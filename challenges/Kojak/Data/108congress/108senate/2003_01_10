Mr. President, there will be a period for morning business \nuntil noon, with the time equally divided, and Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  It is my hope that an agreement can be reached regarding the \ncommittee resolutions on which both sides are working very hard at this \njuncture. Once these committee resolutions are adopted, the committees \nwill then be able to begin their important and very urgent work \naddressing the issues surrounding homeland security, the war, health \ncare, our economy, and the important agenda before the American people, \nan agenda they expect us to address as soon as possible. So I do not \nwant these discussions to progress indefinitely because it is important \nwe begin to address the agenda before us in this 108th Congress.\n  We are making progress, and I am very hopeful over the course of the \nmorning that discussions will continue and I will be able to report \nback on the progress and, ultimately, agreement on these committee \nresolutions. One example is that of the Senate Appropriations Committee \nwhich is poised to meet to complete action on the fiscal year 2003 \nbills which is unfinished business from last year. Before we address \nour agenda for the coming year in the 108th Congress, both sides of the \naisle made a commitment to finish last year's business.\n  The importance of proceeding with these committee resolutions is \nthat, as of today, the new Senators do not have committee assignments. \nAlthough both sides made the assignments, until we officially adopt the \ncommittee resolutions, they are not on any committees in the Senate. It \nis my hope that this agreement can be reached in short order on the \ncommittees and that the resolutions can be agreed to after we agree to \nit at the leadership level and in our caucuses by voice vote. However, \nat this time we are not quite there, and I regret to say that rollcall \nvotes are still possible today.\n\n  Over the course of the morning, as negotiations continue, I will be \nback on the floor to advise the Senate about the day's schedule.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished majority leader \nthat Senator Daschle has indicated that he and the majority leader had \nproductive meetings yesterday and that we are very close to working \nsomething out on the organizational resolution. I received a call last \nnight from Senator Lott, the incoming chairman of the Rules Committee, \nwhen we get the organizational business done, that he is working on the \nspace problem we have. He has indicated he thinks this can be worked \nout shortly also.\n  We hope the leader can come back to the floor later today and \nindicate to Senators that we have worked out something. It would be \ngood for everyone if we can do that.\n\n[[Page S182]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I would like to get the attention of the \ndistinguished majority leader. Pending that, what brings this Senator \nto the floor is the headlines of the morning paper: ``Deficit \nPredictions Soar with Bush Stimulus Plan.''\n  The economists from Standard & Poor's is quoted as saying:\n\n       I don't think it's a near-term concern.\n\n  Then, of course, as the story follows on page 6, the headline is to \nthe effect: ``Economic Plan Could Lead to a Record Deficit.''\n  I wanted the distinguished majority leader to send a message to Karl \nRove. I cannot get the Washington Post to listen. I have been in here \nregularly for a good 10 years saying we are running record deficits. \nNow they have the chief economists saying this could lead to a record \ndeficit.\n  Let the record show on September 30, last year, at the end of fiscal \nyear 2002, the CBO figure was $428 billion, a record deficit. Let's not \ncome here in January and start talking about making records when we \nalready have made a record. Everybody look up on their Internet, \nwww.publicdebt.treas.gov, and you will see the public debt to the penny \nis already up some $155 to $159 or $160 billion. So we are already, in \nthis year, $30 billion to $40 billion in the red ahead of last year.\n  Of course, with the so-called tax cut of revenues, the cut of \nrevenues under the Bush plan, we are bound to have an over $500 billion \ndeficit. That is why I wanted to get the distinguished majority \nleader's attention because history is repeating itself.\n  I remember 10 years ago President Bush I, as a result of Desert \nStorm, the gulf war success, was at all-time popularity. Then they \nlooked economically with these headlines to a record deficit, and they \nhad a $402 to $403 billion deficit. And the Governor of Arkansas beat \nhim. That is exactly where we are headed this morning.\n  I don't know why it is that you cannot get the truth out of these \nfigures. I know what the economists are thinking. You get the money in \nand spend it and hold what they call the on-budget deficit and off-\nbudget and unified and public debt and government debt. That is all \ntommyrot. There is not a Governor in America with deficits asking to \ncut the revenues. Ask Governor Bush in Texas if he would recommend this \nout of the Governor's office in Austin, they would have run him out of \nthe State.\n  Come to Washington and nobody listens. If he can carry a message, I \nthink Karl Rove would listen because he is trying to reelect the \nPresident. ``Economic Plan Could Lead to Record Deficit,'' and he will \nbe electing John Kerry. Maybe I can get their attention telling them \nthat. Here it comes, 2 years ahead of time, the economic plan could \nlead to record deficit.\n  It is almost like working in the CIA here. It is top secret when you \ntalk the truth. I think the axiom of Mark Twain is correct. He said: \nThe truth is such a precious thing it should be used very sparingly. Of \ncourse, that is the media with respect to the truth on the amount of \nmoney we take in, on the amount of money we spend.\n  Let's go exactly back to 1992. At that particular time, Governor \nClinton had just been nominated and invited Alan Greenspan, among \nothers, down to Little Rock. Greenspan told the Presidential nominee: \nLook, you are coming up to Washington. You are not only going to have \nto cut spending, you are going to have to increase taxes. And Governor \nClinton said: Are you serious? He said: That is exactly what the \ncountry needs. That is what you are going to do to get long-term \ninvestment. You are not going to get long-term investment with these \ndeficits upon deficits, the debt going up, the interest costs going up, \nwhich I call interest taxes.\n  When the President says he is cutting taxes, he is actually \nincreasing taxes. They cannot be avoided. They have to be paid. \nInterest costs run at the rate of $1 billion a day. This morning at 8 \no'clock, the first thing the Government did is add another $1 billion \nand add it to the debt. The distinguished Presiding Officer will pick \nup my bill. Senator Thurmond and I have gotten by. We are home free \neconomically. But the next generation coming along will have to pick up \nour bill.\n\n  In any event, President Clinton came to town. We submitted the plan, \nand we cut billions of spending, we raised taxes, and for the next \neight years had the best economy we have ever had. The Senator from \nTennessee, the distinguished majority leader, if I could get his \nattention. I ask my distinguished friend from Tennessee, I know you \nwill see Karl Rove, and I want him to see he is leading his \ndistinguished President into the same trap that Bush and I got led \ninto. When you see these stories, Senator, to the effect that the \neconomic plan could lead to record deficits, and they are quoting the \nchief economists of Standard & Poors, that is exactly where we were in \n1992.\n  President Bushsea dpwm I was the most popular President after that \nDesert Storm you could possibly find. And within a year's time, the \neconomy was at a $400 billion deficit. The young Governor from Arkansas \nbeat him, and this is what we have right now when you see the economic \nworld saying there will not be any investment, when they are saying \nthey will have record deficits.\n\n[[Page S183]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I'd be delighted.\n  Mr. FRIST. The issue of deficit is of concern to our entire body. But \nif you look back at history, what was the size of the economy in 1992?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I don't go with percentages, I go with reality. The \nreality is that the interest costs continue to go up.\n  Mr. FRIST. Is it not true, though, that even at the worst projected \ndeficit in the very article that the Senator read for 2003, as a \npercentage of GDP, about $10.5 trillion, is less than it would be in \n1992?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You like that, is that right?\n  Mr. FRIST. If the Senator would yield for a question, the answer to \nhis question is yes; I would like, as a percentage of GDP, the deficit \nto be as low as possible. That is correct.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Well, if that is the way they want to run the \nGovernment, tell President Bush to go back down----\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. In 1992, we were at war. Had we just gone through a fall \nin the stock market? Had we just got through the corporate scandals? \nHad we just had a 9/11 incident at that time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You don't want to jump on Ken Lay this morning. As the \nnew majority leader, heavens above, I thought we got past Ken Lay. Now \nyou want to jump on the poor fellow. Come on. I don't know, I think \nthey are a little addled over there.\n  What happens is, if the distinguished majority leader can tell me of \nany Governor in America with deficits who is running around talking \nabout the percentage of his GDP--they would run Governor Bush out of \nAustin, TX, if he came out with that nonsense. But he comes up here and \ngets credibility. They have a drive on for dividend tax cuts that could \nnot possibly help anybody until, of course, the election year. That is \na Karl Rove instrumentality and strategy if there ever was. We \nunderstand that. But then--Karl will understand this--you are not going \nto be running on the talk shows with the President of the United States \ntalking about the percentage of the GDP. We have to pay the bills. And \nwhat happens is, after President Bush came to town, we did raise taxes \non Social Security. We raised taxes on gasoline. We raised income \ntaxes. We couldn't get--Mr. President, the Presiding Officer should \nunderstand--we couldn't get a single Republican vote. And Vice \nPresident Gore had to come in here and break the tie in this body.\n\n  So it happened at that time the other Senator from Texas, Senator \nGramm of Texas, said: You folks raise taxes on Social Security, and \nthey will be hunting you Democrats down in the street and shooting you \nlike dogs. That is in the Congressional Record.\n  Now that they have the White House, the House and the Senate, has any \nRepublican asked that the increase in Social Security taxes be \ncanceled? Oh, no. They are not interested in saving Social Security. \nThey give you the words, but like John Mitchell says: Watch what we do, \nnot what we say. They will say Social Security, but they will not come \nback and reduce the Social Security tax. They just couldn't think of it \n10 years ago, and they have not been able to think otherwise for the \npast 10 years.\n  We had the best 8 years of economic expansion, investment, and \neverything else, with the raising of taxes during the 1990s. And we are \nback into the same situation where we have already got a record deficit \nas of the end of the last fiscal year. The fiscal year 2002 ended on \nSeptember 30 of last year with a $428 billion deficit. We are running \n$159 billion in the red already this year. You are already at $587 \nbillion. That is approaching $600 billion in stimulus. That is \nstimulating the economy, money that you do not have, money that you \nhave to go out and borrow--for which you are not going to pay back. We \nhave had the most stimulative economic program that you could think of \nfor 15 months, and it hasn't worked. The economy is worse.\n  Why? On account of voodoo II. President Reagan started this nonsense \nof what you do is cut revenues, cut taxes, and therefore increase your \nrevenues. We went from less than a $1 trillion debt before Reagan. We \nhad 200 years of history, all the wars, and we had not reached $1 \ntrillion in debt. Then we started this charade, which is all for the \ncampaign and not for the country, because everybody can get reelected \non cutting taxes.\n  President Reagan said: Cut the taxes, cut the revenues, and we will \ngrow out of it. As a result, we had the economic downturn in 1987, and \nwe have had the economic downturn in 2001 with the tax cuts.\n  Vice President Bush under Reagan called it voodoo. Now, young \nPresident Bush is giving us voodoo II, and young President Bush \nrecommends voodoo III.\n  Record deficits? Let me describe it so you can add it up and then \nsubtract it. If you take all the deficits from 1945 up until 1976, 30 \nyears, take the deficits of President Truman, President Eisenhower, \nPresident Kennedy, President Johnson, President Nixon, President Ford--\ntake 30 years of all the deficits, the deficits of World War II, the \nKorean war, the war in Vietnam--take all of those deficits, add them \nup, and you will come to $358 billion over the 30-year period. And in 1 \nyear we have got $428 billion under this administration, and they still \nplay the game.\n  The Washington Post will not print the truth. They absolutely refuse \nto do it. All the other papers and everything else--I have gotten a few \narticles from time to time, but very few--just scattered, little squibs \nor anything else of that kind. What you end up doing, you have already \ngot a record deficit. You are going to have record interest costs. We \nare going to war and immediately the cost of fuel is going up, the \ninterest costs are going up, and we, instead of paying $1 billion a \nday, $360 billion or $365 billion a year in interest costs, we are \ngoing over $400 billion a year in debt. That $400 billion is just \nabsolute waste, for nothing. We have to spend it each year. We come in \nhere, but we are playing the political game. That is why this Senator \nis on the floor. I have been in the game 50 years. I never thought the \nGovernment would be turned into a campaign office.\n\n  No one is concerned around here about the needs of the country. It is \nthe needs of the campaign and the media. Jefferson spoke it best when \nhe said: As between a free government and a free press, give me the \nlatter. He knew as long as the free press would tell the truth to the \nAmerican people, the people, through their representatives, would \nreflect the needs of the country. But that is not what the media does. \nIt is a spectator sport. It is who is running and who is not running, \nwho is elected and who is not elected, who may be elected and not be \nelected. They are not paying attention to needs. They are just like \npollsters--what the polls show. No, I don't have any cosponsors for \nVAT, a value-added tax. But we ought to institute this, before the war.\n  It is not the Volunteer Army going to war in Iraq, it is the United \nStates of America, the country, going to war. That is why I put in the \ndraft with Representative Charlie Rangel over on the House side. We \nneed a sense of sacrifice and commitment and togetherness in this \ncountry. But all we have is partisan politics for the next campaign, \nand the media generates it. All the talk shows, ``Firing Line,'' \n``Crossfire,'' ``Talk Back''--whatever they call those particular \nprograms--they all offset each other, and they are supposed to make \nnews. You can't get this printed. You cannot get the truth of how much \ncame in and how much went out in any fiscal year.\n  The truth is, by section 21 of the Greenspan Commission report in \n1983, they said: Set aside a surplus in trust for the baby boomers in \nthe next century. And we are now in the next century. There is no \nproblem with Social Security if we adhere to it. It took me some 7 \nyears to get it done.\n  George Herbert Walker Bush, on November 5, 1990, signed into law \nsection 13301 of the Budget Act. It says: Thou shalt not spend Social \nSecurity on anything other than Social Security.\n  Today we are spending Social Security trust funds on anything and \neverything but Social Security. That is what is happening. We would \nhave $1.3 trillion banked up, ready to go. There would be no privatized \nSocial Security and all the problems we are going to solve in Social \nSecurity. They solve the political problem here in this body. It is \npolitics. They all voted for it.\n\n[[Page S184]]\n\nPresident Bush I signed it into law. But they don't adhere to it.\n  So I have another little amendment. In addition to paying for the \nwar, I have one where the Secretary of Treasury has to certify that, in \norder for the tax cut to take effect, the government does not spend \nSocial Security. I want to see how they vote on that. Any and all tax \ncuts, whether they have capital gains, dividends, marriage penalty, \nincome--whatever they want to think of--let them pass it, but let it \nnot take effect unless they can certify that it does not cost Social \nSecurity. Let's see how they vote on that.\n  (Mr. CHAFEE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. They cannot run around here--everyone, to a man, every \nRepublican, every Democrat, says: I want to save Social Security. But \nthen they come around and continually spend it, and the American people \nwonder why.\n  So the truth is, the economic plan ``could lead'' to a record \ndeficit?\n  The economic plan has led to a record deficit. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer should have been here. Of course, he couldn't because \nhis distinguished father had the seat. But it was back in the 1980s. I \nrecommended a value-added tax at that time. We had a hearing. I will \nhave to get the gentleman's name from Holland--Dr. Cnossen. He was the \nDutch expert who had written the value-added tax for Japan and Canada \nand helped update it with the United Kingdom. He testified. We needed \nthe money. As we were going out of the Finance Committee room, John \nChafee turned to Lloyd Bentsen, the chairman. This was the Finance \nCommittee. He said, Lloyd, if we had a secret ballot, we would pass \nthat out unanimously. That was almost 15 years ago.\n  We had been running those deficits until we got into the 1990s, and \nwe increased the taxes. We increased taxes on income. We increased \ntaxes on gasoline. We increased taxes on Social Security and all of \nthat. We had over a $400 billion deficit in 1992 when President Bush \nOne left office. We brought it down in the early part of President Bush \nTwo. We got it into the black. But then we passed the tax cuts. Voodoo \nTwo. President Bush One was Vice President. He called it voodoo. He was \nright.\n  This idea of cutting revenues and increasing revenues at the same \ntime is bologna. Everybody knows it. We know from hard experience. \nUnder President Reagan, under President Bush Two now, the Voodoo Two. \nNow we have before us the economic plan Voodoo Three. When will we ever \nlearn? That was when I came to town. That was the song they were \nsinging during Vietnam. ``When will we ever learn?''\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak in morning business for up to half an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate your concern and \nyour helpfulness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S184-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S184-S187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE PRESIDENT'S GROWTH PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina has just \nconcluded a rather lengthy and significant speech on the President's \ngrowth package. I thought it appropriate that there be some kind of \nresponse. If I may, I would like to start with something that some of \nmy staff might consider professorial, a little lecture, if you will, on \nthe nature of economics to sort of set the background for what I want \nto say about the President's growth package.\n  There are laws in economics that apply regardless of how we like them \nor do not like them. If I may create a somewhat crude analogy but one I \nhope makes the point, there is a law in science known as the law of \ngravity. The law of gravity says two bodies will attract each other \nwhen falling in free space, so that an individual who walks to the edge \nof a cliff and looks down and jumps into space will be attracted to the \nmass of the Earth below him and end up down at the bottom of the \nvalley. We call this falling off a cliff.\n  Some people will go to the edge of a cliff and, in desperation, jump \noff the cliff to commit suicide. Others will be playing at the edge of \na cliff, examining the beautiful view, and, by accident, stumble and \nfall off the cliff. And there are those who say: Well, it isn't fair. \nIt isn't fair. The first person jumped off the cliff deliberately and, \ntherefore, to a certain extent, deserved his fate of death, but the \nsecond person had no desire to kill himself, and he just stumbled, and, \nby virtue of where he was, the law of gravity killed him, too. And it \nisn't fair.\n  Well, we can rail all we want about fairness, but the law of gravity \noperates regardless.\n  I make that point because a similar situation exists with respect to \neconomics. There are laws in economics that many in this Chamber will \nstand here and say: It isn't fair. But they operate nonetheless. They \noperate just as inexorably as the law of gravity operates. And they \nhave an impact on our lives and the way things work.\n  The most significant of these laws, of course, is the law of supply \nand demand. The law of supply and demand operates in capitalistic \ncountries; it operates in communistic countries; it operates in \ndictatorships; it operates in tyrannies; it operates in free societies \neverywhere. The law of supply and demand is as inexorable as the law of \ngravity.\n  There are some people who stand up and say it isn't fair for Michael \nJordan to play basketball for a living and be paid $20 or $30 million a \nyear, when someone else plays just as much basketball on a playground, \nworks just as hard as Michael Jordan, expends just as much sweat, and \ndoesn't get paid anything.\n  Well, there is no demand for the services of the second player. No \none wants to pay to see him perform. But there is great demand on the \npart of sports-loving Americans to see Michael Jordan perform. \nTherefore, since there is great demand for his services, and there is \nonly a supply of one Michael Jordan, he can command virtually whatever \nsalary he wants in that situation.\n  There are those who say: It isn't fair for Tiger Woods to be paid \nmillions and millions of dollars just because he plays golf. There are \nplenty of Americans who would love to play golf all weekend, the way \nTiger Woods plays golf all weekend, and be paid millions and millions \nof dollars for their efforts--it isn't fair--but for those who would \nlike to be Tiger Woods, no one wants to watch them play golf, there is \nno demand for observing their abilities on the golf links, and the \nnumber of people who want to watch Tiger Woods either in person or on \ntelevision is very high, a very high demand, a supply of only one, \nTiger Woods. As a consequence, he can charge, once again, virtually \nanything he wants for his services.\n\n  The law of supply and demand cannot be repealed by the Senate. The \nlaw of supply and demand cannot be repealed by the House of \nRepresentatives. It operates, it dominates what happens in the economy.\n  Now we come to the question of what do we do to make the economy as \nstrong as possible. One of the first rules we should follow is to \nrespect the law of supply and demand and we do not attempt to repeal it \nthrough government activity in the name of fairness.\n  Let's talk about taxes for a moment. Most Americans don't realize \nthat we have two Federal tax systems. We have additional tax systems at \nthe State and local level in sales taxes, property taxes, and other \nkinds of taxes, but at the Federal level we have two tax systems. They \nare completely independent of each other. Even though for accounting \npurposes, the Federal Government mixes the money together and makes it \nappear as if there is only one source of income, there are two.\n  The first is the payroll taxes. The payroll taxes have been \ninstituted by the Congress for the purpose of funding the Nation's \nprimary entitlement programs, which are Social Security and Medicare. \nEveryone who works pays into the Social Security trust fund. Everyone \nwho works pays into the Medicare trust fund. There is no refund.\n\n[[Page S185]]\n\nThere is no forgiveness. If you work, you pay into those trust funds. \nThen at the end, when you retire, you get the benefits that come out of \nthose trust funds.\n  That is an entirely self-contained, single tax system of payments in \nand benefits out. We can argue about the fairness of that one because \nmany people pay in all their working lives, die before they reach 65, \nand get nothing back. Other people who are long lived pay in all their \nworking lives and then get 10 times back what they pay in. If you live \nuntil your eighties or your nineties and you have been paying in Social \nSecurity since you started work at 14, it is a great deal for you; you \nget an enormous amount back. But if you pay in and die at 62, every \npenny you put in is lost. That is the system. We can talk about dealing \nwith it at some point, and perhaps we should, but that is one entirely \nself-contained tax system.\n  The other tax system the Federal Government uses is income tax. \nIncome tax is graduated. The more you earn, the more you pay. The fact \nis that if you separate these two systems as they are separated by law \nand practice, you discover that roughly 50 percent of working Americans \npay nothing into the second system. They make no contribution \nwhatsoever to covering the cost of government. The top 50 percent of \nAmerican wage earners pay all of the income taxes. Indeed, the top 1 \npercent pay something like a quarter of all of the income taxes. It is \nheavily loaded to the top end. There are some who say that isn't fair, \nsome who say every citizen ought to pay something for the management of \ngovernment: Every working citizen pays something for the entitlements, \nbut every working American ought to pay something for the cost of the \nDefense Department and the Commerce Department and the new Homeland \nSecurity Department and all of the rest of it.\n  We have made the decision in the Congress that that is not the case. \nWe have made the decision that only the top half of Americans will pay \nfor the cost of general government. We have loaded it in such a way \nthat the very richest Americans pay the very most. Indeed, a very high \npercentage of the total tax load is at the top 1 percent. When you go \nto the top 5 percent, you are beginning to get close to half of the \nwhole of Federal revenues. Over half of all Federal revenue comes from \nthe top 10 percent of earnings.\n  Economics is about incentives. Tiger Woods has an incentive to \nperfect his golf game better than anybody else's so he can get to that \npoint I have described where he is in short supply and there is great \ndemand. Michael Jordan has an incentive, an economic incentive, to \nperfect his basketball game so he is better than anybody else so that \nthe law of supply and demand will work on his behalf. If we want to \ngrow the entire economy and, therefore, the amount of money that comes \nfrom those top 50 percent of the taxpayers, indeed from the top 10 \npercent where the majority of the money comes from, we want to create \nincentives for those people to perfect their skills and improve their \nability to create wealth.\n  Understand, all wealth is created from two things: One, risk taking. \nThere is no wealth created unless somebody takes a risk somewhere; and \nNo. 2, accumulated capital. Even the Communists learned that. They \ntried to say, no, wealth is created by labor, but as they built their \nown economy, they recognized that somewhere, someplace there had to be \nan accumulation of capital.\n  The creation of a backhoe that can dig better ditches than people can \ndig with sticks represents capital that is accumulated for the cost of \npurchasing that backhoe. Somebody put that much capital together to \ncreate that backhoe. We have in the United States the largest capital \ninvestment of any nation in the world, and we have the strongest \neconomy in the world. We reward risk taking better than any other \ncountry in the world, and that creates more wealth in the world.\n  This is not an accident. This is the way it happens. When you have \nthe right incentive to the right people, they will respond to that \nincentive and, under the law of supply and demand, they will then \ncreate skills that create wealth that benefits everybody.\n  As I have said, the top 50 percent pay all of the income taxes in \nthis country. The bottom 50 percent benefit enormously from that fact.\n  I remember in the Banking Committee, a question was asked of Chairman \nGreenspan of the Federal Reserve system during the nineties, when the \neconomy was booming: Mr. Chairman, said the questioner, what portion of \nAmerican society has benefited the most from this economy?\n  Now, from the way the questioner asked the question, it was clear \nwhat answer he expected and certainly the answer he wanted. He wanted \nChairman Greenspan to say the top 20 percent have benefited more than \nanybody else because, look at all the money they have gotten.\n  Chairman Greenspan surprised the questioner and pleased me with his \ninsight when he said: Without question, the group that has benefited \nthe most from this booming economy is the bottom 20 percent. Oh, said \nthe questioner, look at the amount of money that has gone to the bottom \n20 percent compared to the huge amount of money that has gone to the \ntop 20 percent. How can you say the bottom 20 percent benefited the \nmost? Because the lifestyles of the top 20 percent have not changed all \nthat much, he said. If Bill Gates is worth $80 billion, as opposed to \n$60 billion, there is no big difference in his lifestyle. But if \nsomeone at the bottom 20 percent, who barely has employable skills and \ncannot find a job in a tough economy, can suddenly find a job at $2, $3 \nand $4 above minimum wage because jobs are scarce--why are they scarce? \nSupply and demand. The economy is booming. There is a great demand for \nlabor and the supply is small and so the price goes up. He says, in \nterms of the impact on the lives of people, this booming economy has \nclearly benefited the bottom 20 percent far more than the other 80 \npercent.\n  I think that is the way we have to look at it, Mr. President. I think \nwe have to say, what is the best thing we can do for the citizens who \nare at the bottom 20 percent. The first answer is that we can get them \na job. But if you go back to the Great Depression of the 1930s, 30 \npercent of Americans were without jobs. In those days, that only \nincluded men; women were not in the workforce. If you were to add \nunemployed women to the statistics, as we would today, because women \nare now in the workforce, the 1930s would have been absolutely \ndevastating for the number of people who could not find jobs. As the \neconomy got bigger, as wealth was created through accumulated capital \nand risk taking, people at the bottom began to find jobs.\n  The statistics are out this morning that unemployment is at 6 \npercent. This is unchanged from the last number. Some people find that \nencouraging. I find it a little discouraging. I had hoped that the \nunemployment rate would start to go down, even though I was taught in \nschool that 6 percent unemployment is full employment. This shows how \nthe economists have changed their attitudes. There was a time when \neconomists said structural unemployment built into the system is 6 \npercent, and if you ever get below 6 percent unemployment, the economy \nwill overheat and self-destruct through inflation. We know now that \nisn't true.\n  We got the unemployment rate down below 4 percent in the late 1990s, \nas the economy was expanding and growing. Now the economy is still \nexpanding and growing but nowhere near the rate it was. For the year \n2002, the growth in the economy will probably come in around 2.9 \npercent. That is the current forecast. In historic terms, 2.9 percent \nis a good growth year. In historic terms, there are many years when we \nwould be thrilled with a 2.9 percent growth. But compared to where we \nwere, 2.9 looks anemic. Indeed, compared to where we can be, 2.9 is \nanemic. I clearly want to see the economy growing at 3, 3.5. I get a \nlittle nervous when it starts growing at 4. Then you are getting into \nthe area where you are in danger of tipping over to inflation.\n\n  What does all this have to do with the President's growth package? \nThis is a nice lecture on economics. I hope nobody disagrees with it \nbecause I think it is sound. But what does it have to do with the \nPresident's growth package? Simply this: The President's growth package \nrecognizes the fundamental truths embedded in what I have had to say; \nthat is, all growth comes from capital accumulation and from risk-\ntaking, and the President's growth\n\n[[Page S186]]\n\npackage is saying to those who have accumulated capital that we will \ngive you an incentive to take some risks.\n  There are two incentives built into the President's program: No. 1, \nlower taxes. If you take your money and risk it and get a return on it, \nyou will get to keep more of it than you can now. That is an incentive \nfor you to take your accumulated capital and risk it more than you are \nnow.\n  No. 2--almost as important--is certainty. Markets flee uncertainty. \nMarkets get very nervous when we cannot have a sense of what the future \nwill be. The President is saying: Here is a tax cut. We want to move it \nforward a year and, ultimately, we want to make it permanent so that as \nyou make your plans for how you are going to take risks with your \naccumulated capital, you can have some certainty that you will be able \nto keep a little more of it. And if they do that and the economy grows \nat a rate faster than 2.9 percent per year, who will benefit the most? \nIt will be the people at the bottom. It will be the people who cannot \nget jobs now who will find that jobs will become plentiful again. It \nwill be the people who are hurting now who will benefit the most from \nthe changes in the economy that will come about as a result of the \nactions of the President's growth package. There are those who will \nsay: But this isn't fair. It is not fair for you to have an incentive \nfor the Michael Jordans of the world. Your incentives, or your money, \nshould be given to the unemployed. Well, we have extended unemployment \ninsurance. We did that the first day of the Congress, and we should \ncontinue to pay attention to that. But the structural needs of the \neconomy are such that the best welfare program we can give the \nunemployed is to get them a job.\n  The best way to create jobs is to see to it that the economy grows at \nmore than 2.9 percent per year. So for that reason, I think the \nPresident's program is a sound one. There are those who say we cannot \nafford it in terms of the Federal deficit--look, this is going to cost \nus $600 billion over the next 10 years. How in the world can we afford \nthat?\n  Let's go back to the growth numbers. In the next 10 years, if we grow \nat 2.9 percent every year for the next 10 years, that is an increase of \nover 30 percent. So 2.9 compounded over 10 years comes to well over 30 \npercent. Let's say it is 3 percent and not compound it and say it is \nexactly 30 percent. The economy is currently operating at the level of \n$10 trillion per year. If we can keep the growth rate at 3 percent per \nyear for 10 years, that is a 30-percent increase. Again, we are not \ncompounding this; we are keeping the numbers simple.\n  Ten years at $10 trillion is $100 trillion. If the growth rate is \nindeed another 30 percent, that is another $30 trillion. If what we do \nin terms of incentives in the tax program can raise the growth rate \nfrom 2.9 to just 3.1 or 3.2, multiply that over 10 years and you have \n$150 trillion. Does $600 billion amount to anything when you are \ntalking about $150 trillion?\n  The numbers are staggering, but they are very important. If we can \nraise the growth rate from 2.9 percent to 3.1 percent or 3.2 percent or \n3.3 percent with the President's growth program over the 10-year \nperiod, we will solve the social problems of those at the bottom. We \nwill get enough revenue for the Federal Government because the Federal \nGovernment revenue does not come from the budget. The Federal \nGovernment revenue comes from the growth of the economy. We can grow \nour way out of this problem if we are only smart enough not to fight \nthe basic laws of economics. If we spend our time saying it is not \nfair, we are like the people who will not build a fence on the edge of \nthe cliff because we say it is not fair for the law of gravity to kill \nthe fellow who stumbled across. Or do we say the law of gravity is \ngoing to operate whether we like it or not, and let's go to the expense \nof building the fence on the edge of the cliff; we will get the benefit \nof saving the lives of those who stumble across.\n  I suggest that if we have the right kind of incentives for those who \naccumulate capital and take risks so that the economy grows, it will be \nworth whatever it costs, just like building the fence is worth it, even \nthough it is an expense, because of the saving of lives at the other \nend.\n  People speak of economics as a science, and it is because it has \nbasic laws on which it is based, but it is also something of an art. \nCertainly economic forecasting is an art. I have been in this Chamber \nlong enough to see the forecasts all over the place, and no forecast \nthat has ever been made by the Office of Management and Budget, be it \nDemocratic or Republican, or by the Congressional Budget Office, be it \nDemocratic or Republican, has ever proved to be accurate. There are too \nmany variables in the system. It is not that their forecasting tools \nare wrong, it is that the economy is so fluid and changes all the time \nand people react differently to incentives than others predict that the \nforecasts almost always turn out to be either too high or too low.\n  For many years, OMB and CBO predicted surpluses, and we got deficits. \nThen for some years, they predicted deficits, and we got surpluses. The \neconomy surprised us.\n  The plea I have made the whole time I have been in the Senate is, \nyes, we need to pay attention to the forecasts, we need to pay \nattention to the economists and their projections, but we need to be a \nwhole lot more humble in our assumption that these are scripture carved \nin stone. We should focus more on the fundamentals of economics than on \nthe details of today's projections and today's numbers.\n  Looking at the world as a whole, this is what we see: The United \nStates has less structural taxation built into its system than any \nother country in the world. The United States has the greatest rewards \nfor risk taking of any country in the world. The United States respects \naccumulated capital more than any other country in the world. And guess \nwhat. The United States has the strongest economy with the strongest \ngrowth rate and the highest standard of living of any other country in \nthe world.\n  If we were to listen to our European friends who tell us what we need \nto be doing, we should ask the fundamental question: Do we want the \nU.S. economy to be like the European economy, which is not creating any \nnew jobs, which has a higher rate of taxation than we have and which is \nvirtually stagnant in terms of their GDP growth?\n  The Europeans are trying to create the world's second largest \neconomy, maybe the world's largest economy through the Euro zone and \nthe establishment of the European Community, but they are not getting \nthere. I submit one of the reasons they are not getting there is \nbecause they do not reward productivity; they do not reward creativity; \nthey do not reward risk taking. In the name of fairness, they are \nstifling the very activity that would create the wealth that would \nallow them to solve their problems.\n\n  I have owned businesses in Japan. Japan is statistically the second \nlargest national economy in the world. Japan has been virtually in \ndepression for 10 years. Why? Because Japan, once again, is not willing \nto take the kinds of steps I think President Bush's economic plan \nrepresents because they say it is not fair. As a result, the pain is \nspread over all of the Japanese, and they pay a serious price for their \ninability to recognize that economics is about incentives and the \npurpose of government is to get out of the way of those who create \nwealth to the best degree.\n  Yes, those who create wealth should pay for the government, and in \nthis country they do. As I have said, once again, it is the top earners \nwho pay for the Government. The bottom 50 percent pay nothing for \ngovernmental services. They have taxes deducted, once again, but those \ntaxes are in the entitlement system. They do not participate in any way \nin the payment of Government services out of the general fund.\n  One last comment, Mr. President, and I will yield the floor. There \nhas been a lot of discussion here about the unfairness of the \nPresident's proposal to reduce taxation on dividends. We can debate the \nfairness argument, and fairness is in the eye of the beholder. There \nare some who say, as they do out of the administration, it is unfair to \ntax income twice. There are those in this Chamber who say: Hey, we tax \nincome twice all the time in America. People earn something and they \nare taxed; they earn something and they are taxed again; they earn \nsomething\n\n[[Page S187]]\n\nand they are taxed again. I will leave the fairness argument aside \nbecause, as I say, fairness is in the eye of the beholder, and I will \nnot make the case that it is unfair to tax corporate income twice, even \nthough I think there is some validity to the case. I want to address \nanother fundamental question.\n  In this Chamber last Congress, we passed what is now known as the \nSarbanes-Oxley bill. It was a reaction to the Enron scandal and to the \ncorporate governance excesses we saw throughout all of corporate \nAmerica. Out of that came a phrase that stockholders had heard but that \ngeneral Americans had not heard before that scandal. It was the phrase \nreferring to ``managed earnings.''\n  I remember when I was running a public company. They talked about, \n``We can manage our earnings,'' the accountants were saying, ``to \nproduce this kind of quarterly result, and Wall Street is looking for \nthis kind of number and we should manage our earnings to give them that \nnumber.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue \nfor another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I remember painfully when our public \ncompany fell 1 penny per share short of the projection that Wall Street \nwas looking for. The stock dropped something like 20 percent that day \nbecause we fell 1 penny short. When some people in the company said it \nis not fair for us to be penalized that way, the reaction of the Wall \nStreet analysts was very interesting.\n  They said: You have the ability to manage your earnings, and if you \nwere not able to find that extra penny and change your number to \nreflect it, that means you are in a whole lot more trouble than we \nthought you were. The penny is not important. What is important is what \nyour inability to come up with that penny says about your ability to \nmanage your earnings.\n  The stock, frankly, has never recovered. When I came to the Senate, \nit was in the low twenties. At one point in my Senate career it hit 40. \nToday you can buy every share of that stock you want for $1.25. \nFortunately, I sold all of mine before it got there, but not at a high \nenough number to leave me with anything like the net worth I had when I \ncame to the Senate. So I have had a very painful personal experience \nwith that situation.\n  Back to the question of dividends. I know as a CEO you can manage \nearnings but you cannot manage cash. Earnings are an idea, a concept, a \nhope, or a prayer. Cash is a fact. We created with the Clinton tax cut \nan incentive for companies to manage their earnings because we put into \nthe law there could be no corporation deduction as an expense for CEO \npay over $1 million a year. In other words, if a company was going to \npay their CEO $2 million a year, they could only deduct as an expense \nthe first $1 million. So there was a disincentive to compensate the CEO \nwith cash. We did it because people on the floor said it was not fair \nfor a CEO to be paid that much money just like, as I say, some people \nsay it is not fair for Michael Jordan to earn so much more money than \nany other basketball player.\n  We created an incentive for compensation to be tied to stock options. \nBoy, did the Enron executives get that message. They and a number of \nothers under that incentive managed the earnings to drive up the stock \nprice so they could cash in. And those who understood that this was \nphony accounting did cash in. They sold their shares at the highest \npoint.\n  That did not use to happen in American industry. It used to be that \nthe measure of a company's value was how high a dividend it paid. But \ndividends are paid in cash. You can manage earnings but you cannot \nmanage cash. You have to manage the business in order to get cash.\n  If we were to say, OK, we will make it attractive for people to \ninvest in companies that accumulate cash and pay that cash out to their \nowners, it will be taxed but it will only be taxed once and the owners \ncan look for a cash return, I think that would have a greater impact on \ncorporate governance and decisions in the boardrooms of America's \nmanufacturing corporations than all of the Sarbanes-Oxley bills we can \nconceive of and pass. If we want to change the corporate culture in \nAmerica back toward more fundamental sound manufacturing and goods-\nproducing companies, what structural change could we make that would \nhave a more beneficial effect than saying if you concentrate on \naccumulating cash which comes from real operations rather than managed \nearnings, and there is an incentive for you to pay out that cash to \nyour shareholders so there will be an incentive for shareholders to \nreward those managers who manage their business on sound principles \nrather than managed earnings, we would have a cultural change that \nwould be tremendous.\n  Back to my beginning point. Ultimately, the solution to all of our \neconomic problems is to have the economy grow, to have it grow on a \nsound basis, to have it grow on a consistent basis, to have it grow \nyear over year over year. If we can get the growth rate back up from \nlast year's 2.9 percent to 3.1 or 3.2 and maintain that for the next 10 \nyears, at the end of the 10-year period with the 3-percent growth rate \nsustained and compounded, we will have all the money we need in the \nFederal Treasury to cover all projections of deficits. We will have an \nunemployment rate well below today's 6 percent, even though 6 percent \nis historically considered full employment. We will have all of the \nthings we need. If in the name of ``fairness'' we ignore economic laws, \nwe ignore the impact of the law of supply and demand, and we do things \nnow that look good for political rhetoric and hamper the long-term \ngrowth of the economy, we will find ourselves 10 years from now with \nbigger deficits and slower growth and higher unemployment and more \nsocial problems.\n  Ultimately, we must keep our eye on the goal that we have: grow the \neconomy. Grow the economy intelligently on the basis of sound \nprinciples, build incentives into the system that will reward those \nthat will contribute to growing the economy. And as we do that, we will \nthen be in a position to solve all of our economic problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I understand we are in a period of \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I request I be permitted to speak up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That authority has already been granted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S187-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S187-S192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, I could very much agree with many of the broad principles I hear. \nHow we rearrange them to get to those longrun growth numbers that do \ncompound and make our economy stronger is an area where men have a \ndifference of opinion. That is one of the things I will discuss. We are \nseriously at a point in the path of economic history, at least of our \nNation, where those choices lead to long-term structural problems, ones \nwe have visited at other points in time, ones that with regard to \nalternatives could actually stimulate the economy, get us into an \ninvestment cycle that could drive that same kind of growth rate that \nthe Senator speaks so eloquently about and which I could agree. If we \ncould get that economy growing from 2.9 percent to 3.5 or 3.4, we could \ncreate the kinds of incentives for people to invest and go forward.\n  The real issue is how do we get on to that path of growth? There are \nserious differences of opinion. That is a debate we need to have on the \nfloor of the Senate in front of the American people.\n  I will take a few moments to actually talk through at least my \nperspective on some of the issues that arise from the President's \nproposal. I have certainly heard a lot of commentary on it. We have \nheard from some that it is bold. We have heard from some that it is \nrisky. We have heard from some that it is reckless.\n  From my point of view, it is more towards the imprudent, at best, and \nin some ways I find it is reckless with regard to long-term fiscal \nhealth and stability.\n  I consider myself a fiscal conservative, on balance, over a period of \ntime. I think we need to live within our means. I don't think that is \ngoing to be accomplished here.\n\n[[Page S188]]\n\n  I am pleased the President recognizes our economy has major problems. \nIt is a reality. Unfortunately, it is past the time when we should have \naddressed some of these issues, but it is an important admission. This \nand changing the economic team has been an important statement. We \nneeded a new look at where we were.\n  Since March of 2001 when the recession was declared by a blue-ribbon \npanel of economists led by Mr. Feldstein, a prominent conservative \neconomist, we have lost 2.1 million American jobs in the private \nsector. Actually, with this morning's announcement on unemployment, \nthat would be about 2.2 million jobs. The unemployment rate, again, as \nmany have heard, stands at 6 percent. The most important element of the \nannouncement today is that over the last 2 months we have lost 188,000 \njobs.\n  By the way, the President is predicting that the program that we put \nin place will only produce that amount of jobs over the next 12 to 18 \nmonths.\n  Mortgage foreclosures are at a high. I think everyone knows all too \nwell the kind of lost value we have had in the stock market over the \nlast 2 years, even more substantial over the last 3. Consumer \nconfidence is bumping along at historic lows. Demand has declined to an \nextent that businesses are operating at 75 percent of their capacity. \nThe average for the country over the last 25 years is about 81 percent.\n  We are running Federal budget deficit rates of about $200 billion \nthis year. Just yesterday there was a new study of the State \ngovernments. They are running budget deficits cumulatively of about $90 \nbillion. Many of our local communities are suffering from the same kind \nof pressures in their local budgets. We are seeing increases in \nproperty taxes.\n  I think, in short, we have a serious economic situation in this \ncountry. It is one that does deserve attention and I am glad we are \nhaving the debate with regard to it. Frankly, the people of New Jersey \nhave known this for some time. I live in a State where Lucent \nTechnology has shrunk its workforce from 180,000 employees--not all of \nthem in New Jersey but on a worldwide basis--to roughly 30,000. We have \nclosed essentially one of the great intellectual research institutions \nthat created some of the innovation that has driven the American \neconomy--Bell Labs. We are seeing an impending shutdown of the two \nremaining auto manufacturing plants, certainly cut shifts to one, and \nthey are talking about closing one of those plants in New Jersey. In \nthe northern part of the State we are seeing significant if not massive \nlayoffs in the financial services industry, among others.\n  We are having about a $4 billion budget deficit in the State of New \nJersey in fiscal 2003 and projections for about $6 billion in fiscal \n2004.\n  Our Governors and mayors know we have a problem. I am glad we are now \ncoming to that recognition here in Washington.\n  California is looking at a budget deficit, I saw in the paper this \nmorning, of about $35 billion over the next 15 months to 18 months. The \nTexas deficit is $12 billion, New York's is $10 billion, New Jersey, as \nI said, is someplace between $5.5 billion and $6 billion. We have to \nunderstand we have to deal with growth in this economy and it has to \nhappen now or we are going to have incredible stress and strain and I \nthink actions that will end up undermining our longrun economic \nsecurity here at home.\n  We need a serious and focused action to get our economy moving. On \nthat front I think there are several parts of the President's program \nthat deserve support. For example, I totally would back accelerating an \nexpanded child credit, the adjustments in the marriage penalty, tax \nrelief for the middle class in the 10 percent bracket, the small \nbusiness, the AMT provisions. These are all sound and reasonable \nprovisions.\n  Unfortunately, though, they are a relatively small part of the \noverall package. I think we need to make sure we are providing help to \nthose who need it most. These do. I think they will help get our \neconomy on track. Unfortunately, so few of these will be hit today, in \n2003 and 2004, to really give that drive, that thrust to the economy \nthat I think will make a difference in a way that deals with some of \nthose problems I talked about.\n  We have 1 million people with 95,000 a week already on long-term \nextended unemployment. These are people who dropped off the rolls that \nwill allow for benefiting from the unemployment compensation program we \nput in place this week.\n  I think it is important that we get moving. There are some elements \nin the President's plan that I think are supportable, but they are \nrelatively a small piece--about 30 percent--of the overall program. I \nthink in many ways--and I will try to go through this and will make \nsome comments on specific elements of it--you could argue there are \nelements of this program that are antigrowth.\n  I would particularly like to talk about some of this cash issue I \nheard the Senator from Utah talk about. He and I agree that cash is \nking. It is one of those things that actually drives the valuations of \ncorporations and their ability to do things. I just come out with a \ndifferent perspective on how we are addressing that in this particular \nprogram.\n  We really do, though, need to stimulate our economy now to provide \njobs, absorb excess capacity, get into that investment cycle that I \nthink will drive our economy to creating jobs. Let's remember, most \neconomists and business people believed--and by the way, so did all of \nour budgeteers around here--that there were some simple principles we \nneed to follow with regard to stimulus programs. They articulated those \nlast year when we were going through these programs.\n  We need short-term stimulus. That should be immediate and temporary. \nWe need long-term fiscal discipline, long-term fiscal health and, in my \nview, the plan we saw put on the table on Tuesday just the reverse. \nLess than 10 percent of its 10-year cost will go into the economy this \nyear, a very small percentage.\n  By the way, if we talk for a while longer here on the floor of the \nSenate, there will be even less going to the economy this year, before \nthe program is implemented.\n  There is very little argument with the view that it will undermine \nour long-term fiscal discipline leading to what I believe will be \nhigher long-term interest rates down the road. People argue about \nwhether deficits create interest rates. They only do that when we are \noperating at full capacity. When there is not full capacity, there is \nno crowding out issue. What we need to worry about is what are interest \nrates going to do when there is real competition for money in a fully \noperating economy. I think those shortfalls that are going to be built \nin structurally when we come out of this are going to lead to \ndisastrous deficits when we come out of this down the road.\n  When the baby boomers retire--we have 35 million seniors now--we will \nhave 70 million in 20 years. That will put incredible pressures on our \nmedical system, Social Security system, all elements of our society. I \ndo not think anyone has planned, particularly in the context of these \ntax cuts, how we are going to get through that.\n  The bottom line, in my view, is this is a plan that will not work. It \nis antijobs and antigrowth, from my perspective, on balance, and in \nmany ways it is imprudent.\n  First, this plan--and this gets at one of the things on which I think \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah and I agree, in principle--the plan \nto encourage corporations to shift cash from corporate investments and \nemployment into dividends will reduce overall business investment and \neither cost jobs that could be created, or even the maintenance of \nthem. Certainly in the short run that is going to be the case, and \npotentially over the long run.\n  Few people seem to get focused on the fact which I think should be \nobvious: You can't spend the same dollar twice. So for each dollar \ncontributed as a dividend, companies will have one less dollar to \ninvest in plant and equipment; one less dollar to plow into research \nand development, one less dollar to hire new personnel. The end result \nwill be investment in fewer jobs in the short term and potentially less \neconomic growth in the long term as well.\n  By the way, I have some sympathy for this double taxation of dividend \nargument. But if you were going to do that, it ought to be a deduction \nagainst taxable income on the balance sheet of\n\n[[Page S189]]\n\nthe corporation. Then the cash is held, they can make the decisions and \ntreat it as an equivalent of interest, and then we would not have the \nbias in our system towards debt as opposed to equity. And it should, in \nmy view, be accompanied with reform, other tax reforms, that take away \nsome of the causes of why reported income is about 100 percent higher \nthan what taxable reported income is.\n  It just strikes me we are addressing this problem wrong, even if we \nwanted to reduce the double taxation of dividends, but it is absolutely \nobvious and certainly common sense if you take cash off the balance \nsheet of the corporation it has less ability to invest in its future, \nless ability to invest in hiring more people going forward. Cash is \nking. It is part of the valuation. But it strikes me, as we are \napproaching this, it is a wrong formulation.\n  The Bush plan does contain one element that I think is a reasonably \ndecent and dampening incentive to shift money in cash dividends. It is \nvery complicated. It adjusts the shareholder base. Their stock profits \nare not distributed in the form of dividends. I accept the fact that it \nwill marginally offset the shift of cash dividends. I think that will \nbe the minor scheme of things because I think the competition among \ncorporations showing different returns will be high. But I do think \nthat it is a reasonable attempt to try to make some offset to getting \ncash off the balance sheet for those who think they have to do marginal \nrates of return in which they can invest.\n  It is an incredibly complex concept to be able to explain to the vast \nmajority of Americans. To understand the differences and the increased \nbases for the vast majority of Americans will be a hard concept to get \ntheir minds around. It is going to lead to an absolute deluge of \npaperwork and shifting of information back and forth between investors, \nbrokers, tax preparers, and all other kinds of folks which I think can \nlead to all kinds of unintended consequences.\n  Beyond the lack of fiscal stimulus in the first year and what I \nbelieve will be a perverse impact created by the structure of the \ndifferent proposals, I am also concerned about the distribution of tax \nbenefits provided in the President's plan. Many of my colleagues tried \nto explain or at least talked about the obvious unfairness of that \ndistribution in a progressive tax system. The Bush administration, in \nmy view, and those who often talk about this obscure distributional \nimpact of the proposal, focus the tax burden exclusively on Federal \nincome taxes and ignore the severe burdens imposed by Federal payroll \ntaxes, all shapes and forms of State taxes, and local taxes, and \nespecially property taxes and sales taxes.\n  In New Jersey, the budget deficit required us to cut services and \nraise property taxes 7.1 percent. The State of New Jersey, by the way, \nalso had to put on a business tax to be able to raise about $1 billion \nto close that budget deficit. In the city of New York, which has been \ntroubled by current events, will have to raise property taxes 18.5 \npercent this year to try to make up for the holes that are being \ncreated and the lack of support from the Federal Government.\n  These additional taxes that I am talking about, such as property \ntaxes in particular, which weigh very heavily on the middle class, and \ntaking into account the distribution of the American tax burden, create \nan entirely different profile than if you just take a small slice of \nthe pie and look at the Federal income tax.\n  Without taking a more comprehensive approach, the President is really \nmisleading the American people based on the secondary impacts that will \noccur. Rather than focusing on the fairness issue, I wish to focus \ninstead on the ineffectiveness of the administration's proposal in \npromoting economic growth.\n  I am one of those guys who believes a rising tide does lift all \nboats, and if we do well everyone will benefit. Grow the pie.\n  There is a broad agreement among economists that low- and moderate-\nincome people are likely to spend the tax cuts rather than the high \nmarginal income people who would not have a propensity to spend it. It \nis a well-known fact and it is a matter of economic policy that any \nstimulus program ought to focus its tax cuts marginally on those who \nwill turn around and spend it because then you will get the multiplier \neffect on the economy. You will get that growth that we are both trying \nto get.\n  My friend from Utah has talked about trying to get it up to 3.5 or \n3.1 or 3.2. We can do that if we can get the people to spend the \nmoney--reducing inventories of manufacturers and people going back to \nwork. I think the Bush plan does precisely the opposite.\n  Over the next 10 years, just looking at some of the distributional \ninterests, lots of people with annual incomes of more than $1 million--\nby the way, this is a 10-year look--those with $1 million of income or \nmore will get a break worth $900,000.\n  Middle-class-income families--by the way, I define, at least in New \nJersey, the middle class as being in the $75,000 to $125,000 range \nbecause there are different views about what that is. But let us take \nmiddle-class-income families of $75,000 to $125,000. In that same 10-\nyear period, they would get $18,000 over 10 years. I think that is \nroughly 2.5 percent of the $900,000.\n  Let us consider people who would be in moderate-income classes. In \nsome parts of the country maybe this is defined as the middle class. \nEven in New Jersey, it is between $30,000 and $40,000.\n  The median income for an individual in the United States is about \n$27,000. But using a $30,000 to $40,000 range, I think the total 10-\nyear cumulative value of this is about $3,500 under the Bush plan. This \nis .4 percent of the total benefit that the million-dollar earners get.\n  Consider the 25 million taxpayers with purported gross incomes of \nless than $10,000. They make up 20 percent of the population of \ntaxpayers. They will get, over the 10 years, a total of $50.\n  By the way, they are paying payroll taxes. Many of them are paying \nproperty taxes. Many of them are paying State sales taxes, and all the \nother nonconsidered taxes in this view. I think that is a tough way to \nlook at it. This is not intended to say, wow, this is bad; people at \nthe top end are getting such great breaks. It is just that there is a \ndistributional reality that doesn't make sense: $900,000 over 10 years \nfor those making more than $1 million; $18,000 for those between \n$75,000 and $100,000; and $3,500 for those between $30,000 and $40,000; \nand $50 for those $10,000 and below.\n  I think you can make a fairness argument. But I think the most \nimportant piece is that it will not stimulate the economy. The people \nwho will spend money--particularly in the short run--are not going to \nbe receiving the resources to be able to go off to their Wal-Marts or \nTargets and other places and put the demand into this economy.\n  I know that the administration and many have argued and are pointing \nout that those of us who make the kind of case that I just made are \nentering into what is tantamount to class warfare. My point has nothing \nto do with that--nothing at all. It is, in fact, just the opposite.\n  As other Democrats, I believe our goal should be to grow the economy \nto the benefit of every American--for all Americans. I want to create \nmore millionaires. I want more people to be more successful--not fewer. \nHanding out tax cuts so disproportionately to the top of the income \nscale is a highly ineffective way to grow our economy. They just do not \nturn around and drive the economy--certainly not in the short run.\n  There are real debates about whether that actually gets back into the \ninvestment system, particularly if a lot of it goes off to seniors and \na lot of it goes into bonds and coupons and into Federal Government \nsecurities. It is just not certain that it is going to grow productive \ncapacity, and certainly it isn't going to eat up the excess capacity we \nhave today. I don't think this is going to grow the pie larger, which \nis what all of us should look for.\n  We made more millionaires in the 1990s than we did in any other \nperiod in the history of the United States. I think it is absolutely \nessential that we talk about growing the pie as opposed to getting into \nthis discussion about how we are dividing it.\n  Keep in mind that all Americans, including the very wealthy, in my \nview, benefit from a strong economy. Those at the top income scale, as \nI said, did\n\n[[Page S190]]\n\nwell in the 1990s. We adopted policies based on a commitment of fiscal \ndiscipline, along with targeted investment in priorities such as \neducation. Abandoning those policies for tax breaks such as the \nproposed dividend exclusion clearly will not mean more cash in hand for \nthose who invest in our society. There is nothing wrong with that in \nits own right. But is it going to grow the economy? I think this, in \nmany ways, runs the risk of being antigrowth. It certainly runs the \nrisk of higher interest rates down the road given the fiscal \nimplications that may very well come about.\n  I just have to say that it seems odd after the growth experience of \nthe 1990s. I know there were problems at the end of the 1990s. But we \ncreated 22 million new jobs, we had a balanced budget, and we had \ntremendous growth and productivity in this country because of \ninvestment in technology and the spread of American entrepreneurial \nskills.\n  Why we need radical surgery on America's tax structure is just a hard \nconcept to get your mind around. Clearly, we have cyclical problems \nthat can be addressed by dealing with an inventory cycle and investment \ncycle. And I think that calls for short-term stimulus and managing \ncarefully our long-term fiscal situation.\n  Next, I want to move on and talk about one claim that has been made \nrepeatedly by proponents of the administration and the administration \nofficials that gets sort of tied up in this class-warfare charge; that \nis, the administration's tax cut supposedly benefits seniors. This \nclaim, in my view, is about as misleading as anything I can imagine.\n  There are 37 million seniors in the U.S. Yet only one-fourth of \nthem--less than 10 million; about 9.25 million--will receive dividends. \nSome 75 percent--or 27 million--of America's seniors will get \nabsolutely nothing from the President's dividend exclusion. Moreover, \nonly a small fraction of the wealthiest seniors will enjoy most of the \nbenefits. Nearly 40 percent of the dividend tax cut for seniors will \nflow to those filers with incomes exceeding $200,000. That is a mere \n2.5 percent of tax returns filed by senior citizens.\n  I am trying to figure it out because there are married couples in \nthere, but I think it is around 250,000 seniors out of 37 million \nseniors who will get 40 percent of that so-called benefit for seniors. \nSo it is highly misleading to argue that seniors will benefit from this \nplan. Only a small number of the wealthiest seniors will benefit.\n  And when you take the potential cost of this--in maintaining the real \nvalue of Social Security benefits, the ability of our Nation to truly \ndeal with a prescription drug benefit, regardless of what kind of plan \ncomes forward--to talk about this benefiting seniors on a relative \nbasis to the overall needs of the seniors is hard for me to get my mind \naround. It is virtually mind-boggling. In fact, one could make the case \nthat seniors are among the biggest losers in the President's plan \nbecause we are not going to have the ability to deal with this baby \nboom generation, going from 37 million seniors to 70 million seniors \nover the next 15 years.\n  So far, I have discussed the small size of the stimulus in the first \nyear, its incentives for companies to shift cash away from investments \nand jobs, and targeting the tax cuts to those who are least likely to \nspend it. I have responded to some of the claims that I think are \nrelatively bogus with regard to benefits for America's seniors.\n  Now I want to focus on another and critically important issue, which \nis the failure to address the severe fiscal problems facing our States. \nIn many ways, it makes those problems worse. In fact, it is in this \nvein that this plan is also seriously antigrowth. And if it isn't \nantigrowth, it is absolutely antistate when you come to considering the \nimpact on State finances.\n  While many of us in Washington are talking about putting more money \ninto the economy, as I suggested, most of our Governors and our State \nlegislators are having to deal with how we pull money out of the \neconomy. That is because almost all of our States have strict balanced \nbudget requirements--48 out of 50 States--and face severe fiscal \nproblems.\n  The total of the projected deficits, as I said, was just \nreestimated--about $90 billion, give or take $10 billion. I agree with \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah; some of these economic projections \nare hard to put in print. But if we do not get the economy going, the \nonly way that number is going to go is up. The crisis facing State \ntreasuries is not just a problem for elected officials; it is a problem \nfor all of our citizens and for our economy. States and localities \nalready have begun to raise taxes.\n\n  In New Jersey, property taxes have increased 7.1 percent; in the city \nof New York, 18.5 percent. Across this country, we are raising property \ntaxes because people care about the education of their children, they \ncare about transportation, and they are investing heavily in homeland \nsecurity to protect the American people. It is a big deal that we are \nnot taking on a fair share of that at the Federal level.\n  By the way, we just created another unfunded mandate with Leave No \nChild Behind. And our budget proposals are not meeting our promises \naccording to it. We have not done that with IDEA or in special \neducation. And there are real needs with regard to our homeland \nsecurity. We are putting burdens on the States and local governments \nand not coming up with help to make it happen.\n  These tax increases and spending cuts that the individual States and \nlocalities are doing not only hurt taxpayers but they really undermine \nthe efficacy of Government and the program beneficiaries they serve to \ndepress the economy further. That deficit among the States, in fact, \nmore than offsets the entire stimulus proposed for fiscal year 2003 in \nthe President's plan. And I suspect you will be able to say the same \nthing about fiscal year 2004. We have different timings on when the two \nfit together. But we are taking out of one pocket and putting it into \nanother. I think it is really wrongheaded policy and really will limit \ngrowth in the country. I think it is really putting unfair burdens on \nour State and local governments.\n  Only the Federal Government is in a position to counter these \npressures. Instead, the administration's plan does absolutely nothing \nto address these fiscal crises in our States or to reduce the need for \nState tax hikes or spending cuts. It just does not deal with these \nissues. I hope we can understand and adjust this plan to take into \nconsideration the plight of all of our country, all of our various \nentities that service the American people, by pulling this all \ntogether.\n  By the way, the proposal actually worsens the situation on not only \nthe support level, but every State ties its State income tax--those \nStates that have an income tax--to the Federal tax system. And the \nStates are going to directly lose $4.5 billion--almost $100 million in \nmy State of New Jersey, but over $1 billion in the State of California.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nsimply ask if we could enter a unanimous consent agreement on order. I \ncertainly do not object to the Senator from New Jersey having an extra \n5 minutes, but I understand the Senator from Utah and the Senator from \nOhio wish to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from Utah has spoken, \nwho will speak after the Senator from New Jersey, and after the Senator \nfrom Ohio has spoken, I be recognized at the completion of the comments \nof the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I appreciate very much the courtesy of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  Mr. President, we have a problem in the States. And the tie in of the \ntaxes that States collect to the Federal tax system is one of those \nplaces where there is a problem.\n  Another, on which I will not go into great deal, is the issuance of \nmunicipal bonds, tax-exempt bonds, the fundamental element of how you \nfund infrastructure, schools, and all the other elements at the local \nlevel. They are going to have to compete now with tax-free dividends \nand are going to suffer very seriously on a competitive basis in the \nfinancial markets.\n\n[[Page S191]]\n\n  I can assure you, interest rates for State and local government \nbonds, on an equal basis--regardless of where the markets go, where \ninterest rates go--will be higher than they would have otherwise been. \nSo there is a real problem.\n  I will go back and just mention briefly, the lack of attention to \nthese exhausted unemployment benefits is going to put greater burdens \non States and create greater rolls in Medicaid. Lots of support is \ngoing to have to be delivered to the individual families who are \nsuffering from those kinds of situations. I think we have a real \nproblem there.\n  I also want to say I think there are other issues involved. Maybe the \nmost important is, where are our priorities? We are at a time of great \nnational insecurity, with good reason. We need to protect the American \npeople at home, abroad, and against terrorists.\n  We had almost 700 New Jersey people lose their lives on September 11. \nPeople are concerned about security. We need to be investing in it. Why \nand wherefore are we having such a program that brings little sacrifice \nto those who are doing well at a time when there are such great needs?\n  I could go on further about some of the complexities of this and how \nit will offer great opportunity for financial engineering, chicanery, \nif you will, almost the repetitive nature of some of the things that we \nsaw in the last several years: The unfortunate implication for 401(k)s \nand IRAs and tax-exempt pension funds with regard to dividends, the \ndisincentives it will create for longrun savings for retirement, the \nproblems it may very well cause to the real estate industry because of \nthe competitive disadvantage of REITs and the financial structure which \nis an important thing for housing for people.\n  There are serious, serious flaws in this. Instead of directly \naddressing the fundamental economic problem, which is excess capacity, \nboth in labor and manufacturing, this reflects, in my view, a return to \nthe discredited economics of radical supply siders.\n  I don't want to quote only a Republican commentator, but I will. \nKevin Phillips put it this way:\n\n       This isn't even trickle-down economics. It's mist down \n     economics.\n\n  We are on the wrong track. We have a new economic team at the White \nHouse. I hope they will step back and evaluate some of these elements. \nThere are places where we can work together on this plan, but 90 \npercent of this proposal that is focused on the longrun restructuring \nof economic structure, in my view, is a bad idea. It truly hurts our \nStates and potentially undermines investment at the corporate level, \nand it has some issues on the fairness side.\n  It is time that we take a rethink. I hope we can have a great debate \nover the next few months in the Senate to make this a better program to \nhelp all Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I spoke at length and I do not intend to \ndo that again. I congratulate the Senator from New Jersey on his \npresentation. Even though it sounds as if we are miles apart, we are in \nfact very much together on our determination to see to it that the \nultimate result of what we do is long-term growth for the whole \neconomy. I congratulate him on his analysis.\n  I have a few things, obviously, with which I would disagree and \nanticipate that we will have that conversation both in the Banking \nCommittee and on the floor.\n  There are two specifics I would like to respond to briefly before I \nturn the time over to my friend from Ohio. The Senator from New Jersey \nsaid he would prefer, with respect to dividends, that they be deducted \nas expenses on the corporate P statement rather than made tax free to \nthe recipient. I agree with him absolutely, that that is the more \nintelligent way to do it. I have said that to the White House as we \nhave had these conversations. The reaction is politically that would be \nmore difficult to sell than making it sound tax free to the recipient.\n  Maybe if the Senator from New Jersey and I march together in that \nparticular parade, we can move in that direction because the comments \nhe makes about the complexity of the tax system are exactly correct. \nThe difficulties of reporting how this would be handled are just as \ncomplex as the Senator from New Jersey suggests they are. I would be \nwith him in seeing if we could make that shift somewhere along the way.\n  I know he would stop short of doing that because of his feelings with \nrespect to the dividend proposal anyway, but I want him to know that \nhis analysis here is the same as mine and that he has analyzed that one \ncorrectly.\n  The other item we ought to have on the table as we have the \ndiscussion, the Senator from New Jersey refers to the impact on the top \n1 percent; they would receive $900,000, et cetera. That is true if we \nassume that every taxpayer who files a tax return who is in that top 1 \npercent is in fact an individual.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I stood on this floor and asked this \nfundamental question--I know the answer from the Senator from New \nJersey will be yes, but the answer from the vast majority of my \ncolleagues was no--do you know what a K-1 is? Overwhelmingly, \nRepublicans and Democrats had no idea what a K-1 is. A K-1 is the form \nyou file for income you are receiving from a partnership or an S \ncorporation.\n  A majority of the tax returns filed by the individuals who would \nreceive the $900,000 to which the Senator from New Jersey refers \ninclude K-1 income. The K-1 is set up to avoid double taxation. You \njoin an S corporation or a partnership and you say: All right, the \nprofits of that corporation will flow to my individual tax return. I \nwill pay taxes.\n  I know this very dramatically from my experience in the 1980s when \nthe personal rate was lower than the corporate rate. With four other \nindividuals, we built a company from virtually nothing to a company \nthat today employs over 4,000 people, and we did it in the decade of \ngreed, as it was referred to by some, of the Reagan years when the top \npersonal rate was 28 percent. By putting that on my personal tax return \nand paying 28 percent rather than today's effective rate of 42, I was \nable to see to it that that company, which I headed as the CEO, grew \nwith internally generated funds.\n  The difference between a 28-percent yield to the Feds and a 42-\npercent yield to the Feds was the difference between our ability to \nmake that business survive. We built that business entirely with \ninternally generated funds.\n\n  My salary was $100,000. My tax return showed $1 million because the \nmoney that was flowing through that corporation went on to my tax \nreturn as K-1 income. I didn't get a dime of that. I would have loved \nto have had the after-tax income show up, but we had to fund the \ncompany. So as we talk about the tax break to wealthy individuals \nduring this debate, let us keep in mind that we are not talking about \nMichael Jordan or Donald Trump or Tiger Woods. Yes, they would get \nthose breaks, but overwhelmingly a majority of the people who would get \nthose breaks are businesses that, either through an S corporation \ndevice or a partnership device, are putting that income on to \nindividual returns. And that would, in fact, be money that would be \ninvested in creating new jobs. That would, in fact, be money that would \nbe invested in growing the economy.\n  I know the Senator from New Jersey has had K-1 income because he has \nbeen a partnership partner in a very successful partnership, and he \nunderstands this. But I want to take this occasion to put this on the \nrecord and make this part of the debate as we go forward.\n  Let us understand, as we argue about the amount the top 1 percent is \ngoing to get out of this, that we are not talking just about \nindividuals; we are talking about businesses that depend very \ndefinitely on the benefit that comes from having S corporation profits \nreported through a K-1 show up on individual tax returns but are, in \nfact, not getting into the individual pockets, are, in fact, funding \nthe growth of small businesses and new enterprises.\n  With those two immediate comments, I will yield the floor and save \nthe other notes I have taken on the Senator's excellent speech for a \ndirect conversation with the Senator from New Jersey. He has made a \nsignificant contribution to this debate, and I look forward to working \nwith him to try to eventually come up with a growth package that makes \nsense.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to respond for 1\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\nminute, if the Senator from Ohio will not object.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I appreciate very much the comments of the Senator from \nUtah. I think we need a healthy debate to get the best policies. I will \nmake one observation about the S corporations and K-1s, which I know \nsomething about. The fact is, I try not to use the sort of \ndistributional numbers. You will notice I did not use the top 1 \npercent; I used people making $1 million or more as the basis on which \nI compare numbers. So there is some element of that which translates \ninto comparability. I think you and I can sort through those in detail. \nBut the fact is, people at $1 million or more in adjusted gross income \nare going to have an advantage of $900,000 cumulatively over the 10 \nyears, and the other brackets are at $18,500, $3,500, and $50.\n  I believe that a rising tide lifts all boats. That is the theme about \nwhich I am talking. We may have differences about how you get there. I \nwant to make sure that we distinguish between talking about \npercentages, and what I am trying to talk about is the people who \nactually get the benefit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S192-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S192-S193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNBORN VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak, once again, on \nbehalf of unborn children. Unborn children are the silent victims of \nviolent crimes. Today, along with my distinguished colleagues, Senator \nGraham of South Carolina, Senator Voinovich, Senator Brownback, Senator \nEnsign, Senator Enzi, Senator Inhofe, Senator Nickles, Senator \nSantorum, and Senator Fitzgerald, we will once again introduce the \nUnborn Victims of Violence Act, which would hold victims liable for \nconduct that injures or kills an unborn child by creating a separate \nFederal offense for unborn children. I thank my colleagues for their \nsupport in this effort. I want to recognize especially Senator Graham \nof South Carolina who championed this cause so successfully last year \non the House side. He has worked tirelessly to see that the most \nvulnerable in our society are in fact protected.\n  Mr. President, our bill, which is similar to the legislation that we \nsponsored in the 106th and 107th Congresses, would establish new \ncriminal penalties for anybody injuring or killing a fetus while \ncommitting certain Federal offenses. Therefore, this bill would make \nthe death or injury of an unborn child during the commission of certain \nexisting Federal crimes a separate crime under Federal law and under \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n  Mr. President, 26 of our States already have criminalized the killing \nand injuring of unborn victims during a crime. Our bill, the Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act, simply acknowledges that violent acts against \nunborn babies are also criminal when the assailant is committing a \nFederal crime.\n  We live in a violent world and, sadly, sometimes--perhaps more often \nthan we realize--even unborn babies are the targets, intended or \notherwise, of violent acts. Let me give some very disturbing examples.\n  In 1996, airman Gregory Robbins and his family were stationed in my \nhome State of Ohio at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton. At \nthat time, Mrs. Robbins was more than 8 months pregnant with a daughter \nwho they named Jasmine. On September 12, 1996, in a fit of rage, Airman \nRobbins wrapped his fist in a T-shirt and savagely beat his wife by \nstriking her repeatedly about the head and the abdomen. Fortunately, \nMrs. Robbins survived the violent assault. Tragically, her uterus \nruptured during the attack, expelling the baby into her abdominal \ncavity, causing Jasmine's death.\n  Air Force prosecutors sought to prosecute Airman Robbins for \nJasmine's death, but found that neither the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice nor the Federal code makes criminal such an act which results \nin the death or injury of an unborn child. No Federal law covered that \nact. The only available Federal offense was for the simple assault on \nthe mother. This was a case in which the only available Federal penalty \nsimply did not fit the crime.\n  Now, fortunately, Ohio had at the time, and still does, a fetal \nhomicide act. So Federal prosecutors were able to bootstrap the Ohio \nfetal homicide law under the Federal law to convict Airman Robbins of \nJasmine's death. Upon appeal, the Federal appeals court upheld the \nlower court's ruling.\n  Mr. President, if it hadn't been for the Ohio law that was already in \nplace, there would have been no opportunity for the Federal prosecutors \nto prosecute and punish Airman Robbins for the assault against baby \nJasmine. That is one reason we need a Federal remedy to avoid having to \nbootstrap Federal laws to provide recourse when a violent act occurs \nduring the commission of a Federal crime. If this had been a crime that \noccurred on a Federal enclave in a State that did not have a similar \nlaw--and there are 24 States that don't--there would have been no \nremedy, and there is no remedy today. Federal prosecutors have no \nremedy in those situations today. Our bill would rectify that.\n\n  A Federal remedy will ensure that crime within Federal jurisdictions \nagainst unborn victims are, in fact, punished. Our bill also ensures \nthat if certain Federal crimes are committed anywhere in the United \nStates and they result in the death of a child, Federal prosecutors \nwill be able to file charges.\n  Let me give you another example of another tragedy. In August 1999, \nShiwona Pace of Little Rock, AR, was days away from giving birth. She \nwas thrilled about her pregnancy, but her boyfriend, Eric Bullock, did \nnot share the joy and enthusiasm. In fact, Eric wanted the baby to die. \nSo he hired three thugs to beat his girlfriend so badly that she lost \nthe unborn child. According to Shiwona, who testified in a Senate \nJudiciary Committee hearing we held in Washington in February of 2000:\n\n       I begged and pleaded for the life of my unborn child, but \n     they showed me no mercy. In fact, one of them told me, ``your \n     baby is dying tonight.'' I was choked, hit in the face with a \n     gun, slapped, punched, and kicked repeatedly in the stomach. \n     One of them even put a gun in my mouth and threatened to \n     shoot.\n\n  Mr. President, in this particular case, this particular tragedy, just \na few short weeks before this vicious attack, Arkansas had passed its \nfetal protection act. Under that Arkansas State law, Eric Bullock was \nconvicted on February 9, 2001, of capital murder against Shiwona's \nunborn child and sentenced to life in prison without parole. He was \nalso convicted of first degree battery for harm against Shiwona.\n  In yet another example--this one in Columbus, OH--16-year-old Sean \nSteele was found guilty of two counts of murder for the death of his \ngirlfriend, Barbara ``Bobbie'' Watkins, age 15, and her 22-week-old \nunborn child. He was convicted under Ohio's unborn victims law, which \nrepresented the first murder conviction in Franklin County, OH, in \nwhich the victim was a fetus.\n  Another example: In the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center \nbombings, Federal prosecutors were able to charge the defendants with \nthe murders of or injuries to the mothers, but not to their unborn \nbabies. Again, Federal law currently fails to criminalize these violent \nacts. There are no Federal provisions of the unborn victims of Federal \ncrimes.\n  Our bill would make acts like these--acts of violence within Federal \njurisdictions--Federal crimes. This is a very simple step that we can \ntake, one that will have, I believe, a dramatic effect. It is something \nthat we simply need to do.\n  The fact is that it is just plain wrong that our Federal Government \ndoes absolutely nothing to criminalize violent acts against unborn \nchildren. We cannot allow criminals to get away with murder. We simply \nmust close this loophole.\n  As a civilized society, we must take a stand against violent crimes \nagainst children. We must close this loophole.\n  We purposely drafted this legislation very narrowly. Because of that, \nour bill would not permit the prosecution for any abortion to which a \nwoman consented. It would not permit the prosecution of a woman for any \naction, legal or unlegal, in regard to her unborn child. Our \nlegislation would not permit the prosecution for harm caused to the \nmother or unborn child in the course of medical treatment. And finally, \nour bill would not allow for the\n\n[[Page S193]]\n\nimposition of the death penalty under this act.\n  It is time we wrap the arms of justice around unborn children and \nprotect them against criminal assailants. Everyone agrees that violent \nassailants of unborn babies are, in fact, criminals. When acts of \nviolence against unborn victims fall within Federal jurisdiction, we \nmust have a penalty. We have an obligation to our unborn children who \ncannot speak for themselves. The Senate must act.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation. \nI thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to address again an issue I \naddressed yesterday on the floor relative to the funding and the \nactivity under the No Child Left Behind legislation which is landmark \nlegislation we passed a year ago which the President of the United \nStates signed and which was a bipartisan effort.\n  After I spoke yesterday, a couple of Senators came down to the \nChamber and addressed the issue but, once again, misrepresented the \nfacts. I think it is important, therefore, to restate what the facts \nare and go through some of the history and also review in more depth a \nletter which was sent by Senator Kennedy and Senator Miller to the \nDepartment of Education, which letter, in my opinion, is off base and \ninaccurate.\n  To begin with, the No Child Left Behind bill is landmark legislation, \nthe purpose of which is to give parents of low-income children and low-\nincome children an opportunity to participate in the American dream by \nassuring they get a decent education and have a chance to learn what \nthey need to learn to be competitive with their peers, especially as \nthey proceed through the early years of education.\n  It is a bill that ties four different elements to it.\n  No. 1, the purpose is to obviously give low-income children a better \neducational opportunity through a process of giving the local school \ndistricts flexibility over how they deal with the rules under title I, \nwhich is the low-income child education part of the Federal law.\n  No. 2, there is an initiative in this bill to make sure that low-\nincome children are reaching the standards of their peers through \nputting in place a testing regime which basically sets up \naccountability and to establish that children of all ethnic groups in \nthe same classroom are learning at a level which is necessary for them \nto move on so that the children are not being warehoused, are not \nsimply being passed through the system--as we discovered, \nunfortunately, was happening for years and, at the end of their \neducational experience in public schools, they really did not know \nenough to compete in America and to have a successful life.\n\n  No. 3, if a child was found to be in a school that simply was not \nworking, was not educating that child, there are certain rules put into \nthe bill which empower the parent to take some action so they can get \ntheir child the educational assistance they need, such as public school \nchoice, such as getting tutorial support outside the school. And if the \nschool continued not to work, then the public school system was given a \nlot of funds and resources to correct that problem.\n  No. 4, there was a significant amount of Federal dollars--a dramatic \nincrease in Federal funding--that was put into local schools for the \npurpose of addressing this bill. That is what I want to talk about \ntoday because, once again, that was misrepresented on this floor.\n  The amount of funding which President Bush has put into the new bill \nrepresents the most historic increase in the educational funding in the \nhistory of Federal funding. It has been a 132-percent increase in \nfunding. We have seen a 132-percent increase in funding in education \nover the last 6 years, and that compares to a 48-percent increase in \nDefense, or a 96-percent increase in Health and Human Services. It is a \ndramatic increase in educational funding.\n  One might say that ties to the Clinton years, too. Yes, it does, but \nif we look at what President Bush has done in his first year in office, \nhe increased funding in education by approximately $20 billion over the \nlast year of the Clinton administration. That is a dramatic increase, a \n50-percent increase almost in funding over the last year of the Clinton \nadministration.\n  The request of the President for new funding in areas of, for \nexample, special education, was historic compared to President Clinton \nwho essentially requested no increases in special education until his \nlast year, this being a chart showing President Clinton's request. The \nred represents the $1 billion increase in special education funding \nthat President Bush requested and received in his first year, and the \n$1 billion increase in special education funding which President Bush \nrequested on top of that $1 billion in the coming year.\n  If one looks at the history of the commitment of this President to \neducational funding, it dwarfs--dwarfs--the commitment made by the \nClinton administration. For example, if one looks at the 7 years of \nincreases in educational funding under the Clinton administration, they \nare almost 25-percent less than the increases which President Bush has \nput into educational funding in just 2 years. He has not only made this \ntype of a commitment in 2 years, but he has already stated that he \nintends to increase title I funding by another $1 billion this year. He \nhas asked for that, and I expect we are going to see the same type of \ndramatic increase in special education funding and across the board.\n  This letter was sent by Senator Kennedy and Senator Miller to \nSecretary Paige, and it outlined their concerns with the No Child Left \nBehind legislation. I think it is important to respond to this because \nthis letter was truly an inaccurate letter. It began--and I heard \nSenator Harkin yesterday parroting this position--by saying that the \nPresident has cut No Child Left Behind spending. That is absolutely \ninaccurate. Not only has he not cut it, he has increased that specific \naccount, title I, by over $4 billion since he has been President.\n\n  How do they define it as a cut? There is one program--one program--\nthat they did not fund. It was a $90 million program called the Fund \nfor Improvement of Education. Because they did not fund that one \nprogram, that is a cut in the minds of Senator Harkin and Senator \nKennedy. That is a very interesting way to account. If you increase \nspending in one year by $1 billion, but as part of that $1-billion \nincrease you eliminate a program worth $90 million, you have cut \nspending, according to Senator Kennedy and Senator Harkin. That is a \ntruly unique way to look at the way math is done. I think maybe they \nshould go back and do math in the third grade and see if they pass the \ntest which we are going to try to make sure kids have to pass to be \ncompetent in the third grade.\n  Clearly, if the funds have been increased by $1 billion, you have not \ncut the program. If you have eliminated an earmarked program--which is \nnot working to begin with and which has virtually no purpose other than \nto fund special interest activity--which is worth $90 million, but at \nthe same time you have increased funding over $1 billion in that \naccount, you have not cut the program; you have improved the program \nand you have made sure that billion dollars is going to be spent much \nmore effectively. What do we do with the $90 million they eliminated? \nWe sent it back to the towns, the cities, and let the teachers and \nprincipals and the school boards decide how to spend that money rather \nthan have it be a categorical program. That representation in the \nletter was specious.\n\n[[Page S194]]\n\n  The letter goes on to say the bill is filled with an unfunded mandate \nto build schools and hire highly qualified teachers to comply with the \nbill's public school choice capacity requirements. But that is not the \ncase. It should be noted that in 1995 Congress prohibited unfunded \nmandates. With regard to school construction, the Department of \nEducation has never required districts to build new schools. Of course, \nit has not required that in order to accommodate the No Child Left \nBehind law.\n  Furthermore, the Department is still waiting for the States to draw \ndown $900 million in school construction renovation money that was \npassed in the year 2001. So the money is still sitting there and has \nnot even been spent.\n  With regard to the new teacher requirement, which simply says the \nteachers have to be highly qualified teachers, that is not a mandate. \nIn fact, what this bill does is dramatically increase and has \ndramatically increased the funding for teacher training and for teacher \npay and for teacher support. A $742 million increase in one year. Three \nbillion dollars is now going out to the States to assist them with \nteacher training, teacher qualification, and teacher support.\n  What we did in this bill which is unique and special and is going to \nhelp the local school, instead of having a whole set of categorical \nprograms, one of which says you must have this number of teachers in \nyour schoolroom depending on this number of kids, instead of telling \nschools that is how they have to educate their children, we said we are \ngoing to take all this money, this $3 billion--we have increased it now \nby $742 million--and we will put it together in a pool and we will say \nto you, the principal, you tell us how you can use this to improve your \nteachers. If you need more teachers in the classroom, if you need to \nhire more teachers, you can use the money for that. If you have really \ngood teachers you want to keep in your classroom, you can pay them \nmore. If you have teachers who need technical support, computers, \nwhatever, in their classroom to help them, you can use it that way. If \nyou have teachers who need a little extra help, a little extra \neducation, or want that to improve themselves, you can use it that way. \nWe gave the flexibility to local school districts to make the decisions \nas to how they were going to use this money to improve their teachers \nso all the teachers would be of high quality.\n  But that does not satisfy the Senator from Iowa or the Senator from \nMassachusetts. They want that categorical program which says with this \nmoney you have to hire this number of teachers if you have this number \nof students. That was rejected in No Child Left Behind. You cannot come \naround the corner now and say you have to do it now because that is not \nthe law anymore. Therefore, you cannot claim there is an unfunded \nmandate.\n  Let's remember, this President has increased funding for teachers by \n35 percent over what the Clinton administration funded.\n  The letter also says the final regulations established an incentive \nfor schools to focus on test scores while ignoring high school dropout \nrates, thereby jeopardizing the law's accountability provisions. \nNothing could be further from the truth. The regulations are actually \nstronger than the statute. The statute was unclear on graduation rates \nand the regulations state even if all children are doing well in \nschool, if the dropout rates are high, the school is still identified \nas being in need of improvement, a tougher standard than what we passed \nin the Congress.\n\n  The letter also criticizes the Department for not allowing teachers \nwho are alternatively certified or working on becoming alternatively \ncertified to be counted as highly qualified. This is a perfect example \nof how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do the teachers \nunion bidding by trying to prevent individuals who do not go through \nthe traditional teacher certification process, which is dominated by, \nunfortunately, union rules which sometimes have no relevance to \ncapacity to teach. It restricts those people from being hired. They do \nnot want competition. They do not want teachers coming in from the \nTeach for America Program or other programs and encourage professionals \nfrom other fields to move into the teaching arena. This bill, No Child \nLeft Behind, encourages drawing into our school systems people who are \nqualified but are not necessarily professional teachers--going to the \nmilitary services, for example, to get people out of the Army and the \nArmed Forces into teaching. And as I said, Teach for America. That \nlanguage was a strong addition to the bill, not a weakening of the \nbill.\n  The letter also states that the No Child Left Behind prohibited norm-\nreference tests which measures students' achievements against that of \ntheir peers. This is patently false. Patently false. The House bill \noriginally had that language; this language was dropped. It is another \nexample, as is the example that I pointed out prior, of using the old \nlaw of the way things used to be to attack the new law, the way things \nare and the way things are improving.\n  The letter also claims the Department allowed States to use a \npatchwork of local tests to meet the new annual testing requirements, \nmaking it possible to measure whether achievement gaps are closed. The \nDepartment has made it crystal clear if you use local tests they have \nto be comparable tests. That is the way it should be. There is no \nreason to deny school districts from using local tests. If they put \ntogether a plan which makes it clear that those local tests are \ncomparable, of course we should let them use local tests. That is \ncalled flexibility. As long as there is a way to compare them and the \nDepartment has said that is a commitment, that is something a State has \nto do in deciding their plan.\n  And let's remember here, one of the States that has met the test of \nputting forward an accountability system that will work happens to be \nMassachusetts. Massachusetts has proved you can do it. As has New York. \nAs has Indiana. As has Ohio. Big States. States with lots of kids in \ntheir system. Their plans have been approved, ahead of schedule, that \nthey can meet the tests of this bill.\n  And what is the purpose of this bill? Remember, the purpose of the \nbill is to make sure kids learn. These people who put these plans \ntogether are excited about the fact they now have a law they can follow \nwhich allows them to make sure that kids do learn. All the teachers in \nthis country, all teachers, that is their purpose. They are altruistic \npeople because they want to help kids learn. Now we put in place a \nsystem to help them find out whether the kids are meeting those \nstandards and whether they are learning. These States which have \nalready come up and put forward plans and initiatives which work under \nthe bill are reflecting the energy out there to do good under this \nbill, and yet we get a letter like this which is basically trying to \nundermine the bill.\n  Last point. This letter engaged in a bit of what I call revisionist \nhistory when it claims No Child Left Behind allows Federal educational \nprograms to directly fund religious organizations and to permit \norganizations to discriminate based on religion. After many hours of \nnegotiation--I was there; Senator Kennedy was there; Senator Miller was \nthere--and I am very surprised to see this language in this letter. We \nreached a bipartisan agreement to be silent. That is to allow current \nlaw to operate on the issue of the Civil Rights Act. Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, \nnational origin and employment, except with regard to employment by \nreligious institutions. We did not nor did we intend to reverse this \nprecedent. To claim otherwise is simply to ridicule the process we went \nthrough for months and misrepresents the outcome of the process which \nwe resolved over those months.\n  What my colleagues are asking for in this letter is to have the \nDepartment of Education pile more and more regulations onto the States \nand the local communities as they try to come into compliance and make \nthe No Child Left Behind bill work. That is just the opposite of our \ngoal. Our goal was to free up the local communities in the States to \ngive them the opportunity to use their energy, their creativity, and \ntheir individuality to address this very serious problem we have in \nAmerica, which is that so many kids, especially low-income kids, are \nnot being educated well enough to participate in American society.\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\n  We don't want to go back to the old way where there were strings \nrunning from every desk in this Chamber out to every school district. \nWe were saying: You must do this or we are going to pull that string \nand jerk you around. We want to go to the new way, which says: We are \ngoing to give you flexibility; we are going to give you money; we are \ngoing to empower parents to know what is going on. But at the end of \nthe day we are going to expect accountability; we are going to expect \nresults; we are going to expect these kids actually are learning.\n  We are going to test them. The tests will be designed by local folks, \nbut we are going to expect them to learn to the standards the local \nfolks design. It is a reasonable bill. It is going to help a lot of \nkids in America. And it is unfortunate there appears to be this \norchestrated effort to undermine it.\n  It is extremely unfortunate that we hear, again and again, \nmisrepresentations on the floor of this Senate about how much money is \ncommitted to it and about the commitment of this President to funding \neducation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized without objection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S195-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S195-S200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have heard some weighty \nsubjects discussed here today. The Senator from New Hampshire was \ndiscussing the issue of education. Prior to that, Senators from Utah \nand New Jersey were talking about tax policy, trying to get our sickly \neconomy revved up and moving again. If those were not enough of weighty \nsubjects to talk about, I want to bring up one of grave concern to the \nforeign policy of this United States, indeed to the very defense of \nthese United States: That is the subject of North Korea.\n  I rise today to speak on this subject as a member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. This question of development of nuclear \nweapons by North Korea is something we should address. That is the \noccasion to which I rise today.\n  Over half a century we have seen North Korea struggle along in its \ntotalitarian, repressive regime. If there is any question about that, \nlook at the fruits of that repressive labor--the starvation there among \nthe people while the leaders, indeed, lead very comfortable and cushy \nlives. Nobody questions the starvation among the people in North Korea. \nThe free world has been trying to do something about it.\n  To those in this Chamber who have had the privilege, as I have, of \ngoing to the DMZ, to the line, to see the stark differences on either \nside of the line, it is very apparent. One, is a side that is lush in \nvegetation, highly developed. Then, just looking across the line, you \nsee quite a contrast with the sparse vegetation on the north side of \nthe line.\n  But I saw North Korea also from a different perspective, from the \nwindow of a spacecraft on the night side of the Earth. There is quite a \ncontrast for the lights reflecting from Earth back up into space--there \nis a distinct difference between North and South Korea from space at \nnight. The South Korean peninsula is lit up, vibrant in its economic \nactivity, whereas north of the line there are very few lights \ndiscernible from the view of the window of the spacecraft.\n\n  In North Korea, we have had a regime that has isolated its own \ncountry. Now this situation is urgent, vis-a-vis the foreign policy of \nthe United States. It requires sustained attention from our \nadministration even as we deal with a separate and growing crisis in \nIraq. Unfortunately, the Bush administration is approaching the events \non the Korean peninsula in an inconsistent and incoherent way, in the \nopinion of this Senator, even as it continues to build up our forces in \nthe Persian Gulf region.\n  This is dangerous. We cannot, in my opinion, and we must not, allow \nthe North Koreans to develop an effective nuclear weapons arsenal. Yet \nit is a very difficult situation. Go back to 1994. The Clinton \nadministration faced a similar crisis in 1994, which it averted by \nstriking an agreement with North Korea. This Agreed Framework provided \nthe United States would provide North Korea with economic assistance \nand more open diplomatic communication in exchange for a cessation of \noperations and infrastructure development of reactors and facilities \nused to build its nuclear weapons program. This agreement, while \nflawed, allowed the United Nations to come in and monitor the disposal \nof the plutonium rods to ensure they would not be used to develop \nweapons. Indeed, it helped prevent North Korea from having dozens of \nnuclear weapons by now.\n  One year ago, President Bush, in his State of the Union speech, \nreferred to North Korea as a member of the axis of evil for its \nrepressive and brutal actions against their own population. In that \nrespect the President was correct.\n  But we see now what the consequences of that speech are. Instead of \nspeaking softly and carrying a big stick, President Bush decided to \nspeak harshly without a coherent policy to back it up. Though this \npronouncement did not cause the North Koreans to begin their bad \nbehavior and cheat on their agreements--it certainly didn't cause them \nto start that bad behavior or cheat on their agreements with the United \nStates and the international community which, by the way, the North \nKoreans have now admitted--it did embolden them to harden their \nposition, to renounce the 1994 agreement and to begin in earnest to \nopenly pursue more nuclear weapons.\n  This is now the situation in which the Bush administration, by its \nown words, has painted our Nation into a very difficult corner.\n  U.S. policy regarding North Korea has been inconsistent. The \nPresident has demanded North Korea give up its nuclear weapons \nprograms, which is a good starting point. He said he wants to solve \nthis peacefully, through diplomatic means, but until this week--indeed, \nuntil day before yesterday--the President refused even to speak \ndirectly to the North Koreans. The administration has said it wanted to \nisolate North Korea, possibly with sanctions.\n  Look around the world. That option is opposed vehemently by the \ngovernments, friendly to us, of South Korea and Japan. Even China has \nstated its position, that it supports a non-nuclear Korean peninsula. \nYet the administration has scarcely engaged the Chinese in a meaningful \nway. We ought to be encouraging them to join us to stop the development \nof North Korean nuclear weapons.\n  Russia also needs to be included in these discussions. The lack of a \nclear strategy increases the risk of a volatile and destabilized \natmosphere in the face of a North Korean nuclear threat. This danger is \nunderscored by today's news that North Korea has announced its \nimmediate withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. U.S. \nleadership is needed for the world's declared nuclear powers to work \ntogether, perhaps through the United Nations, in a common response to \nthis immediate danger.\n  If we fail to do so, the nightmare scenario of North Korea selling \nits nuclear weapons to terrorist groups and other rogue states and \nother provocations could become a reality.\n  I welcome the President's belated decision to engage the North \nKoreans directly. I hope it has not come too late. I also hope that \nthese talks will be conducted at the highest possible levels. We must \nmake North Korea understand that the building of an arsenal of nuclear \nweapons will not be tolerated, and that all options to combat this \nthreat are on the table.\n  At the same time, we must work to form a viable, regional solution \nwith South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia. No policy that we pursue \ncan possibly work unless it is carried out in consultation with these \nkey countries. We must devise workable policy options that the United \nStates and North Korea may consider to de-escalate the situation \nimmediately. These talks must be substantive and be conducted in good \nfaith, which has been a consistent problem over the years with North \nKorea--but now the world is watching--immediately, now.\n  Finally, I hope that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold \nhearings on North Korea as soon as possible. Hearings should explore \nthe administration's detailed plans and policy prescriptions for this \ncrisis and\n\n[[Page S196]]\n\nits implications. I know Senators Lugar and Biden care a great deal \nabout this. I thank them for their leadership.\n  I call upon President Bush to stop sending mixed signals on this \nurgent matter. Consistency in policy and leadership is demanded in \nthese very hazardous and uncertain times. Then one day, maybe from the \nwindow of a future spacecraft--with a North Korea that has become a \npart of the world community of nations, a North Korea that reaches out \nin friendship to her neighbors--then maybe one day from the window of a \nfuture spacecraft on the night side of the Earth, we can look down and \nsee a North Korea joining a South Korea lit up like a glittering jewel \nshowing economic and political progress and freedom in that part of the \nworld.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to address this most important matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as long as I \nmay speak beyond 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to talk today about a subject that is \nvery much on our minds--the subject of North Korea and the threat North \nKorea poses to the entire world because of its development of weapons \nof mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, and the fact it is the \nworld's largest proliferator of those kinds of weapons.\n  Next week, Senator McCain and I will be introducing a bill called the \nNorth Korea Democracy Act of 2003. The purpose of this legislation is \nto establish American policy, from a congressional standpoint, that \nwill help us to move North Korea toward a more democratic regime and \nforego the development of these weapons of mass destruction and the \nproliferation of them as well as missiles throughout the world. As we \nare all very much aware, today, right now, North Korea is ruled by a \nleader and leaders who have cheated on agreements in the past not to \nproduce these weapons, and has really brought the world to the brink of \nmilitary conflict, and has removed itself from numerous agreements it \nhad earlier entered into, which have constrained its activities to \ndate.\n  As a result, the United States is presented with a challenge of what \nto do in North Korea that has a very short timeline on it, a challenge \nin which, as one pundit put it, ``the clock is ticking.'' Just as an \naside, we know we have to deal with countries such as Iraq as well. \nIraq is one of the fronts of the war on terror, and we are all aware of \nthe fact the President has been preparing for the potential for \nmilitary action should Saddam Hussein not comply with the U.N. \nresolutions that require him to come clean on his weapons of mass \ndestruction program and to dismantle those weapons.\n  The President has made it clear that while he is proceeding for those \npreparations with regard to Iraq, that he also understands the \nimportance of dealing with the problem of North Korea, because North \nKorea has nuclear weapons already, we believe, and because of its \nrecent actions, it could create more nuclear weapons quite quickly and, \nfrom our past understanding of North Korea's policies, could begin to \nsell those weapons to other countries.\n  To not put too fine a point on it, think about the prospects of \ndealing with a Libya or an Algeria or a Syria or a Sudan or a country \nsuch as these that bought a nuclear weapon from North Korea. It is a \nvery troubling prospect, indeed. Yet in a matter of months--not years, \nnot some time way down the line, but literally in a matter of a few \nmonths under the current program in which it is engaged--North Korea \ncould develop nuclear weapons and sell them to countries such as those \nI have mentioned. Of course, it could also sell a weapon to a terrorist \norganization, other than a state that sponsors terror.\n  This is, indeed, a troubling prospect, and that is why I say the \nclock is ticking. That is why it is important for the United States to \nhave a very firm policy, a very clear policy for dealing with this and \nfor the Congress to be engaged in the development of that policy; \nhence, the reason for the introduction of this legislation.\n  I will set the stage with what this threat is, what the U.S. policy \nhas been, what our current strategy is with respect to dealing with \nNorth Korea, and then I will describe in a little more detail the bill \nabout which I am talking.\n  The President has said that the centerpiece of our policy with \nrespect to North Korea is that it must promptly and verifiably \ndismantle its nuclear enrichment program. Of what exactly is the \nPresident speaking?\n  In the past, North Korea created a plutonium enrichment facility that \nproduced only 5 megawatts of electricity, so it was clearly not \nsomething to produce power for the country of North Korea--in fact, it \nrequires coal to operate--but was for producing fissionable material to \nput into nuclear weapons.\n  In 1994, North Korea agreed that it would no longer produce \nfissionable material from that facility and that it would not produce \nany other fissionable material. That plant was put into a standby mode, \nin effect, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, was \npermitted to install devices that would monitor the compliance of that \ncommitment, as well as people who were onsite to verify compliance.\n  In the interim, North Korea began to develop a uranium enrichment \nproject in deep underground facilities in North Korea. North Korea \nbegan this program and only recently 'fessed up to the fact that it had \nbeen engaging in this program for a long time.\n  It, too, is in violation of agreements that North Korea had entered \ninto, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or the NPT. North \nKorea today, I believe, announced it was, in fact, withdrawing from the \nNPT. It had been threatening to do so for some time. At the time it \ndeveloped this fissionable material, North Korea was a signatory to the \nNPT.\n  Throughout the last several years--and we do not know precisely how \nlong--North Korea had been developing a clandestine nuclear fissionable \nprogram with which to build nuclear weapons. We believe that as a \nresult of the previous program, as well as perhaps what might have been \ndeveloped in the uranium program, North Korea does, in fact, \npossess nuclear capability at this time. The exact number of weapons we \nbelieve they have is a classified number.\n\n  That is what the President was talking about when he said that North \nKorea must promptly and verifiably dismantle its nuclear enrichment \nprogram--both the plutonium enrichment program, which it has now \nrestarted, as well as the uranium fissile material program that it has \nrecently admitted to possessing.\n  I mentioned the NPT, but North Korea has also agreed in other fora to \nnot produce these kinds of weapons. Another agreement that it entered \ninto was the North-South Declaration on the Denuclearization of the \nKorean Peninsula.\n  It also in 1994, as part of what is referred to as the agreed \nframework with the United States, forsworn the development of any of \nthese nuclear weapons. There are actually four specific different \nagreements that North Korea is currently in violation of as a result of \nthese two nuclear programs with which it is engaged.\n  When we confronted the Koreans last September with the fact that we \nwere aware of the development of its uranium enrichment program, at \nthat point North Korean leaders threatened to pull out of the NPT and, \nas a result of that, the United States and the other nations that had \nbeen involved in the agreed framework on the Korean peninsula agreement \ndecided the violation of these accords could not be rewarded with \ncontinued sale or providing of heavy fuel oil or other products to \nNorth Korea, as a result of which the last shipment, I believe, went to \nNorth Korea in September or October.\n  That was part of the quid pro quo for North Korea forswearing these \nnuclear\n\n[[Page S197]]\n\nprograms. We said: We will build nuclear facilities for you; we will \nprovide you with fuel for your current facilities, including this heavy \nfuel oil; if you will continue to forswear those nuclear weapons, we \nwill continue to supply that material and that fuel to you.\n  Once they threatened to pull out of the NPT and agreed they were in \nviolation, we stopped those fuel oil shipments. That is what brought \nthe current controversy to a literal boiling point when the Korean \nleaders said they would pull out of the NPT ostensibly because we cut \noff the fuel shipments, and, of course, it was the other way around.\n  The question is what to do at this point with the North Korean \nleaders having not only threatened now to pull out of the NPT, but \nactually giving notice that they pulled out, and their admission they \nhave been in violation of these other agreements.\n  There have basically been three schools of thought. One school of \nthought is we should actually engage in a military attack on the \nplutonium facility which has been restarted by North Korea. Some people \nwho worked in the Clinton administration, and perhaps President \nClinton--I am not sure--actually said that was part of President \nClinton's threat against North Korea: That if they ever started that \nfacility again, we would bomb the facility. I do not know if that was \nconveyed to the North Koreans. I do not know whether we ever would have \ndone so.\n  The problem with military activity is that North Korea is a country \nthat today possesses a very large number of rockets and artillery \npieces, as well as missiles, all of which could very quickly, within a \nmatter of minutes, literally kill millions of people in the area of \nSeoul, Korea, only 30-some miles away from the DMZ.\n  It is a good example, by the way, of why, if we are going to have to \ndeal with Saddam Hussein, it is better to do it today when he does not \npose that kind of threat to us than tomorrow when he might, just as \nNorth Korea does today.\n  So, the military option, while probably not one that should be taken \noff the table, is one that is fraught with peril and difficulties. \nNorth Korea could very probably cause great destruction not only on \nSouth Korea, killing South Koreans and American servicemen, about \n37,000 of which are stationed in South Korea, but also, if they desire \nto do so, could strike Japan and possibly even Hawaii. Its missiles are \nthat well developed.\n  Because of that, the potential for military action, while it probably \nshould never be taken off the table because we do not know just how \nserious North Korea will be with its aggression, is not one most \nexperts believe should be threatened as a means of making North Korea \ncomply.\n  At the other end of the spectrum are those who say we should talk \nwith North Korea. There are two problems. One, it has been tried and \nfound to have failed. North Korea is willing to talk, but it is not \nwilling to make concessions or, if it does make concessions, it is not \nwilling to keep them. So talk alone is clearly, at least in my view, \nnot a solution to this problem. Originally, North Koreans said if you \nwill talk to us, then we can get a dialog going that will actually \nresult in our compliance with these agreements. But as soon as the \nSecretary of State hinted maybe the United States would talk, all of a \nsudden there are new conditions. As a matter of fact, it is reported in \nthe news media that the North Korean leaders said they were going to \npull out of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty today--unless we would \nresume fuel oil shipments to them.\n  This is the point. That is the way the North Koreans talk. They are \nalways bargaining. They will talk to you today if you will give them \nsomething today; otherwise, no dice. And the problem is you give it to \nthem and then even if they have made a commitment, we find they will \nbreak it. So the North Koreans are not exactly the kind of partners you \ncan rely upon and negotiate. For the same reason, we are not \nnegotiating with Saddam Hussein or the al-Qaida. We do not believe it \nis in our best interest to negotiate with the North Koreans. So talk \nalone will not solve the problem.\n  Somewhere in between military action and talk there has to be a \nsolution to this problem. As I pointed out, the clock is ticking. We do \nnot have a long time to wait. So even though the legislation I will be \ndescribing in a moment contains components that would gradually \npressure North Korea to become more democratic, to become more \npeaceful, to eschew its weapons of mass destruction and stop its \nnuclear program, the question is whether even this kind of approach can \ntake hold quickly enough to force North Korea to stop before it \ndevelops the nuclear weapons and gets them in somebody else's hands. \nThat is the real question.\n  So, even this middle ground, this third wave, as I call it, has the \npotential of not working if North Korea believes it can gain enough \ntime to build these nuclear weapons and sell them to somebody else or \nbuild them and threaten to do that as a way of extracting concessions \nfrom us. That is the problem. I don't want to get too specific about \nthe timing. I will say that in a matter of months, much less than a \nyear, North Korea could develop a number of nuclear weapons. That is \nthe kind of timeframe we are talking about.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I apologize for interrupting. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be recognized following the presentation by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a very \nwell thought-through op-ed piece called ``Don't Rule Out Force,'' \npenned by Dennis Ross, which appeared in today's Washington Post \nnewspaper.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 10, 2003]\n\n                          Don't Rule Out Force\n\n                            (By Dennis Ross)\n\n       Why is the Bush administration suggesting there is no \n     crisis in Korea? Is it because it doesn't want to be diverted \n     from taking on Saddam Hussein and, in effect prefers dealing \n     with each threat sequentially? Perhaps. But I suspect it has \n     less to do with Hussein than with what is clearly a weak set \n     of options.\n       True, it would not be easy to fight both North Korea and \n     Iraq at the same time. But even more to the point, North \n     Korea has formidable conventional military capabilities. If \n     the United States decided to bomb the nuclear processing \n     center in the Yongbyon complex, one could not rule out the \n     possibility that the North Koreans would react with a massive \n     attack against the South. They certainly want us to think \n     they would, and it would be irresponsible not to take this \n     threat seriously.\n       Does that argue for the administration's approach of \n     isolation and containment of North Korea? It might, if the \n     North Koreans were two or three years away from being able to \n     produce a half-dozen nuclear devices. But it's more likely \n     that they are only six months away, and that is not \n     sufficient time for the effects of isolation and containment \n     to work on Kim Jong Il. The price to North Korea in six \n     months will not be appreciably different from what it is \n     today. In six months North Korea will be in a position to \n     sell a nuclear device, and its record to date demonstrates \n     unmistakably that it will sell anything to anybody any time.\n       To put it simply, the clock is ticking. And paradoxically, \n     by publicly taking the military option off the table, the \n     United States is sending Kim Jong Il the message that he has \n     time. From his standpoint, that will permit him to become a \n     nuclear power, making him, in his eyes, a factor \n     internationally and requiring us to deal with him on his \n     terms.\n       He may, of course, be miscalculating. But even the Bush \n     administration's preferred strategy of isolation and \n     containment has no real support from those who would be \n     essential to making it work over time. Neither the South \n     Koreans nor the Chinese nor even the Russians seem to accept \n     it. Each country favors a policy of engagement. While South \n     Korea's desire to mediate the crisis is understandable, North \n     Korea will continue to use the South's fears to erode its \n     positions and to try to drive a wedge between Washington and \n     Seoul.\n       If we want diplomacy to stand a chance, we cannot divorce \n     it completely from possible military responses, and we must \n     look to those who actually do possess leverage given current \n     realities. Our readiness to use military force--alone if \n     necessary--has been essential to the administration's ability \n     to isolate Iraq and build a consensus on disarming it. By \n     taking the military option off the table in Korea, we not \n     only signal the North Koreans that they have time, but also \n     reduce the sense of urgency that might alter Chinese and \n     Russian behavior. And it is the Chinese and Russians who have \n     the greatest leverage on Kim Jong Il.\n       The Chinese provide half of North Korea's food and fuel \n     assistance. Russia's leverage stems less from what it \n     provides now, though\n\n[[Page S198]]\n\n     its economic ties are important to North Korea, than from the \n     relationship President Vladimir Putin has with Kim Jong Il. \n     He has feted him in Moscow and seems to take him seriously. \n     The North Korean leader clearly values his connection to \n     Putin.\n       While neither the Chinese nor the Russians are pleased with \n     North Korean behavior, their public reactions have been \n     tepid. (Moscow ``regrets'' the North Korean threat to \n     withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.)\n       Both the Russians and the Chinese would undoubtedly oppose \n     a U.S. military response. But if we want to mobilize more \n     vigorous action from them, those two countries have to become \n     seized with the seriousness of the moment. They have to \n     believe that the resumption of reprocessing is not acceptable \n     to us and could trigger a military reaction.\n       The purpose is not to make the military option inevitable \n     but to build the pressure to produce a diplomatic \n     alternative.\n       At the minimum, the administration must introduce greater \n     ambiguity into its posture. For example, it could make clear \n     that no option is being excluded, including military ones. \n     Similarly, without calling attention to it, we could also \n     build our naval presence in the area, something that would \n     please neither the Chinese nor the Russians. Should we feel \n     the need for more dramatic and extreme measures, the \n     administration could say that a continuing North Korean \n     capability to produce nuclear weapons is so threatening that \n     we would reserve the right to act militarily and would even \n     contemplate extending our nuclear umbrella to South Korea.\n       The goal would be to promote a greater sense of urgency, \n     without making an empty bluff or triggering worse North \n     Korean behavior. Making clear we have been left with no \n     choice but to consider the military option need not be done \n     in public, but it does need to be done if we are to persuade \n     the Russians and the Chinese to help us alter North Korean \n     behavior.\n       Neither the Russians nor the Chinese want a war on the \n     Korean peninsula; nor do they want the U.S. presence to be \n     expanded or the U.S. nuclear umbrella to be extended, making \n     us even more of the arbiter of Asian affairs. We have to play \n     on these fears, while making it clear that it is in the hands \n     of Russia and China to head off the very possibilities that \n     are so troubling to them.\n       The Russians, in particular, could organize a diplomatic \n     initiative that could finesse the administration's \n     unwillingness to ``negotiate'' with North Korea, while \n     creating the indirect engagement that will be necessary. In \n     this connection, Moscow could host a meeting of all the \n     interested parties: the United States, China, South Korea, \n     Japan and perhaps the European Union and the United Nations.\n       Ground rules for settling this crisis could be established, \n     with the clear understanding that North Korea's wishes will \n     not be addressed until Pyongyang is ready to stop its nuclear \n     program, subject all parts of its nuclear efforts to \n     intensive and continuing inspection and turn over all \n     existing spent fuel.\n       No doubt if the Russians were to present such demands to \n     North Korea, the North Koreans would seek to negotiate on \n     these conditions and what they might receive in return. \n     Provided the Russians knew clearly what our red lines were--\n     and convinced of our readiness to act military if necessary--\n     diplomacy might yet succeed.\n\n  Mr. KYL. The reason I do this at this point, Mr. President, Dennis \nRoss makes the point, and I think eloquently, that the administration \nshould not rule out force; that it ought to make it clear not only to \nNorth Korea but to North Korea's neighbors, Russia and China, that, of \ncourse, force is always an option; that there have to be some \nconsequences to an absolute refusal of North Korea to agree to abide by \nthe norms all the rest of us abide by, and to abide by the agreements \nit has entered into.\n  I hasten to point out neither Dennis Ross nor I are advocating the \nuse of force. He points out, and I reiterate the point, one would hope \nit would never come to that because the use of force against North \nKorea is fraught with the perils I discussed before.\n  But Ross makes the point, and I think it is a valid one, that without \nconsequences to failing to agree to be reasonable, it is unlikely North \nKorea will be reasonable. And more importantly, without that kind of a \npotential development, it may well be our allies in the region--the \nRussians and Chinese--who may also not be willing to put the kind of \npressure they can and should against North Korea to cause North Korea \nto back down.\n  So that is the reason why this kind of action by the United States \nshould not necessarily be ruled out, even with all of its potential \ndangers.\n  The reason I make this point is as follows: Talks can only succeed if \nwe change the circumstances on the ground today. As of right now, talks \nresult in promises by North Korea in exchange for fuel oil or food or \nwhatever to North Korea, and then they violate the agreements and we \nare left in a position of reacting to their violation. We have to \nchange that dynamic in some way so that North Korea feels some pressure \nto come to terms with its violations, some pressure to comply with the \ncommitments it has made, some pressure to begin to dismantle its \nnuclear programs. Without that kind of pressure, without something to \nlose by refusing to go along in our negotiations or violating the \nagreements they make, talk alone is not likely to change anything. We \nhave to change the circumstances.\n  How do we do that? That is where our legislation comes in. This \nlegislation would put into place several circumstances which we believe \nwould cause North Korea to more seriously consider negotiations as a \nmeans toward real, peaceful resolution of the dispute and real \ndisarmament of its nuclear facilities. But without these kinds of \npressures or conditions or circumstances, they are not likely to do so.\n  Let me briefly summarize the legislation. The first thing is to \nrecognize what the North Koreans themselves have said, but to make it \nofficial: That the agreed framework entered into 9 years ago has failed \nand is no longer extant and it related to a circumstance North Korea \nhas no longer permitted to exist and, as a result, the subsidization of \nNorth Korea called for under the agreement will cease; that they are \nnot going to continue to be supported by the United States under the \nagreed framework.\n  The second thing we do is prohibit the United States assistance to \nNorth Korea or the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization \nunder the agreed framework. This is designed, among other things, to \nhelp deny North Korea the funds, the hard currency it needs, to \ncontinuing the development of its nuclear program.\n  That is the third thing the act would do. It would reinstitute the \nsanctions that were previously in place and permit the President to \ninvoke new sanctions. In effect, what I have called for is a resolution \nsimilar to resolution 611 against Iraq. Same terms, prohibiting exports \nand imports, as a way of denying hard currency to a country to engage \nin illicit activity. In the case of North Korea, this is especially \nimportant. The biggest source of hard currency for North Korea is the \nillicit drug trade and the weaponry it sends to other countries.\n  Where do countries such as Iraq get Scud missiles? North Korea. Where \ndid Pakistan get some of its equipment? North Korea. Where do other \ncountries get weapons of mass destruction? North Korea.\n  If we impose sanctions that both prohibit the importation and the \nexportation of these items from North Korea, we can help to impose upon \ntheir regime an economic circumstance which might persuade them it is \nmore beneficial to talk and to make promises they intend to keep than \nto continue on their present course of action.\n  Another provision of the act would prohibit any nuclear cooperation \nagreement or type of nuclear interaction with North Korea unless and \nuntil the President made several determinations and sent them to the \nCongress and Congress approved of such an interaction or agreement by \ncongressional action.\n  We would also encourage the President to obtain multilateral \nsanctions including the blocking of remittances from ethnic Koreans to \nNorth Korea. That's the other source of hard currency, the remittances \nfrom North Koreans elsewhere in the world to their relatives in North \nKorea itself.\n  But with regard to multilateral activity here, it is interesting to \nme that probably the most significant pressure that could be put on \nNorth Korea to begin complying with its commitments would come from \nChina. China supplies approximately 80 percent of the fuel oil to North \nKorea. It provides over half of the food and fuel generally to North \nKorea. It has a long border with North Korea. It clearly would be \ncalled upon to help enforce sanctions if they were imposed. And it \nclearly would suffer, probably more than any other country, from any \nkind of nuclear explosion on the North Korean peninsula or any other \nexplosion in which poison gases or nerve agents or biological agents of \nsome kind were released from the atmosphere since the wind is \nprevailing south to north.\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\n  China has a great deal to lose from North Korea acquiring a nuclear \ncapability as well. In the first place, I don't think China wants other \ncountries in the region to have nuclear weapons. China has those \nweapons, but I don't think it wants Japan to acquire those weapons. I \ndon't think it would want South Korea or Taiwan to acquire nuclear \nweapons. I am not sure it would want the United States to extend its \nnuclear umbrella to South Korea, for example.\n  All of those things could happen if North Korea is permitted to \ndevelop nuclear weapons. It seems to me, therefore, it is very much in \nChina's interest to quietly, if that is the way they have to do it, but \nfirmly dissuade the North Koreans from progressing with its nuclear \ndevelopment program.\n  It is especially troublesome that very recently China has continued \nto supply North Korea with materiel and other assistance for the \nfurther development of North Korea's nuclear program. Again, without \ngoing into details, we are well aware of what China has been doing. The \nUnited States needs to come down very firmly against this kind of \nexport from China to North Korea. Not only do I think we should argue \nto China what we believe is in China's best interests, but in other \nways to exert what other kind of influence we can on China to stop this \nkind of activity and assist us working with the North Koreans to stop \ntheir program.\n  To some extent, arguments similar to that relate to Russia, although \nRussia is not as close to North Korea as are the Chinese. But in both \ncases, both Russia and China could assist us. One of the things our \nbill urges is the development of those multilateral kinds of agreements \nand actions that would stop North Korea from furthering its program.\n  We would also in this act do a variety of things which we think would \nhelp to put pressure on North Korea, in terms of democratization and in \nterms of liberalizing its country in general. For example, granting \nNorth Koreans refugee status in the United States, encouraging the \nexecutive branch to work with other countries to care for and resettle \nrefugees from North Korea and provide money for that purpose. We would \nrequire Radio Free Asia to increase its broadcasting to North Korea to \n24 hours a day and authorize whatever money is necessary to do that.\n  We also believe it is important for Congress to actually take \nmeasures, including military reinforcements, if that is called for, and \nenhanced defense exercises and other steps as determined appropriate to \nassure the highest level of deterrence against North Korea.\n\n  This is important for two reasons. First, there are those who called \non us to bring our troops home from South Korea and, frankly, the \ntemptation is great, when South Korean leaders basically talk about not \nwanting the United States in South Korea anymore, to do precisely that. \nWhy should we have our own troops there when they allegedly do not want \nus there? Unfortunately, that's a shortsighted way of looking at the \nproblem. If we are to put the pressure on North Korea to make dialog \nmeaningful, the third way I was talking about, to back it up with some \npotential action, then you do have to have a military presence and \ndemonstrate you mean it when you talk about the North Koreans needing \nto comply with their agreements. Therefore, it would be the wrong time \nto either remove our troops or suggest they are not prepared. Thus, the \nreason our bill calls for enhanced measures to ensure our deterrence in \nthat area.\n  What these provisions of the bill demonstrate is that there are a lot \nof alternatives in between just talk which, as I said, is cheap, and \nmilitary action, which is to be avoided at all costs here because of \nthe consequences of it. There are a lot of things we could be doing in \nbetween that. I have described in not very much detail what our bill \nprovides in that regard, to just demonstrate there are a lot of things \nwe could be doing to cut off its supply of hard currency, to isolate \nit, and to put pressure on North Korea to begin to comply with the \nagreements it has made in the past.\n  Some might say this is provocative. Frankly, I don't think it is very \nprovocative. It is certainly not as provocative as having to resort to \nmilitary force. It seems to me it is also not provocative to let the \nNorth Koreans know there are consequences to violating agreements they \nhave made with the rest of the world.\n  If we are not able to back up these agreements, then why ever have \nagreements in the first place? Why couldn't any country simply get out \nof the NPT and say, We didn't really mean it when we signed up? The \nUnited Nations charter itself--I have forgotten the exact chapters; I \nthink it is chapters 6 and 7--provides for the imposition of \ninternational norms of behavior in cases where the peace of the world \nis threatened by a particular country. That applies directly to North \nKorea in this case.\n  So we have the ability to act as an international group of nations, \nin addition to unilaterally in the case of the United States. But I \nwould also say to those who say this is dangerous and provocative, \nthat's the same thing people criticized Ronald Reagan for when he \ntalked about the Evil Empire, Russia. It was the pressure the United \nStates put on Russia in the latter stages of the Soviet Union, during \nwhich time the President not only built up our military to create a \nstrong deterrence to any military action by the Soviet Union but also \nbegan to expand our push for democratization and freedom in Eastern \nEurope and in the outlying areas of the Soviet empire.\n  Many think it was the combination of those factors that caused the \nSoviet Union to break up, the combination of a strong deterrence on our \npart, the peace-through-strength concept of Ronald Reagan, but also the \ndeclaration that it was an evil empire, the assistance to Lech Walesa, \nthe characterization of the country and all of the eastern satellite \ncountries of the Soviet Union as evil and nondemocratic and abusive of \nhuman rights, the Jackson-Vanik amendment. Those actions, over time, I \nbelieve, had a very salutary effect on the people in the Soviet Union \nand caused them to eventually conclude they could not confront the \ndemocratic nations of the world. As a result, Russia has been the \nproduct, fortunately for the people of Russia, of that kind of push.\n\n  I do not think you create a more dangerous or provocative situation \nhere. I think in the case of North Korea you begin to lay the \ngroundwork for the North Koreans to become a democratic society that \ncan actually take care of its people and not starve them to death and \nengage in the human rights abuses it has in the past.\n  Let me just quote something Ronald Reagan wrote to himself. This is \nin a book called ``Reagan's War.'' It is talking about the philosophy \nReagan had in dealing with the Soviet Union, but I think it is relevant \nto North Korea as well. In his diary the President wrote the following \nwith respect to a meeting that had been convened, an emergency meeting \nof the NSC. He jotted these notes to himself about his goal with \nrespect to Poland. He said:\n\n       I took a stand that this may be the last chance in our \n     lifetime to see a change in the Soviet empire's colonial \n     policy re Eastern Europe. We should take a stand and tell \n     them unless and until martial law is lifted in Poland, the \n     prisoners were released and negotiations resumed between \n     Walesa and the Polish government, we would quarantine the \n     Soviets and Poland with no trade or communications across \n     their borders. Also tell our NATO allies and others to join \n     us in such sanctions or risk an estrangement from us.\n\n  Bearing in mind that all know what the result of President Reagan's \npolicies were, I think that is the same philosophy that should animate \nour policy today toward North Korea. We should not be seen as \nvacillating. Some have characterized the administration as vacillating.\n  We should be sure the positions we are taking are clear-cut, firm, \nand no one can mistake what our intentions are, as the first step. \nSecond, we should adhere to the President's policy of forcing North \nKorea to promptly and verifiably dismantle its nuclear enrichment \nprogram. And third, Congress can play a role in this by enacting \nlegislation of the kind I have described that would not only create the \nconditions for more democratization in the country by granting refugee \nstatus to political refugees, broadcasting into North Korea the message \nof freedom to its people, but also squeezing economically the military \nleaders of the country to deny them the hard currency they are \ncurrently using to build up this nuclear capability, to prevent them \nfrom exporting these weapons of mass destruction to other countries.\n\n[[Page S200]]\n\n  Just as a final point, such an export limitation or quarantine as \npart of the sanctions that could be imposed here would not only deny \nthe economic reward to the North Koreans from the production of this \nmaterial, but it could result in an interdiction of such material if in \nfact they are going to try to send it some place else. Remember that \nshipment from North Korea that was recently intercepted going into \nYemen. This kind of sale of weapons of mass destruction by North Korea, \ntherefore, if interdicted, would not only deny the country the hard \ncurrency that it uses for its nuclear program but perhaps ultimately \nmore importantly would prevent this kind of equipment from getting into \nthe hands of terrorists or terrorist nations that mean us harm.\n  This is the approach we believe is appropriate for the United States \nto take. Neither military action nor just plain talk, but a dialog \nbacked up by firm, positive, constructive actions on the part of the \nUnited States would put a lot of pressure on North Korea and would \nhopefully bring countries such as China and Russia along with us to \nhelp us put pressure on North Korea to cause it to come to meaningful \nagreement with the United States that is verifiable and that would \nresult in peace in the region and the dismantlement of dangerous \nnuclear weapons they have been building.\n  We will be introducing this legislation next week. I appreciate the \nsupport Senator McCain has provided in putting this legislation \ntogether, and I look forward to visiting with my colleagues and getting \nsponsorship of the legislation with an early commitment to get it \npassed by this body and sent on to the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S200-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S200-S201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HIGH-SPEED PURSUITS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in this morning's Los Angeles Times there \nwas a story headlined ``Border Pursuit Crash Kills Two, Hurts \nThirteen''.\n  The paper reported that 2 women were killed and 13 people were \ninjured--7 of them critically--when a pickup truck full of suspected \nillegal immigrants overturned, after a pursuit by the Border Patrol. \nThe 15-year-old truck was packed with people huddled under a tarp as it \nsped west on Interstate 8.\n  That pickup truck apparently smashed into a guardrail and overturned \nsending bodies tumbling down an embankment. According to the California \nHighway Patrol, two women were pronounced dead at the scene 20 miles \nnorth of the U.S.-Mexican border. Seven victims were taken to local \nhospitals in critical condition, and six other people with minor to \nmoderate injuries.\n  The issue of high-speed pursuit by law enforcement officials is not \nnew. In fact, on Tuesday of this week, the Los Angeles Police \nDepartment announced that they were severely restricting circumstances \nin which officers could engage in high-speed pursuits, following a \nseries of deadly crashes in that city involving fleeing vehicles.\n  Los Angeles has become known as the car chase capital of the world. \nWe have all seen the helicopters following police chases on live \ntelevision. In 2001, the Los Angeles Police Department launched 781 \npursuits. One-hundred and thirty-nine people were injured. Six people \ndied in those pursuits. Fifty-nine percent of the police pursuits in \nLos Angeles resulted from minor traffic infractions.\n  According to the Border Patrol, in 1996, 8 illegal immigrants were \nkilled and 19 were injured when their vehicle tumbled into a ditch as \npart of a high-speed pursuit by the Border Patrol. There is a list of \nsuch cases.\n  Look, this is not the fault of law enforcement officials. It is the \nfault of the people who are fleeing law enforcement officials. But we \nought to have policies and training on high-speed pursuits, to make \nsure pursuit is appropriate. In cases where we have minor infractions, \nin cases where there is no imminent danger, we ought not have chases at \n60-, 80-, or 100-mile miles per hour, in which innocent people get \nkilled.\n  Today I am writing to the head of the Border Patrol asking for an \ninvestigation into what happened yesterday. I want to understand what \nkind of pursuit policies the Border Patrol uses, and what kind of \npursuit policies and training they have.\n  This is happening too often. I think more law enforcement ought to \nfollow the model of Los Angeles.\n  I have a personal interest in this issue. My mother was killed in a \nhigh-speed police chase. She was driving home from a hospital one night \nabout 9 o'clock in the evening on a quiet street in Bismark, ND. A \ncouple of drunks driving a pickup truck fishtailed. Witnesses said the \npolice were chasing them at 80 to 100 miles an hour, down a city street \nin Bismark, ND. There was a crash. My mother was an innocent victim.\n  Three-hundred to four-hundred people a year in this country suffer \nthat fate; some say up to 1,000.\n  This is not some mysterious illness for which we don't know a cure. \nWe understand what causes the death of innocent people with respect to \npolice pursuits. We understand how to stop it.\n  I believe if there is a bank robbery and guns are blazing and a \ngetaway car is moving, the police ought to chase and ought to pursue \nbecause they have no choice. The public is desperately endangered in \nthat circumstance. But such chases are inappropriate in many other \ncircumstances.\n\n  I have spent a lot of time on this issue in recent years. I remember \ntalking to a county sheriff in North Dakota about this issue. He said: \nJust last week we had a police pursuit. We started this pursuit, and \none of my deputies saw someone horribly drunk weaving all over the \nroad. He began immediately to apprehend this person. The person took \noff at a high rate of speed, and my deputy saw two little children in \nthe backseat of that car and immediately disengaged. We got the license \nnumber. We didn't chase. We arrested that person about 3 hours later \nand those children were safe.\n  If they had not made that judgment call, perhaps that would have \nresulted in a car crash and the death of those children.\n  I mentioned my family's acquaintance with this issue in a deadly way. \nHere are some other examples, which occurred recently in Los Angeles. \nIn March of 2002, Henry and Anna Polivoda, 79 and 76 years old, were \nstruck and killed by a fleeing suspect in a pursuit that began over a \ncar registration. Henry and Anna were Holocaust survivors, but they \ncouldn't survive a high-speed pursuit on a city street. They were \ninnocent victims of that pursuit.\n  A couple of months after that, a 4-year-old girl was killed when an \nauto theft suspect ran a red light on a busy downtown street, causing a \nchain reaction that knocked over a traffic light, killing the girl.\n  This goes on and on and on.\n  Yesterday's incident is one I know very little about--only that which \nI read in the newspaper. Of course, it brought back to me some very sad \nmemories.\n  I know that those who were attempting to smuggle illegal immigrants \ninto this country yesterday are ultimately at fault. I know those \nsmugglers who decided not to stop when the Border Patrol tried to \napprehend them are at fault.\n  But I also know this requires us, once again, to review when it is \nappropriate for us to engage in high-speed police pursuits and when it \nis inappropriate.\n  I have undying admiration for the work law enforcement officers do \nevery day and every night. While we lie safely in our beds at night, \nthere are people patrolling our streets and keeping us safe. They \ndeserve our enormous admiration for the work they do. It is dangerous \nand difficult.\n  But I only ask this: How many more crashes, how many more deaths will \nit take for this country--all of us--to decide that in some \ncircumstances it is inappropriate for law enforcement to engage in \nhigh-speed chases?\n  I know a city police chief from a southern State. His daughter is \ndead as a result of a high-speed police chase. Now, this is a police \nchief. This is a law enforcement official. His daughter was killed in a \nchase that occurred as a result of a broken taillight. That broken \ntaillight was a cause for law enforcement to want to stop the vehicle. \nThe vehicle did not stop. It took off at a high rate of speed. Because \nof that broken taillight, the police pursued, and\n\n[[Page S201]]\n\nthe police chief's daughter was killed--an innocent bystander at an \nintersection down the road.\n  And it is always the innocent bystander who is killed. The drunk \ndriver who killed my mother had almost no injuries, as is almost always \nthe case with drunks. He was fleeing from the police. It was his fault. \nBut in the circumstance I described with my mother, in that community, \nthey did not have the kind of training I think they needed with respect \nto police pursuit. I think that is the case in many communities around \nthe country.\n  Today, I say to the police chief in Los Angeles: Good for you. Thanks \nfor the announcement you made on Tuesday, to decide to restrict police \npursuit and high-speed chases to circumstances where they are \nessential.\n  We do not need to be entertained on a television network by having a \nhelicopter following a chase. That ought not be what entertains the \nAmerican people. Police chases are appropriate and necessary in certain \ncircumstances. But in other circumstances they are killing innocent \nAmericans.\n  So what I wanted to say today is this: There have been too many \nexamples with the Border Patrol of high-speed pursuits in which people \nare being killed, especially on Interstate 8. I think it is time for us \nto take a look at what is going on. I am going to ask the head of the \nBorder Patrol to investigate this and report to us exactly what \nhappened.\n  I want the head of the Border Patrol, and all other Federal law \nenforcement authorities, to tell us about their policies and training \nwith respect to high-speed law enforcement pursuit.\n  I am not suggesting they should not be able to pursue; I am saying \nthey need training and policies that determine when it is appropriate \nand when it is not.\n  Mr. President, this is always a painful subject for me. I have been \ndealing with it for a long while.\n  There are of course many others who have also been dealing with this. \nThere was a wonderful woman in the State of Wyoming who lost a loved \none to a high-speed police pursuit. She created a national organization \ncalled STOP, to deal with the problem. She and many other people who \nsuffered and whose loved ones suffered as a result of being on the \nwrong end of a police pursuit--an innocent victim--tried very hard to \nmake progress in requiring uniform policies and uniform training in \nthis area. I am sorry to say that she died of cancer some while ago.\n  I hope we will make more progress than we have in the past. We have \nmade some progress in some areas, but not nearly enough. Yesterday's \nincident--this morning's news--I think reflects that once again.\n  I do not come here assigning blame with respect to the incident \nyesterday. Clearly, the ultimate blame lies with the smugglers who \ndecided not to stop when law enforcement authorities tried to apprehend \nthem. But I want to know if perhaps policies which allow chases in \ncertain circumstances are also contributing to the death of innocent \npeople. If that is the case, we need to ask law enforcement to better \ntrain their officers, and create better policies.\n  So I will send a letter today and call the head of the Border Patrol \nand ask for this investigation. I will share with my colleagues the \nresults of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe we are in morning business \nwith Senators allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S201-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S201-S202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senators \nKyl and McCain for the introduction of the legislation to cause us to \nconfront the unacceptable behavior of North Korea. That is a situation \nthat is dangerous. It is a situation that has gotten out of hand, for a \nnumber of reasons; one of which is, over the years, through bad \nbehavior, North Korea has obtained what they consider to be benefits as \na result of misbehaving, violating world standards. As a result of \nthat, I think they have been encouraged, in a way, to continue that \nmisbehavior. So we need to change that cycle.\n  I have not studied the legislation completely, but it strikes me as a \ngood step in sending a message that this Congress and this country will \nnot continue to reward bad behavior.\n  This time last year--maybe just about this time--I was in Korea, and \nI went just across the DMZ, as you can do, in that building that splits \nthe boundary line, and actually had a few minutes in North Korea. It is \na remarkable situation in so many ways.\n  South Korea is one of the most booming economies in the world. \nBuildings are going up everywhere. Interstates with cloverleafs are all \naround Seoul. We flew all over the country in helicopters, visiting our \nmilitary bases and air bases. And you could see it so clearly. There \nare traffic jams. People are well dressed. They are healthy. They are \nindustrious. They are highly educated and doing very well.\n  In fact, while I was there I had an opportunity to meet with a number \nof Korean business leaders and to ask them to invest $1 billion in the \ncreation of a world class automobile plant in Alabama. They were \nconsidering several locations in the United States. They chose to take \nthe wealth they have created--through a free market, a free country, \nwith technology and science and education--and expand their capacity to \nproduce world class automobiles. And Hyundai expects to be one of the \ntop five automobile manufacturers in the world in the next several \nyears.\n  Just north of that DMZ, less than--what?--50 miles from Seoul, Korea, \nis the North Korean countryside. The people of North Korea are \nsuffering the most terrible privations. Starvation is all about. This \ncountry is unable to feed its own people.\n  But what do they do well? They have a good military, which they spend \nmillions and millions of dollars on. They have a State police system \nthat oppresses the people to a degree that is almost unsurpassed in the \nworld's history.\n  I asked one of the American officials at the Embassy: Why don't we do \nmore to send in Radio-Free-Europe-type messages to the people? Let's \nsend in a ``Radio-Free North Korea,'' as Senator Kyl proposes in this \nlegislation. And he said: Well, it's much more difficult than you \nthink. For example, the TV sets the people can obtain, have only three \nchannels, and all of those channels are full-time government channels. \nThus, one can't send in a television message. And they asserted there \nare similar problems even with radios in North Korea.\n  This is a nation that has suffered the most oppression of almost any \nnation I can name. Their oppression is as systematic and as deliberate \nas one can imagine. And the results are so stark, so dramatic.\n  Many people have seen the famous and stunning photograph of the \nKorean peninsula at night. In it, you can see the DMZ. You can also see \nsouth of the demilitarized zone into South Korea.\n  There are lights everywhere in South Korea. You can see into China \nand there are lights everywhere, but North Korea is just dark, without \nelectricity, without lights, for the people. How long does this \ncontinue? What plan do we have to try to change this situation?\n  The President has expressed concern about it. From the world leaders \nand the Europeans and others who like to be engaged in these issues, do \nI hear sufficient outrage as to the moral unacceptability of what is \noccurring in this country? If there is any decency, if there is any \nconcern for fellow human beings anywhere in the world, we ought to be \noutraged by what is happening to the good people of North Korea who \nhave little if any chance to free themselves from this oppression.\n  They say we have to send aid and food and other things or else the \ncountry might implode. We know people are dying now. We know the \npopulation of North Korea is shrinking. We know the population of North \nKorea has fallen to probably half that of the population in South Korea \nand just in the last 20 years. How much worse could an implosion be? \nWhat should we think and how should we analyze this situation?\n  I will have more to say about it, but any humane, forward-looking \nforeign policy ought to consider what we can do to change the \nfundamental nature of the Government in North Korea. It is oppressing \nits people to an extraordinary degree. Through threats and\n\n[[Page S202]]\n\nbluster, we have been allowing North Korea to obtain benefits pursuant \nto agreements. Now they have admitted before the entire world, flat \nout, that the benefits they have been receiving pursuant to the \nagreement with the United States and the Clinton administration were \nbuilt on a lie, that they were, in fact, in violation of the very \nagreement they signed.\n  The Economist magazine had an interesting piece recently that said, \nyes, agreements are good in the world. Multilateral agreements are \ngood. Bilateral agreements are good. Peace agreements are good. But \nthey said this: What happens when the country doesn't abide by it? What \nhappens when they say they are going to do something and just don't do \nit? If there are no consequences for their failure to comply with \nsolemn agreements that they have made, presumably for the good of the \nregion and the world and their own nation, then what is going to occur \nhere? Are we not creating a circumstance where a country may conclude \nthat they may, indeed, gain by a lie, gain by cheating, gain by \nthreatening and destabilizing and selling weapons around the world?\n  We need to reexamine our policy. We need to understand that this is \nnot a normal regime in North Korea. This is an abnormal regime of the \nworst kind. It is hurting its own people more than anything else. It is \nthreatening the stability of that region and the world. Something needs \nto be done about it. We cannot continue to ignore it.\n  One thing we cannot do, we cannot expect to sign an agreement with \nthem and expect it to be honored because their history is not to honor \nagreements.\n  I support the legislation. We need to do something such as this and \nmove it forward. We need to strengthen our relationship with South \nKorea. They have so much to offer to the world. We need to do what we \ncan to change that regime in North Korea that is so unhealthy, a regime \nthat is doing so much damage and threatening the stability and safety \nand security of the world.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S202-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Hugo Cesar ``Bibi'' Barajas was found dead from \nmultiple gunshot wounds to the neck, arm, and chest near a club that \ncaters to the gay and transgender community.

Mr. President, since 1994, the U.S. Government has \nprovided tactical aerial intelligence assistance to the Government of \nPeru, to help it stop the shipment of illegal drugs across its borders.\n  U.S. surveillance aircraft owned by the Defense Department and \noperated by contractors employed by the Central Intelligence Agency are \ntasked to locate potential drug flights, which Peruvian military jets \nthen intercept. Occasionally, the Peruvian military has shot down those \naircraft.\n  Unfortunately, the mistaken shoot-down on April 20, 2001, of a \ncivilian missionary aircraft resulting in the deaths of two innocent \nAmericans, including a young child, and the wounding of the pilot, \nrevealed serious deficiencies in the procedures governing this program.\n  After a thorough investigation and revision of the procedures, the \nState Department has recommended that this program be reinstated in \nColumbia, and it is anticipated that it may also resume at some point \nin Peru.\n  I understand the motivation for this program is to stop the shipment \nof illegal drugs. That is a goal we all share, and we are spending \nhundreds of millions of dollars each year in the Andes to do so. \nHowever, a policy of shooting down civilian aircraft in such \ncircumstances would not be lawful in the United States, and I am \nconcerned that the foreign pilots are performing the role of \nprosecutor, jury and executioner, even when there may be no cause for \nself-defense and no proof that the operators of the targeted aircraft \nhave broken any law.\n  This policy, in essence, presumed any civilian aircraft in drug-\nproducing areas to be guilty unless proven innocent, and permitted the \nuse of deadly force when there was only the suspicion of involvement of \nsmuggling drugs.\n  I have read a report issued by the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence in October of 2001, which describes the serious flaws in \nthe aerial interdiction program in the Andean countries. I agree with \nmany of the report's findings. The Intelligence Committee report I \nrefer to was commissioned specifically to investigate the April 20, \n2001 incident in Peru.\n  Despite the appearance of legitimacy, the missionary plane was \nsingled out by a U.S. surveillance jet as a possible drug smuggling \nflight. The U.S. surveillance aircraft was participating in the joint \nU.S.-Peru counter-drug aerial interdiction program. The surveillance \njet tracked the path of the missionary flight and a Peruvian military \njet responded.\n  A confused and ultimately unsuccessful effort was made by Peruvian \nmilitary and Peruvian civilian authorities to identify the missionary \nplane and to surmise the intentions of its crew, all of which are \nmandated by the standard operating procedures that govern operation of \nthe aerial interdiction program.\n  That information was available to the Peruvian authorities. But due \nto the lack of access to records of flight plans kept by Peruvian \naviation authorities; the failure of a Peruvian officer to check a list \nof aircraft tail numbers that would have identified the missionary \nplane as a legitimately owned and operated aircraft; and inefficient \ncommunications between the aircraft involved and ground personnel, a \npresumption of guilt, without supporting evidence, led to this \navoidable tragedy.\n  This incident is a glaring example of the dire consequences resulting \nfrom attempts by law enforcement and military agencies to take the \nplace of prosecutors and courts to mete out justice to suspected \ncriminals.\n  I am sympathetic to the motivations for this policy. But absent an \nimminent, serious threat to human health or safety, I do not believe \nthat deadly force of this type should be used against civilian \naircraft. While I hope I am proven wrong, I worry that the new \nprocedures, while well-intentioned, may not be adequate to prevent \nanother tragic mistake. I am also concerned that we risk providing \nother countries with an excuse to shoot down civilian aircraft over \ntheir territory, whether to stop illegal drugs or for some completely \ndifferent reason which they may deem to be legitimate.\n  I urge the administration to reconsider this policy. Yes, we want to \nstop drugs. Yes, we want to conduct aerial surveillance of suspected \naircraft. But shooting civilian aircraft out of the sky, when there is \nno cause for self-defense, no imminent threat to innocent life, and not \neven proof of illegality, I believe goes too far. We have seen what can \nhappen. Let us not repeat that mistake.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S203-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S203]]\n                 THE TRUTH IN TUNA LABELING ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Truth in \nTuna Labeling Act of 2003. This act would amend the Dolphin Protection \nConsumer Information Act by reinstating an important consumer provision \nthat had been a part of U.S. law since 1990. The provision in this bill \nwould ensure our consumers that tuna fish sold in the United States \nthat is labeled ``dolphin safe'' in fact was caught in a way that will \nnot harm dolphins.\n  My colleague Senator Boxer and I believe that restoring the original \n``dolphin-safe'' standard is necessary after a recent--and surprising--\ndecision by the Secretary of Commerce that would now allow tuna caught \nby chasing and encircling dolphins to be deemed ``safe'' for dolphins.\n  The ``dolphin safe'' label came about as an entirely voluntary \nconsumer label. It was created in reaction to public outrage about \nfishing methods specific to the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, ETP, \nwhere dolphins that swim with schools of yellowfin tuna were \nintentionally encircled by purse seine tuna vessels and killed in \nfishing operations. Hundreds of thousands of dolphins died as a result \nof this practice over the years. A massive consumer boycott of tuna was \nlaunched. The U.S. tuna industry stepped up to the plate and \nvoluntarily committed to abandon this ``encirclement'' practice. This \ncommitment is what the 1990 ``dolphin safe'' labeling provision \nrecognized. Since that time, the U.S. fishing fleet has not used the \nencirclement method, and has stopped fishing in the ETP entirely.\n  In 1997, the act was amended after conclusion of an international \ndolphin protection agreement among many ETP tuna fishing nations. The \nchange would allow the Secretary of Commerce to consider whether a \nmodified encirclement method could qualify for the dolphin safe label. \nBut, there were those who strongly questioned that any encirclement \nmethod could be safe, and a condition of agreeing to this charge was \nthat there would be a scientific study to ensure there would be no \nadverse impact on the dolphin populations. The amended law directed the \nSecretary of Commerce to make his decision based on the scientific \nstudy.\n  The deadline for making this decision came at the end of last year. \nThe Secretary had to find that encirclement had no significant impact \non dolphins in order to change the standard to allow tuna caught by \nthis method to call itself ``dolphin safe.'' Well, the National Marine \nFisheries Service study found that:\n\n     concerns remains that the practice of chasing and encircling \n     dolphins somehow is adversely affecting the ability of \n     depleted stocks [of dolphins in the eastern Tropical Pacific] \n     to recover.\n\n  Yet, on December 31, 2002, the Secretary of Commerce made a \nremarkable finding, saying that despite these stated scientific \nconcerns about chasing and encircling dolphins, there would be ``no \nsignificant adverse impact'' on dolphin populations. As a result, they \nweakened the labeling standard, allowing tuna caught by encircling and \nchasing dolphins to be sold as ``dolphin safe.'' Mr. President, this \ndecision did not follow the intent of Congress, which was to base this \ndecision on the science alone. I was particularly concerned about a \nreport in the New York Times this week that scientific studies on \ndolphin stress were discontinued by NMFS due to political pressure on \nthis very issue. I hope and trust that is not the case, and I am sure \nwe will get to the bottom of this in Committee hearings. But until \nthese scientific questions are sorted out, we need to restore the \nstandard that was in place prior to the decision.\n\n  My own interest in this issue has always been threefold: to ensure \nsound conservation of marine mammals, to provide consumers with the \ninformation they need when purchasing tuna, and ensure U.S. tuna \nfishermen a level playing field on which to compete. This bill is \nconsistent with this philosophy. It sets forth an even-handed measure \nthat gives consumers the straight story. In addition, any country can \nexport tuna to the United States. But to get a specially authorized \n``dolphin safe'' label on the can, they must fish in a dolphin safe \nway. Quite simply, anyone who wants to use the specific ``dolphin \nsafe'' label needs to follow the same standards. That's as fair as you \ncan get.\n  I understand that there may be additional ways we can help restore \nthe dolphin populations of the ETP, including through international \naction, and I look forward to discussing those ideas. But this is a \nsimple provision that we can surely all agree upon. It says if you want \nto label your tuna ``dolphin safe,'' you can't harm dolphins. The \nAmerican consumer wants and deserves clarity when they purchase tuna. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to ensure we get to that \nresult.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S203-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S203-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S203-4", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill and joint resolution were read the second time, \nand placed on the calendar:\n\n       H.R. 16.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend \nloan forgiveness for certain loans to Head Start teachers; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Voinovich to \nintroduce legislation to expand the Federal loan forgiveness program to \ninclude Head Start teachers and administrators.\n  Nationwide, only 22 percent of Head Start teachers have completed a \nbaccalaureate or advanced degree program. In California, that number is \neven smaller: about 16 percent of Head Start teachers have completed a \nbachelor's degree.\n  A survey completed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices in June 2000 called the Head Start Family and Child \nExperiences Survey, FACES, found a strong relationship between the \neducation of the Head Start teacher and classroom quality. ``Teachers \nwith higher education levels were found to be more sensitive and \nresponsive to their children, to have more high quality language \nactivities, and more creative activities in their classrooms.''\n  Teachers with higher levels of education also had classes with more \nhigh quality language activities such as reading books to the children \nand provided more opportunities for children to develop skills in \nexpressing thoughts.\n  Equally important, teachers with higher levels of education were \nfound to be more responsive and sensitive to the children in their \nclasses.\n  Head Start is one of the most important Federal programs because it \nhas the potential to reach children early in their formative years when \ntheir cognitive skills are just developing.\n  We know that poor children disproportionately start school behind \ntheir peers, they are less likely to count to 10 or to recite the \nalphabet.\n  Providing low-income children with access to programs that encourage \ncognitive learning and prepare them to enter school ready to learn is \nimportant.\n  Head Start is one example of a Federal program that has the potential \nto reach every low-income child; to help every eligible child learn to \ncount to ten and begin to recite the alphabet.\n  Many of our Nation's youngsters, however, enter elementary school \nwithout the basic skills necessary to succeed. Often these children lag \nbehind their peers throughout their academic career.\n  As taxpayers, we will spend millions on efforts to help these \nchildren catch up. Many of these children will never catch up.\n  Several studies confirm the importance of providing low-income \nchildren with the opportunity early on to gain basic cognitive skills: \na study conducted on a preschool program in Chicago showed that for \nevery dollar invested, $8 was saved by society in projected costs. \nAdditionally, 26 percent more children were likely to finish high \nschool and 40 percent were less likely to repeat a grade.\n  The National Head Start Association found that for every dollar \ninvested in Head Start, at least $2.50 is saved because these \nchildren need less remedial education and are less likely to be on \nwelfare programs or involved with the juvenile justice system that non-\nHead Start peers.\n\n  The Rand Corporation found that for every dollar invested in early \nchildhood learning programs, taxpayers save between $4 and $7 later by \nreducing the need for alcohol and drug treatment programs, special \neducation programs, mental health services, and the likelihood of \nincarceration.\n  We can save millions by providing low-income children with access to \nquality preschool where they will gain the necessary skills to succeed \nin school and life.\n  In order to give every child a head start in life, we must continue \nto recruit qualified teachers to the Head Start field who have \ndemonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, early \nchildhood development, and other areas of the preschool curriculum with \na particular focus on cognition learning.\n  Obtaining and maintaining teachers with such qualifications is the \nonly way to jump-start cognition learning and to ensure that our \nyoungsters start elementary school ready to learn.\n  In 2000, the Head Start 2010 National Advisory Panel presided over \nfifteen national hearings and open forums. The panel found: ``There was \na tremendous amount of testimony about the fact that, despite increases \nresulting from Federal quality set-aside funding, relatively low \nsalaries and poor or non-existent benefits make it difficult to attract \nand retain qualified staff over the long term.\n  Witnesses stated that many staff positions remain vacant and turnover \nis likely to worsen if compensation does not improve significantly . . \n. comments included passionate exhortations for greater investment in \nstaff, observing that, in Head Start . . . the quality of the program \nis tied directly to the quality of the staff.''\n  Many Head Start programs in California are losing qualified teachers \nto local school districts in part because the pay is better, \nnationally, the average Head Start teacher made $20,700 in 2000 \ncompared to $40,575 for an elementary and secondary school teacher.\n  Head Start teachers are making half of that elementary and secondary \nteachers are paid on average.\n  Low pay, combined with mounting student loan debt, is a real \ndeterrent to getting college graduates to become Head Start teachers.\n  And every teacher Head Start loses impacts access to services for our \nNation's youngsters.\n  Today, there are no educational requirements for a Head Start teacher \nother than a child development associate CDA, credential, requiring 24 \nearly child education credits and 16 general education credits.\n  By 2003, 50 percent of Head Start teachers will be required to have \nat minimum an associate or 2-year degree.\n  Following the recommendation of the Head Start 2010 National Advisory \nPanel, I believe we must elevate the compensation to attract and retain \nqualified individuals to commit to long-term careers in Head Start.\n  The loan forgiveness incentives in this bill are meant to encourage \nrecent graduates, current Head Start teachers without a degree, and \ncollege students to enter and remain in the Head Start field. In \nexchange for 5 years of service, a Head Start teacher administrator \ncould receive up to $5,000 of the Federal Stafford Loan forgiven.\n  I believe we must continue to improve the Head Start program such \nthat children leave the program able to count to ten, to recognize \nsizes and colors, and can begin to recite the alphabet, to name a few \nindicators of cognitive learning.\n  This is just the first step.

Mr. President, I rise today to again join my friend \nand colleague, Senator Feinstein, to reintroduce legislation which will \nencourage young teachers to go into early childhood education, \nencourage further learning and credentialing of early learning \neducators, and lead to better education for our Nation's youngest \nchildren.\n  There is no more important time in a child's life than their earliest \nyears. Scientific research tells us that babies are born with 100 \nbillion neurons, or brain cells, that are waiting to make connections, \nor synapses, with one another. These synapses empower the brain and \ndictate healthy development and future learning. By the time a baby is \nthree, 1,000 trillion connections have been made, twice as many \nsynapses as most adults have.\n  However, at age 11, children start eliminating those brain \nconnections that have not been used, thus decreasing their potential \nfor learning and development.\n  To maximize their learning potential, we must begin to teach our \nchildren the necessary skills before they reach kindergarten. \nResearchers have found that focusing on these earliest years can make \nthe greatest difference in a child's development and learning, and I \nknow of few other programs that provide the same focus as Head Start.\n  Our bill, the Loan Forgiveness for Head Start Teachers Act of 2003, \nis designed to encourage currently enrolled and incoming college \nstudents working on a Bachelor's or a Master's degree to pursue a \ncareer as a Head Start teacher. In exchange for a 5-year teaching \ncommitment in a qualified Head Start program, a college graduate with a \nminimum of a bachelor's degree could receive up to $5,000 in \nforgiveness for their Federal Stafford student loan.\n  I was pleased that in the 107th Congress, during debate over the No \nChild Left Behind Act of 2001, this bill was offered as an amendment \nand was overwhelmingly passed by the Senate. Unfortunately, the \namendment was not included in the final version of the No Child Left \nBehind Act. However, the support our bill received in the Senate gives \nme great hope that this legislation will be enacted in the 108th \nCongress.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, we invested heavily in Head Start so \nthat there was room for every eligible child in Ohio. Because of our \nefforts, Ohio is 4th in the nation in terms of children served by Head \nStart with nearly 38,000 students served in the year 2000.\n  I have carried my passion for early childhood education with me to \nthe U.S. Senate. I continue to believe that it is absolutely critical \nthat we do more to help our young people prepare to begin school and it \nis why I was pleased to work with Senators Jeffords and Stevens to help \npass the Early Learning Opportunities Act of 2000. Still, we must now \ndo more to help those teachers who educate our youngest children.\n  The results of a survey undertaken by the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services over the past two years has shown a significant \ncorrelation between the quality of education a child receives and the \namount of education that child's teacher possesses. That is, the more \neducation a teacher has, the more effectively they teach their students \ncognitive skills, and the more likely that students are to act upon \nthose skills.\n  Current Federal law requires that 50 percent of all Head Start \nteachers must have an associate, bachelor's, or advanced degree in \nearly childhood education or a related field with teaching experience \nby 2003. Under Ohio law, by 2007, all Head Start teachers must have at \nleast an associates degree. The more education our teachers have, the \nbetter off our children will be. Unfortunately, as we all know, \neducation is expensive.\n  In Ohio today, only 11.3 percent--242--of the 2,126 Head Start \nteachers employed in the state have a bachelor's degree. Additionally, \nless than 1 percent--20--of Ohio's Head Start teachers have a graduate \ndegree. We must do more to help our teachers afford the education that \nwill be used to help educate our children.\n  Recruiting and retaining Head Start and early childhood teachers \ncontinues to be a challenge for Ohio and other states. The Loan \nForgiveness for Head Start Teachers Act of 2003 will help communities, \nschools and other funded Head Start providers to meet the challenge of \nrecruiting and retaining high quality teachers. It is one of the best \nways that I know of where we can make a real difference in the lives of \nour most precious resource--our children.\n  I am pleased to have been able to work with the National Head Start \nAssociation and Ohio Head Start Association, and my colleague Senator \nFeinstein, on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join as \ncosponsors of this bill.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S206-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S206]]\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 17--RECOGNIZING THE FIRST TEE FOR ITS SUPPORT OF \nPROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE YOUNG PEOPLE OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AN OPPORTUNITY TO \n DEVELOP, THROUGH GOLF AND CHARACTER EDUCATION, LIFE-ENHANCING VALUES \n              SUCH AS HONOR, INTEGRITY, AND SPORTSMANSHIP\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nwhich recognizes the many benefits provided to our Nation's youth by \nthe First Tee Golf program. The First Tee, a youth character building \norganization, provides young people of all backgrounds an opportunity \nto develop life-enhancing values such as honor, integrity and \nsportsmanship through golf.\n  Golf is a unique sport that teaches many of life's important lessons \nand promotes the best of character through fellowship and good \nsportsmanship. This resolution recognizes the contribution of the First \nTee Golf program which, through the game of golf, provides many youths \nthe lessons they will use to succeed as young men and women. By \nmitigating the high cost associated with this sport, the First Tee \nprogram gives young people an opportunity to reap the numerous benefits \nthe game offers. Participants involved with First Tee learn to interact \nmore effectively with others and to be a positive influence in their \ncommunities through curriculum specifically designed to teach \ninterpersonal skills, self-management, goal-setting, and resistance \nskills. These are difficult life skills to teach, and I believe that \nthe game of golf and the First Tee program is an ideal way to foster \nthese values.\n  I am proud that such an honorable program is finally becoming a \nreality in my State of Arkansas, and I am pleased to introduce this \nresolution recognizing the First Tee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S206-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S206-S207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        7(a) CREDIT SUBSIDY RATE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 141, which was introduced \nearlier today by Senators Snowe, Bond, Kerry, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 141) to improve the calculation of the Federal \n     subsidy rate with respect to certain small business loans, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation that \nI introduced today to permit the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, \nand the Small Business Administration, SBA, to use a recently-completed \neconometric model to calculate the credit subsidy rate for the 7(a) \nsmall business loan guarantee program, the flagship loan program at the \nSBA. I am very pleased that Senators Bond, Kerry, Crapo, Bennett, Enzi, \nBurns, and Landrieu are original cosponsors of this important \nlegislation.\n  Our bill, once signed into law by President Bush, will allow the 7(a) \nloan program to meet the borrowing demands of our Nation's small \nbusinesses, which is approximately $10 billion for fiscal year 2003. \nWithout this bill, the program would limit 7(a) loans to less than $5 \nbillion for FY 2003. Currently, the 7(a) program is operating at a very \nreduced capacity, with a loan size cap of $500,000, to avoid exceeding \nthe program limitations.\n  By limiting the 7(a) guaranteed small business loan program, we are \nunnecessarily hampering much-needed job growth in the United States. \nJust 2 days ago, we here in the Senate passed much-needed legislation \nto extend jobless benefits for 20 more weeks. These benefits are \nintended to help those persons who have already been unemployed for 6 \nmonths. This is much too long for someone who is actively looking for a \njob. And we should be doing everything possible to support job creation \nopportunities.\n  The SBA 7(a) small business loan program is just the answer. \nAccording to the SBA, the 7(a) program is its most efficient program \nfor creating new jobs. Historically, the SBA maintains the ``job \ncoefficient'' for the 7(a) loans is $32,382. The SBA ``job \ncoefficient'' is the amount of an SBA-guaranteed 7(a) loan that leads \nto one job.\n  Based on the SBA's ``job coefficient'' for the 7(a) program, the \nimpact of the small business guaranteed loan program is staggering. \nAccording to the OMB, enactment of our bill and implementation of the \neconometric model will reduce the credit subsidy rate of the 7(a) \nprogram from 1.76 percent to 1.04 percent. This reduction will expand \nthe size of the 7(a) program from $4.85 billion to $8.2 billion, an \nincrease of nearly $3.5 billion. Based on the SBA 7(a) ``job \ncoefficient,'' the increase in lending from our bill will result in \nnearly 21,000 more loans to small businesses that will support 103,690 \njobs. And no additional Federal Government spending will be needed to \nsupport this change.\n  The good news about the expansion of the 7(a) small business loan \nprogram does not stop here. Part of our strategy to expand the 7(a) \nloans program is to reprogram leftover, no-year funds previously \nappropriated for the SBA's STAR terrorist disaster recovery loan \nprogram, which is set to expire on January 10, 2003. If the \nreprogramming is approved later this month as part of the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill, the leftover STAR funds would be used for the \nregular 7(a) loan program. At this time, there is approximately $20 \nmillion remaining, which would support an additional 12,000 loans to \nsmall businesses totaling $1.92 billion, while assuming a credit \nsubsidy rate of 1.04 percent established by the new econometric model. \nSBA-guaranteed loans to small businesses made with these funds would \nsupport 60,000 more jobs.\n  Unlike many stimulus plans that project benefits that occur years \nafter enactment of the proposal, the expansion of the SBA's 7(a) \nprogram makes a critical expansion of the jobs a ``today'' event rather \nthan a promise in the future. Once our bill is enacted, the increased \nlending between now and September 30, 2003, will guarantee 21,000 small \nbusiness loans that support over 103,000 jobs. And after the STAR \nreprogramming is approved, 12,000 loans can be made to small businesses \nthat support another 60,000 jobs. That's over 163,000 more jobs between \nnow and the end of fiscal year 2003. How incredible is that?\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\n  The ``econometric model'' is a significant reform in the way the SBA \nand OMB calculates the credit subsidy rate for the 7(a) loan program. \nOur bill provides that the OMB and SBA will adopt the new econometric \nmodel effective retroactively to October 1, 2002. Developed by the SBA \nand OMB, the econometric model will use far more comprehensive data \nabout individual borrowers and loans when forecasting anticipated \ndefaults and establishing loan reserves to cover them.\n  Under the Credit Reform Act of 1990, the annual appropriation for the \nSBA must, in advance, provide sufficient funds to cover the cost of a \nFederal loan guarantee, after taking into consideration the fees paid \nby small business borrowers and lenders under the 7(a) program. This \namount, referred to as the credit subsidy rate, is determined by the \nOMB prior to the submission of the President's annual budget request to \nthe Congress.\n  Critics of the credit subsidy rate for the 7(a) program have cited \nthe use of historical loan performance data that pre-dates the \nenactment of the Federal Credit Reform Act as a major cause of a credit \nsubsidy rate that greatly exceeds actual loan performance. The \nconsequence is the use of the most conservative loan default rates, \nyear-in and year-out, and the failure by the OMB and the SBA to adjust \nhistorical loan performance data to reflect 7(a) program changes, both \nstatutory and regulatory, that have lead to real reductions in the \ndefault rates and improved program performance. According to an in-\ndepth analysis undertaken by the General Accounting Office (GAO), the \nexcessively high credit subsidy rates have resulted in nearly $1 \nbillion in unnecessary fees being paid by small business borrowers and \nlenders to the U.S. Treasury.\n  It is very unrealistic to believe that a 100 percent accurate credit \nsubsidy rate estimate can be derived for the 7(a) loan program, or for \nany other Federal credit program. The econometric model, designed to \ncalculate the 7(a) credit subsidy rate, is a major improvement over the \n``old'' model.\n  Originally, the administration stated that the econometric model \nwould not be available until FY 2004. After extensive discussions with \nthe senior White House staff, the administration has agreed to \naccelerate their use of the model retroactive to October 1, 2002, the \nbeginning of FY 2003. Their policy change is a very positive effort to \nhelp small businesses and promote job growth.\n  Our bill is designed to waive a key provision of the Federal Credit \nReform Act that prohibits the Congress from changing a credit subsidy \nrate estimate once it has been transmitted to the Congress as part of \nthe President's annual budget submission. This may be the first time \nthis provision has been waived since implementation of the act in FY \n1992.\n  We would not be where we are today resolving this important matter \nwithout the tireless efforts of my colleagues in the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives. Mr. Manzullo, chairman of the House Committee \non Small Business, fought for this change every step of the way. The \nranking member, Ms. Velazquez, was especially vigilant in her efforts. \nIn the Senate, my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, John Kerry, \nhas kept the committee focused on resolving this issue for the past \nyear. We have all fought hard to resolve the credit subsidy rate \ncontroversy for the past year. We have all fought hard to resolve the \ncredit subsidy rate controversy for FY 2003.\n  Resolving the 7(a) credit subsidy rate issue is good for small \nbusinesses, is good for those seeking work and is good for America. It \nwill mean more jobs, more opportunity and economic fuel for start-up \ncompanies. It will also be invaluable in growing small businesses. I \nurge each of my colleagues to vote a resounding ``aye'' for this \nimportant bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements regarding this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 141) was read a third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 141\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

After written notification to \n     Congress, the Small Business Administration shall implement \n     the validated, OMB-approved subsidy rate for fiscal year \n     2003, using this model and methodology.

I know some of this housekeeping material is \nhard for those outside the Chamber to understand--why it takes so long. \nI tell the majority leader that we are doing the very best we can to \nget this worked out.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the leadership on the other side of \nthe aisle because we have had a very productive week. For our \ncolleagues in the Senate and also the people who watch these \nproceedings, I want to reiterate that we have all been working in good \nfaith on a range of issues with respect to these committee resolutions. \nI very much appreciate that cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will rule on the request that was \nmade. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just to update our membership, I think that \nwe have made tremendous progress, to be honest with you, in terms of \nthe last 6 or 7 days on the committee resolutions. There are a couple \nof issues that we have worked on all day today and yesterday, and I \nknow that is not apparent before the Senate, but there has been real \nprogress. What we would like to do--it is an objective for both sides--\nis to have the committees organized. There are 21 committees with new \nchairmen, and the Presiding Officer is one of the newer Members right \nnow who does not have a committee presence. That is the sort of thing \nwe are waiting on, and we have all agreed that we need to have that \ndone as soon as possible. The new Members, right now, don't sit on any \nof the 21 committees. We are working to get the committee assignments \non both sides of the aisle. That is the particular issue that we are \ntalking about now and putting the new committee chairmen in place.\n  As we just heard, we will be able to do that in the very near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S207-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S207-S208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. We will be leaving here shortly. I will mention what time \nwe may have votes on Monday afternoon. I do hope that we can use as a \ngoal Monday completion of these committee resolutions. There are a \nnumber of issues that we are working on, but until the\n\n[[Page S208]]\n\ncommittees are organized, assignments are made, we cannot fully address \nthe issues before us.\n  Senators should anticipate a busy week next week as we address a \nwhole range of issues, including the committee resolutions; and then, I \nshould add the appropriations, which is the next big challenge for us--\nthe 11 appropriations bills that we were unable to finish in the 107th \nCongress. I very much would like to have as a goal by the end of next \nweek completion, if at all possible, of that unfinished business.\n\n  I think we should remain in session--and this is unfinished business \nfrom the last session--until we finish the committee resolutions, as \nwell as the appropriations. I hope Senators can plan their schedules \naccordingly.\n  Rollcall votes are possible during each day next week, including \nMonday, although we would not have a vote before Monday at 5 o'clock. \nWe don't anticipate any votes. We don't know absolutely for sure that \nwe will have a vote at that point in time, but I think it is important \nto proceed in that direction with the business before us.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their cooperation and all the \nkindness they have shown in the last few days as I have taken on this \nnew position. We have addressed a number of issues that are important \nto the American people during this first week of the 108th Congress. If \nI may look back over the last several days, it has been one of active \nnegotiation. It is not all that apparent to the world at large, but we \nhave had action and accomplishment and achievement. It has been a \nproductive start.\n  By working together over the course of the last week, there are three \nthings in addition to the debate on the floor that we have been able to \naccomplish. One is the unemployment insurance, which, again, working in \na bipartisan way, we were able to pass within several hours of opening \nthe session. That will aid thousands of our fellow citizens in need. It \nis a problem that we addressed in this body before. We were able to \naddress it in a very cooperative spirit, and we have accomplished that. \nA number of us had the pleasure of meeting with the President 2 days \nlater as he signed that bill. That is to the benefit of Americans.\n  Secondly, we passed a continuing resolution that will keep our \nGovernment functioning and give us the time we need to complete the \nspending bills, the appropriations bills, that I mentioned earlier.\n  Third, just a few minutes ago, we wrapped up one other issue that \ncame from the 107th Congress, one report. To our colleagues who are \nhere and are listening, that was a promise made in the 107th Congress \nthat we have been able to fulfill in the last few minutes.\n\n  Many will recall that immediately prior to passage of the homeland \nsecurity bill in the Senate, Senator Lott secured an agreement with \nSpeaker Hastert and Majority Leader DeLay to revisit in this Congress \ncertain provisions in the homeland security bill. I am pleased to tell \nmy colleagues that we have done just that in a manner that is \nacceptable to our Members. We have reached agreement. The changes will \nbe included in the omnibus appropriations bill that I hope we will be \nable to consider shortly. The specifics of that will be released in the \ncoming days.\n  I thank Speaker Hastert for his willingness to work with the Senate \nto address these specific issues. I thank Majority Leader DeLay for his \nassistance, and I thank Senators Chafee, Collins, and Snowe for their \ncooperation, as well as Senators Gregg and Roberts for their \nassistance.\n  In closing, I wish to acknowledge the help of my colleagues because, \nas I said in my opening remarks, the spirit of working together in \ncooperation, I know--I absolutely know--will be to the benefit of the \nAmerican people. I hope the 108th Congress will be increasingly \ncharacterized by that spirit of cooperation.\n  On Tuesday, we promised the American people we would get right to \nwork. We have in a strong bipartisan way. It has been a good week. We \nextended the unemployment insurance, we passed the continuing \nresolution, and we have made good on a promise to revisit those \nprovisions in the homeland security bill.\n  I am delighted to report that after 72 hours, I got voice mail in my \noffice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/10/senate-section/article/S208-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JANUARY 13, 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
