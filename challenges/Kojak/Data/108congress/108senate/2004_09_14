Mr. President, today we have a period of morning business \nfor up to 60 minutes, with the first 30 minutes under the control of \nthe Democratic leader or his designee and the final 30 minutes under \nthe control of the majority leader or his designee.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe Homeland Security appropriations bill. As I understand, there are \napproximately five pending amendments the chairman will review to \ndetermine when we will be disposing of them. Therefore, Senators should \nexpect numerous rollcall votes over the course of the day as we move \ntoward completion of that bill.\n  We do have our recess between 12:30 and 2:15 for the weekly party \nluncheons.\n  While I mentioned we will have numerous rollcall votes, and I see the \nassistant Democratic leader, one thing we must do over the course of \ntoday and tomorrow is limit the amount of time for Senators to vote in \nthe specified time. We have Senators who straggle in. Everyone has an \nexcuse. We have been too liberal in allowing people to come in late. In \norder to finish the bill, especially as we want to pay appropriate \nrespect to the Jewish holiday tomorrow, I plead with our colleagues \nthat they come as soon as they are notified there will be a vote. We \ngive everyone a heads-up when there will be a vote. Come and vote and \nleave and efficiently use that time.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am so gratified to hear the leader \nspeaking on this topic.\n  Yesterday, we had a vote that took 45 minutes. I suggested to the \nfloor staff maybe we should do away with the 15-minute limitation and \nwait until the last person shows up. It is unfair to this body. I don't \nthink the leader should plead with people to come. They would come very \nquickly if we start cutting off the votes. It is unfair to this body to \nwait around here while somebody is finishing a phone call or a workout \nin the gym while the rest of us are waiting to get work done.\n  Also, if I could, through the Chair, we want to finish this Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill. We have been working through these \nnumerous amendments. We are at a point where I believe we could \nfinalize this bill.\n  Finally, as the leader knows, we wanted to have a cutoff on this. I \nunderstand the leader decided yesterday to take a look at it to see if \nthere is something we could do to help the situation in Florida through \nthis bill. I said yesterday--and still say this--let's finish this \nbill. We want to help Florida as much as we can, but I think, by trying \nto tie these two things together, it is not going to work very well.\n  I respectfully submit to the leader, let's try to push forward and \nhave a timeline when we can finish this bill. It is an important piece \nof legislation. We understand that. But it would set such a good tone \nif we could finish that prior to the holiday beginning tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S9156]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I do again restate and reemphasize the importance of \nfinishing this legislation, either this evening or early Wednesday \nmorning, so Senators can observe the Rosh Hashanah holiday \nappropriately. We want to allow people to have travel time tomorrow as \nwell. But we must finish this bill. Again, the plea for efficiency, for \namendments to be brought forward, and that we vote on time is all to \nrestate the importance of dealing with this very important bill and \ncompleting this bill in a timely way.\n  We may well have, in addition to a busy session today, a busy session \ntonight in order to complete the bill. I know the Members continue to \nmake inquiries as to whether we will finish tonight or in the morning. \nAll I can say is we have to finish the bill. The holiday starts \ntomorrow, late afternoon, but it means, to give people appropriate \ntravel time, we need to finish it, and we have time to finish it \ntonight or tomorrow. But I think how things go today and tonight will \ndetermine the schedule over the course of the day, tonight, and \ntomorrow. I will have further updates on that as we progress on the \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9156-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PORTRAIT PRESENTATIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do wish to alert colleagues to a special \nevent being sponsored by the U.S. Senate Commission on Art today. At \n2:30 today, after the policy luncheons, in the Senate Reception Room, \njust adjacent to where we are now, the portraits of Senators Arthur \nVandenberg of Michigan and Robert Wagner of New York will be presented.\n  Members of the Vandenberg and Wagner families have traveled to \nWashington for this special event. Senator Daschle and I both will be \non hand and will be making very brief comments.\n  I encourage our colleagues to take a few moments to come by and help \ncommemorate these two real giants of the 20th century. It is an \nopportunity for us to express our appreciation for two distinguished \nstatesmen and their contributions. It is also a time for us to honor \nthis great institution.\n  We have the opportunity of being part of a very unique family, the \nSenate family, and today's presentation of portraits in the Reception \nRoom is a reminder of the trust that is placed in us by our fellow \ncitizens and, indeed, as we look to the past, by history.\n  As a sidenote, I have to say I am very proud that the portrait of \nSenator Vandenberg was painted by a Tennessean, Michael Shane Neal.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, if I could get through everything, I would \nbe happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you. Not yield the floor. I am asking if the \nSenator would yield for a question when he is finished.\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, when I finish. Let me try to get through the \nannouncements, the statements. Let me go through the material, and then \nI will be happy to yield for a quick question.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9156-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ROSH HASHANAH AND ANTI-SEMITISM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, tomorrow is the Jewish holiday Rosh \nHashanah, and it is also called the Jewish New Year. It is one of the \nholiest days of the year in the Jewish faith for the Jewish people. \nRosh Hashanah marks the anniversary of the creation of the world. It is \na day for contemplation and prayer, to look forward to the year ahead, \nto reflect on past deeds, and to ask for God's forgiveness.\n\n  As our friends prepare to celebrate their holiday, I think it is \nappropriate for us to take time to reflect on our own deeds and the \nstate of tolerance or, as I am pained to say, the rise of intolerance \ntoward the Jewish people. A number of Senators will be speaking on the \ntopic this morning, and I do urge my colleagues to listen and follow \nthe issue closely. A sampling of anti-Semitic incidents just this \nsummer really does paint a disturbing picture.\n  In Paris, anti-Semitic inscriptions were found stamped into a dozen \nbooks in the main library. The perpetrators stamped the edge of the \nbooks with the words ``Against the Jewish Mafia and Jewish Racism'' and \nthen gave the Web addresses of anti-Semitic sites.\n  Anti-Semitic graffiti, including a sign saying ``death to Jews'' and \na swastika, was found scrawled on a wall on the grounds of Notre Dame \nCathedral.\n  Sixty gravestones were desecrated with swastikas in a Jewish cemetery \nin Lyon.\n  France was not alone. Last month, in Germany, thugs vandalized a \nJewish monument.\n  In Belgium, four Jewish teenagers were assaulted. One of the Jewish \nstudents was stabbed in the back and his lung was punctured.\n  In New Zealand, a Jewish chapel was burned down and up to 90 Jewish \nheadstones were pulled out of the ground and smashed.\n  In Canada, a synagogue was vandalized with graffiti, swastikas, and \nanti-Semitic slogans.\n  These are just a few of the incidents that have occurred in recent \nmonths. Leaders in the Jewish community are understandably concerned.\n  I urge my colleagues and my fellow Americans to share their concern.\n  We know the history. We know where anti-Semitism can lead. It is our \nduty to stand firm against bigotry and intolerance. We cannot allow \nhistory to repeat itself.\n  Again, I make these statements in part because of the Jewish holiday \ntomorrow. A number of people have come forward to express their \nsentiments to us in leadership. I know further remarks will be made on \nthe floor in morning business on that issue.\n  Mr. President, at this juncture, I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for yielding \nfor a question.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9156-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9156-S9158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REIMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning, again in a Congress Journal, \nit says: ``Frist Decision to Delay Reimportation.'' This is the issue \nof the reimportation of prescription drugs, in order to put downward \npressure on drug prices, as I mentioned to the majority leader last \nweek on the floor of the Senate.\n  I harken back to about midnight, March 11, in the Senate, on the \nfloor of the Senate, when we were in session very late, to a statement \nput in the Senate Record by the majority leader saying ``the Senate \nwill begin a process for developing proposals that would allow for the \nsafe reimportation of FDA-approved prescription drugs.''\n  I say to the majority leader, I hope very much that his decision on \nwhat the remaining schedule will be for this Senate will include an \nopportunity for us to, on the floor of the Senate, consider legislation \ndealing with the reimportation of prescription drugs.\n  We have bipartisan legislation in the Senate. We also have a House-\npassed bill that is on the calendar. As I indicated to the Senator from \nTennessee last week, it is my intent, and the intent of others--\nRepublicans and Democrats--to push this issue to the floor. But I hope \nwe would not have to push it in light of the statement by the majority \nleader on March 11, 2004.\n  I ask the Senator to respond.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would be happy to respond. Really, we \nneed to clarify because I know a lot of statements have been made to \nthe press that I made a commitment to the distinguished Senator to have \na vote on the floor. I think we need to go to the statement he just \nread and see what was actually both said and the commitment that was \nmade.\n  Let me read the statement again. He just read it. The statement was--\nand this statement made by me--``the Senate will begin a process for \ndeveloping proposals that would allow for the safe reimportation of \nFDA-approved prescription drugs.'' So I do not think it is right for \nSenators on the other side of the aisle to characterize that statement \nas a commitment to bring it to the floor, have a vote on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. So that is No. 1.\n  No. 2, since that statement was made--and I think it was March 11--it \nwas with the understanding to do exactly what was said; that is, to \nbegin a process that is deliberate, that is thoughtful, that is \ninclusive, that captures the ideas of a whole range of U.S. Senators, \nwith experts coming in to testify, to talk, to discuss, in committees, \noutside of committees.\n  Since March 11, a tremendous amount has been done. Again, I will\n\n[[Page S9157]]\n\ncome back to this whole concept of the safe importation of FDA-approved \ndrugs.\n  Again, I was looking--because I knew it was going to come up again \nover the course of today--and vigorous process has begun in the Senate. \nIf we just look since March 11, the Senate HELP Committee, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and the Subcommittee on Investigations of the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee have all held hearings--and \ncontinue to hold hearings--on this matter since that statement on March \n11.\n  The HELP Committee, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, the committee of jurisdiction, has not yet developed a \nconsensus on any approach because they are struggling with this issue \nof putting safety first.\n  We know there is broad appeal for people who say: Let's bring in \ncheaper drugs from Canada, maybe from Malaysia, Thailand, India, \nBrazil, because people want less expensive drugs. I am sure all the \npolls and surveys say: Bring in those drugs; that means I can get \ncheaper drugs.\n  In good conscience, as someone who recognizes that a few bad pills--\nthink back to a Tylenol situation where we had five pills, back in the \n1980s, that paralyzed our system, a few counterfeit drugs. The FDA \ntells us right now they cannot guarantee that 60 billion pills coming \nto this country every year can be safe, given the structures we have \ntoday.\n  I say that because it is very difficult. That is the reason I don't \nthink we ought to just bring it to the floor without that careful \nconsideration which is underway today, working through the committee of \njurisdiction. It is a popular issue. When people say ``politically \ndriven,'' that throws it into partisanship, which I don't want it to \nbe. I know that is not the intention of the authors. We have people on \nboth sides of the aisle supporting specific legislation.\n  Before bringing it to the floor, I want to make absolutely sure, in \nthis time where we only have 17 days left, when we have an \nappropriations bill we are presently struggling to finish tonight that \ntalks about the safety and security of the American people, where we \nhave the issue of intelligence reform, where we know we have to look at \nit internally and reorganize this body, the huge task to make sure we \nhandle intelligence matters appropriately here, where we have a call \nfrom the President of the United States over the next 17 days to \ntotally reorganize 15 intelligence agencies in the executive branch, \nfocusing on the safety and security of the American people as it \napplies to intelligence, I just don't think by bringing this vote up to \nthe floor, because it will be sort of the popularly driven vote without \nsufficient attention to safety first, that that is the right thing to \ndo, given these 17 days.\n  We all want to lower the cost of prescription drugs. They are way too \nhigh. They are going up too fast. We want to use appropriate tools to \ndo that. Reimportation, if it can be safe, may be one of those tools. \nCan it be done safely? That has to be the fundamental question. I know \nboth sides of the aisle want the drugs to be safe. They don't want \ndrugs coming in cheaply just so we satisfy the demand for cheaper \ndrugs. The question is, How do we do that. We don't have the consensus \nyet, I believe, to bring it to the floor and have people voting up or \ndown. And then we really don't have time on the floor as we look at \nsafety and security, the issues of intelligence, intelligence reform, \n12 appropriations bills, all due in the next 17 days.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would allow me the courtesy of a reply in \nleader time, the Senator has taken a lengthy period of time to describe \nwhy this may not happen. Let me make a couple of observations.\n  The Senator knows what we discussed at midnight on the floor on about \nsix or seven occasions prior to midnight on March 17. There were plenty \nof days left in the session at that point to consider a bipartisan bill \non the reimportation of prescription drugs. We agreed there would be a \nprocess for developing proposals that would allow for the safe \nreimportation of prescription drugs, with the understanding that it was \ngoing to happen this year.\n\n  In the HELP Committee, which the majority leader referenced, there \nhave been three markups scheduled and three markups cancelled. That is \nnot a process that leads to allowing the reimportation of prescription \ndrugs.\n  I have great respect for my colleague from Tennessee, but there is no \nsafety issue here. Europe does this every day routinely in something \ncalled parallel trading. The question for this country will be, Will we \ndecide to put downward pressure on prescription drugs by allowing \nreimportation or won't we? I believe earlier this year the \nrepresentation was given to the Senate that we would be allowed the \nopportunity on the floor of the Senate to deal with this issue.\n  It is my determination, as with others in the Republican and \nDemocratic caucuses, to push this issue. We need to make time for this \nin the coming days because this Congress is going to have to consider \nit. I believe we were given a commitment that it was going to be \nconsidered. Three markup sessions that were scheduled and then canceled \nis not the development of a process that would allow for reimportation. \nIf those of us who have developed our bill on a bipartisan basis don't \npush it, we will end this session with no opportunity for reimportation \nof prescription drugs and no opportunity to put downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices.\n  This is not a partisan issue for me. It is not a political issue. It \nis about some poor soul out there this morning who is trying to buy \nprescription drugs and using his or her grocery money to do it because \nthey are paying double, triple, quadruple, 10 times the price they pay \nwhen they go north of the border to buy the same drug put in the same \nbottle and made by the same company. It is unfair. We ought to do \nsomething about it. We have waited far too long.\n  I respect the majority leader. I simply wanted to point out there has \nto be time to consider this in the coming 17 days. There was in March, \nand there needs to be now.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his courtesy.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I don't want things to be misrepresented. I \nwant everybody to have a full understanding. The challenges in the HELP \nCommittee do reflect the difficulty. When you are talking about safety, \nnot just of cheaper drugs, if you give somebody a counterfeit drug that \ndoesn't thin their blood and they have a stroke and they die, we have \ndone a disservice. I don't want that to happen. I am not saying \nreimportation will cause that to happen, but I will say it is our \nresponsibility to put safety No. 1.\n  I promise you, I will do that. It is an important issue. We agreed on \nMarch 11 to put a process in place. Three attempts by the HELP \nCommittee were mentioned that were canceled or postponed. Let me just \nsay, on Thursday July 22, the Subcommittee on Investigations of the \nSenate Committee on Governmental Affairs held a second hearing on \npurchasing prescription drugs. On July 21, the HELP Committee had \nplanned to do the markup. It had to be postponed. That is correct.\n  On July 14, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the \nimplications--that is, safety. They also talked about intellectual \nproperty trade. But they specifically focused on the drug importation \nlegislation.\n  On June 23, the Senate GOP HELP Committee had a briefing to help \neducate us broadly. It was not a markup but a briefing to educate us \nbroadly to discuss, specifically, importation.\n  On June 17, the Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs held a hearing where GAO released two \nnew studies that documented how American consumes are able to readily \nobtain prescription drugs, including controlled substances, over the \nInternet without a prescription. In that hearing they talked about \nerroneous dispensing labels, suspicious packaging.\n  On May 20, the HELP Committee held a drug importation hearing to \nexamine the challenges of developing and implementing drug importation \nlegislation.\n  The administration has a specific task force on drug importation that \nwas set up as a product of the Medicare bill that we passed on this \nfloor. They have not yet issued their final report. The report will \nincorporate testimony--this is what the administration is doing--by \nconsumer groups, by professionals, by safety experts, by the FDA, by \nleading representatives from\n\n[[Page S9158]]\n\nhealth care purchasers, from academic scholars. The task force has not \nyet released their report to us or to the American people. We await \nthat. It is a very important initiative by the administration that we \nmandated to them. Off the Hill, a number of forums have been held since \nMarch.\n  I mention all of this because I don't want the impression left that \nthis issue, which is important to the American people--and we want less \nexpensive drugs, but we want them to be safe drugs--is not being \naddressed by this body or other people concerned. I will continue to \nwork with the other side. I know there will be a huge push in these \nnext 17 days to get this up for a vote.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a USA Today \nstory entitled ``Medical costs eat at Social Security'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Sept. 14, 2004]\n\n                  Medical Costs Eat at Social Security\n\n                         (By William M. Welch)\n\n       Washington.--With a new Medicare drug benefit set to begin \n     in 2006, Americans 65 and older can expect to spend a large \n     and growing share of their Social Security checks on Medicare \n     premiums and expenses, previously undisclosed federal data \n     show.\n       Information the Bush administration excluded from its 2004 \n     report on the Medicare program shows that a typical 65-year-\n     old can expect to spend 37% of his or her Social Security \n     income on Medicare premiums, copayments and out-of-pocket \n     expenses in 2006. That share is projected to grow to almost \n     40% in 2011 and nearly 50% by 2021.\n       Unless Congress does something to hold down costs \n     confronting seniors, the official projections suggest that \n     health spending will consume virtually the entire amount of \n     Social Security benefits when children born today reach \n     retirement age.\n       The table was provided by the Department of Health and \n     Human Services at the request of Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif. \n     Stark, who opposed the drug benefit enacted last year at \n     President Bush's urging, sought the data after noticing that \n     a chart included in previous annual reports was not in the \n     2004 version.\n       Stark charged that the administration threw out the chart \n     because it shows future Medicare costs under the new law will \n     erode Social Security checks.\n       ``It doesn't look good to lie to grandma, so the Bush \n     administration has withheld information and come up with \n     other creative ways to mask the damage they have done to \n     Medicare,'' Stark said.\n       Richard Foster, Medicare's chief actuary, said the \n     program's trustees--administration officials and appointees--\n     replaced the chart with a graph that lacks specific numbers \n     in an effort to show that the increased costs come with a new \n     benefit.\n       ``The table makes it look like beneficiaries are worse off \n     than ever, and that's not the case,'' Foster said.\n       Bill Pierce, a spokesman for Health and Human Services \n     Secretary Tommy Thompson, said the administration wasn't \n     trying to hide anything. ``We have a new program, and it's \n     got to be reflected with new information,'' he said.\n       The drug benefit is voluntary. It requires a premium, \n     estimated at $420 a year initially, and substantial \n     copayments. The administration estimates participants will \n     save about 50% on their drug bills.\n       Critics of the law say the new figures show it does little \n     to restrain drug costs. The law prohibits the government from \n     negotiating lower drug prices.\n       The data ``ironically are the clearest proof of the new \n     Medicare law's failures and the resulting squeeze on seniors' \n     pocketbooks,'' said Ron Pollack, head of Families USA, a \n     health advocacy group.\n       The disclosure comes just days after the administration \n     announced Medicare premiums will rise by 17% next year due to \n     rising health costs.\n       Foster is at the center of another dispute over missing \n     data. He says he withheld from Congress higher cost estimates \n     for the Medicare law last year, at the direction of a Bush \n     appointee who headed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services. Congress approved the law based on a 10-year, $400 \n     billion estimated price tag. Foster's estimate was $540 \n     billion.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to listen to \nthe colloquy both Senators Dorgan and Frist have engaged in. \nCoincidentally, I had intended to come to the floor to talk about the \nnew report that was released on the front page of USA Today citing the \ndramatic increase in Medicare costs and the impact these costs will \nhave on seniors' Social Security benefits.\n  In 2005, 19 percent of Social Security benefits are going to go to \nMedicare expenses. But according to the USA Today article:\n\n     a typical 65 year old can expect to spend 37% of his or her \n     Social Security income on Medicare premiums, co-payments, and \n     out-of-pocket expenses in 2006. That share is projected to \n     grow to almost 40% in 2011 and nearly 50% in 2021.\n\n  According to the article, by 2026, over half of a senior's Social \nSecurity benefits will be consumed by cost increases under Medicare, \nincluding cost increases associated with the new part D drug benefit.\n  Think about that: we are on pace to see nearly half of the benefit \nseniors depend on under Social Security consumed by cost increases \nunder Medicare.\n  Unfortunately, I think the Senate and the country took a step \nbackward when the Senate made the decision last year to pass the \nlegislation it did. Part of the reason for these increases is that the \nnew law will do almost nothing to bring down the cost of prescription \ndrugs. Another reason is that the law and this Administration is \noverpaying HMOs.\n  There are ways we can address the dramatic cost increase this chart \nrepresents, ways to protect seniors' Social Security and lower drug \nprices. The first is to do what Senator Dorgan has suggested, and that \nhas bipartisan support: allow reimportation of drugs from Canada.\n  Canada has exactly the same drug, the same corporation, the same \neverything, and yet the drugs available there are oftentimes 50 to 60 \npercent cheaper than they are in this country. If a senior citizen can \ngo to another country to acquire those drugs, why in heaven's name \nwould we prevent them from doing so?\n  I have heard the distinguished majority leader say that safety is a \nfactor and that we ought to consider safety as we consider providing \naccess to these drugs. Well, I would say cost is a safety issue as \nwell. I have talked to countless seniors in South Dakota who are \nrationing their own medication because they cannot afford it. If, based \non cost, our seniors are not able to take the drugs they need, no one \ncan tell me that is safe. When one rations drugs, when one does not \ntake them all, when one splits pills, when one makes a choice between \nnutrition and medicine, how safe is that? That is exactly what is going \non today.\n  We've already made the decisions to ensure these drugs will be safe. \nWe should not have to worry about another report or another \nbureaucratic response. Our seniors are not prepared to wait any longer. \nWe have debated this long enough. Reimportation ought to be the law of \nthe land today. That is one way, perhaps the easiest, simplest, and \nmost compelling way, to deal with the cost issue immediately.\n  There is a second way to address rising costs. A second way is to do \nfor seniors what we already do for veterans and for our military. What \ndo we do for them? The Government negotiates with the drug companies to \nbring down prices.\n  In most cases, drug prices for veterans are at least 60 percent lower \nthan they are for seniors. The only reason they are that much lower is \nbecause the Government has the authority to negotiate these lower \nprices.\n  Why in heaven's name would people object to extending this concept to \nseniors as well? On that issue, the drug companies won; we lost. There \nis a specific prohibition against Medicare negotiating lower prices for \nseniors, and I think that is an outrage. We ought to pass legislation \nto allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices.\n  The third thing we can do is to pass legislation that has at least \ntwo forms today--and there may be other ideas. Senators Stabenow and \nKennedy have offered a very good bill that would say we cannot increase \nMedicare premiums beyond the cost of living next year,\n\n[[Page S9159]]\n\nhold it at that. I have a bill that would do something similar. It says \npremiums for Part B and Part D of Medicare cannot exceed 25 percent of \nthe cost-of-living allowance provided to Social Security beneficiaries. \nBoth of these bills would help keep costs down for seniors.\n  So we do not lack ways in which to address the cost issue. What we \nlack is will, a commitment, a determination to bring the issue to the \nfloor.\n  We all lament the dramatic increase in the cost of health care, but \nwe are not going to solve it unless we are willing to take some action. \nWe can go through more hearings, we can go through a lot more reports, \nbut reports and hearings are not going to get the job done. This Senate \nneeds to act.\n  I am amazed at the degree to which the finger-pointing continues to \ngo on and on, with the tired and lame excuse that it is somehow the \nDemocrats' fault that we have not addressed reimportation, that we have \nnot addressed any of the other pending issues. We have had specific \ncommitments on mental health parity and that bill is now unlikely to be \naddressed, even though we have had very specific commitments to take up \nmental health parity in the Senate. That has not happened because there \nis a lack of commitment and energy on the other side.\n  We have not been able to deal with the FSC bill, the welfare reform \nbill, the tax bill, the highway bill, in large measure because our \nRepublican friends have not been able to agree among themselves. So all \nof these and other issues continue to languish. This is a do-nothing \nCongress and in large measure it is do-nothing because they have done \nnothing to bring themselves together and force these issues on to the \nSenate floor to allow us the opportunity to vote and to do the right \nthing.\n  Senior citizens deserve better than that. Those who are in this \ncountry looking to the Senate for answers on all of these and other \nissues deserve better than that. I hope we can make the most of what \nlimited time we have remaining so we can do better than that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9159-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9159-S9160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST KEEP ITS EDUCATION PROMISES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, throughout America, another new school \nyear is beginning. As children settle into new classes and parents meet \ntheir children's new teachers, we are reminded once again of the \nimportance of public education to America's future.\n  Good, strong public schools are not a Democratic or a Republican \nconcern; they are a cornerstone of American democracy. They are what \nhas helped America create the most innovative, powerful economy the \nworld has ever known and they are essential to the survival of the \nmiddle class in this country.\n  Nearly 3 years ago, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act \ncontaining the most far-reaching changes in Federal education policy in \nnearly 40 years. Recently, States released their second annual No Child \nLeft Behind report cards, showing how their schools are measuring up \nunder the new law. This afternoon, I would like to talk briefly about \nhow the Federal Government is measuring up--whether we are keeping the \npromises we made under No Child Left Behind and other important \neducation laws.\n  All of us know that, if we mention No Child Left Behind at a town \nhall meeting, we are just as likely to hear boos as we are to hear \napplause. Why is that?\n  One reason is because of some basic design flaws. What seemed to work \nwell on paper, we are discovering, may not work as well in practice. \nParts of No Child Left Behind need fine-tuning.\n  There were also some problems, early on, with the way the \nadministration was implementing the new law. Fortunately, some of those \nproblems are starting to be addressed. Yesterday, Senator Kennedy \nintroduced legislation to make sure the No Child Left Behind Act is \nimplemented correctly. No one understands the No Child Left Behind Act \nbetter, and no one worked harder with President Bush to pass it. We \nought to have a serious debate--and a vote--on Senator Kennedy's bill \nthis year.\n  Unfortunately, the administration and Congressional Republicans \nremain unwilling to acknowledge one of the biggest impediments to the \nsuccess of the No Child Left Behind Act: inadequate resources.\n  Our Republican colleagues cite numbers to show that education funding \nis increasing. With all due respect, their numbers miss the point. The \nquestion isn't: Is the Federal Government spending more on education? \nThe question is: Is the Federal Government providing States with the \nresources they need to make the No Child Left Behind Act, and other \nFederal education mandates, work? The answer is no. The President's \nbudget for this year provides the smallest increase in education in \nnearly a decade. Over the last 3 years, the President's budgets have \nshortchanged No Child Left Behind by $26 billion.\n  We all know that more money alone won't make schools better. But we \nalso know that money does matter. It costs money to make the changes \nthe No Child Left Behind Act requires. It costs money to put a highly \ntrained teacher in every classroom. It costs money to test every \nstudent, every year, in grades 3 through 8. It costs money to produce \nand distribute the school report cards that are required under the new \nlaw, and to collect and analyze all the data that go into those report \ncards.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act aims to close the achievement gap by \nraising the educational achievement of poor and minority students and \nstudents with disabilities. This is a noble and necessary goal. Yet, \nyear after year, the programs that actually help close that achievement \ngap are the very programs that are the most seriously underfunded. In \nthe President's budget this year, 80 percent of the total shortfall in \nthe No Child Left Behind Act is in Title I programs. The children and \nschools that need the most help are instead targeted for the biggest \nfunding shortfalls.\n  Shortchanging Title I and other parts of the No Child Left Behind Act \nmeans denying schools the resources they need to succeed--then \npunishing them for not measuring up.\n  Refusing to fund No Child Left Behind adequately also undermines \nlocal control of schools. Rapid City, SD, is a good example. Parents \nand educators in Rapid City have come up with an innovative plan for a \nnew, year-round school that would provide extra help to low-income \nchildren. It would also work with the children's parents so they can be \nbetter partners in their children's education. It is exactly the kind \nof intensive help that is needed to close the achievement gap. But \nRapid City doesn't have the Title I resources to make it a reality.\n\n  The underfunding of the No Child Left Behind Act is a major reason \nthat legislators in 17 States--many of them Republican-controlled \nStates--have endorsed bills protesting the law.\n  The President's budget also provides less than half of what Congress \nagreed nearly 40 years ago was Washington's fair share of special \neducation costs.\n  The National Council of State Legislatures estimates the cost of \nunfunded Federal mandates will hit an unprecedented $34 billion this \nyear. The two most expensive unfunded Federal mandates? No Child Left \nBehind, and special education. In South Dakota, the shortfall this year \njust in these two programs is $61 million; $30 million for No Child \nLeft Behind, and $31 million for special education.\n  Accountability is critical. But accountability has to work both ways. \nIf the Federal Government passes a law, we ought to fund it \nadequately--not push the cost off on State and local taxpayers.\n  In South Dakota, we have a State law that allows school districts to \n``opt out'' of the State freeze on local property taxes if they can't \nprovide basic educational programs and still balance their budgets. \nThese are not cases where communities choose to pay higher taxes in \norder to pay for extras. Before districts can even seek an opt out \nagreement they have to have already made significant budget cuts.\n  The number of districts seeking such agreements has increased \ndramatically since No Child Left Behind was passed. Today, 46 percent \nof South Dakota school districts are operating under opt out \nagreements. Think about that: Nearly half the school districts in South \nDakota are raising local property taxes, in part to make up for the\n\n[[Page S9160]]\n\nFederal Government's failure to keep its education promises.\n  Custer is one those communities. It is a small ranching town in \nwestern South Dakota. Last year, Custer went to a 4-day school-week to \nbalance its budget--and it still ended the year with a deficit. This \nyear, Custer has to find an extra $300,000 to replace the 70-year-old \nboiler in its elementary school. It has no idea where the money will \ncome from.\n  In Faith, SD, the town's only school building was condemned in June. \nThe people of Faith have no idea how they will replace their school. \nThe local tax base can produce only a fraction of the cost. For now, \nthe children of Faith are attending classes in double-wide trailers.\n  During the debate on No Child Left Behind, I fought to include a \nRural Education Assistance Program to address the unique circumstances \nof schools in small towns like Custer and Faith. That program, too, is \nunderfunded in the President's budget. In South Dakota alone, the \nshortfall in rural education this year is $700,000.\n  Nearly every district in our State has laid off teachers in the last \nfew years. They have cut advanced placement courses, art programs, \nforeign languages, vocational education programs--you name it. Wall, \nSD, has eliminated its entire middle-school staff. High school teachers \nin Wall now teach high school and middle school. Rural districts are \nforming consortia to share administrators and education specialists.\n  Across the country, schools are laying off teachers and other \nemployees, and cutting programs, bus routes, textbook purchases, and \nother expenses. Many communities are rationing Title I funds--limiting \nthem to elementary schools only--because, they say, if they had to \ninclude high schools, there wouldn't be enough left for elementary \nschools to make a difference.\n  The refusal by Republicans in Washington to adequately fund Federal \neducation programs is not the only reason many public schools are \nhaving a difficult time balancing their budgets. But, at a time when \nmany State and local governments are still struggling, these Republican \nunfunded education mandates are making a difficult situation worse in \nmany places.\n  And it is going to get much worse. That is not speculation. The Bush \nadministration's own internal budget documents project more than $5.5 \nbillion in cuts for elementary and secondary education in fiscal years \n2005 through 2009. Those cuts are more than six times larger than the \neducation increases they are calling for in this election year. That is \nfrom the President's own Office of Management and Budget.\n  If we really couldn't do any better, that would be one thing. But \nthis is a matter of choice, not necessity. At the same time the \nPresident and Congressional Republicans are telling us that we can't \nafford--or don't need--to keep the education promises the Federal \nGovernment makes, they insist that Congress needs to create tens of \nbillions of dollars in new tax breaks for millionaires and wealthy \ncorporations. That is the wrong choice for America. Real reform \nrequires real resources, otherwise it is just an empty slogan, or \nworse--a set-up for failure.\n  As they start this new school year, most children probably aren't \npaying any attention to what goes on in Washington. But what we decide \nhere about education will have a profound effect on their future. \nDuring the education appropriations debate, Democrats are going to \nfight to keep the education promises our Government has made. We hope \nour Republican colleagues will join us--for our children's future, and \nfor the future of our democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9160-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday President Bush went to Battle \nCreek, MI. The purpose of his visit, of course, was in preparation for \nthe election but also to raise a critical issue, and the issue is the \nsame one we have discussed this morning: health care in America. \nPresident Bush was outspoken in attacking Senator John Kerry for having \nthe nerve to suggest we need to change health care in America.\n  In criticizing John Kerry, President Bush, quoting from the morning \nnewspaper, said John Kerry's proposal would be ultimately a Government \ntakeover of medicine. It would be a massive, complicated blueprint to \nhave our Government take over decisionmaking in health care. \nBureaucrats would become the decisionmakers.\n  Once again, the Republican Party and President Bush wave the bloody \nshirt that if anyone suggests a change in the health care system in \nAmerica today that they are calling for socialism and more bureaucracy.\n  What the President refuses to acknowledge and what the leadership on \nthe Republican side of the Senate refuses to acknowledge is the health \ncare system in America is in crisis. Since this President took office, \ncensus figures show 3.8 million more Americans are uninsured. In \naddition, the Kaiser Family Foundation study released last week said \nfamilies are paying on average $1,000 more out of pocket for health \ncoverage this year than in the year before the President was elected.\n  It tells us that health care is becoming more expensive, more \nexclusive, and, frankly, that the average working family doesn't have a \nfighting chance under this system. What is the response on the \nRepublican side of the aisle? What is the response from President Bush? \nMore of the same. Don't rock the boat. We cannot say anything negative \nwhen it comes to the enormous profits that are being garnered by the \ndrug companies and the HMOs.\n  But families and businesses across America understand the reality of \nhealth care today. When the Republican leader comes to the floor of the \nSenate and announces that we don't have time in the remaining weeks of \nthe session to consider the issue of reimporting drugs from Canada or \nother countries, what he has basically said to thousands of seniors and \nfamilies across America is that we are going to protect American drug \ncompanies and their profits at any cost. That is what has happened with \nour own prescription drug plan for seniors, and it is what is happening \nfor the agenda for the Senate.\n  Look at what happened to premiums across America. On this chart is a \ntrendline. I don't have to go year by year. Ask any employer in America \nwhat has happened to health insurance premiums and they will tell you \nthat every year it is more expensive. I go around Illinois and meet \nwith good, solid, God-fearing Republican businessmen who tell me: \nSenator, we cannot take it anymore. There is no way we can deal with \nthese annual increases in health insurance. What are you doing in \nWashington about this? The honest answer is, under the Bush \nadministration and the Republican-controlled Congress, absolutely \nnothing. So what do these businesses do? They will tell you over and \nover again they have no choice. How big an obstacle is health care cost \nin hiring new employees? And 78 percent say it is an obstacle. They \ncannot hire a new person because the cost of health insurance is so \nhigh.\n  What about the health insurance companies, the HMOs? How are they \nfaring as these health insurance premiums go up? Do the premium \nincreases just reflect the fact that it costs more to provide health \ncare? Look at their profit margins. HMO profits from 2002 to 2003 went \nfrom $5.5 billion to almost double that amount, $10.2 billion.\n  You ask yourself, why is the President criticizing John Kerry for \nbringing up meaningful health care reform\n\n[[Page S9161]]\n\nto help working families and help small businesses and large businesses \nas well? Because the HMOs don't want anybody to rock the boat. The Bush \nadministration, whether they are dealing with the drug companies or \nHMOs, is going to protect their profit margins, even at the expense of \nadequate health care for Americans.\n  When you take a look at what John Kerry proposed, I don't believe it \nis radical. Would you be in favor of reducing the tax cuts for people \nmaking over $200,000 a year and taking that money and expanding the \ncoverage of health insurance in America? Is that a radical idea? No, \nthat is a commonsense idea. People making over $200,000 a year are not \ngoing to miss that tiny tax cut as a percentage of their income. But \nwhen you put that money together, you are able to address some of the \nserious problems facing us.\n  I believe President Bush forgot the obvious. Average working people \ncannot keep up with the cost of health insurance and health care in \nAmerica. His administration has done nothing, absolutely nothing, to \ndeal with it. What do they do when John Kerry comes forward and says it \nis time for us to have a bipartisan discussion on bringing the costs of \nhealth care under control and expanding coverage? President Bush goes \nto Battle Creek, MI, and accuses him of socialized medicine, huge \nbureaucracies. He says, ``A Government takeover of medicine.'' Those \ndays have passed.\n\n  It has been over 10 years since the Congress and the Government in \nWashington have had a serious conversation about the cost of health \ninsurance. In that period of time, the private sector has been in \ncharge. The private sector has done to health care what you would \nexpect them to do. They have raised the cost and reduced the risk. So \nevery year you find your health care premiums going up and coverage \ngoing down while their profits go through the roof. If you want 4 more \nyears of the same, you will have a chance to vote for it on November 2.\n  Also, consider that Congress--this Chamber, the Senate, and across \nthe rotunda in the House--has failed to meet our responsibilities under \nRepublican leadership. When we have the Republican leader come before \nus today and say we don't have time to deal with the reimportation of \ndrugs before we adjourn for a recess this year, trust me, if the \nRepublicans continue in control of this Chamber, there will be another \nexcuse next year.\n  Despite the best efforts of Senator Daschle, Senator Dorgan, Senator \nKennedy, and so many others, we are not going to have an opportunity to \nhelp people across America deal with the soaring costs of health care \nuntil there is a change in leadership and attitude. It is time for \nbusiness and labor, Republicans and Democrats, to come together to face \nthis health care issue and to do it in a bipartisan fashion. We can do \nit, but we need a change of leadership to achieve it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Massachusetts allow the Senator from \nMichigan 2 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am delighted to.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Kennedy still has 15 minutes. The Senator from \nMichigan has 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues very much. I thank \nthe Senator from Massachusetts for allowing me to take 2 minutes to \nfollow up on the comments of the distinguished Senator from Illinois \nconcerning what is happening on health care and reimportation.\n  I just came from a gathering with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and the House of Representatives, speaking out again on why we \nneed to pass that bill immediately. We want to lower prices. We need to \nallow pharmacists to do business with pharmacists across the border in \nCanada or other countries where it is safe, and we can drop prices in \nhalf.\n  I also raise one more time this issue of the Medicare premium \nincrease that was announced by the administration over a week ago at \nthe end of the day, on a Friday, in the middle of a hurricane, \nunfortunately, right after the Republican convention, when the \nPresident indicated he was going to lower pricing for seniors for \nhealth care, and then we saw an announcement of the largest premium \nincrease in the history of the country--17.5-percent premium increase. \nSocial Security is only going up by approximately 3 percent this year, \nwhich means seniors will be moving backward, being put in a real hole \nas a result of what is happening.\n  I am pleased to have introduced legislation along with my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts and other Members. We welcome everyone's support and \ncosponsorship, and I hope we can get this taken up as quickly as \npossible. There will be a 17.5-percent increase in Medicare premiums, \nand a piece of that, as a result of policy changes to privatize \nMedicare, is not acceptable. As I indicated before, Social Security is \ngoing to go up about 3 percent. Yet, we are going to see the highest \nincrease in Medicare's history in premiums.\n  The majority of seniors have not asked to privatize Medicare. They \nhave not chosen that option. They should not be paying for it. I urge \nmy colleagues to join us to fix that before we leave this fall.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield our additional 5 minutes to Senator \nKennedy, for a total of 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first, I commend our leader, Senator \nDaschle, for his presentation this morning and for his constancy and \nleadership in attempting to bring reimportation legislation before the \nSenate. He has supported the bipartisan legislation. He reminds us \nabout the importance of it. I am a strong supporter of that \nlegislation. I am disappointed, as Senator Dorgan is, that we have not \nbeen able to address it.\n  This legislation would have an important impact in terms of grabbing \na hold of the problem of the escalation of prescription drug prices. \nThe issues on safety have been addressed. I commend our leader for \nrecognizing this and bringing it to the Senate, and I thank Senator \nDorgan for his persistence and leadership. Once again, I commend as \nwell my friend and colleague from Michigan, Debbie Stabenow, who has \nbeen a leader in pursuing a legitimate prescription drug program for \nyears--certainly since she has been in the Senate. I thank again \nSenator Durbin from Illinois for his very eloquent summation about \nwhere we are in terms of our health care challenges in this country.\n\n  I was somewhat surprised, although I should not have been, reading \nthrough the President's statement yesterday.\n  I ask the Chair if he would let me know when I have 3 minutes left, \nplease.\n  I was surprised, listening to the President talk about the health \ncare challenges we are facing in this Nation. What troubled me about \nthe presentation is that the President went on to misrepresent what my \nfriend and colleague stands for, and basically what I stand for, in the \nhealth care choices that are before this Nation. Then, in a technique \nwhich some of us have gotten used to here in the Senate--but certainly \nI think it is unworthy in the Presidential debate--to misrepresent, \ndistort the position of the opposition, and then to differ with it. \nThat is a debate technique which is used here frequently, but is \ncertainly not, I think, fitting in terms of the office of the \nPresidency of the United States.\n  In his comments he mentioned that today we are going to hear a lot of \ntalk about a difference of opinion. It starts with: You know what you \nexpect from a Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I imagine he was, in all respect, making a reference to the \nlongstanding position I have held which I think is still absolutely \nessential for this country; that we have a universal, comprehensive \nprogram that is affordable, dependable, and reliable, at a price that \nworking families, middle-income families can afford. That has been my \nposition. I have offered legislation for more than 35 years to try to \nbe able to do it. We have been unable to do it and I think the American \npeople have suffered.\n  When I was reading through the comments of the President, they had a \nwisp of the kind of comments made 35 years ago when a comprehensive, \nuniversal program was proposed. At that time the opponents said, Can \nyou imagine, this bill to have a universal, comprehensive program will \ncost $100 billion?\n  Let me remind America, this year we are going to spend $1.8 trillion, \nand $500\n\n[[Page S9162]]\n\nbillion of that $1.8 trillion has been the increase of the cost of \nhealth care for American families since this President assumed office. \nHello? Hello, Mr. President? Five hundred billion dollars, half a \ntrillion dollars in increases, and what do you get for it? I will come \nback to that.\n  The basic point, so all of us know what John Kerry is fighting for, \nis to let the American people buy the same kind of insurance policy we \nhave. Who are we? We are Members of the Congress of the United States. \nWe are Senators of the United States. We are executive members of the \nU.S. Government. We have a very good program. John Kerry believes that \nsame program ought to be made available to the American people. But \nPresident Bush does not, nor does the Republican leadership. That is \nthe basic difference.\n  We know we have a very good program. There is not a Member of this \nbody, not a single Member of this body who doesn't have the Federal \nEmployees Insurance Program. It is an excellent one. We pay 25 percent \nof the premium and the taxpayers pay 75 percent. That is true with \nregard to the President of the United States. I wonder, for all those \npeople who were out in that crowd yesterday listening, what percent are \nthey paying for their premiums? I doubt if 2 percent or 3 percent or 4 \npercent of the crowd he was talking to have the same quality of health \ninsurance we have in the Senate.\n  It bothers me when we have statements which misrepresent what my \nfriend and colleague is fighting for, which I believe in very deeply. \nThat the American people are entitled to and should have the same kind \nof health insurance everyone in this body has. That is the issue.\n\n  This President says no to that. The Republican leadership says no to \nthat. In the meantime, what they do reminds me very much of what they \ndid with regard to the Iraqi policy. They misrepresent, they distort, \nand they basically deceive the American people with regard to the facts \nof the opposition. That is what they have done with regard to Senator \nKerry's position.\n  We have a campaign on. I was here during the debates on the Medicare \nprogram. We had legitimate debates on it. It is true the Republicans \noverwhelmingly opposed Medicare, as they opposed Social Security. So \nwhen you listen to a lot of our colleagues--including this \nadministration--talk about how they are for comprehensive universal \nhealth care, we ought to say: Hello? When did that come about? We \nhaven't heard that for the last 4 years.\n  I challenge any Republican to identify the legislation that has been \nadvanced, put before the Senate, that would provide the kind of \ncomprehensive, universal health care coverage at the cost people can \nafford. It is not there. This administration has not fought for it, \ndoesn't believe in it, and is distorting and misrepresenting the \nprogram John Kerry has offered.\n  There has been reference today to ``Medical Costs Eat At Social \nSecurity.'' I wonder if the President mentioned that yesterday. When \nthe actual publication of the Medicare actuaries came out, they \ndesignated these increases, not by dollars, but by lines. That is \nbecause this administration has been hiding the costs of their various \nprograms. It even says here at the bottom of the article which Senator \nDaschle has had printed, that Foster, who is one of the principal \nspokespersons for the administration ``is at the center of another \ndispute over missing data. He said he withheld from Congress higher \ncost estimates for the Medicare law last year. . . .''\n  Hello? Here it is, the administration trying to hide the costs of \nMedicare, and complaining, out in Michigan, about the costs of Senator \nKerry's health care program. The article says Foster ``withheld from \nCongress higher cost estimates last year at the direction of a Bush \nappointee.''\n  A Bush appointee? Hello, Mr. President, why haven't you mentioned \nthis in your comments about Senator Kerry?\n  That would be sad enough, if it weren't for the real results of these \nincreases and in particular the failure of this administration to get a \nhandle on health care costs and on prescription drugs. With the passage \nof what I call the good-for-nothing Medicare bill the President \nreferred to as--well, he talks about:\n\n       I was sent to Washington to do something, so we modernized \n     Medicare . . . [Listen to this, so we modernized Medicare] \n     with the Medicare bill that was passed just this last year.\n\n  We will come to that in a moment. But let's look at what is happening \nto the increased costs on Social Security. I draw your attention to \nthis chart entitled ``The Bush Medicare Program, Health Costs \nImpoverish Senior Citizens.''\n  These are not the figures of the Senator from Massachusetts. These \nare the figures of the Office of the Actuary, Department of Health and \nHuman Services. The chart they used in the article, ``Medical Costs Eat \nAt Social Security,'' is for a 65-year-old. This is for an 85-year-old. \nThese are the members of the ``greatest generation.'' These are the men \nand women who fought in World War II, the great generation that lifted \nthe Nation out of the Depression, fought in World War II.\n  By 2006, 43 percent of their Social Security benefit is going to be \nused to pay for the premium and the copayments under Medicare. In 2016 \nit will be 52 percent. By 2026, it will be 65 percent. That is 43 \npercent by 2006. How are our seniors going to do it? Well, Senator \nKennedy, we have had an increase in the cost of health care, and this \nhas been terrible but this administration has tried to do something \nabout it. Baloney. This administration has done nothing about the \nhealth care costs that are out of control.\n\n  This chart shows that health care costs are out of control. This \nchart indicates the increase in the premiums that we have seen during \nthe period of 2001 cumulatively to 2004. The blue indicates the CPI \nduring that period of time. What we have seen cumulatively is the CPI \nhas gone up 9.2 percent, and health care costs, 59 percent.\n  Costs are out of control. Where is the administration's answer to the \ncost of the control? Why aren't we debating that on floor of the Senate \nafter we do homeland security? Why aren't we doing it? We have an \nopportunity to do something about it with the reimportation. You just \nheard the majority leader say we were not going to consider it at this \ntime.\n  The President says costs are out of control. We say OK. Let us do \nsomething. Let us make a downpayment and try to get a handle on \nprescription drugs. The majority leader and the President say: No. You \ncan't do that. We are not going to let you do that. We are going to \nblock you here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Here it is with regard to the general costs being out of control in \nrelation to the CPI.\n  Let us look at health care costs. Family coverage costs have \nincreased in 2004. It was $6,348; now it is $9,050. For single coverage \nin 2000 it was $2,400; now it is $3,600.\n  That is what has been happening over the period of the last 3 years \nunder this administration. What is their answer? No. The one thing we \ncan do about getting a handle on costs and we are not going to let you \ndo it; we are not going to do reimportation.\n  Look at the Bush record with regard to the price of prescription \ndrugs. This chart, based on data from HHS, CPI and the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics shows the cumulative changes in the CPI and the cost of \nprescription drugs from 2001 to 2003. The CPI grew at 6.8 percent over \nthe period of 2001, 2002, and 2003, and the cost of prescription drugs \nat 51.5 percent. How are our seniors going to do it? They can't do it. \nThey make the choice between nutrition and prescription drugs, between \nheating their homes and prescription drugs, between food and \nprescription drugs, in my part of the country, in walling off part of \ntheir houses in the wintertime because they can't afford heating oil \nand prescription drugs. It is happening every single day. Can't we do \nsomething about it? Sure we can, as we have pointed out.\n  The costs of these prescription drugs are a half or even a third of \nthat in other places around the world.\n  We have ways to deal with both the costs as well as the safety. But \nno, the administration won't do it. We see that the administration has \nbasically abandoned any effort to do something about getting a handle \non costs. We have seen the total amount that has been expended in this \ncountry increase by $500 billion, from $1.3 trillion to $1.8 trillion.\n\n[[Page S9163]]\n\n  We have seen the President talking about the opposition while John \nKerry is trying to get a universal comprehensive program. It ought to \nbe a matter of right in this country. The President says no. And we \nhave denial on the floor of the Senate on the day after the President \nhas spoken of doing something about getting a handle on costs, and this \nadministration wants 4 more years? Talk about irresponsibility. They \nmislead us in going into Iraq. They mislead us in the use of \nintelligence. They mislead the people of Iraq, and they have done the \nsame thing on health care. How long are we going to take it? What do \nthe American people need?\n  Here it is with the number of the uninsured--large and rising by 1 \nmillion a year in the increase of the uninsured. Look at this. That is \nthe census figure. Look at this. Seventy-three million of our fellow \ncitizens are without health insurance coverage at some point in this \nyear--for at least 1 to 4 months. This is why the Americans who have \nhealth insurance know that they are a pink-slip away from losing it.\n\n  We have seen an explosion of part-time workers. Do you think they get \nhealth insurance coverage? Absolutely not; a fraction of them maybe, \nbut a great majority don't. We see the whole movement away from the \nemployer-based system to part-time work. That is what is happening out \nhere across this country.\n  Under the Medicare bill, 3 million American retirees are going to be \ndropped and low-income seniors will pay under newer financial \nprovisions. Premiums are going to be affected and 15 million seniors \nare going to be disadvantaged under current Medicare. That is the \nsituation. This is the Medicare bill that was passed.\n  Look at what has happened. Here we have excess payment to HMOs of $46 \nbillion and a $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies. If \nyou want to know where expenditures are, if you want to know what is \ncosting more for the average taxpayers, we have given $139 billion over \nthe next 8 years as windfall profits to the prescription drug industry, \nand we have given the HMOs $46 billion.\n  My fellow citizens, if you want to go out and invest in something, go \nout today and invest in HMOs and prescription drugs because we have \nguaranteed it.\n  Talk about small business--I wish small business had that kind of \nguarantees and Government payouts. Talk about competition, it doesn't \nexist in that Medicare bill. That is what the problem is. The drug \nindustry is doing well and the HMOs are doing well but the average \nworkers are not doing well.\n  Let us level with the American people about what the real debate is \nabout in this Congress. Let us not distort and misrepresent the \nposition of the opposition. I know the Republicans were against Social \nSecurity, I know they were against Medicare, and I know they were \nagainst a comprehensive prescription drug program that would have made \na difference. We had a good one which actually got 76 votes. It was \nbipartisan. It was not this program.\n  But then the hand of the White House ruled and we have massive \ngiveaways to the drug industry and to HMOs. That is why we see the \nincrease--a failure of leadership on health care in the last 4 years, \nand the denial on the floor of the Senate to our Democratic leaders and \nto this party to do something about it.\n  We want to do something about it. We have a bipartisan bill to do \nsomething about it. Why, Mr. President, when you make those speeches \nout there in Michigan, why don't you call up the Republican leadership \nand do something about it?\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9163-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9163-S9164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak on another \nsubject, but after listening to the Senator from Massachusetts I want \nto try to respond to some of the comments he made.\n  There is no question that we have a health care crisis in this \ncountry. There is a great deal of disagreement as to why. There is no \nquestion that the issue is tremendously complicated and does not lend \nitself to a solution with a single silver bullet. I am interested at \nthe suggestion that the silver bullet to solve the rising health care \ncosts is to allow drug reimportation. We have had that suggestion made \nhere this morning. I would like to talk about that for a moment.\n  The evidence is that drug importation or reimportation, whichever \nphrase you choose, does not, in fact, produce major savings, except on \nan anecdotal basis; that is, one senior here or there might receive a \nsignificant benefit but overall the benefit of importation is very \nlimited.\n  A recent London School of Economics study shows that parallel trade \nin drugs in Europe where they have importation back and forth across \nthe borders has resulted in a savings of less than 2 percent by \nconsumers. A World Bank study found that parallel trade in Sweden cost \nconsumers as much as it saved them after accounting for reshipping and \nrepackaging costs as well as profits for the traders.\n  So to stand here and say, whatever the decibel level, that we can \nsomehow solve the problem if we just adopt the reimportation \nlegislation that is being proposed is to go in the face of previous \nexperience. I would be willing to adopt this just to prove the point if \nthere were not a downside connected with it that our friends on the \nDemocratic side do not talk about.\n\n  I have a sister-in-law who is a very aggressive shopper. She is a \nsenior. She is very familiar with the Internet. She makes sure she gets \nthe best deal in every circumstance. She takes prescription drugs and \ngets on the Internet and discovers that she can find a price cheaper on \nthe Internet, if she buys overseas, than the price she can get at her \nlocal druggist.\n  She came to me and asked: Bob, is this a good idea? Now, I am not one \nof your constituents. I don't want a political answer. I am your \nsister-in-law who is trying to save money, and I want the truth. Is \nthis a good idea for me to get my prescription drugs in Canada where \nthe prices are so much lower?\n  I said to her: Based on what I know, if you get on a bus or a plane \nand drive to Canada and walk into a Canadian drugstore and buy the \ngoods over the counter, chances are you will get reliable drugs at a \nlower price, and that will be the thing for you to do. On the other \nhand, if you get on the Internet and order these drugs to be shipped to \nyou across national boundaries, there is no guarantee whatever that the \ndrugs you will get will be the drugs you think you are getting.\n  Indeed, if we are going to talk anecdotal evidence, as we have been \nin the Senate, there are plenty of examples of people who have gotten \non the Internet, gone to a Web site that appears to be in Canada, \npurchased drugs in Canada at a lower cost, and said to themselves: \nAren't I a hero for being able to lower my drug costs so much.\n  Then when the drugs arrived, they found that while they may have been \ntransshipped from Canada, they were produced in Bangladesh or Nigeria \nor wherever else in the world. There is absolutely no guarantee the \ndrugs they are buying at such attractive lower prices are, in fact, the \ndrugs that are outlined on the label of the bottle or box they receive.\n  Indeed, one of the interesting things that has started to happen is \nnot only are we seeing degradation of the quality and accuracy of drugs \nbeing shipped across borders as a result of Internet sales, the \nCanadians themselves are beginning to lose control of the quality in \ntheir pharmacies. There are so many different sources of drugs now \navailable that even within the network of drug distribution points \nwithin Canada, they cannot be sure of the purity and state of their \ndrugs.\n  I am interested that there are those in the Senate who have said the \ndrug companies are making enormous profits, and all we need to do is \ncut out those profits, lower the price of drugs, and everything will be \nfine, and at the same time they are insisting we have to have more \nresearch. What has lowered the cost of health care on a per person \nbasis? It is the introduction of new wonder drugs. Where did the new \nwonder drugs come from? They do not come out of the air. They do not \ncome as a result of Federal legislation. We cannot pass a bill in the \nSenate that says there will be a new drug that will solve this, that, \nor the other problem. Drugs come as a result of research.\n\n[[Page S9164]]\n\n  We talk about the profits of the drug companies. I am not here to \ncarry any water for the drug companies, but I have been a businessman \nlong enough to know that profits that show up on a balance sheet or a \nprofit-and-loss statement do not automatically go immediately into the \npockets of the Donald Trumps and the Warren Buffetts of the world. \nProfits get retained in companies. There is an accounting term for it \ncalled retained earnings.\n  What do companies do with those retained earnings? They invest them \nin research. It takes roughly $1 billion to determine whether a new \nidea for a drug will produce a drug that works. A company has to have \nenough financial strength that it can put $1 billion into research to \nproduce one drug.\n  That is expensive enough. You can spend millions of dollars on a drug \nthat does not work before you know it is not going to work. So the \namount of profits they will make on the drugs that do work not only \nhave to recover the cost that it took for the drug that does work, but \nit has to recover the millions again and again for the drugs that do \nnot work.\n  To suggest there is a silver bullet to the rising health care costs, \nand that the silver bullet can be found in beating up the drug \ncompanies and buying drugs from Canada, is to demonstrate vast \nignorance of the way the free market really works.\n  Let me make, again, the standard statement that I make over and over \nin the campaign. I am not questioning the patriotism of my friends \nacross the aisle. I am questioning their wisdom and their judgment and \ntheir decisions, but I am not questioning their patriotism. We hear \nthat over and over again.\n  Finally, we hear the drug benefit that was passed in this body \ndenigrated again and again on the Democratic side of the aisle, the do-\nnothing program, the program that did not do anything for senior \ncitizens, and the cry that has gone out to the point that I find many \nof my constituents believe this program is so complicated that nobody \ncan figure it out, and nobody can get any benefit from it.\n  Senator Hatch and I put together a series of town meetings across our \nState. We gathered seniors. We said: Here is how it works. We walked \nthem through how to get on the Internet and order drugs. Then we said: \nIf this is too complicated for you, you are not Internet friendly. Get \nyour grandchild to get on the Internet, and they can make it work. If \nyou do not have a grandchild who can make it work, call 1-800-Medicare, \nand the person who answers the phone will get on the Internet for you \nand make it work.\n  We took seniors out of the audience, asked what drugs they are \ncurrently taking, then, on the Internet, we checked it. They came back \nand said: We are going to save 45 to 50 percent of our drug costs, and \nthis was easy. This was simple.\n  Talk about misleading the American people. Those who stand in the \nSenate at a high decibel rate attacking this bill are misleading the \nAmerican people. Senator Hatch and I found with our constituents this \nprogram is easy to deal with. It will save up to half of your drug \ncosts right now, and it is the law. You do not have to wait for an \nelection or for an eruption to have this come to pass.\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will not be offended \nwhen I disagree with them when they say: The President has lied. The \nPresident has misled. That is election year rhetoric that we should \nlearn to ignore, and spend our time on the reality, which is this \nCongress, under this President, has, in fact, done significant things. \nAnd if we will just level with the American people as to what we have \ndone, they will find that it is easy to navigate, and it will produce \nsignificant financial benefit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah. His \ncomments are right on. When I have an hour or two I will be happy to \nexplain my strenuous opposition to this issue of importation of \npharmaceuticals from countries that can very much harm our patients in \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9164-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9164-S9167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ANTI-JEWISH SENTIMENT IN EUROPE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Today, as I come forward--and Senator Brownback will be \njoining me in a few minutes--as we enter into Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish \nnew year, a time of reflection for the Jewish people, I thought it \nwould be appropriate to reflect upon the state of affairs with respect \nto Jewry around the world and the frightening rise in anti-Semitism we \nhave seen in many parts of the world, and I argue, unfortunately, even \nin this country.\n  Senator Brownback will talk about a different aspect than I, and \nthere will be some speakers tomorrow morning during morning business \nwho will cover various other aspects of this problem.\n  An area I have been particularly concerned about is the rise of anti-\nSemitism in Europe. As we know, the roots of anti-Semitism in various \nparts of Europe are very deep, and we have seen the horrific \nconsequences of that within the last century. It is important, as a \nresult, to keep a very close, watchful eye on any precursors to what \ncould be another tragic, horrific situation occurring on that \ncontinent.\n  There is a rabbi, Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who said--and this \nquote, to me, is quite telling--``Let it not be said of us that we saw \nthe tiny flame but did not put it out until it became a raging fire.'' \nI think that is one of our duties and responsibilities as the leader of \nthe free world, in our diplomatic bodies around the world and through \ndiplomatic channels country to country, to use our good offices in \nAmerica to make sure we are watchful, and we do more than just watch \nidly, to call attention to situations which are of concern to us as \nfreedom-loving people and as people who put first among our freedoms \nthe freedom of conscience.\n  The freedom of religion is the fundamental and first of our freedoms \nbecause all freedoms flow from that. If you do not have the freedom to \nbelieve what you want to believe, then freedom of speech is a \nmeaningless freedom, freedom of assembly is a meaningless freedom. So \nthis is the first of the freedoms, and it is one that we believe, as \nAmericans, very strongly.\n  We believe, as the President says, that liberty, that basic freedom \nis the right of all people given by God. Yet we see, in Europe in \nparticular, a growing and rising tension in the world, in that \ncontinent.\n  I submit for the Record recent incidents of anti-Semitism in Europe, \njust in this year, the year 2004. I will go through and pick one \nincident from each of the countries I will talk about. Unfortunately, \non this list--which is about 5 pages long--almost half of the incidents \noccurred in France. I have had meetings with the French Ambassador on \nthis issue and expressed concerns about religious freedom and expressed \nconcerns, via correspondence and meetings, about anti-Semitism. Yet \nthis is a growing problem in this region of the world. But it is not \nonly in France.\n  This first example is of a situation in France. This is a situation \nwhere we have the World War II memorial to Jewish soldiers in Lyon, \nwhere you have swastikas painted on the memorial.\n  You have instance after instance--and I think there are, as I said, \n5\\1/2\\ pages of this document that I will be submitting for the \nRecord--talking about anti-Semitic activity, whether it is graffiti or \nturning over tombstones, destroying graves, whether it is vandalism of \nsynagogues, or whether it is assaults on Jewish children, particularly \nin school and coming from religious schools. We are seeing it more and \nmore and more.\n  We need to understand this is not a problem that will go away if we \nignore it. This is a problem which we have to speak up on and bring \nattention to.\n  In Belgium, four Jewish teenagers, all students from the same school \nin an Antwerp suburb, were attacked by a group of 15 men. One of the \nJewish students was stabbed in the back and seriously injured. Again, \nan attack, in this case, by ``youth of Arab origin.''\n  In the Czech Republic, some 80 tombstones were overturned in a Jewish \ncemetery in Hranice in the east of the Czech Republic.\n  In Austria, a Holocaust memorial was desecrated, with the word \n``lie'' spray painted over a historical plaque. This memorial near \nVienna is at the site of a former concentration camp.\n  In Germany, in Dusseldorf, vandals sprayed swastikas and SS symbols \non at least 40 gravestones at a Jewish cemetery.\n\n[[Page S9165]]\n\n  In Hungary, a Jewish cemetery in northern Hungary was vandalized. \nMore than 90 gravestones were smashed only weeks after the cemetery had \nbeen renovated by the local town council to mark the 60th anniversary \nof the Holocaust.\n  In Moldova, vandals threw Molotov cocktails at the synagogue in \nTiraspol.\n  In Poland, in Krakow, police discovered the desecration of a 19th \ncentury synagogue. Vandals had painted swastikas on a Star of David \nhanging from gallows on the Tempel Synagogue.\n  In Romania, the wall of a Jewish cemetery in northwestern Romania was \nsmeared with swastikas as well as anti-Semitic and fascist slogans.\n  In Russia, there were several instances of vandalism and an explosion \nin Debent that shattered several windows in a synagogue in the southern \nregion of Dagestan.\n  In Ukraine, more than 50 gravestones were vandalized in a Jewish \ncemetery.\n  In Great Britain, the British rabbi--I will put up another quote from \nhim--said, ``Jews wait anxiously for the next news of a synagogue \nvandalized, a cemetery desecrated, a Jewish school set on fire, Jews \nattacked in the streets.''\n  In London, only a couple months ago, there was an arson attack on a \nLondon area synagogue, destroying religious books, including some that \nhad been smuggled out by Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis. A burning \nrag was thrown into the South Tottenham United Synagogue.\n  In Birmingham, just last month, 60 Jewish gravestones were destroyed \nin a cemetery.\n  We can go on and on and on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the full text of this document \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Recent Incidents of Anti-Semitism in Europe (2004)\n\n\n                                Austria\n\n       June 1, 2004.--Villach.--A memorial honoring Holocaust \n     victims in southern Austria, consisting of 17 glass plates \n     engraved with the names of 108 local Holocaust victims, was \n     smashed. The memorial, which was created in 1999, was \n     previously damaged by vandals in March 2003.\n       January 18, 2004.--Hinterbruehl--A Holocaust memorial was \n     desecrated, with the word ``lie'' spray painted over a \n     historical plaque.

A Jewish cyclist in \n     Berchem had stones and bottles thrown at him by a group of 15 \n     youths. He escaped injury. In the second attack, a young \n     Jewish man was found bleeding on the street. His attacker was \n     described as ``Eastern European origin.'' No arrests have \n     been made.\n       June 24, 2004.--Antwerp--Four Jewish teen-agers, all \n     students from the same school in an Antwerp suburb, were \n     attacked by a group of 15 men described by authorities as \n     ``youth of Arab origin.'' One of the Jewish students, who was \n     stabbed in the back, was seriously injured with a punctured \n     lung. In response to the attack, ADL wrote to the Belgian \n     Ambassador urging an investigation.\n\n\n                             Czech Republic\n\n       August 10, 2004.--Hranice--Some 80 tombstones were \n     overturned at the Jewish cemetery in Hranice in the east of \n     the Czech Republic.\n\n\n                                 France\n\n       August 26, 2004.--Paris--The director of the main public \n     library, the Bibliotheque Publique d'Information, announced \n     that anti-Semitic inscriptions were found stamped into a \n     dozen books about the Dreyfus case and legal issues. The \n     vandals stamped the edge of the books with the \n     words ``Against the Jewish Mafia and Jewish Racism'' with \n     the addresses of a Holocaust denial and Islamic propaganda \n     Web sites.\n       August 14, 2004.--Paris--Anti-Semitic graffiti, including a \n     sign saying ``death to Jews'' and a swastika, was found \n     scrawled on a wall on the grounds of Notre Dame Cathedral. \n     Police are investigating.\n       August 9, 2004.--Lyon--Some 60 gravestones were vandalized \n     with swastikas in a Jewish cemetery in Lyon in southeastern \n     France. On August 15, a 24-year-old man turned himself in to \n     Paris police and admitted to desecrating the graves in Lyon. \n     He did not appear to have links to far-right groups and told \n     investigators that he was inspired by a television \n     documentary about American racist groups. A state prosecutor \n     said that the man was inspired by a hatred of Arabs.\n       July 28, 2004.--Saverne--Thirty-two tombstones were \n     vandalized with swastikas, Stars of David and satanic ``666'' \n     symbols in a Jewish cemetery in the Alsatian town of Saverne, \n     north of Strasbourg. The vandalism was discovered by a family \n     member visiting the cemetery.\n       June 11, 2004.--Rivesaltes--A Holocaust-era mural painted \n     by Jewish children in a transit camp who were being held \n     before being sent to Nazi death camps, was discovered \n     vandalized in southwestern France. A historian visiting the \n     site, where 4,500 Jews and Gypsies were held, found that the \n     mural had been chiseled off the wall. According to The \n     Independent, in 1942, a Swiss nurse at the camp asked the \n     children to paint a Swiss landscape on the infirmary wall. \n     The painting was discovered in 1999 and was to become the \n     central exhibition of a Holocaust museum at the Rivesaltes \n     transit camp. Half of the inmates of the transit camp, \n     including 400 children, were later killed in Auschwitz. \n     French government officials condemned the incident, and the \n     Interior Minister promised that the mural would be restored.\n       June 4, 2004.--Epinay-sur-Seine--A 17-year-old Jewish \n     student was stabbed by a man with a knife shouting ``Allahu \n     Aqbar'' (G-d is great in Arabic). The student was leaving a \n     Jewish school in the northern Parisian suburbs. The attacker \n     tried to hurt two other students with a screwdriver. The \n     student was in serious, but not critical condition. President \n     Jacques Chirac condemned the attack and the French Interior \n     Minister, Dominque de Villepin, visited the scene.\n       May 30, 2004.--Boulogne-Billancourt--A 17-year-old Jewish \n     youth was attacked outside his home in a Paris suburb by a \n     group of young men yelling anti-Semitic slogans. The youth is \n     the son of a local rabbi. President Jacques Chirac condemned \n     the attack.\n       May 7, 2004.--Villier-le-Bel--A small explosive device was \n     discovered outside a synagogue north of Paris. According to \n     media reports, the bomb was in a bag with the writing ``Boom \n     anti-Jews'' and a swastika. On May 14, an 18-year-old man was \n     found guilty of putting the fake bombs on the grounds of the \n     synagogue and was sentenced to two months in prison.\n       May 6/7, 2004.--Verdun--A memorial to Jewish soldiers who \n     died in the Battle of Verdun was vandalized. Nazi slogans and \n     symbols were scrawled on the memorial. The Battle of Verdun \n     was fought between French and German armies near the northern \n     French city in 1916.\n       May 4, 2004.--Paris--In the suburb of Cretiel, a rabbi and \n     his young son were attacked on their way home from Friday \n     night services.\n       April 29/30, 2004.--Colmar--A Jewish cemetery in the Alsace \n     region in eastern France was vandalized. At least 127 \n     headstones were spray painted with swastikas and anti-Semitic \n     statements. The cemetery dates back to the 18th century. The \n     attack was condemned by numerous French officials, including \n     President Jacques Chirac.\n       April 4, 2004.--Valenciennes--A synagogue in northern \n     France was defaced with neo-Nazi slogans, including \n     swastikas, and ``One people, one empire, one leader, 59 \n     years, sieg heil.'' The 59 is believed to be a reference to \n     the 59 years since the death of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.\n       March 23, 2004.--Toulon--A Jewish synagogue and community \n     center was set on fire. According to media reports, the \n     arsonist broke a window and threw a Molotov cocktail into the \n     building. There was minor damage and no injuries.\n       January 23, 2004.--Villiers-au-Bois--Two gravestones marked \n     with Stars of David were damaged in the World War I cemetery \n     of Villiers-au-Bois near the English Channel coast.\n       January 20, 2004.--Strasbourg--A parked minibus used to \n     transport children to a Jewish school in the eastern French \n     city of Strasbourg was burned.

A \n     burning rag was thrown into the south Tottenham United \n     Synagogue.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. But what we see here is a very troubling trend in an \narea of the world which has been, unfortunately, a hotbed for this kind \nof behavior which has led to horrific consequences. We have an \nobligation, particularly in this region of the world, to point out to \nthe governments of those countries the importance of making sure that \nreligious liberty is respected, and religious liberty of all faiths, \nbut in particular any kind of rise or any kind of motion toward a \nreturn to a horrific time in the world's history.\n  This is one of the reasons I wanted to get up and talk today. I think \nit is important that we bring attention to this issue, as well as the \nbroader issue of anti-Semitism.\n  Later, we will hear people talk about the acceptance--it is almost \nincredible to believe--the acceptance of anti-Semitic behavior at our \ncolleges and universities here in the United States of America, as well \nas a whole host of problems.\n  Mr. President, I see my time is up. I know the Senator from Kansas is \nhere. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor addressing the topic of anti-Semitism and anti-Israelism expanding \nin the world. I have comments to add to this issue as well.\n  This is a disheartening development that is taking place. We are \nseeing it. It is being documented. I say to my colleagues, if they are \ninterested, I have ``The Rise of Anti-Israelism & Anti-Semitism,'' by \nDr. Gary Tobin, Dr. Alexander Karp, and others. It is a good 2, 2\\1/2\\ \ninches thick, documenting what is taking place in the world today. It \nis full of pictures and leaflets that are being distributed. Some of \nthem are ghastly to look at. I do not want to show them on the Senate \nfloor because they are so dark and evil and diabolical. But I think it \nis something for people to be able to see the documentation.\n  When I first heard about this developing, I said this can't really \ntake place now. We are 60 years out from Auschwitz. That is close \nenough. People are still alive who experienced this. Surely this does \nnot happen in the world today. Yet it does. We need to identify it as \nevil and dark and wrong and castigate it and tell people this is wrong \nand stand up against it. And it is, unfortunately, well documented \nabout what is taking place.\n  I particularly thank my colleague Senator Voinovich for his tireless \nwork in promoting the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004 and \npushing to identify and get at the roots of the issue.\n  In his book titled ``Never Again? The Threat of the New Anti-\nSemitism,'' National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham \nFoxman, likens anti-Semitism to a disease. He says:\n\n       Like many diseases, it spreads from person to person. It \n     can be inherited--not genetically, of course, but through the \n     malign impact of a bigoted adult on his or her children and \n     grandchildren. It can lie dormant within an individual, \n     sowing symptoms only in times of stress. And at times when a \n     community is vulnerable, it can spread rapidly, causing an \n     outbreak that is equivalent to an epidemic.\n\n  We cannot tolerate further spread of this epidemic. Many of us here \nassociate anti-Semitism with the hatred of Jews that hit Europe in the \n1930s and escalated to the genocidal measures of Adolph Hitler and the \nNazis. However, as President Bush stated in a recent speech:\n\n     . . . Anti-Semitism is not a problem of the past; the hatred \n     of Jews did not die in a Berlin bunker. . . . The \n     demonization of Israel, the most extreme anti-Zionist \n     rhetoric can be a flimsy cover for anti-Semitism, and \n     contribute to an atmosphere of fear in which synagogues are \n     desecrated, people are slandered, [and] folks are threatened. \n     . . .\n\n  This hatred of Israel and her people continues, endorsed and \npropagated by many states and their leaders.\n  In a time when we are concerned about terrorism and security, some \nmight question the need to focus on a problem like anti-Semitism. The \nissues of terrorism and anti-Semitism are inseparably married, wedded \nby their intolerable hatred of Israel and Jews. They are joined \ntogether by their disgust for defenders of peace and democracy. The \neerie and lasting relationship of state-sponsored terrorism and state-\nsponsored anti-Semitism is destroying hope of peace for future \ngenerations.\n  In the book I just referenced, the authors state:\n\n       Terrorism has clearly been chosen and relied upon as a \n     primary tactic by the world's most vehement anti-Israelists \n     and anti-Semites: despotic Arab dictatorships. Syria, Iran, \n     Saudi Arabia, and Palestine are all led by those who have \n     chosen to use fear and terror to weaken Israeli resolve.\n\n  In the State Department's Pattern of Global Terrorism report released \nin 2001, it certifies that:\n\n       Iran's involvement in terrorist-related activities remained \n     focused on support\n     for groups opposed to Israel and peace between Israel and its \n     neighbors. . . . Supreme Leader Khamenei continued to refer \n     to Israel as a `cancerous tumor' that must be removed. . . .\n\n  The most recent report states that:\n\n       During 2003, Iran maintained a high-profile role in \n     encouraging anti-Israeli activity, both rhetorically and \n     operationally. . . . Iran provided Lebanese Hizballah and \n     Palestinian rejectionist groups--notably Hamas, the Palestine \n     Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of \n     Palestine-General Command--with funding, safe-haven, \n     training, and weapons.\n\n  That is from our own State Department.\n  In Foxman's book, he reiterates the trend of state-sponsored \nterrorism taking a more religious approach:\n\n       So today, thanks to the propaganda of a number of \n     fundamentalist Islamic clerics, supported by Arab leaders in \n     many countries, the Arab-Israeli conflict has been \n     transformed from a nationalist struggle into a religious \n     one. When Palestinian suicide bombers go out on their \n     deadly missions, they wrap themselves not in the banner of \n     the Palestinian Authority but in the green and white flag \n     of Islam. When terrorists record videotapes to inspire \n     their followers and frighten their opponents, they don't \n     talk about demands for land or autonomy, they talk about \n     religious martyrdom and about their wish to kill Jews.\n\n  We are living in a critical period of history. The war for \ncivilization--and our very way of life--is being fought not only in \nBaghdad and Kabul, but it is being fought in Jerusalem a well, and has \nbeen for a long time. This battle pits democracy against \ntotalitarianism. It pits freedom against subjugation. It pits a culture \nthat values life against a culture willing to throw it away with \nneither remorse nor regret.\n  While the global war on terror is our common cause now, peace and \nreconciliation are our actual objectives. Through time immemorial, the \npeople of Israel have simply sought and taught of peace; of a time when \nswords would be beaten into plowshares; and children would be taught of \nwar no\n\n[[Page S9167]]\n\nmore. When the lion would lay down with the lamb and there would be no \nmore tears. Yet today we are beset with hostilities. Nations are \nembracing terrorism. Hatreds exist without reason.\n  Peace and truth go together. We must speak of peace with all who \nembrace peace and speak the truth about those who do not. Evil must be \nidentified for what it is and once exposed to the sunlight of the \ntruth, will waken, whither and fall. Terrorism and anti-Semitism are \nevil and must be rejected by all civilized people and every nation. \nTerrorism is practiced on the innocent and anti-Semitism on the \nvulnerable, and they are tools of dark souls. Those that employ these \nmeans must be confronted and renounced by all humanity.\n  Let us call on Syria and Iran, Sudan and North Korea to embrace the \nnobility of their heritage and renounce terrorism and anti-Semitism. \nImmunity from the wrath of hatred is impossible, but inoculation from \nthe spread of this disease to future generations is both possible and \nnecessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

We will consider those amendments and deal with them in an \norderly way. We hope we can reject most of them. There are some we can \nagree to.\n  I see my good friend from Connecticut is on the floor and has an \namendment. I am happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending \namendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3630\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment on behalf of myself and \nSenator Specter to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Specter, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Levin, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kennedy, \n     Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3630.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the amount provided for fire department staffing \n               assistance grants; and to provide offsets)\n\n       On page 21, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n\n\n               Fire Department Staffing Assistance Grants\n\n       For necessary expenses for programs authorized by section \n     34 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 \n     U.S.C. 2229a), to remain available until September 30, 2006, \n     $100,000,000: Provided, That not to exceed 5 percent of this \n     amount shall be available for program administration: \n     Provided, further, That the amount appropriated by title I \n     under the heading ``Office of the Under Secretary for \n     Management'' is hereby reduced by $70,000,000, the amount \n     appropriated by title IV under the heading ``Information \n     Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Management and \n     Administration'' is hereby reduced by $20,000,000, and the \n     amount appropriated by title IV under the heading ``Science \n     and Technology Management and Administration'' is hereby \n     reduced by $10,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment dealing with \nthe SAFER Act. This is the No. 1 priority of the various firefighting \norganizations of the United States, whether they be paid firefighters, \nvolunteer firefighters, fire chiefs organizations, and others. On \nbehalf of Senators Specter, Levin, Harkin, Kennedy, Sarbanes, Daschle, \nSchumer, and myself, we offer this important amendment.\n  I want to take a few minutes, with the full recognition that my \nfriend and colleague from Mississippi wants to move matters along. I \nwill take as little time as I can to explain this amendment and what we \nare trying to do, why I think it is a worthwhile amendment, how we pay \nfor it, and why I don't feel that the offset we are suggesting here in \nany way would be detrimental to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Our amendment will help the 33,000 fire departments across America--\npaid departments, volunteer departments, and combination departments. \nIt will help them acquire the necessary personnel they need in order to \nfight fires and respond to situations all across the country, \nparticularly terrorist incidents and other large-scale emergencies that \nmay emerge.\n  Just yesterday, I spent a couple of hours with the fire department of \nEnfield, CT. I went out on one of the calls--a traffic accident. It \nturned out not to be a serious emergency, but the first vehicles to \nactually respond to the situation were the fire departments of Enfield. \nThat happens every single day in this country. I think one firehouse in \nEnfield--one of five--has some 1,200 calls they respond to each year, \nto give you an idea of the magnitude of emergencies these departments \nare called upon to respond to every day of the year, all hours of the \nday and night.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is the single most important \nlegislative priority of the International Association of Firefighters. \nIt is also strongly supported by the International Association of Fire \nChiefs and the National Volunteer Fire Council. If our colleagues \nsupport firefighters--and I know many, if not all, do--this is an \nopportunity to support bipartisan legislation that will make a huge \ndifference in the personnel area of a fire department.\n  In particular, this amendment provides $100 million for the SAFER \nAct, which stands for Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency \nResponse. It was enacted last year with significant bipartisan support \nas part of the fiscal year 2004 Department of Defense Authorization \nAct. In fact, the lead sponsors at that time were Senator Warner of \nVirginia, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, along with \nSenators Sarbanes, Daschle, Snowe, Clinton, Corzine, Durbin, Johnson, \nKerry, Landrieu, Murray, Reed, and Schumer.\n  The House of Representatives also has championed very similar, if not \nexact, legislation. It has been supported by the Chairman of the House \nScience Committee, Sherwood Boehlert of New York; Republican \nCongressman Curt Weldon, a tremendous champion of firefighters for many\n\n[[Page S9168]]\n\nyears; along with House minority whip Steny Hoyer, and Representative \nBill Pascrell, a strong advocate of firefighters.\n  The $100 million our amendment provides is fully offset by reductions \nin management and administrative expenses in title I and title IV of \nthe underlying bill. Even with these offsets, the accounts that will be \naffected will still receive an increase over last year's funding \nlevels.\n  After all, this debate is fundamentally about priorities. Senator \nSpecter and I strongly believe the need for additional firefighters on \nour Nation's streets far outweighs the need for increased resources \ndevoted to administration and management in Washington, DC.\n  If I can, I will explain how this offset works because I know my good \nfriend from Mississippi will want to address this. I know that my \nfriend from Mississippi has a very difficult job trying to put a bill \ntogether that is balanced. I respect him immensely for having to \nwrestle with these important issues. Certainly, I would have supported \na larger 302(b) allocation for homeland security, but that is a debate \nfor another day.\n\n  Nevertheless, Senator Specter and I have chosen these offsets with a \ngreat deal of care. In no instance do they cut programs below last \nyear's levels. They don't affect the intelligence community in any way. \nIf anything, our offsets will respect the increases in the underlying \nbill but grant smaller increases. In addition, these offsets are from \nincreases to administrative and management accounts. We believe it is \nmore important to place new firefighters on the streets than new \nmanagers and administrators in Washington. I will mention specifically \nwhat we are doing.\n  The Office of the Undersecretary for Management in Title I, for \nexample, received a significant increase in this bill over last year's \nlevel. Last year, we funded it at $130 million. This year, the Senate \nbill provides an increase to $245 million for the same office. That is \nan 88-percent increase over last year! If our amendment is adopted, the \nOffice of the Under Secretary of Management would still receive a 35-\npercent increase over last year's bill.\n  It seems to me that if we were gutting the Office for Undersecretary \nfor Management and making it impossible for it to operate, others could \nargue we don't have a good case. But in order to help put 75,000 new \nfirefighters on the street over the next seven years, I think is a fair \ntradeoff.\n  Under title IV of the bill, the $30 million we offset only comes from \nmanagement and administrative expenses. By the way, with that cut we \nare talking about, we still leave the level under title IV higher than \nwhat is in the House-passed bill.\n  We don't believe these offsets we found are in any way damaging to \nthe underlying bill. They still allow for substantial increases in \nmanagement and administrative costs, as well as leaving title IV in the \nsame position it would be funded at in the House-passed legislation.\n  You don't have to take our word on the importance of the legislation \nand the need for increasing the number of people we have in our fire \ndepartments. The U.S. Fire Administration--not the firefighters, not \nthe fire chiefs, but U.S. Fire Administration--and National Fire \nProtection Association found that fire departments throughout the \nNation, rural America and urban America, lack sufficient personnel to \nadequately protect the public.\n  These concerns were echoed last year in the Council on Foreign \nRelations report, authored by our former colleague Warren Rudman. The \nreport was entitled ``Emergency Responders: Drastically Underfunded, \nDrastically Underprepared.'' It noted that ``only 10 percent of fire \ndepartments in the United States have the personnel . . . to respond to \na building collapse.'' It also found that ``two-thirds of our fire \ndepartments do not meet the consensus fire standard from minimum safe \nstaffing levels,'' which is at least four firefighters per truck at the \nscene of an emergency.\n  If our colleagues are not concerned about these findings, they ought \nto be concerned about the Rudman report's conclusion. It said:\n\n       If the Nation does not take immediate steps to better \n     identify and address the needs of emergency first responders, \n     the next terrorist incident could have an even more \n     devastating impact than the September 11 attacks.\n\n  On Saturday our Nation commemorated the third anniversary of that \ntragic day three years ago. No American citizen will ever forget--no \ncitizen in the world, for that matter, could ever forget--the heroism \nof the firefighters who were among the first on the scene that day and \nwho charged the stairs, while everybody else was running out of these \nbuildings.\n  Those 343 members of the New York Fire Department made the ultimate \nsacrifice that day in their efforts to save thousands of lives trapped \nin the World Trade Center.\n  After September 11, of course, we realized that firefighters face new \nand profound challenges. No longer do they just fight fires, promote \nsafety, and inspect fire code violations. Firefighters still have those \ntraditional responsibilities, but they are now called upon to do far \nmore. They are now asked to respond to the threat of biological, \nchemical, and even nuclear terrorism. In other words, they are asked to \nconfront what once seemed unthinkable on American soil. It is, \ntherefore, not an exaggeration to say that the Nation's firefighters \nare now literally on the front lines of the war on terror, protecting \nour Nation from the very clear and present danger of future terrorist \nattacks.\n  In the past, the Congress has come to the aid of America's \nfirefighters. We have provided substantial funds for the FIRE Act Grant \nProgram, which I also authored with my good friend Senator DeWine of \nOhio. FIRE Act grants have enabled fire departments, large and small, \npaid and volunteer, to purchase the necessary equipment and train \nfirefighters. That assistance allows them to do a better job. In \nEnfield, CT, yesterday, I saw exactly the kind of equipment that can be \npurchased with a fire grant proposal. It has made a huge difference to \nthat one department in a relatively small community in my home State of \nConnecticut.\n  While training and equipment are extremely important, they are \nmeaningless, obviously, without the personnel needed to take advantage \nof it. After all, what good is a new breathing apparatus if there is no \nfirefighter to use it? What good is new protective clothing if there is \nno firefighter to wear it? What good are new firetrucks if there are no \nfirefighters to drive them? What good are new portable radios if there \nare no firefighters to communicate with each other?\n  We cannot lose sight of the human side of this important issue. It \ntakes significant manpower to rush into burning houses and buildings, \nto save the life of a child, deliver emergency medical services and \nrespond to an incident involving a chemical or biological agent. It is, \ntherefore, this shortfall in firefighter staffing that this bipartisan, \nfully offset amendment that I am offering with Senator Specter and \nothers addresses.\n  The manpower situation was not always this dire. Yet over the past \ntwo decades the number of firefighters as a percentage of the U.S. \nworkforce has declined considerably. I am going to put up a chart that \nlays out exactly what has happened. This chart will give us a clear \nunderstanding of the problems that exist.\n  Only 11 percent of fire departments can handle, with local personnel, \na building collapse with 50 occupants or more in it. That means 89 \npercent of our departments cannot respond to that. Only 13 percent of \nfire departments can handle a hazardous material incident with chemical \nor biological agents and 10 injuries. Again, 87 percent cannot respond \nto this in an adequate way. Forty percent of fire department personnel \ninvolved in hazardous material response lack formal training in these \nduties, and 60 to 75 percent of fire departments do not have enough \nfire stations to achieve widely used response time guidelines. That \ngives some idea just in a brief synopsis of how serious the problems \nare across our country as far as the lack of personnel.\n  In 1983, for example, there was 1 firefighter for every 212 of our \ncitizens. In the year 2000, there was only 1 firefighter for every 260 \nAmericans. To put it another way, the number of firefighters has \ndeclined by almost 20 percent, nearly one-fifth, over the last two\n\n[[Page S9169]]\n\ndecades. In fact, we have fewer firefighters per capita than nurses and \npolice officers.\n  The amendment I am offering with our colleagues, if it is approved \ntoday, will hopefully begin to reverse this disquieting trend. In fact, \nthe fire chief at Enfield, CT, told me that when he joined the \ndepartment, there was a waiting list in order to get on the fire \ndepartment. Today they are out every single day seeking to find people \nwho will make this a career choice. In fact, they are understaffed at \nthat particular station house.\n\n  As to our volunteer departments across the country, particularly in \nrural America, the days when people would be able to serve in a \nvolunteer fire department and work in the town they lived in is \ndiminishing. More and more people are choosing to live in rural \nenvironments and work someplace else, and they are unable to be \nvolunteer firefighters in the home communities. Thus, the number of \nhired personnel becomes more important. In rural and urban America, the \nproblem is the same.\n  These numbers I have just cited have recently been exacerbated by the \nfact that many firefighters have been called to active duty in the \nNational Guard or Army Reserves. According to a recent survey, the \nsmallest fire departments are disproportionately affected by the call-\nup of military personnel, and I note the presence of the Presiding \nOfficer who comes from the State of Wyoming, where again a lot of small \nrural communities have been disproportionately affected by the call-ups \nand are feeling it in a very significant way. We are told that these \ndepartments are the least able to absorb the loss of trained staff and \nwill stand to benefit from assistance made available under this \namendment.\n  Finally, making matters worse for the fire services are the budget \ncrises that State and local governments are enduring. This amendment is \nnot suggesting that this ought to be a permanent program where we \nassume the responsibility of paying for the personnel at local fire \ndepartments across America; it is saying that the U.S. Government ought \nto be a better partner. Just as we have been doing with the COPS \nprogram, we can be so doing with our fire departments--not at the same \nlevel, not even close to the same level--but being a better partner to \nhelp get this on the right track again. Then hopefully, as our economy \nimproves, our State and local governments will take over the \nresponsibility.\n  Over the next 5 or 6 years, stretching this out, not trying to do it \nin 1 year, we can make a real difference in putting some people on the \nground who can make a difference and save lives in this country.\n  Across our Nation today, firefighter staffing is being cut, and fire \nstations are being closed because of State and local budget shortfalls. \nThese events are occurring at the same time that threats to our Nation \nby terrorism are placing unprecedented demands on the Nation's fire \nservices.\n  I need not remind our colleagues this morning that we are currently \nspending billions of America's tax dollars to reconstruct Iraq. Some of \nthose very funds are being spent to hire and train Iraqi firefighters \nand build fire stations in that nation. If we can find the resources to \nhire firefighters and renovate fire stations in Iraq, I do not think it \nis outrageous at all to suggest that we might find some resources to \nmake a difference in hiring some people to protect our own communities \nin this great Nation of ours.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that our amendment is fully paid for, with \nreductions in management and administrative expenditures, by allowing \nfor an increase of 35 percent in those areas, reducing the increase \nfrom 88 to 35 percent, and still by allowing under title 4 the amount \nfor administrative and management expenditures at levels above those \nincluded in the House-passed bill.\n  It also has the endorsement of every major firefighter organization \nin this country. This is their No. 1 bill. This is their No. 1 \npriority. If we are going to go back home and talk about the importance \nof homeland security and doing a better job, standing up for these men \nand women who put their lives on the line every single day for our \ncountry, then it seems to me the very least we can do is see to it that \nthey have the necessary personnel to do the job, and that is what we \nare asking for with this amendment.\n  America's firefighters are always the first ones in and the last ones \nout. They risk their own lives to save the lives of others. They stare \ndanger in the face every single day because they know they have a duty \nto fulfill. On the third anniversary of the September 11 attacks, where \n343 firefighters lost their lives doing just that, first ones in and \nlast out, I believe there is no better way for us to commemorate \nSeptember 11 and recognize the contribution of those individuals than \nto respond to the very organizations who represented them, who have \nasked us to do a bit better under this bill to see to it that our \nfirefighters have the necessary personnel they need in order to do \ntheir job.\n  I thought I had already done this, but if not, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Clinton of New York be added as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. At the conclusion of these remarks, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the letter of full endorsement of the Dodd-Specter amendment by \nHarold Schaitberger, general president of the International Association \nof Fire Fighters, be printed in the Record. I have mentioned already \nwhere the fire chiefs are on this issue. I also ask unanimous consent \nthat the letter from Chief Robert DiPoli, who is the president of the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, of full endorsement of this \nlegislation as well be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  This is their priority. This is their opportunity. I need not waste a \nlot more time talking about this. I am sure my colleagues understand \nits importance. I hope on one of these amendments, a bipartisan \namendment, our colleagues would see fit to be supportive of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                             of Fire Fighters,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2004.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our nation's more than 265,000 \n     professional fire fighters, I am writing to urge your support \n     for the Dodd-Specter amendment to the Homeland Security \n     Appropriation (HR 4567) to provide $100 million for a fire \n     fighter staffing initiative. The amendment is fully offset, \n     and enjoys bipartisan support.\n       As you know, Congress last year enacted the SAFER Fire \n     Fighters Act to address the critical staffing shortage in \n     both career and volunteer fire departments nationwide. While \n     other federal programs, such as the FIRE Act, have provided \n     funding for fire fighter training and equipment, no federal \n     assistance is currently being provided to ensure that fire \n     departments have adequate personnel to take advantage of \n     these resources.\n       Studies conducted by FEMA, the Council on Foreign \n     Relations, and other organizations have consistently found \n     that fire departments throughout the nation lack sufficient \n     personnel to adequately protect the public. The SAFER Fire \n     Fighters Act addresses this need by providing temporary \n     matching funds to enable fire departments to hire additional \n     fire fighters, and providing grants for the recruitment and \n     retention of volunteer fire fighters.\n       Thank you for your consideration, and your continued \n     support of America's fire fighters. If you have any questions \n     about this issue, please feel free to contact Barry Kasinitz, \n     IAFF Director of Governmental Affairs, at 202-824-1581.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Harold A. Schaitberger,\n     General President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                               of Fire Chiefs,\n\n                                  Fairfax, VA, September 13, 2004.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nation's fire chiefs, I urge \n     you to vote for the Dodd-Specter Amendment to the homeland \n     security appropriations bill. This amendment would fund the \n     Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response \n     Firefighters Act of 2004 (the ``SAFER Act'') at $100 million \n     in Fiscal Year 2004 (FY05).\n       Established in 1873, the International Association of Fire \n     Chiefs (IAFC) is a powerful network of more than 12,000 chief \n     fire and emergency officers. Our members lead fire \n     departments in responding to structural and wildland fires, \n     hazardous materials incidents (including chemical, \n     biological, radiological, and nuclear events), technical \n     rescues (including swiftwater rescues, confined-space\n\n[[Page S9170]]\n\n     rescues, and auto extrication, among others), and emergency \n     medical situations.\n       The SAFER Act would go along way toward ensuring the safety \n     of the public--and firefighters--during each of these \n     emergency events. Large numbers of fire departments respond \n     with an inadequate number of personnel. National Fire \n     Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 1710 requires that, at \n     a minimum, four members of a fire or emergency medical \n     services company respond to an event. Often, however, more \n     personnel are needed. In initiating a complete attack on a \n     structural fire, for example, four firefighters are needed to \n     meet OSHA's ``Two In/Two Out'' rule of having two \n     firefighters inside the building and two outside, in case \n     those inside need to be rescued. An incident commander is \n     also required, along with a firefighter operating the water \n     pump and one person ventilating the building.\n       Congress authorized the SAFER Act to grant federal funds to \n     local communities to hire more firefighters. Grants would be \n     awarded on the basis of need through a competitive, peer-\n     reviewed process modeled after the highly successful \n     Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, which assists fire \n     departments in funding much-needed equipment and training. \n     The grants would be for a four-year period and must not \n     exceed a total of $100,000 per firefighter. They require \n     communities to match the grant (at 10, 20, 50 and 70 percent \n     in years one through four of the grant, respectively, to \n     phase down local government dependence on the federal \n     government). Recipients would be required to retain new hires \n     for at least one year following the conclusion of federal \n     funding.\n       Because volunteer firefighters are such an important part \n     of America's fire service, SAFER contains a specific \n     provision to make sure that 10 percent of the appropriated \n     funds are used for departments with majority volunteer or all \n     volunteer personnel. In addition, at least 10 percent of the \n     total appropriated funds must be used to recruit and retain \n     volunteer firefighters.\n       Please vote for the Dodd-Specter Amendment to fund SAFER in \n     FY05.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Chief, Robert A. DiPoli,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we appreciate very much the offering of \nthe amendment by the Senator from Connecticut. We oppose the amendment, \nand I have some very persuasive comments I am going to make on that \nsubject. But before I proceed to do so, the Senator from New York has \nindicated an interest in offering an amendment and describing it to the \nSenate. I am happy to withhold my discussion of the Dodd amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent, if the Senator has no objection, to set \naside his amendment temporarily so the Senator from New York can offer \nher amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the courtesy of \nmy friend and colleague. I know, though, that the Senator from \nConnecticut is still on the floor. Perhaps he would want to hear the \nimmediate response from the chairman of the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee. So given that, if it is appropriate, I ask \nunanimous consent I be permitted to follow Senator Cochran, upon the \nconclusion of his response to Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the bill we presented to the committee--\nand the committee approved it and referred it to the Senate for its \nconsideration--has been very carefully crafted, analyzing the needs of \nthe Department. We conducted a lot of hearings. We have been in \nconsultation with the administration, the officials at the Department \nwho are administering these programs, trying to make sure that, across \nthe board, we are utilizing the funds that are available to us to get \nthe maximum amount of benefit, in the most efficient way possible, to \nidentify the critical and emergency needs we have, and to try to \naddress those in a way that helps guarantee the safety and security of \nour homeland.\n  This is an important and very challenging task for the Senate. We \nappreciate the fact there are going to be differences of opinion and \nthere are going to be suggestions made to increase this account or that \naccount, reducing the funding for another, and that is what the Senator \nhas proposed: that we add money for firefighter grants; that we take \naway money from other accounts in the bill, administration accounts. It \nis an easy vote to add money for a popular program. That is the easiest \nthing that we can do as a Representative or a Senator.\n  I am not suggesting the amendment is offered just because it calls \nfor an easy vote, because this amendment suggests not only adding money \nfor a popular program, but it also offsets by cutting funds for some \nthat may not be as popular or as well known or understood as well as \nthe firefighter program.\n  We all know firefighters. We know what they do. We know how \nheroically they performed on 9/11, and how much we depend on them every \nday. So we want to be sure they are well funded, that they have the \ntraining they need and the equipment they need, so we want to be \ngenerous.\n\n  That is why I point out at the outset that Senator Frist and Senator \nByrd, the former chairman of the full committee, the ranking Democrat \non this subcommittee, and I joined in offering an amendment early in \nthe consideration of this bill to increase firefighter assistance to \n$750 million. The bill now contains the level of funding that was \nincluded in last year's appropriations act for these purposes.\n  If you look at the history of funding of these programs, the \nfirefighter assistance grants alone have received over $2.1 billion in \nfunding since fiscal year 2002.\n  This does not reflect the resources that have been made available for \nfire departments through the basic State grant program or from State \nand local government support. They have, after all, the initial \nresponsibility for these activities.\n  The amendment suggests offsets that we cannot afford to take. We are \ngoing to put at risk the Department of Homeland Security's initiatives \nin many areas if these offsets are approved in this amendment. For \nexample, the suggestion of the Senator from Connecticut would reduce \nthe Under Secretary for Management by $70 million, the Information \nAnalysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate's account by $20 \nmillion, and the Science and Technology Directorate's account by $10 \nmillion.\n  Buffer zone protection plans for critical infrastructure cannot be \ncompleted if the offset, cutting funds for the Infrastructure \nProtection Directorate, is approved. If the amendment is adopted, \nfunding the Homeland Security Operations Center, which serves as the \nnerve center for sharing information across all levels of Government \nand the private sector, will be decimated.\n  In addition, the Homeland Security Information Network will not be \nable to provide threat information to State and local government \nentities as they are expected to do without the funds that are cut out \nof the bill by the Dodd amendment.\n  The management administration account, which is in the Science and \nTechnology Directorate, provides the front line workers of the \nDirectorate the funds for grants to university-based research \nfacilities where many of the new technologies are being developed and \ndesigned, to more fully protect the safety and security of our \nhomeland.\n  An immediate freeze is called for in all Federal hiring. The cut \nwould decrease management administration accounts below last year's \nlevel, significantly and adversely affecting the number of employees in \nthe Science and Technology Directorate.\n  The cut in funding could require a layoff of workers due to the \nreconfiguration and prioritization that is called for at that \nDirectorate.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will carefully review the effect of this \namendment, the damage that it would do to programs that are already \nunderway that have to do with threat vulnerability programs that we \ncannot afford to abandon at this point. We want to work with the \nfirefighter programs and make sure the grant programs are continued. \nThey are generously funded in this bill, as I have pointed out, and \nthey have been. We will continue to defend them, and we will work in \nconference to try to accommodate some of the concerns the Senator has \nmentioned in his excellent remarks.\n  For these and other reasons which I may state before we actually get \nto a vote on this amendment, I urge the Senate to vote against and \nreject the amendment proposed by Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. If I may briefly respond, let me thank my colleague again. \nAs I\n\n[[Page S9171]]\n\nsaid at the outset, he has a difficult job. Everyone has different \nideas. I understand he has to balance all these.\n  If I may respectfully challenge what he said on the offsets, because \nthis is a critical question and obviously we have to pay for these \ninitiatives. We took money from two different titles in this bill, \nTitle I and Title IV.\n  In Title I, which is where the bulk of the money would come from for \nthe amendment, it would still leave an increase in the account of 35-\npercent over last year. The offset reduces it from an 88 percent \nincrease that is in the underlying legislation.\n  I should mention at the outset, and I don't want to confuse our \ncolleagues, that there are two separate proposals. One is the FIRE Act \ngrant initiative, which the committee has been very supportive of, and \nI appreciate that. The bill has funding for $700 million for the FIRE \nAct grant program, which provides assistance for training and \nequipment. This amendment, however, is about personnel, which is a \ndifferent issue. Our argument is that you can get a grant for new \nequipment, but it is meaningless if you don't have the personnel to do \nthe job. That is why the SAFER bill is a top priority for the fire \norganizations.\n  Second, when it comes to the Title IV offsets, you still leave the \nadministrative and management dollars at a level higher than what is in \nthe House-passed bill.\n  So it is not bare-bones budgeting at all in this area. In those three \ncategories, we are leaving more money than was in last year's budget, \nand at least as much as in the House-passed bill in either case.\n  We did it very carefully with the full knowledge that you don't want \nto be robbing Peter to pay Paul, as the expression goes, or cut into \nother critical areas. So by reducing across the board in these \nmanagement areas, bringing them down to levels that still are above \nwhat they were previously, we think we have come up with a very \nbalanced approach that deals with a very serious problem, and that is \nthe 20-percent decline in the number of personnel that is affecting \npaid and volunteer departments across the country. It is a glaring \nproblem that even the U.S. Fire Administration, aside from what \nfirefighters and fire chiefs are saying, believes is absolutely \ncritical.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Mississippi for allowing me to bring \nup the amendment by having a unanimous consent to set aside pending \namendments. If need be, Senator Specter may also want to share some \ncomments before we finally vote on the matter. Would that be \npermissible?\n  I understand that at a later time another Senator wants to talk on \nthis before we actually vote. Would that be permissible?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think we \nhave an opportunity for Senators to discuss these amendments out of \norder, if they would like. I don't think there would be any objection \nmade to that.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, knowing that the Senator from New York \nwishes to offer an amendment, I am not going to talk long. But I want \nto make one observation. We ought not to be getting into the business \nin the Senate of deciding for States and localities how they spend this \ngrant money or how they spend the SAFER Act money. We need to have the \nflexibility to make those decisions with State and local governments. \nIf we start telling a fire department they have to buy equipment with \nthis amount of money, that they have to train people with this other \namount of money, they have to equip trucks and vehicles with this \namount, this amount is for that or the other, we are making a big \nmistake.\n  We are not the managers of these departments. We are not in the \nposition to make the best decisions about how to efficiently use funds \nfrom Washington that will help our communities be safer and improve the \nquality of service provided by firefighters, law enforcement personnel, \nemergency management workers, or the rest. That is why the grant \nprograms are broad and general. The States develop the plans for using \nthe funds available to them from the Department of Homeland Security in \nmany of these areas. It is the States and localities we ought to depend \non to make the best decisions.\n  If we did what the Senator from Connecticut is suggesting we do, we \nwould get into the business of making these departments allocate funds \nfor one category or one specific activity or the other, and that is a \nbig mistake. Adopting this amendment flies right in the face of the \nadministrative policies that this Department is trying to develop and \nimplement, and it is working to make our communities safer because we \nare leaving the decisions to those who are in the best position to know \nwhat is needed in their communities.\n\n  Do the firefighters need training in a certain area or another? I \ndon't know the answer to that, if it applies to a fire department in my \nState. But the chief may know. He ought to know. He is in a better \nposition to make the recommendations to the State officials as to what \ntheir needs are.\n  These people are applying for these funds. They are having to set out \nhow they propose to use them. At other levels of administration, the \ndecision is made to assign priorities and which ones have a higher \npriority than another.\n  That ought not to be made on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It is a \nmistake to get into the details as suggested by this amendment and take \nmoney away from activities that are ongoing, that are planned for this \nyear, and then cut the funding for it. That is just going to make it \nmore and more difficult to have a coherent, balanced approach to \nhomeland security.\n  We hope the Senate will reject the amendment of the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3631\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Clinton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3631.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Homeland Security to allocate \n    formula-based grants to State and local governments based on an \n assessment of threats and vulnerabilities and other factors that the \nSecretary considers appropriate, in accordance with the recommendation \n                        of the 9/11 Commission)\n\n       On page 19, line 21, insert ``, which shall be allocated \n     based on factors such as threat, vulnerability, population, \n     population density, the presence of critical infrastructure, \n     and other factors that the Secretary considers appropriate,'' \n     after ``grants''.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I again appreciate the courtesy of our \nchairman and colleague, the Senator from Mississippi. I also applaud \nhim for taking on a heavy responsibility with respect to Homeland \nSecurity appropriations. I am going to be offering two amendments that \nI believe are necessary.\n  This first amendment is intended to do what every expert who has \nlooked at homeland security has recommended and advised us to do.\n  Most recently, the 9/11 Commission reached the very same conclusion; \nthat is, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security should \nallocate formula-based State and local homeland security grants on the \nbasis of threats and vulnerabilities and other factors that the \nSecretary deems appropriate.\n  There are two major categories of grant money going from Washington \nout to the States and localities with respect to homeland security. One \nis called the State Homeland Security Grant Program. The other is the \nLaw Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Grant Program.\n  As the Commission stated:\n\n       We understand the contention that every State and city \n     needs to have some minimum\n\n[[Page S9172]]\n\n     infrastructure for emergency response. But Federal homeland \n     security assistance should not remain a program for general \n     revenue sharing. It should supplement State and local \n     resources based on the risks or vulnerability that merit \n     additional support. Congress should not use this money as a \n     pork barrel.\n\n  The Commission, as we know, made a number of recommendations, some of \nwhich are being considered in other bills. We will have reports from \nsome of the committees working on intelligence reform and the like. But \nthis is a recommendation that we can and should act on now while we are \ndebating and considering Homeland Security funding.\n  Specifically, my amendment does not affect the State minimum in the \nbill. I would underscore that, because I know there are legitimate \nconcerns on the part of my colleagues which I share.\n  I represent a very diverse State. We have a lot of rural areas. We \nhave a lot of open space up in particularly the northern part of the \nState and the western part of the State. I know very well that every \nState has legitimate needs. My bill does not affect the State \nminimum. It states that the grant funds above the State minimum should \nbe allocated based on factors such as threat, vulnerability, \npopulation, population density, the presence of critical \ninfrastructure, and other factors that the Secretary considers \nappropriate.\n\n  In crafting this amendment, only the factors mentioned by the 9/11 \nCommission were included, no more and no less.\n  As my colleagues know, the 9/11 Commission recommended that an \nadvisory committee be established to advise the Secretary on any \nadditional factors that the Secretary of Homeland Security should \nconsider, such as benchmarks for evaluating community homeland security \nneeds. As the Commission stated in its report, ``the benchmarks will be \nimperfect and subjective, and they will continually evolve. But hard \nchoices must be made. Those who would allocate money on a different \nbasis should then defend their view of the national interest.\n  Not only did the 9/11 Commission recommend that such changes be made \nin how Federal homeland security funds are allocated, but so did the \nother commissions that we quote in the Senate all the time, commissions \nsuch as the Homeland Security Independent Task Force of the Council on \nForeign Relations, chaired by former Senator Warren Rudman. In fact, \nevery homeland security expert I have talked to has said that the way \nthe administration has chosen to allocate funding beyond the PATRIOT \nAct minimum--in other words, the State minimum that everybody will \nget--to allocate the additional funding beyond the minimum, on a per \ncapita basis, simply makes no sense other than--I grant this--political \nsense. In this area of homeland security, we must, as the 9/11 \nCommission urged us to do, leave our politics at the door.\n  This should be a debate about what is in the best interests of our \nentire country, every region, and particularly on the basis of those \nthreats and vulnerabilities that place certain parts of our country at \ngreater risk than others.\n  I am concerned because in the Senate report accompanying the bill \nthat is now before the Senate, there is language that says Secretary \nRidge must allocate funds beyond the all-State so-called PATRIOT \nminimum on a per capita basis. In other words, we are not even leaving \nit to chance. We are not even leaving it to the discretion of the \nSecretary. In the report language of this bill, we are directing, or \ncertainly strongly urging, the Secretary to allocate that funding on a \nper capita basis. That is literally the antithesis of the September 11 \nreport, the Rudman task force. It is also the antithesis of what we \nhave heard time and time again from Secretary Ridge and even from \nPresident Bush and homeland security experts.\n  The Rudman task force unequivocally made clear that for the sake of \nhomeland defense we must employ a better formula. Certainly, they \nreached the same conclusion as the 9/11 Commission. I am a little \nconcerned we have report language in our Senate bill that goes so \ncontrary to what everyone has said needs to be done.\n  We have talked many times about the need for a better formula, and we \nshould continue to talk about it until we actually do something. But it \nis discouraging to talk and not act and, in fact, to continue to go in \na different direction.\n  It is important when we make the decisions about this that we \nrecognize--I am not just talking about New York or Washington, although \nthey were specifically mentioned in the 9/11 Commission--there are \nother parts of our country that have critical infrastructure. For \nexample, in southern Louisiana, we have a major port. We have offshore \npetroleum platforms. We have part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \nriver road crossing, facilities pumping natural gas.\n\n  Considering that complex critical infrastructure, I imagine the \nSecretary of Homeland Security might very well determine the State of \nLouisiana should get some extra threat-based funding in order to deal \nwith what is a very real danger.\n  We have communities such as Lancaster County, PA. We think of that as \nthe home of the Amish and beautiful rolling countryside, but it also \nhas two nuclear powerplants within the borders of that county. There \nare only five counties in the entire country that are in that position. \nAgain, I argue that should be taken into account.\n  None of this could be taken into account, however, if we follow the \nHouse bill or we follow the report language of the Senate bill and see \nwhere the Secretary is being directed to continue to distribute this \nmoney on a per capita basis.\n  In closing, with respect to this amendment, it is simply long past \ntime that we conclude that we must do something on a threat basis, and \nin order to do that, we need to give direction to the Secretary. He and \nI have had many conversations about this. He has expressed to me on \nmany occasions his desire to provide threat-based funding, but his \nbelief is that his hands are tied, because we continue to send the \nmessage to him and to the entire country we are going to distribute \nthis money on a per capita basis.\n  I ask that the pending amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3632\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I send this amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Clinton], for herself and \n     Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 3632.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To appropriate an additional $625,000,000 for discretionary \n           grants for high-threat, high-density urban areas)\n\n       On page 39, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       Sec. 515. (a) It is the sense of the Senate that in \n     allocating Urban Area Security Initiative funds to high-\n     threat, high-density urban areas, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security should ensure that urban areas that face the \n     greatest threat receive Urban Area Security Initiative \n     resources commensurate with that threat.\n       (b) The amount appropriated to the Office of State and \n     Local Government Coordination and Preparedness for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2005, for discretionary grants for \n     use in high-threat, high-density urban areas under title III \n     of this Act is increased by $625,000,000.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. In addition to my first amendment, which would provide \nthe Secretary with the discretion to distribute money above the State \nminimum, above the so-called PATRIOT Act minimum on the basis of \nthreat, Senator Schumer and I offer this amendment to provide an \nadditional $625 million for high-threat urban areas. This is a separate \ncategory of funding in homeland security in addition to the other two I \nmentioned.\n  In this category, we know that the Secretary does have discretion, \nbut what we have found is that over the last several years the \ndiscretion that he has felt obligated to exercise has meant less money \ngoing to more places as opposed to concentrating money on a threat \nanalysis so we could really take care of the needs of particular areas \nand then move on down to take care of the needs of others.\n  Last week, when Secretary Ridge spoke at the National Press Club, he \nsaid:\n\n\n[[Page S9173]]\n\n\n       I would tell you that we assess the level of terrorist \n     threat outside of Washington and New York, which will always \n     be at the top of the list. I mean, that's just a fact of \n     life. . . . I'm not telling you anything [new]. It's not \n     news.\n       New York City, for obvious reasons--the impact on the \n     economy and al-Qaida has always talked about the disruption \n     or the undermining of our national economy. It's not just the \n     iconic nature of New York City. A lot of the stock exchanges, \n     the financial services community drives not only our national \n     economy but the international economy.\n       And Washington, D.C., the nation's capital, will always be \n     targets.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission and all the commissions before it, President \nBush, and Secretary Ridge have all acknowledged the acute homeland \nsecurity needs of high-threat urban areas, especially New York and \nWashington.\n  I was delighted the recent Republican convention in New York went so \nwell. Everyone seemed to have a great time in the greatest city in the \nworld. The amount of work, the extraordinary expense of making it run \nso smoothly, was defrayed to some extent by Federal assistance, but to \na large measure it reflected the ongoing investment that the people of \nthe city of New York and the State of New York made in ensuring that we \nare always on high alert because, in fact, in New York City we are \nalways on high alert.\n  Yet despite that, last year, the Department of Homeland Security \nallocated only $47 million to the New York City area under the high-\nthreat program. They admit that was insufficient. Everyone who looked \nat it knows it is insufficient.\n\n  Our mayor has come forth with a very scrubbed list of immediate needs \nthat is in the area of about $600 million just for New York City. That \nis why I am offering this amendment along with my colleague. I \nrecognize Secretary Ridge has the authority to allocate high-threat \nresources in the way he deems appropriate. But, unfortunately, there is \nnot enough money in the pot for him to do the job he knows needs to be \ndone. So my amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that in \nallocating resources under the Urban Area Security Initiative, the \nSecretary should allocate commensurate with the threat these areas \nface.\n  Now, $47 million, which was the allocation last year to New York \nCity, is a lot of money. But it pales in comparison to the $200 million \nthe New York City Police Department alone spends on counterterrorism \nactivities and the $1 billion in New York City's specific homeland \nsecurity needs.\n  My guess is many of our guests at the Republican Convention enjoyed \nthe city in part because the police presence was so pervasive and the \nreputation of our firefighters so well deserved for courage and bravery \nthat it was not a matter you needed to think much about. You could get \nout and enjoy the city and go back and forth to hotels and go out for \nmeals and maybe even go to the theater. I was thrilled by that. I am \nalways very happy when people come to New York City.\n  But the very bottom line is, we are not getting adequate funding to \nbe as prepared as we need to be. And other high-threat areas are also \nin the same position. I hope we are able to recognize these two \namendments are real, commonsense amendments. They are aimed at making \nsure the money gets where it is most needed and at increasing the money \nthat is specifically addressing high-threat urban areas. Because, \nunfortunately, we are playing a little bit of a shell game here. We are \ncutting money for first responders, which is why I strongly support the \namendment from my colleague, the Senator from Connecticut.\n  We are expecting those firefighters and police officers and emergency \nresponders and emergency room doctors and nurses and others to be ready \nwhen we need them. Hopefully, we will not need them, but they better be \nready if we do need them. Yet we are cutting money for first \nresponders. The omnibus Byrd amendment that we failed to pass in the \nSenate last week tried to address that. It is unfortunate we are taking \nmoney away with one hand while we are giving it back with the other. \nBut what we are giving back does not make up for either what was lost \nor what is needed.\n  I hope we can address the continuing emergency needs when it comes to \nour first responders. There is nothing more important--I am told this \nall the time--than funding specifically for interoperable \ncommunications systems. Unfortunately, there is no money in this bill \nto help our first responders do that. This is something we have talked \nabout now for 3 years. Our police and firefighters could not talk to \neach other in New York. This is a problem that happens all over the \ncountry. Yet we do not seem to address it.\n  Again, the 9/11 Commission came forward with a good recommendation:\n\n       [H]igh-risk urban areas such as New York City \n     and Washington, D.C., should establish single corps units \n     to ensure communications connectivity between and among \n     civilian authorities, local first responders, and the \n     National Guard. Federal funding of such units should be \n     given high priority by Congress.\n\n  I hope we will do that before we finish this bill. I hope we can \nrecognize that in most parts of our country that face these risks--\nwhether it is a tourist attraction such as Las Vegas or a large \nmelting-pot city as Los Angeles or, of course, other cities of similar \nsize and population density--having interoperable communications among \nand between first responders is essential to being able to deal with \nboth threat and reality.\n  We are on the lookout for potential terrorist activities and we need \nto be able to hope that all of our various law enforcement and \nfirefighting responders and others are preventers as well as responders \nand are well equipped to do that. We can do the right thing by \nincreasing the amount in the high-threat urban areas. If we put in the \n$625 million Senator Schumer and I are recommending in this amendment, \nwe would bring the total appropriated amount to $1.5 billion. This is \nthe amount I have been arguing for and fighting for in legislation I \nintroduced back in January of this year. It is also in line with \nPresident Bush, according to his proposed fiscal year 2005 budget. In \nthat budget, he called for $1,446,000,000 specifically for high-threat \nurban areas.\n  So again, everybody seems to be in sync except our Congress. I do not \nunderstand that. I find it bewildering that we have the administration \nproposing this amount of money, we have every expert proposing this \namount of money, but when it comes to action on the floor of the Senate \nand the House, somehow we do not do it. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport both of my amendments. I hope they will go along with the 9/11 \nCommission report which has won broad bipartisan support. It is, \napparently, the fastest selling paperback in the country. A lot of \nAmericans are reading it, digesting it. It is not only a debate among \nexperts and policy wonks and security gurus.\n  There is now a debate that is happening out in America. And it is a \nlife-or-death debate. It goes to the heart of whether we are serious \nabout homeland security, whether we are going to put our dollars where \nour words have been, whether we are going to get the results we need so \nwe can feel confident we have done everything we know to do.\n  So I ask my colleagues for support of the two amendments I have \noffered today and, in keeping with the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission, to do so in a broad bipartisan way that sends a signal to \nnot only our Nation but to any who wish us ill anywhere in the world \nthat we are vigilant, we are prepared, we are doing all we humanly know \nto do to prevent and deter attacks and respond effectively should one \noccur.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3631\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am sure Senators are aware that the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee of the Senate has jurisdiction over the \nlegislative authority, the law, creating the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. In that, legislation grant programs are described, allocation \nformulas are contained, that give guidance to the distribution of \nFederal funds to States and localities for various programs.\n  The Senator from New York is suggesting, by her first amendment, that \nthe appropriations bill that is before the Senate should be amended to \nchange the way the grants are being given to States and localities. The \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee has already addressed this issue. \nHearings have been held. A review and consideration of various changes \nin the allocation process have all been reviewed. And the committee has \nacted.\n\n[[Page S9174]]\n\nThey have reported out of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee S. \n1245. That is a Senate bill called the Homeland Security Grant \nEnhancement Act. The act, as reported by the committee, will modify the \nformula for distributing domestic preparedness grants.\n  If the Senate wants to take action as suggested by the Senator from \nNew York, it can adopt that bill or amend it as may be suggested by the \nSenator from New York. That is the appropriate vehicle for revising \nfirst responder grant funding, not this appropriations bill. We are \nbound by the law. We are funding the programs authorized by the law. We \nare giving funds according to the priorities of that law. Every time we \nhave an annual appropriations bill, we cannot change the way those \nformulas are written. That would be bad policy, bad practice, and it \nshould not be followed in this instance on this issue.\n  Every State in the Nation is entitled to a base level of Federal \nsupport for homeland security needs. A State's size or population does \nnot necessarily reflect the level of danger to a State's population or \nto a city's population. Each State has the responsibility to make \ndecisions that are designed to protect the property and the lives of \nits citizens, and they must allocate State resources--and local \nresources may be allocated as well--to train, equip, and maintain \nqualified first responders for those purposes.\n  I believe the committee has done a very good job of analyzing and \nrecognizing the needs of our larger and most threatened cities. In the \nfiscal year 2003 appropriations and the wartime supplemental, $850 \nmillion was set aside for high-threat urban discretionary grants. In \nfiscal year 2004, in the appropriations bill, a further $725 million \nwas set aside for these high-threat urban areas. The bill now before \nthe Senate contains $875 million dedicated to high-threat urban \ndiscretionary grants. Taken together, this is over $2.4 billion just \nfor the urban areas of our country. This is on top of the basic grant \neach State receives.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has developed a model using \nclassified information to allocate resources to major urban areas based \non a combination of current threat estimates, critical assets within \nthe urban area, as well as population density. The formula uses a \ncombination of these factors to produce proportional resource \nallocations. Of the high-threat urban grant funding for fiscal year \n2004, over $79 million has gone to communities in New York State. Since \nthe inception of the Urban Area Security Initiative, over $316 million \nhas been made available to cities in New York. These funds are in \naddition to the dollars that were received by the State of New York \nthrough the basic State grants.\n  In fiscal year 2004, more than $141 million in discretionary high-\nthreat funding has been allocated to communities in California. Since \nthe inception of the Urban Area Security Initiative, more than $247 \nmillion has been made available to the State of California. So the \nneeds of our urban areas and the States with high population centers \nare already being addressed. But so, too, are those in other States of \nour great Nation.\n  We should not come in on this bill today with this amendment and \nchange the formula for the basic State grant program. That debate \nshould occur when the Senate considers the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee bill, S. 1245, which is now on the calendar of the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the first amendment of the Senator \nfrom New York.\n  The second amendment the Senator has offered deals with Urban Area \nSecurity Initiative funding and suggests to the Senate that the amount \navailable in the bill should be increased. In this bill, as in last \nyear's appropriation, we have continued to provide funds specifically \nfor the largest metropolitan areas that face the most risk. The Urban \nArea Security Initiative grant fund is distributed at the discretion of \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security. I have mentioned that. It is based \non current threat information and other factors. With the resources \navailable, the bill makes the best use of these limited resources.\n  Let me make that point again. These are limited resources. This \ncommittee has been allocated a certain amount of money, around $32 \nbillion, to provide funding for this next fiscal year for activities \nunder the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security and other \nagencies that are funded in this bill. With those limitations, choices \nhave to be made. It would be good to be able to increase funding for \nall of the programs in this bill. They are all worthwhile programs or \nthey would not be in the bill. They are all important activities. But \nat some point the committee has to make a decision. It has to say: This \nis the amount that is allocated for this next fiscal year for this \nparticular account or program.\n\n  This bill includes $875 million for the Urban Area Security \nInitiative. Since fiscal year 2003, including the amount provided here, \nover $2.4 billion will have been made available for the Urban Area \nSecurity Initiative. The Senator's amendment would add an additional \n$625 million, almost doubling the Urban Area Security Initiative, to \nthis grant program.\n  Because of the reasons I have cited, at the appropriate time, I will \nsuggest that a point of order should lie against this amendment.\n  Next let me read another provision of the committee report which I \nthink will explain why it is important for us to reject this amendment:\n\n       The Committee is concerned with the administration of the \n     funds available to assist the communities most in danger in \n     the United States. The continued expansion of the cities \n     eligible for this funding has the impact of diluting the \n     resources that have been made available, shortchanging those \n     communities with the most serious quantifiable threat. The \n     Committee believes the Department achieved a more optimal use \n     of the funds in fiscal year 2003. Further, the Committee \n     believes the Department's practice over the past two fiscal \n     years, to allocate the full amount appropriated for the \n     program at one time near the beginning of the year, leaves \n     the Department with little ability to respond to new or \n     updated intelligence or recent terrorist threats. \n     Consequently, the Committee recommends that at least 10 \n     percent of the funds appropriated for the program be reserved \n     to meet any needs over the course of the fiscal year \n     warranted by more current threat information and \n     intelligence. Any reserve funds remaining at the beginning of \n     the last quarter of the fiscal year shall be released to \n     fiscal year 2005 grant recipients as determined by the \n     Secretary.\n\n  It is my hope that the Senate will reject both of the amendments \noffered by the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3632\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment \nintroduced by my colleague and friend, Senator Clinton, and me. It \ndoesn't take money away from anybody else. It simply increases the \namount of money to the high-needs areas. There are lots of ways to skin \nthis cat. It is clear that the areas most under threat, cities such as \nNew York City, the No. 1 target, as we know, of the terrorists, need \nfar more help than we get. I think there has been a general outcry by \nthe 9/11 Commission and many others that it is so unfair to give, say, \nthe State of Wyoming more on a per-capita basis than New York City gets \nin terms of terror. I don't doubt the need Wyoming has for dollars. But \nif Wyoming has the need for dollars, certainly New York has a greater \nneed for dollars.\n  What we have done with this amendment, which is one way to do it, is \nto simply increase the high-needs area. It does not touch the general \nformula but, rather, goes to high needs.\n  Let me share a little history about this high-needs area. As you may \nknow, when we first were setting up this formula, I spent a lot of time \nnegotiating with the White House as to how we would allocate money. \nThen the point person for the White House was the Secretary of OMB, \nMitch Daniels. We came to the conclusion that obviously every State \nneeded some money. And knowing how the House and Senate work, we \nweren't going to get a formula which would send money to the 5 or 10 \nlargest cities or the 5 or 10 largest focal points. So we negotiated \nthe formula in two parts.\n  The first was the general formula, and there was a specific need for \nevery State and taking care of those States. Now, the remainder of that \nformula, which we are not discussing now, was supposed to be allocated \nby discretion by the administration. They basically punted the ball and \ndid that on a per capita basis.\n\n[[Page S9175]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be given an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will not object. I have a unanimous consent request to \nmake.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield to the Senator for that purpose.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:20 \ntoday, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Mikulski \namendment No. 3624, with no amendments in order to the amendment prior \nto the vote; provided further that there be 2 minutes equally divided \nfor debate prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Schumer has asked for 5 minutes and \nI have no objection to that. The other Senator from New York may wish \nadditional time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New York wishes 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we had the high-needs formula, which \nreally didn't do justice to the areas that had the highest needs. We \ncame up with this high-needs formula.\n  Frankly, the first year it worked quite well and quite fairly. The \nbottom line is that, of the high-needs allocation the first year, which \nI believe was $700 million, New York City, the city that has been the \nfocus of both terrorist attacks, received $225 million. While still on \na per capita basis, we were not getting what we thought was a fair \nshare, it certainly came a lot closer.\n  But what has happened is two things. First, on the high-needs \nformula, other localities came in and asked for money. They said they \nare a high-needs area. The number of cities last year that were under \nthe high-needs rubric expanded. The first year it was a handful, the \nnext year it was 30, and last year it was 50. So now lots of localities \nare competing for this high-needs money. That is fine. I am not one to \nbegrudge that. I think we are not doing enough on homeland security, \nand this is one place we should be spending more dollars.\n  We are not trying to take away money from the high-needs area. I \nremind my colleagues that the amendment we are offering will apply to a \nlarger number of cities than first proposed. But the bottom line is \nvery simple; that is, once the high-needs funding was spread among many \ncities, the cities of the greatest need, such as New York and \nWashington, did not get the dollars they needed. Over the last 3 years, \nthe amount of money that New York City has received has shrunk and \nshrunk and shrunk. The bottom line is very simple: We are not getting \nwhat we need.\n  Let me talk about some of the needs in New York City. I live in \nBrooklyn, a proud Brooklynite. We have the Brooklyn Bridge, which \ncrosses from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Every time I cross that bridge--\nusually by car and once in a while on a bicycle--there are two police \nofficers at each end of the bridge. That bridge is guarded 24 hours a \nday, 7 days a week, as it must be. We picked up somebody in Ohio a few \nyears ago who was intent on trying to destroy that bridge. Well, that \nis 20 police officers, because it is five shifts of four people. \nMultiply that by the number of bridges and tunnels comparable to the \nBrooklyn Bridge in New York and that shows you the magnitude of what we \nare doing.\n  It is the same thing with our firefighters and our emergency \nresponders and our hospitals. All of them have had to do so much more \nbecause our city is at the epicenter more, quite frankly, than a \nhospital, police department, or a firefighting department in a middle-\nsized city in the middle of America, which doesn't have to do quite \nwhat we do. My guess is that bridges in Omaha, or Wichita, or \nAlbuquerque are not guarded by two police officers at either end for 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week; nor should they be. But they have to be in \nNew York.\n  We will do everything we can to prevent another 9/11. Yet as we have \ngone further along, the amount of money New York City has been given \nhas decreased. I know there are other cities that have needs. I worked \nhard to see that Buffalo was included in this formula, with $10 \nmillion. A few other cities in upstate New York have problems.\n  So there are only two ways to go about solving this problem. One is \nto rob Peter to pay Paul, to reallocate the funds that are there. That \nis not this amendment. We don't touch that. The other is to increase \nthe high-needs funding, so the cities that are under the greatest \nthreat and the greatest danger can at least be reimbursed in greater \npart. Certainly, we won't be made whole for the homeland security \nefforts that we must undertake.\n  We heard a few months ago, when we picked up the new intelligence, \nwhat the areas were they were focusing on: Washington, DC, and the New \nYork City metropolitan area; five buildings, two in DC, two in \nManhattan, and one in northern New Jersey. Again, we can bring home the \nneed to focus that should be here. Yet we are not doing it.\n  Let me tell you, if you think we don't have the money, we are going \nto spend $416 billion on defense this year. We are only spending $33 \nbillion on homeland security in toto. We are spending less than $2 \nbillion on helping our first responders, on helping our localities that \nhave worked so hard and so well to defend us from terrorism. It would \nseem to me that any fair allocation of dollars would be giving New York \nCity more money, giving some of the other cities more money.\n  Let me go over the numbers. Last year, New York's share of high-needs \nareas dropped to 9 percent. We didn't receive 9 percent of the attacks. \nThus far--and I hope there are no more anywhere in America--we received \n100 percent of the two terrorist attacks that have occurred.\n  Our city, as I say, is struggling. We have needs like everybody else. \nWe have a great police department, a great fire department, a great EMT \ndepartment, and great hospitals. But they cannot do it alone. So it is \nmy hope that our colleagues will rise to the occasion.\n  This money, as I say, will not just benefit New York but other cities \nof high needs throughout the country. Let's stop underfunding this very \nneeded program. Let's stop saying let the other guy do it. In a time of \nterrorism, we need leadership. This amendment represents leadership, \nand I hope we can get the sufficient number of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to respond to some of the points \nmade by the chairman of the subcommittee. I start by saying that as I \nunderstand the underlying legislation from the House, there is no \nlanguage, either legislative or report, that addresses how the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security should distribute the \nfunding above the small State minimum.\n  The language that my amendment is addressing specifically appears in \nthe report to the Senate bill. So I want everyone to understand that I \nagree every State should receive a minimum level of funding. I think \nthat is not only politically necessary, it is appropriate and fair.\n  Based on the calculation of that funding, about 38 percent of all of \nthe homeland security funding in the two biggest grant categories for \nthe State homeland security grants and the terrorism prevention grants \nwill go across the board on a per capita basis to all the States. So \neverybody will get a per capita basis that they can then use to meet \ntheir homeland security needs.\n  Now, the remaining 62 percent of the money is what my formula \namendment is addressing. At the very least, the Senate should not be, \nin report language, recommending that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity also distribute the funding on a per capita basis. That runs \nabsolutely counter to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. The \n9/11 Commission said do away with small State minimums, do away with \nany kind of per capita funding, begin to distribute this money on the \nbasis of risk and threat. Yet we get a committee recommendation from \nour Senate committee which basically recommends that the funds that are \nused consistent with each State's homeland security strategy are to be \nallocated on a per capita basis.\n\n[[Page S9176]]\n\n  So it is not only that we are failing to change the formula to comply \nwith the 9/11 Commission, we are directing the Department of Homeland \nSecurity not to comply with the 9/11 Commission.\n  I am not saying take the money away from all the States and direct it \nwhere it is most needed. I am not going the full place that the 9/11 \nCommission has set out for us. I am recognizing the political reality \nand the fairness of allocating money to every State. At the very least, \nlet us not direct the Department of Homeland Security to distribute the \nmoney above the small State minimum on a per capita basis. So I hope we \ncould remove that language, and my formula amendment would do that.\n  Secondly, we cannot wait for the Governmental Affairs Committee to \ncome forward with their authorization. I stood on this floor months ago \nand said we needed to change the risk and threat analysis in order to \ndistribute the money more effectively. The very effective chairwoman of \nthat committee came down to the floor and said: We are working on a \nchange of formula. Work with us. Let us get the authorization changed.\n  We have been waiting for that bill ever since. There is no \nauthorization. The only opportunity we have to begin to try to focus \nour efforts on homeland security to address the kind of threats that we \nface is in this appropriations. In fact, the door has been opened \nbecause in this appropriations bill coming from the House, they talk \nabout a PATRIOT Act minimum, and then the Senate committee goes one \nstep forward and says above that minimum do not direct it any other way \nexcept per capita.\n  So I understand very well that everybody has to look out for his or \nher own State, but on this matter we have to put the money where the \nthreat is, and the threat is in places such as New York and Washington. \nEvery committee, every commission that has looked at this has come to \nthe same conclusion.\n  So I look forward to working with the chairman to make it possible to \ndistribute the money on a threat-based analysis as opposed to directing \nthe Department to distribute the money above the small State minimum, \n62 percent of the money, also on a per capita basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9176-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes evenly divided before \nproceeding to the vote on the amendment.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, at the appropriate time it will be my \nintention to make the point of order against the amendment, in that it \nviolates the Budget Act because it provides for the appropriation of \nadditional funds above the allocation of the amount available to this \nsubcommittee and there is no offset provided in the amendment. So for \nthe information of Senators, that is the intention of the managers of \nthe bill.\n  Under the previous order, as I understand it, a vote is scheduled to \noccur at 2:20. Is that the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate? Is it my amendment increasing firefighters funds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pending before the Senate is the Senator's \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. As I understand it, I have 1 minute and then there will \nbe a subsequent comment by the chairman of the subcommittee; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. My amendment which is pending adds $150 million to the \nFire Grant Program, bringing it to the authorized level of $900 \nmillion. This Fire Grant Program is peer-reviewed and merit based with \nno pork in it. It provides grants to local fire departments. The \nPresident requested $500 million, the chairman added another $200 \nmillion, then Senator Frist added another $50 million on Friday, but I \nwant to bring it up to the full $900 million. Why? This Fire Grant \nProgram is the only program that really helps our firefighters have the \nequipment they need to protect themselves, as well as modern equipment.\n  Last year, the Fire Grant Program received $2.5 billion for its \nrequests--20,000 worthy applications. I know we can't fund it at $2.5 \nbillion, but we can fund it at the authorized level. Therefore, I urge \nadoption of my amendment. Let us protect the first responders so they \ncan protect us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from the National \nVolunteers Fire Council and the Congressional Fire Services Institute \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              National Volunteer Fire Council,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2004.\n     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: The National Volunteer Fire Council \n     (NVFC) is a non-profit membership association representing \n     the interests of the more than 800,000 members of America's \n     volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services. On behalf of our \n     membership, I am writing to lend our full support for your \n     amendment to the FY 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations \n     Bill to fully fund the Assistance to Firefighters Grant \n     program at the $900 million level.\n       As you know, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program \n     provides critical funding to our nation's 1.1 million \n     firefighters, 75% of which are volunteers. The purpose of the \n     program is to bring every fire department up to a base-line \n     level of readiness--and keep them there. The program has \n     proven to be the most effective program to date in directly \n     providing local volunteer and career fire departments not \n     only with the tools they need to perform their day-to-day \n     duties, but it has also enhanced their ability to respond to \n     large disasters as well. As we move to prepare for terrorist \n     incidents at home, we must first ensure that local fire \n     departments have the basic tools they need to do their jobs \n     on a daily basis.\n       The program benefits our entire nation by providing local \n     fire departments with much-needed training and equipment to \n     respond to 21 million calls annually. These calls include \n     structural fire suppression, emergency medical response, \n     hazardous materials incidents, technical rescues, wildland \n     fire protection, natural disasters and events of terrorism.\n       Once again, we strongly support your amendment to the FY \n     2005 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill and we thank you \n     for your continued leadership and support of America's fire \n     service. If you or your staff have any questions please feel \n     free to contact Craig Sharman, NVFC Director of Government \n     Relations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Philip C. Stittleburg,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Congressional Fire\n\n\n                                           Services Institute,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: On behalf of the Congressional Fire \n     Services Institute's National Advisory Committee comprised of \n     42 national fire and emergency organizations, I am writing to \n     thank you for all your efforts, past and present, to preserve \n     the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP), also \n     known as the FIRE Act. As you know, the FIRE Act has been a \n     critical program in our efforts to prepare America's \n     firefighters to effectively respond to all emergencies. It is \n     for this reason that I would like to commend you on your \n     efforts to increase the funding allocation for the AFGP in \n     the FY05 Homeland Security Appropriations Act to $900 \n     million, the full amount authorized by Congress.\n       The purpose of the FIRE Act is to bring every fire \n     department up to a base-line level of readiness--and keep \n     them there. Too many fire departments in this country lack\n\n[[Page S9177]]\n\n     even the most basic needs, including proper turn-out gear, \n     communication systems, training, prevention, and public \n     education programs. These facts are contained in the Needs \n     Assessment of the U.S. Fire Service published by the United \n     States Fire Administration in cooperation with the National \n     Fire Protection Association. It revealed that many \n     departments lack the basic tools and training they need to \n     respond to over 21 million calls, annually--from daily \n     incidents to major disasters, both deliberate acts and \n     natural events. The all-hazards response enhancement provided \n     by the FIRE Act ensures the most efficient and effective use \n     of federal funding. It not only prepares departments to \n     respond to acts of terrorism, it enhances the department's \n     ability to respond to all other emergencies that occur \n     thousands of times each day across our country.\n       The FIRE Act addresses another important mission of every \n     fire department, one that often does not command the \n     attention it deserves because of budgetary constraints: \n     prevention and education. Over 3,000 people die in fires \n     every year and over 20,000 people suffer injuries. We can \n     reduce these figures with additional funds targeted at \n     prevention and education programs. This would allow \n     firefighters to spend time in their communities teaching \n     children and others about fire prevention or conducting \n     inspections of both occupied and abandoned buildings.\n       A growing challenge facing the fire service is urban \n     sprawl. As construction increases in wildland/urban \n     interface, fire departments face new challenges requiring \n     additional resources and personnel. During the Southern \n     California fires last October, the media reported the number \n     of homes destroyed. Largely overlooked were the number of \n     lives saved and homes protected because of the heroic actions \n     taken by the fire service. Yet we cannot expect the fire \n     service assigned to these areas to meet the public's \n     expectations to safeguard their lives and property without \n     adequate resources.\n       When reviewing the totality of a fire department's \n     responsibilities, it is important to recognize that every \n     function serves a vital role in fulfilling a fire \n     department's mission, protecting lives and property. By \n     design, the FIRE Act addresses the entire spectrum of \n     education, prevention and response.\n       The FIRE Act is not about supplanting local fiduciary \n     responsibilities; it's about supplementing efforts to protect \n     this country's people, property, and economy. And because the \n     fire service provides protection to so much of our nation's \n     infrastructure, the federal government does indeed have a \n     responsibility to support the mission of our first \n     responders.\n       In the three years the FIRE Act has been in existence, it \n     has become one of the most effective programs administered by \n     the federal government. In January of 2003, officials from \n     the U.S. Department of Agriculture selected the Fire Grant \n     Program for a study they were conducting as part of a \n     management training course. Summarizing the programs, they \n     said that the grant program has been ``highly effective in \n     increasing the safety and effectiveness of grant \n     recipients.'' Their study found:\n       97% of program participants reported positive impact on \n     their ability to handle fire and fire-related incidents.\n       Of those recipients receiving firefighting equipment, 99% \n     indicated improvements in the safety of firefighters and 98% \n     indicated improvements in operation capacity.\n       90% of the participants indicated that their department \n     operated more efficiently and safely as a result of the \n     training provided by the grant program.\n       Over 88% of the participants who were able to measure \n     change at the time the survey was distributed reported \n     improvement in the fitness and health of their firefighters \n     as a result of the program and 86% indicated reduced \n     injuries.\n       The FIRE Act plays a critical role in addressing the needs \n     of over 30,000 fire departments and one million fire and \n     rescue personnel. We thank you for your commitment to our \n     nation's firefighters and this important program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Steve Edwards,\n         Chairman, CFSI National Advisory Committee.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support the Mikulski amendment because I \nthink that it includes important funding for firefighter grants. The \namendment includes $200 million for firefighter grants--the authorized \nlevel--so that we can increase the resources available for our first \nresponders.\n  In its current form, this amendment does not include any offsetting \nreductions to pay for the new investments. If this amendment is adopted \ntoday--and I hope that it will be--I intend to work with the conferees \nto offset these increases by reducing funds that have been earmarked \nfor Iraqi reconstruction. I believe these expenditures should be offset \nwith these other spending cuts.\n  Iraq is a nation that sits on some of the largest oil reserves in the \nworld. My view is that Iraq should pay for its own reconstruction.\n  Last year, this Congress acted in an expedited way to appropriate \n$18.4 billion for Iraqi reconstruction. And yet, 10 months later, most \nof that money is still unspent. Less than $1 billion has been actually \nexpended and only about $7 billion has been obligated.\n  Therefore, I support Senator Mikulski's amendment. But my intention \nis to push for the rescission of those unobligated Iraqi reconstruction \nfunds and use them to offset these needed security investments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the bill provides adequate funds--\ngenerous funding--for this program.\n  I make a point of order under section 302(f) that the amendment \nexceeds the subcommittee's allocation under section 302(b) of the \nBudget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order has been raised.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion \nto waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) and the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nKentucky (Mr. Bunning) would vote ``no''.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), and the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 50, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 175 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Akaka\n     Bunning\n     Campbell\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are \n45. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe point of order was sustained.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are at a point now where we are \nhopeful we can begin disposing of amendments that have previously been \noffered and on which debate has occurred. They have been set aside so \nSenators can offer amendments on other subjects. We have at this time \nnine amendments that are in that situation: amendments offered by \nSenators Nelson, Corzine, Kennedy, Dayton, Dodd, Clinton, and one by \nClinton and Schumer.\n  We are hopeful we can reach some understanding about a time to begin \nvoting on these amendments. We do know there are a couple meetings that \nrequire Senators' attendance off the floor at this time, and that might \nbe the situation until about 3:30. But I am hopeful the leaders on the \nother side\n\n[[Page S9178]]\n\ncan consider entering into an understanding or an agreement that we \nwill begin voting on these amendments at 3:30. So I say that for the \ninformation of Senators.\n  There is a markup session going on by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. That may start at 3 o'clock. That is going to require the \nattendance of a good number of Senators. So for the information of \nSenators, we are hopeful we can begin a series of votes at about 3:30, \ndispose of the pending amendments, and then proceed to consider other \namendments that Senators may wish to offer.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to my friend from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Perhaps the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi--by the way, the third hurricane has a track that keeps \ngetting closer and closer to the Mississippi gulf coast. But as the \ndistinguished Senator, the chairman of the committee, and I have been \ntalking about the emergency supplemental appropriations for hurricane \ndamage, I have been provided with a copy of what will be the \nPresident's request for the new supplemental.\n  I note that it does include a lot of the agencies of Government about \nwhich this Senator has spoken that have desperate needs as a result of \ntwo hurricanes hitting back to back in Florida. I noticed there is \nnothing in here for the agricultural losses, including crop losses as \nwell as equipment losses, of which the Florida commissioner of \nagriculture has written to the White House, to OMB, and said those \nlosses are $2 billion. What would the advice of the chairman of the \ncommittee to this Florida Senator be of how we want to address that, \nsince the President is not requesting in his new supplemental any money \nfor agricultural losses?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the inquiry of the Senator \nfrom Florida. It is my understanding that the Department of Agriculture \nhas existing authority under current law to provide assistance for \nagricultural purposes in areas where people have suffered disasters. It \nprovides opportunities for haying and grazing on conservation lands. \nThere are a wide range of emergency activities that can be undertaken \nunder existing law.\n  When we reach a point at which there is a determination of exact \ndollar amounts of damage incurred by citrus growers or others who have \nbeen hurt by the storms in Florida, that may be a possible reason for \nan additional supplemental to be submitted whose benefits were not \ndescribed in the submission that was received today. This is considered \nan emergency for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and others who \nare on the frontline of recovery, providing shelter, providing food, \nemergency items to protect life, debris removal, particularly areas \nwhere the debris poses a danger to life and limb.\n  This is the kind of supplemental, as I understand it, the President \nhas submitted. We hope to be able to approve that and call it up. The \nAppropriations Committee is meeting this afternoon. Senator Stevens, \nchairman of the committee, wants to take action on it as soon as \npossible. The House has to act on it as well. It may very well be that \nwe will have a vehicle on which to go to conference with the House this \nweek.\n  I am hopeful we can keep the President's request clean and approve \nthe request, get the money to the agencies that need the funds, and \nlook to these other issues as they mature in time, in the sense that \nthere has been time to assess the damages and we know what they are and \nwho is entitled to the benefits and what kind of benefits there are in \nagriculture.\n  But there is no doubt in my mind there will be a need for sensitive \nand generous assistance for agricultural producers which do not have \nany other benefits. We do have crop insurance. There are other things \navailable to farmers under current law, and they will be able to \nreceive these and be provided with deserved and well-needed benefits.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator \nwill yield for a further question.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Indeed, I understand what the Senator is \nreferring to. There are section 32 discretionary funds that would be, \nfor example, available for Florida citrus growers. But it comes nowhere \nclose to the estimated amount of losses in these two hurricanes for the \ncitrus crop and equipment which is going to exceed $\\1/2\\ billion, just \nin itself. That is not even to speak of all the other kinds of crops--\nvegetables, sod, timber, milk that was dumped as a result of the \ndairies, all kinds of vegetables, tropical fruit, clams, oysters, \npoultry. Nurseries, Florida's top cash crop, has suffered $\\1/2\\ \nbillion in losses.\n\n  My question is, there is buzzing out here an amendment that is being \nput together by midwestern Senators, Republican and Democratic, to take \ncare of their agricultural problems. Yet they do not address the full \nneed of Florida which has suffered back-to-back hurricane losses that \nhave affected its agriculture.\n  What would be the advice of the Senator from Mississippi to the \nFlorida Senators, when others are coming forth, and yet Florida's \nagricultural needs, after two disastrous hurricanes, are not being met?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my advice to all Senators, including my \ngood friend from Florida, is to try to work with the Appropriations \nCommittee leadership. Senator Stevens is chairing a meeting marking up \nindividual appropriations bills this afternoon. The committee will be \nconsidering the request for supplemental appropriations submitted by \nthe President that we just talked about. At that time, when we are \nconsidering the supplemental for disaster assistance, would be the \ntime, in my view, when we could consider other hurricane damage that \nthe Senator is discussing now. In my mind that would be a more \nappropriate vehicle for the Senators who are talking about midwestern \nagricultural needs as well.\n  I hope this annual appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity won't get held up with a debate over disaster assistance \nbecause of drought or other problems in other parts of the country. It \nis hard to say yes, let's have some funds included in the bill for \nthose purposes, and then say no to those in our part of the country \nwhere we do know the needs are real. They are just as expensive, maybe \nmuch more so in reality, than the Midwestern problems.\n  I am hopeful that we can protect the integrity of the appropriations \nprocess and the integrity of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. \nLet's move this to completion, go to conference with the House, and, in \nan orderly, coherent way, fund the needs of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to protect us from terrorist threats, other natural disasters \nsuch as the ones that are being addressed by the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. Then in a separate action, let's consider disaster \nassistance for hurricane victims and drought victims and others in \nagriculture who have otherwise suffered serious losses this year.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Did this Senator misunderstand the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi in that the President's request \nfor this hurricane relief that has happened on those two hurricanes was \ngoing to be or not going to be attached as an amendment to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations bill?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I don't think that is a decision that has been made.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I see.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My expectation is that the committee leadership, in \nconsultation with the leaders of the Senate, will make that decision at \na later time. Today they are trying to mark up individual \nappropriations bills, and in due course they will take up the \nsupplemental as well.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Then I would say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi, I was given to believe that, in fact, was a decision \nthat was made, that this hurricane relief was going to be attached to \nthis Homeland Security bill. I got that impression from the majority \nleader, Senator Frist. If that decision has not been made then, fine.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It may have been made and I just haven't heard about it. \nThe Senator from Florida may be more up to date than I am. But I knew \nit was an option that was being considered and being discussed. I was \nnot aware that the decision had definitely been made to do that.\n\n[[Page S9179]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Then this Senator certainly would not have to \nencourage the quickening of the interests in all of this hurricane \ndisaster assistance relief as this Senator speaks with the Senator from \nMississippi, because right now Hurricane Ivan, a category 5 hurricane, \nis bearing down on the Mississippi coast. It could well be that we are \nlooking at an additional hurricane emergency disaster relief \nsupplemental that would directly affect the State represented by the \ndistinguished Senator who is the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct. It \nposes a real danger, not only to the people in that area but also to \nproperty. It is clear that the disaster relief fund of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, which we replenished just a few days ago \nto the tune of $2 billion, could run out of money again. I know the \ntendencies of this Congress to be that where there are needs like that, \nwe will act to address them. At a time when that relief fund or any \nother account is depleted and hurricane victims need the attention of \nthese agencies and the benefits to which they are entitled, we will \nact. I believe we will act promptly and with dispatch and with \ngenerosity to the fullest extent allowed under the law.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, is FEMA appropriated under the \nAppropriations subcommittee the Senator chairs?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is one of the agencies under the Department of \nHomeland Security, and it is covered in this annual appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Then this Senator simply makes a \nrecommendation that we should never be in an emergency posture like we \nwere last week, where FEMA is not carrying the adequate reserves. On \nThursday, they ran out of money and were, in fact, not spending the \nmoney that was desperately needed in the previous 5 days for hurricane \nrelief. This Senator is merely making the recommendation that, as we \nlook to FEMA appropriations in the future, there should be a cushion of \nreserves in FEMA because this country can face all kinds of disasters, \nas we know, and this year FEMA's budget was too lean to be able to \nrespond.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator makes a point we should consider. I agree \nwith that. It is awfully difficult for us to know the future or to be \nable to predict it and the needs of every agency of the Government, \neven FEMA. But we do the best we can and we will continue to work hard. \nAny advice or suggestions the Senators might have for the appropriate \nlevel of funding on an annual basis would be welcome.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3619, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to modify \namendment No. 3619 at the desk. The change is to allow for funding of \nthe offset of the proposed amendment, regarding chemical security \nplants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking that amendment be made \npending at this time?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I send the modified amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified, and it is \nnow pending.\n  The amendment (No. 3619), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 19, line 17, strike ``$2,845,081,000'' and all that \n     follows through ``grants'' on page 20, line 11, and insert \n     the following: ``$2,915,081,000, which shall be allocated as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) $970,000,000 for formula-based grants and \n     $400,000,000 for law enforcement terrorism prevention grants \n     pursuant to section 1014 of the USA PATRIOT Act (42 U.S.C. \n     3714): Provided, That the application for grants shall be \n     made available to States within 45 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act; that States shall submit applications \n     within 45 days after the grant announcement; and that the \n     Office of State and Local Government Coordination and \n     Preparedness shall act within 15 days after receipt of an \n     application: Provided further, That each State shall obligate \n     not less than 80 percent of the total amount of the grant to \n     local governments within 60 days after the grant award; and\n       ``(2) $1,270,000,000 for discretionary grants for use in \n     high-threat, high-density urban areas, as determined by the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security: Provided, That the amount \n     under title I for the Human Resources Account of the Office \n     of the Under Secretary for Management shall be reduced by \n     $70,000,000: Provided further, That $150,000,000 shall be for \n     port security grants; $15,000,000 shall be for trucking \n     industry security grants; $10,000,000 shall be for intercity \n     bus security grants; $150,000,000 shall be for rail and \n     transit security grants; $70,000,000 shall be for enhancing \n     the security of chemical plants''.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this amendment addresses one of the most \nserious security threats facing our Nation: the threat of terrorist \nattacks on chemical facilities. It is a subject I have worked on with a \nnumber of colleagues on both sides of the aisle over the last 3 years. \nIt addresses an issue where there are literally thousands of chemical \nfacilities across the country where a chemical release could expose \ntens of thousands of Americans to highly toxic gases.\n  I have tried to stress that there are 123 of these where more than a \nmillion people could be exposed. About eight of those are in New \nJersey, so this is an intensely important subject matter for the \ncommunity I represent. We need to change this.\n  While we are working today on the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations, there is authorizing legislation working through the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee that would deal with this \nproblem. I want to be a constructive element in bringing that to a \nconclusion. We have a security problem now with our chemical plants. My \nmodified amendment would provide $70 million to State and local \ngovernments in order to enhance the security of those chemical plants. \nAlso, it includes that offset I mentioned, which is changed from the \noriginal version of the amendment.\n  This amendment only takes a modest first step by appropriating that \nmoney to these State and local efforts. Funds could be used, for \nexample, to strengthen law enforcement's presence around chemical \nplants. When we go to Code Orange, the Department of Homeland Security \nrequests that our local law enforcement provide additional security for \nthese plants. It is not like they are not doing this already. That is \novertime for additional individuals. Also, this money would go to train \nand prepare officials to respond to a terrorist attack. The release of \na chemical toxic cloud is not like fighting a fire; it takes different \nkinds of actions. This amendment would provide some of that support. It \nwould also provide guidance and assistance to plant managers. It would \nhave the proper interface with State and local officials on how to \nrespond and maybe even prevent attacks on chemical security plants.\n  As I said, the funds will be offset by eliminating funds for a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security performance pay system, and we will \nprovide the resources that I think--at least looking at a tradeoff of \nhow I see it in New Jersey, and I think it is the case across the \ncountry, since 123 plants expose more than a million people, it is a \ngood tradeoff. It may be an important issue to get on with pay systems, \nbut I don't understand how we trade that off versus the security of the \nindividuals who surround the plants.\n  Remember, these plants were built in a different era, at a different \ntime. They are very prominently located in densely populated areas in \nthe country. We ought to do what we can to protect them. One of the \nways is to provide these funds. That is what this amendment is about. I \nspoke about it at length the other day on the Senate floor. I believe \nvery strongly that there are real reasons for us to pay attention to \nchemical plant security in this country. Every time the Department of \nHomeland Security raises the code level, they mention chemical plant \nsecurity. It is in the Hart-Rudman report. It is in studies of the \nvulnerabilities of the critical infrastructure in this country. We \nought to take special steps to make sure there is security at these \nplants. We would not tolerate the kind of security arrangement we have \nin chemical plants if\n\n[[Page S9180]]\n\nthey were nuclear powerplants, and there are as many people exposed to \nthese toxic exposures, if there were to be a terrorist attack, as there \nwould be in many, if not most, nuclear powerplants, which are located \nin many different areas.\n  I hope my colleagues will realize this is an important consideration, \na modest first step. It is paid for, and I believe we can make the \nAmerican people a little bit more secure by adjusting where we are \nspending $70 million to provide for chemical plant security. I \nappreciate it, and I hope that it will be favorably considered by my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are at a point now where we can \nannounce to Senators our intention to proceed to votes on some of the \namendments that are pending now. The amendment of the Senator from New \nJersey, which he has modified, would be the first amendment we would \nconsider. It would be the intention of this manager to move to table \nthe Corzine amendment and get the yeas and nays, and then have a \nsimilar motion against the Dayton amendment No. 3629 and the Clinton/\nSchumer amendment No. 3632. We are advised that the Appropriations \nCommittee is in meeting now and members may not be available until \nclose to 4, but we could begin these votes at 3:45.\n  The distinguished assistant leader has assured us that is an \nagreement that is OK with the Democratic side of the aisle, and with \nthat understanding, I will propound this unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 3:45 p.m. today, the Senate vote in \nrelation to the following amendments in the order mentioned: Corzine \nNo. 3619, as modified; Dayton No. 3629; Clinton No. 3632. I further ask \nunanimous consent that no amendments be in order to the amendments \nprior to those votes and that there be 2 minutes equally divided for \ndebate prior to each of the votes, and finally that the second and \nthird votes in the series be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the distinguished leader and I thank all \nSenators for that agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I direct a question through the Chair to the \ndistinguished manager of the bill. On this side, we still have every \nintention to try to finish this bill tonight. Unless something comes up \nwe do not know about, it is my understanding that the manager also \nfeels the same way. So if people have amendments--for example, I talked \nto a couple of my Senators this afternoon and they said, well, we will \ndo it later. Everyone should know later is here. We are now at that \ntime. Later is right now. This would be an appropriate time for someone \nto come over and offer an amendment as we speak. We would set what is \npending aside, lay that down. It is my understanding the manager of the \nbill wants to move through these pending amendments as quickly as \npossible. We have several amendments after we finish this block of \nvotes that are still outstanding. That is going to get us into the \nevening time. So if people still have amendments they want to offer, \nthey should get over here and do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator very \nmuch for his suggestions. He is absolutely right. We do intend to press \non and try to complete action on this bill tonight. We would appreciate \nthe cooperation of all Senators in that regard. We are going to try to \nget to the point where we can announce that we are definitely going to \nfinish the bill tonight. That is our intention. We hope we can move \nforward with dispatch and determination to achieve that goal. We thank \nthe distinguished Senator for his good assistance in that regard.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3619, as Modified\n\n  Under the previous order, there are now 2 minutes equally divided on \nthe Corzine amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, homeland security experts refer to \nchemical plants as ``pre-positioned weapons of mass destruction.'' Yet \nmore than 3 years after the September 11 attacks, the Bush \nadministration has done almost nothing to enhance the security of the \nestimated 15,000 chemical facilities in the United States.\n  I therefore support the amendment of Senator Corzine to provide $100 \nmillion for State and local efforts to enhance the safety of \ncommunities around chemical plants. These funds are needed to allow for \nexpanded law enforcement presence around plants, better training and \npreparation for first responders and local officials, and additional \nguidance for plant managers.\n  This is just a first step, however. Communities cannot do it alone. \nTo truly enhance security, chemical sources must implement security \nplans that address their unique vulnerabilities. Some facilities have \nalready made considerable improvements, such as repositioning storage \ntanks away from public roads and hiring more guards. Here in \nWashington, DC, the Blue Plains water treatment plant went one step \nfurther by switching from chlorine to bleach, thereby reducing the \ninherent hazards posed by their operations. Notwithstanding these \nimprovements, numerous media and government reports continue to \ndocument significant security gaps at many facilities.\n  National legislation mandating federally enforceable minimum \nstandards is long overdue. When I was chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, we unanimously passed Senator Corzine's \nlegislation out of committee. Bowing to pressure from the petroleum and \nchemical industries, the Bush administration put the brakes on this \nlegislation. Now, almost 2 years later, we are still debating the \nissue.\n  We cannot afford to ignore the risks posed by chemical plants any \nlonger. A terrorist attack at any one of the 15,000 chemical facilities \nnationwide would likely cause death or injury to the people in the \nsurrounding communities. The chemical industry's own data indicates \nthat, in a worst case release, toxic chemicals could threaten more than \n1 million people at each of 123 facilities spread across 24 States. \nThere are also more than 700 facilities from which a chemical release \ncould threaten more than 100,000 residential neighbors.\n  This issue is too important to ignore or add at the last minute to \nanother bill without adequate time for proper consideration. I have \nasked my staff to continue working in a tri-partisan fashion to develop \nlegislation that can be adopted unanimously by the Senate. If such an \nagreement cannot be reached quickly, however, we should move stand-\nalone legislation to the floor for a full debate.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of \nSenator Corzine to help communities surrounding chemical plants address \nthe added security risks that these facilities pose. We should then \nquickly enact comprehensive chemical security legislation to supplement \nthese community efforts and ensure that the chemical facilities \nthemselves do their part to ensure the safety of our home towns.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Has a motion to table the Corzine amendment been made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It cannot be made until the time is expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the committee has recommended in this \nbill $193,673,000 for protective action activities, for developing and \nimplementing protective programs for the Nation's critical \ninfrastructures, including chemical facilities, Federal, State and \nlocal, and private sector activities and programs and best practices.\n  Nationwide, we have seen 2,040 chemical facilities complete \nvulnerability\n\n[[Page S9181]]\n\nassessments as developed by Sandia National Laboratories and the Center \nfor Chemical Process Safety. The Department of Homeland Security has \nmade considerable progress in increasing the security of chemical \nfacilities across the country. Site visits are conducted at chemical \nfacilities as part of a buffer zone protection plan. These plans reduce \nspecific vulnerabilities and build a general protection capacity of \ncommunities. As part of the protective buffer zone effort, the \nprotective security division has developed plans to install cameras to \ndetect and deter surveillance and other threatening activities.\n  The Department has provided protective measures and risk management \nefforts on the sites of greatest concern. We are confident these are \nworking to improve the safety and security of chemical facilities.\n  We urge the Senate to support the committee and vote to approve the \nmotion to table the Corzine amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this amendment addresses one of the most \nserious security threats we have in the Nation, the threat of terrorist \nattack on our chemical plants. There are literally thousands--not 230 \nbut literally thousands--of plants that are exposed to more than 10,000 \nfolks in the country; 123 plants expose a million people or more.\n  My amendment provides $70 million to State and local governments, \nparticularly to focus on this issue of security of chemical plants. It \nincludes an offset, as I mentioned a few minutes ago.\n  The facts speak loudly: We need to address chemical plants. Time and \ntime again, there are reports where people can walk on to \nplants without there being any kind of protection and actually \nfollowing through on a lot of the security plans that were talked about \nbefore.\n\n  There is a whole further authorization bill working its way through \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee right now, which is a very \nbipartisan effort to try to get at this issue, but we need to do \nsomething now.\n  There are, as I said, literally thousands of plants across this \ncountry. We need to provide the support to State and local officials to \nbe able to provide the security, the overtime, needed at these plants, \nand particularly when we raise our code levels. The lack of security at \nour chemical plants has been cited as one of the greatest threats to \nour infrastructure. We need to provide for training. We need to provide \nfunds for guidance and assistance to plant managers and for other steps \nthat State and local officials can take to prevent and respond to \nattacks on chemical plants.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize we have a problem. We ought to be \ndoing everything we can to support and protect the American people.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the Corzine amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are 2 minutes evenly divided \non Dayton amendment No. 3629.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has offered an \namendment dealing with the Federal protective service. It is my \nintention as a manager of the bill to urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst it. First, it is the intention of the manager to move to table \nthis amendment and ask for the yeas and nays, and I do so now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is still time remaining. The \nmotion is not in order at this time.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment is necessary to protect the \nhealth care benefits of security guards who are protecting our security \nat Federal buildings in Minnesota and in other States.\n  In this instance, private contractors have low-bid these security \ncontracts, and they unilaterally have shifted the employees' health \npayments to 401(k) contributions. The company thereby increases its \nprofits by not paying taxes at the expense of their own employees, with \nno consultation, no negotiation, just cold-blooded profiteering. No \nwonder a company like this can underbid its competitors. The bids can \ngo lower and lower every time they cut wages or benefits. That is why \nthere should be employee protections--protections that were eliminated, \nunfortunately, over the objections of many of us when this Department \nof Homeland Security was created just 2 years ago.\n  This amendment simply requires that if a company takes over a \ncontract, it must negotiate changes in health benefits with its \nemployees. I think that is the least we can do on behalf of those who \nare risking their lives to protect our lives.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to define the \nresponsibilities of the Federal Protective Service to negotiate \nemployment contracts with other agencies or individuals who seek to \nwork for the Federal Protective Service. This is actually a Department \nof Labor Fair Labor Standards Act issue. It is not a Homeland Security \nissue. It should not be offered as an amendment to this bill but, \nrather, the issue should be presented to the Department of Labor which \nis responsible for overseeing employee and employer relationships.\n  This amendment would have a very serious adverse effect on the \nFederal Protective Service's ability to carry out protective services \nand ensure the security of Federal buildings throughout the country. It \ncould bring the efforts to a standstill.\n  I move to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McConnell. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell), and the Senator \nfrom Alabama (Mr. Sessions) are necessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S9182]]\n\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nKentucky (Mr. Bunning) would vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3632\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 2 minutes equally divided \non the amendment of the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, are there 2 minutes available equally \ndivided?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nKennedy and Corzine as cosponsors of this high-threat amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this amendment would add $625 million to \nthe high-threat urban area category of Homeland Security funding. This \nwould bring the amount close to what the President asked in his budget \nwhere he asked for $1.5 billion for the high-threat category.\n  What has been happening over the last several years is that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has added the number of cities and \nlocalities with critical infrastructure to this category, which I \nsupport and agree with. But as a result, the amount of money is not \nsufficient in order to meet the needs of the number of places that the \nSecretary deems appropriate for high-threat urban funding. So I ask \nthat we support this increase. It brings us close to the President's \nrequested amount in the 2005 budget, and it enables the Secretary to \nprovide the funding to a number of places that have high-threat needs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support the Clinton amendment because I \nthink that it includes important funding for high risk areas. The \namendment provides additional funds for those areas that are under the \nhighest threat alert.\n  In its current form, this amendment does not include any offsetting \nreductions to pay for the new investments. If this amendment is adopted \ntoday--and I hope that it will be--I intend to work with the conferees \nto offset these increases by reducing funds that have been earmarked \nfor Iraqi reconstruction. I believe these expenditures should be offset \nwith these other spending cuts.\n  Iraq is a nation that sits on some of the largest oil reserves in the \nworld. My view is that Iraq should pay for its own reconstruction.\n  Last year, this Congress acted in an expedited way to appropriate \n$18.4 billion Iraqi reconstruction. And yet, 10 months later, most of \nthat money is still unspent. Less than $1 billion has been actually \nexpended and only about $7 billion has been obligated.\n  Therefore, I support Senator Clinton's amendment. But my intention is \nto push for the rescission of those unobligated Iraqi reconstruction \nfunds and use them to offset these needed security investments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the suggestion of \nthe Senator from New York. The fact is, we have already identified an \nappropriate amount of funding for this area of concern in the bill. The \ncommittee has reviewed the request very carefully. Because the \ncommittee has exhausted its allocation of funds available to it under \nthe allocation of the full committee on appropriations, we have \nidentified what we think is an appropriate amount of funding for this \narea of concern and activity of the Department of Homeland Security. I \nmake a point of order under section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget \nAct that the amendment provides spending in excess of the \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable sections \nof the Congressional Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the amount appropriated for baggage screening \n                  activities, and for other purposes)\n\n       Beginning on page 10, line 25, strike ``$1,437,460,000'' \n     and all that follows through ``presence'' on page 11, line 3, \n     and insert the following: ``$1,512,460,000 shall be for \n     baggage screening activities, of which $210,000,000 shall be \n     available only for procurement of checked baggage explosive \n     detection systems and $75,000,000 shall be available only for \n     installation of checked baggage explosive detection systems; \n     and not to exceed $796,890,000 shall be for airport security \n     direction and enforcement presence, of which $217,890,000 \n     shall be available for airport information technology''.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Byrd \nand their staffs for working with me to draft the Ensign-Bond \namendment, which has 20 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle.\n  This amendment addresses a shortfall in the Transportation Security \nAdministration's budget for our airports' in-line baggage screening \nsystems, or Explosive Detection Systems, for all checked baggage.\n  My amendment adds $75 million to the TSA's budget request of $250 \nmillion, for a total of $325 million. It is fully offset through a \nreduction in TSA's airport information technology and support.\n  TSA has asked for a $154 million increase in airport information \ntechnology, so we will still be giving them half of that increase. \nStill, even with this offset, this technology account is left with $218 \nmillion, and the reduction will not damage TSA's mission.\n  The reason I am offering this amendment is clear: One of the major \nthreats of terrorism we face today is crowded airport lobbies. The huge \nexplosive detection devices in the lobbies of airports makes the \npacked-in crowds an inviting target for terrorists. They could harm and \nkill more people in an airport lobby than they could on an entire \nairplane these days.\n  The amount that TSA requested in fiscal year 2005 for in-line baggage \nscreening is not enough to fully fund the eight airports that are \ncurrently constructing their baggage systems, let alone the 21 airports \nthat are waiting for money to become available so they can start their \nown.\n  It is estimated that $5 billion is needed to fully install the \nbaggage screening systems. At $250 million a year, we are not going to \nget there any time soon. We need to live up to our obligation to our \nairports by clearing the backlog of airports that need to get these \nmonster machines out of their lobbies. It is a huge unfunded mandate \nfor airports that have to operate on tight budgets.\n  Our airports will be safer as a result. In fact, one of the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission is to expedite the installation \nof in-line baggage screening equipment. We will never get there if TSA \ncannot request enough funding for eight airports, let alone for all the \nairports in America that need these baggage screening systems.\n  In summary, my amendment is offset and will help 30 airports in our \ncountry speed up the installation of their in-line baggage screening \nsystems. We have a huge vulnerability on our hands, and we need to act \nquickly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we reviewed the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada. We think it should be accepted by \nthe Senate, so we hope it will be adopted on a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate? If not, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3598) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3630\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in my conversations with the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Mississippi, it is my \nunderstanding the bipartisan amendment I offered earlier today--on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Specter, along with several other \ncolleagues, including Senators Stabenow, Snowe, Biden, Mikulski, \nCorzine, and Clinton--to provide funds to fire departments to hire \nfirefighters, will be accepted by the committee. That being the case, I \nsee no reason for us to ask for a rollcall vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Volunteer \nFire Council be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              National Volunteer Fire Council,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2004.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: The National Volunteer Fire Council \n     (NVFC) is a non-profit membership association representing \n     the interests of the more than 800,000 members of America's \n     volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services. On behalf of our \n     membership, I am writing to lend our full support for your \n     amendment to the FY 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations \n     Bill to fund the SAFER program at the $100 million level.\n       The Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response \n     (SAFER) Firefighters Act, which was passed as part of the FY \n     2004 Defense Authorization bill, would not only provide \n     grants to local fire departments to hire additional \n     personnel, but also includes a component to provide grants to \n     volunteer and combination departments to implement \n     recruitment and retention programs. In addition, the \n     amendment includes language that ensures that firefighters \n     hired under the SAFER Bill are guaranteed the right to \n     continue to volunteer in other jurisdictions during their \n     off-duty hours.\n       As you know, recruitment and retention is often cited as \n     the number one challenge facing America's volunteer fire and \n     EMS departments. The SAFER program would not only help to \n     address staffing shortages in career departments, but would \n     go a long way to reverse the national trend in the volunteer \n     fire service that has resulted in a loss of nearly 15% of the \n     volunteer ranks in the last 20 years.\n       Once again, we strongly support your amendment to the FY \n     2005 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill and we thank you \n     for your continued leadership and support of America's fire \n     service. If you or your staff have any questions please feel \n     free to contact Craig Sharman, NVFC Director of Government \n     Relations at (202) 887-5700.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Philip C. Stittleburg,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate immensely the support of the Senator from \nMississippi and others who are willing to accept the amendment. I want \nto commend Senator Byrd, Senator Specter, as well as their staffs, for \nthe tremendous efforts they have made on behalf of the amendment. We \nwere able to work out an offset that will not do any significant damage \nto the management and administrative functions of the Homeland Security \nDepartment. We still would have a 35-percent increase in title I, and \nroughly the status quo when it comes to title IV.\n  Firefighter staffing is the No. 1 issue for firefighters all across \nAmerica. By agreeing to this amendment, we are fulfilling our pledge to \nthese heroes to do everything we can to not only provide them with the \nmaterials, training, and equipment they need, but also the necessary \npersonnel these departments\n\n[[Page S9184]]\n\nmust have if they are going to complete their jobs.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Mississippi and his staff for their \noutstanding efforts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis good advice and suggestions in the handling of this bill. We \nrecommend we proceed to a voice vote on his amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3630.\n  The amendment (No. 3630) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3639\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. Bingaman. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to laying aside \nthe pending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 3639.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for continued support by the New Mexico National \n     Guard for the performance of the vehicle and cargo inspection \n           activities of the Department of Homeland Security)\n\n       On page 39, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       Sec. 515. During fiscal year 2005 the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security and the Secretary of Defense shall permit the New \n     Mexico Army National Guard to continue performing vehicle and \n     cargo inspection activities in support of the Bureau of \n     Customs and Border Protection and the Bureau of Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement under the authority of the Secretary \n     of Defense to support counterdrug activities of law \n     enforcement agencies.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment which simply \nprovides that during fiscal year 2005, the Secretary of Defense shall \npermit the New Mexico Army National Guard personnel to continue \nperforming vehicle and cargo inspection activities in support of \nCustoms and Border Protection and immigration enforcement agencies \nalong the border.\n  This is work our New Mexico National Guard has been doing now for \nsome time. They do an excellent job. We have 17 full-time guardsmen who \nare involved with this inspection. They are well trained to accomplish \nthis work. This is work which will be very difficult for the other \nFederal agencies involved to try to take over themselves. It is \nimportant that the National Guard be allowed to continue doing the \nwork. The amendment would accomplish that. It is a very meritorious \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we understand the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Domenici, is a cosponsor of the amendment. We appreciate \nSenator Bingaman's bringing this issue to the attention of the Senate. \nWe recommend that we proceed to a voice vote on the Senator's \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3639.\n  The amendment (No. 3639) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3636\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue that is \nvitally important. If there are any pending amendments, I ask unanimous \nconsent that they be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I call up amendment No. 3636.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Burns, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Brownback, \n     Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Mr. Hagel, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3636.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide emergency disaster assistance to agricultural \n producers in Florida and other States due to losses from hurricanes, \n        droughts, freezes, floods, and other natural disasters)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n          TITLE __--EMERGENCY AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\n     SEC. __01.

Res. \n     649 (108th Congress) and applicable to the Senate by section \n     14007 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2005 \n     (Public Law 108-287; 118 Stat. 1014).\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan amendment. My \ncolleague from Montanam Mr. Burns, is a cosponsor of the amendment, \nalong with Senators Roberts, Brownback, Hagel, Conrad, Dorgan, and \nNelson from Nebraska. Maybe there will be more later.\n  This amendment provides for emergency agricultural natural disaster \nassistance. Some might ask why I am offering this amendment, \nparticularly on this bill. The answer is very simple. First of all, \nthere is a tremendous need, a need in rural America to address drought \nagricultural disaster assistance. Just as there is a need in Florida \nbecause of the two hurricanes which have devastated that State, and a \nthird potentially on its way, for agricultural disaster assistance, \nagricultural disasters from droughts in many parts of America are just \nas devastating. We don't hear about them as much because it is in the \nnature of a silent killer. They don't get on TV as much. It is over a \nperiod of time, for years. But the effect is just the same, if not \nworse, in many parts of our country.\n  We are in America. We are an entire country. Just above the Presiding \nOfficer is our national motto, ``e pluribus unum.'' Clearly, this is \nsomething of which we should all be reminded. We are many States, but \nwe are one Nation, here to help each other--one indeed.\n  Our amendment would fully fund the Crop Disaster Program, the \nLivestock Assistance Program, and the American Indian Livestock Feed \nProgram for losses incurred in 2003 or 2004. The producer would have \nthe option of deciding which of the 2 years he or she needs the \nassistance.\n  I might point out that in 1996, the year before the major years of \ndrought began, Montana sold $847 billion worth of wheat. Just a couple \nyears ago, we sold only $366 million. That is a 43-percent decline. \nWhy? Essentially because of drought.\n  This devastation does not end at the front door of our rural homes. \nIt is unrelenting and has taken an enormous economic toll on our \ncommunities as well as our farmers. It will take years to recover. \nBusinesses are closing doors. Employees are being layed off in many \nparts of rural America as a consequence, and main streets are just \ndrying up. Producers are considering selling parcels of land they own \nor pieces of equipment that they have in order to keep their operation \ngoing. They will do so only if they can keep the farm or the ranch that \ntheir family has been working on for, in many cases, generations, and \nscraping that money together has never been more difficult as most of \nthe potential buyers are similarly in financial straits.\n  So we are drying up in many parts of the country. It is all \npatchwork. It is not uniform. There are certain parts of the drought \nthat even in certain parts of my State of Montana, you can tell from \nthis map which indicates it is very dry. Some parts are more drought \nstricken than others. This bill is tailored to give help to those \nproducers who are experiencing drought, who have a disaster, very \nlittle of their crop is left, and they would be compensated for only a \nportion of the loss. We have to act now.\n  Some will say: Put this off to another bill. This is the Homeland \nSecurity bill. This is not an agricultural disaster assistance bill.\n  That is a technical argument. The unanimous consent request states, \nand I will point it out to my colleagues, that first-degree amendments \nto this bill are in order related to the text of homeland security and \nnatural disasters. This is a natural disaster amendment.\n  This bill clearly contemplates amendments that address assistance to \nparts of the country that are experiencing natural disasters. You might \nhear, gee whiz, after all, we should wait until an agriculture bill \ncomes up. We cannot do that. We know there are 3 weeks left before we \nare scheduled to adjourn. There is no time to wait. We know the big \ndisaster bill comes up for Florida, and we know the pressure here for \nthat to be a clean bill--don't add anything to it because it so \naccurately portrays the devastation in Florida, and there is going to \nbe a rush to adjourn and they don't want any amendments, and that will \nhappen.\n  We are going to hear the argument to put it off until the \nsupplemental or another bill. Well, you have to strike while the iron \nis hot here. You need to take advantage of your opportunities. This is \nneeded now, not weeks from now. It is needed right now. Frankly, a bird \nin the hand is worth two in the bush. If we don't act now, we \njeopardize assistance that farmers deserve, as well as the folks in \nFlorida.\n  I point out that we see hurricanes and tornadoes and ice storms and \nfloods in the news; newspapers and television cover that. Those folks \ndeserve help and we will give them help before we adjourn.\n  We must also remember that an agricultural disaster such as drought \nis more of a silent killer; it is not as visible on TV screens, but the \neffect is just as bad, if not worse.\n  You are going to hear, why doesn't the farm bill take care of all \nthis? We know it is important to remind ourselves that disaster \nassistance is completely separate from funding in the farm bill. It is \na totally different animal, a different phenomenon.\n  The argument is also made that farmers and ranchers should be \nsatisfied with the funding they will receive in the farm bill. The \ntruth is, only 18 percent of the total funding in the farm bill goes \ndirectly to producers. The rest goes to food stamps, nutrition \nprograms, et cetera. The farm bill is never intended to cover losses \nfrom natural disasters; it is economic losses, not natural disasters, \nas this amendment so provides.\n  In the same way we use emergency funds to rebuild communities hurt by \ntornadoes and hurricanes, we should rebuild communities hurt by \ndrought. We should not treat natural disasters differently and just pay \nattention to the ones that make the evening news. A disaster is a \ndisaster. There is no reason a double standard should apply. We must \nnot and cannot continue to ignore the impact of drought, the effect it \nhas on our agricultural producers,\n\n[[Page S9186]]\n\nand our rural communities. It is every bit as deserving of assistance.\n  I repeat that it is just as important as small business owners in \nFlorida or anybody else. Florida needs assistance and we will give them \nthat. Those folks are hurting. But I might also say that parts of rural \nAmerica need assistance and we should give them assistance because they \nare hurting just as much in some cases, if not worse.\n  I will end there, just by saying this is bipartisan. We have just as \nmany Republican cosponsors as Democratic cosponsors. It is not a \npolitical issue. This is meant to help people who really need help.\n  With that, I yield the floor and urge my colleagues to take a good \nlong hard look at this and not be--I am trying to use another word--\ndeceived by arguments that say this is just a Homeland Security bill. \nThat is a technicality. The unanimous consent provides for natural \ndisaster amendments to this bill. Second, there is no time to wait. \nThat is why we are here. That is why we are elected, to do what is \nright.\n  Somebody, who was wise, said to me: When you are going to do \nsomething, do it now, don't wait. Second, do it right the first time. \nDon't do it wrong the first time.\n  I think if we are going to do it, we should do it now, do it right \nthe first time; and the right way is a basic, simple amendment. We are \nnot trying to take advantage of somebody or pad anybody's pockets. It \nis to help people who need help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \nof the Senators from Montana, Kansas, and others States that have been \naffected by natural disasters. We have enormous sympathy for the State \nof Florida and the extraordinary disasters they have faced, and we are \nready to help them, as we have been helped in the past.\n  My State has once again been hit by the most remarkable set of \ndisasters I have seen yet--and I have seen a lot--from the worst floods \nin the 1990s--we had the 500-year flood of the Red River. People may \nrecall the images of that extraordinary flooding. In the 1980s, we had \nthe worst drought since the 1930s.\n  This year, our State has been hit by a combination of flooding and \ndrought that is truly stunning. It is almost hard to express what I \nhave seen as I have crisscrossed North Dakota this summer.\n  These headlines on the chart sum up a little of what people in North \nDakota have been reading all year: ``Water Everywhere, While Deadline \nLooms to Get Crops in the Ground.'' What that is talking about is that, \nin our State this year, nearly 2 million acres were prevented from even \nbeing planted because of extraordinary flooding. This is a continuation \nof the flooding in the Devil's Lake Basin that we have seen over the \npast 6 or 7 years. This lake is now bigger than the District of \nColumbia; it is several times the size of the District of Columbia. The \nlake has risen 25 feet in the last 7 years.\n  Throughout this entire basin, which is the size of the State of \nMassachusetts, the land is increasingly under water. There is a joke in \nNorth Dakota that Lake Agassiz may be reforming. Lake Agassiz, my \ncolleagues will remember, was a giant lake, a glacial lake that covered \nmuch of the State of North Dakota in earlier ages.\n  Something truly phenomenal is happening in my State. Some have \nsuggested that global climate change is affecting the severity of the \nweather. I don't know, but something dramatic is happening. We have \ntowns that have experienced 18 inches of rain in 1 day, and these are \nplaces that only get 20 inches of rain in a year. It is Biblical and it \nis unlike anything we have ever seen.\n  In the midst of all of this, we had a killer frost in August. Whoever \nheard of a frost in August? In fact, we had several frosts in August. \nAnd while that is happening in the northern tier of the State, in the \nsouthwestern part of the State is the meanest, toughest drought I have \nseen in my lifetime. I just toured the southwestern part of our State. \nIn county after county, I was in pastures that are like moonscapes \nbecause nothing is growing.\n  This is a headline from one of the newspapers back home: ``Drought \nCancels Annual Crop Show.'' They cannot have a crop show because there \nare no crops to show. That is how devastating the drought has been in \nthe southwestern part of the State. At the same time, the great irony \nis, just a hundred miles north, it is so wet they cannot get the crops \noff. I had one farmer--Mr. Baucus--say to me: The incredible thing \nhere, Senator, is when you look from the road, it looks like there is \n90 bushels of barley there, but you cannot get in to harvest it because \nit is so wet that your equipment bogs down. Now, here we are in the \nsecond week of September and there are very few days left that will be \nwarm enough to mature the crop. The result is going to be losses that \nwill mount geometrically.\n  This says, ``Losses Total $530 million.'' This is our State \nuniversity that has done a calculation of the extraordinary losses. \nAlready, there have been Presidential disaster declarations.\n  I make these points because while we have enormous sympathy for \nFlorida and are prepared to assist them and to vote for natural \ndisaster assistance to them, they are not the only ones being affected \nby natural disasters. I wish it were not so. I wish nobody was being \nfaced with natural disasters, but that is the circumstance we face.\n  On this most recent tour, this is a wheat field that we were looking \nat. This is a wheat field in September. It is not up much past a \nperson's socks. There is nothing here. It was a total loss. These \npeople are going to lose their entire investment.\n  Here is a cornfield. We say knee high by the Fourth of July. You can \nsee this corn is not knee high by the first week in September. In fact, \nmost of these corn plants have no ears on them. About one in four has \nany ears, and the ears they have are like those little miniature ears \nthat one gets in a salad when going to a restaurant. It is unlike \nanything I have ever seen.\n  This is a cornfield that is totally stunted. This is one of my \nassistants who is holding up this corn plant showing there are no ears \non it. It is a total loss. As the farmer who was with me said: Senator, \nthat is garbage. That whole field is just garbage.\n  Yet here is another part of North Dakota--I do not know if people can \nsee this clearly through the television lens, but this is mile after \nmile of northern North Dakota--water, water everywhere. Everywhere one \nlooks there is water. That is the circumstance we face in North Dakota.\n  In the middle of all of this, here is a map that shows the damage. \nThere are 1.7 million acres that were prevented from even being planted \nall across northern North Dakota. All the green area is places where \nacreage was prevented from being planted. Just to put 1.7 million acres \nin perspective, how much is that? That is 25 percent more than the \nwhole State of Delaware. That is the acreage they could not even plant. \nThose who were lucky enough to plant could not harvest. They could not \nharvest because it is so wet the machines are bogged down. That is what \nwe are facing in North Dakota. It is not just drought and it is not \njust flooding.\n  On top of that, killer frost. Here is the indication of where they \nhad killer frost. My colleagues can see in the blue those are areas \nthat had killing frost this year. On August 20, 2004, there were \nfreezing temperatures. The areas in the lightest blue experienced \ntemperatures from 28.5 degrees to 32.2. In the next shade of blue, 32.2 \nto 35.9. In all of these areas, enormous damage was done to the crops.\n  One does not have to take my word for it. We brought back pictures \nshowing what has happened. This picture is from Cass County, ND, an ear \nof corn unaffected. This picture was taken on August 24. That is a \nhealthy ear of corn. Look at the Foster County picture taken the day \nbefore, August 23. This is frost-damaged corn.\n  My colleagues can see what a totally different picture it is, the \ndifference between corn that is healthy and unaffected and that which \nhas been damaged by frost.\n  The losses in my State are now enormous and growing geometrically. \nOur State university just did this assessment: Prevented planting \nlosses as I described, 1.7 million acres, a loss of over $206 million; \ncrop production losses, $264 million; crop quality losses,\n\n[[Page S9187]]\n\nanother $58 million. Total losses in my State so far, $530 million.\n\n  Now, some say that is what crop insurance is for. Let me explain. \nCrop insurance will only cover 40 percent of the loss, not even 40 \npercent of the loss, because of the way crop insurance works. That is \nwith the vast majority of my farmers buying crop insurance. Some will \nsay, gee, more farmers should have bought crop insurance. In my State \nmore than 90 percent of the farmers do buy crop insurance.\n  The way crop insurance works, it in no way makes one whole. It just \noffsets the losses, and when the losses are this massive and this \nsignificant, crop insurance only covers less than 40 percent. This \nshows net direct crop losses of almost $330 million.\n  The economists at our State university then did an analysis of what \nthe indirect losses would be to the State. Households will lose $511 \nmillion. Retail sales will be reduced by $245 million, and put in the \ndirect crop losses, that is an economic loss to North Dakota's economy \nof over $1 billion, and $1 billion to my little State is a huge amount \nof money. I know in Washington $1 billion may not seem all that \nsignificant. It may not be all that significant in California or New \nYork, but in North Dakota $1 billion is real money. It means real \nhardship to real people, people who deserve assistance just as much as \nthe people in Florida who have been devastated by hurricane after \nhurricane.\n  Our people have not been hit by a hurricane. They have been hit by \nflooding, frost, and drought. What a perverse collection of natural \ndisasters to visit any State in any year.\n  The final point I wish to make to my colleagues who may be concerned \nthat we are busting the budget is this is what has happened to the \npattern of farm payments under the new farm bill. The national press \nhas missed this story completely, I might say, but the fact is, farm \nprogram payments have come down dramatically under the new farm bill.\n  This is where they were under the old farm bill, $32.3 billion in the \nyear 2000; 2001 it came down to $22.1 billion; 2002, $15.7 billion. \nThen we had a tick up in 2003 to $17 billion, and in 2004 they are \nanticipating the spending will be $11.5 billion. That is $20 billion \nless than 2000. The national press has not reported this at all.\n  The fact is, the new farm bill is costing a lot less than what we \nwere spending under the old farm bill, much less. This year, it is $20 \nbillion less than the cost was going to be in 2000.\n  My colleagues know I have been voting against waivers of the Budget \nAct for amendment after amendment, and I have told my colleagues there \nis only one exception for me and that is natural disaster, whether it \nis Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, North Dakota, \nMinnesota, Montana.\n  The hard reality is, natural disasters are unpredictable. Nobody can \nknow who is next. Nobody can know who is going to face a flood or a \ndrought or a hurricane. That is why we have always treated them as \nemergencies, with emergency funding. That is my intention this year as \nwell.\n  I believe we have natural disasters. Nobody could have predicted \nHurricane Charley or Hurricane Frances or Hurricane Ivan. And nobody \ncould have predicted these terrible droughts.\n  Senator Nelson from Nebraska said we ought to be naming droughts \nbecause then it would get more attention. It kind of personalizes \nthings. People could understand when we are getting hit with a natural \ndisaster, because it has a name. We don't name droughts. Maybe we \nshould. We certainly name a hurricane and that helps us personalize it \nand remember it. Droughts and floods don't have names, but I will tell \nyou what, they affect real people who have names.\n  I have gone all across my State in dozens of farm meetings, all \nacross the northern tier of North Dakota with this devastating \nflooding, and all across the southwestern part of my State with this \ndisastrous drought. These are real people, real families, who are being \ndevastated and, through no fault of their own, they are on the brink of \nbeing pushed off the farm. They have been devastated every bit as much \nas the people in Florida. All of them deserve our assistance and our \nsupport. I hope very much our colleagues will support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3641\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask the pending amendment be set aside \nand that we take up amendment No. 3641, which has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Mr. Carper, proposes an amendment numbered 3641.\n       On page 20, line 14, strike ``rail'' and insert ``inter-\n     city passenger rail transportation (as defined in section \n     24102(5) of title 49, United States Code), freight rail,''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. I give \ntremendous thanks to Senator Tom Carper of Delaware who has worked so \nhard on this amendment, and Senator Biden for his strong support. They \nhave been a real leadership team, in terms of real security for Amtrak. \nI am pleased we were able to work together.\n  I also thank Senator Cochran enormously, because he has been so \nhelpful to us, and of course Senator Byrd. Basically, last March we \nreceived what should have been a wake-up call when terrorists blew up a \ncommuter train in Madrid, Spain, killing nearly 200 people and injuring \n1,400. I don't think there is any American who will not remember our \nshock and sadness at what occurred.\n  Obviously, we have to address the vulnerabilities of America's rail \nsystems. We must act now. I am so pleased that the bill before us \nincludes more than $207 million for rail and transit security. This \namendment that Senator Carper has done so much work on and which I have \nworked with him on will make it clear that all rail operators will be \neligible for this vital funding. This will allow the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to use full discretion to allocate funds to those \noperators with the greatest need regardless of whether they are local \ntransit agencies, Amtrak, or freight railroad. This minor change will \ngo a long way toward helping, and clearly many of us believe we need to \ndo more.\n  I proudly sit on the Commerce Committee. That committee has now twice \nvoted out rail security bills that are very strong. But adding more \ndollars to rail security would enable us to do more checking on what \nmay be lying on the railroad tracks and set up a system so we can be \nsure that baggage on trains does not contain bombs. We have K-9 teams.\n  There are many things we want to do. It is a great frustration for me \nthat even though Senator McCain and Senator Hollings and the whole \ncommittee in a bipartisan way passed railroad security not once but \ntwice, that bill sits at the desk, as does the port security bill that \nwe voted out, as does the nuclear plant security bill the Environment \nCommittee voted out, and the chemical plant security bill. It is \nfrustrating. But tonight, at least we have a chance to do a little bit \nmore for rail security. I am very grateful for that. I know this \namendment has been cleared on both sides.\n  I see Senator Carper coming to the Senate floor, so I will yield the \nfloor. But once more, I give him my tremendous thanks for his very hard \nwork. It is wonderful to see that we can accomplish something when we \nreach across the aisle. We have taken a big step. Of course, we want to \ntake even bigger steps to make sure our rail passengers are safe.\n  I will yield the floor at this time. I would like to know, because I \nwould like to leave the floor at this time, if it is OK to ask for this \namendment to be adopted in a unanimous consent fashion at the \nconclusion of Senators who wish to speak.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am happy to \nexpress my support for the adoption of this amendment on a voice vote \nat the conclusion of the remarks of Senators\n\n[[Page S9188]]\n\nfrom Delaware and California or any other Senators who would like to \nspeak.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. At the end of Senator Carper's remarks, if no \nother Senator seeks recognition, then he can make that request. Would \nthat be appropriate at that time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, that would be my suggestion. If the \nSenator will yield, we will adopt the amendment on a voice vote at the \nconclusion of the remarks of Senators who are interested.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My thanks to everyone involved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before Senator Boxer leaves the Senate \nfloor, I want to thank her for her tenacity and leadership on this \nissue. I think we have come to a conclusion.\n  I see my senior Senator, Senator Biden, has joined us as well. This \nis an issue he has worked on longer than I have been in the Senate. I \nwant to say to my friend, job well done.\n  I say to Senator Cochran and his staff on the Senate floor, and \nSenator Byrd as well, thank you very much for working with us in \nwriting a very good compromise. A number of us have expressed concern \nupon learning that as money was added to this bill for transit \nsecurity, there was an inability--in fact, no ability--for us to access \nthese dollars to enhance security for inner-city passenger rail, on \nrails principally Amtrak, and to enhance the safety and security of \nfreight railroad operations.\n  As it turns out, the Northeast corridor, which runs from Washington, \nDC, up to Boston, MA, is owned by Amtrak. Not only do Amtrak trains ply \nthese corridors from here to Baltimore to Wilmington to Philadelphia \nand New York, on to Boston, but you can stop in Providence, the State \nof the Presiding Officer. Also, a lot of freight rail use these tracks. \nThe tracks themselves, the overhead wires, the tunnels through which \nthese trains go, the bridges over which they cross are owned and \noperated by Amtrak. The commuter trains that use the tracks from here \nto New York City and on up to Boston in many cases are owned and \noperated by Amtrak. For us to have passed legislation here today which \nattempts to promote rail security at least by giving money through \nState and local governments to transit operations without allowing \nAmtrak to have any access to those moneys I believe would be very \nshortsighted.\n\n  With the addition of this language which we have worked out on the \nRepublican and Democratic side, we have actually a larger pot of money \nthan we started with. That is good. With the addition of this \namendment, we have the ability to enhance the safety and security of \ninner-city passenger rail operations and freight rail operations, too.\n  When I go home later this week, I will probably take the train. There \nis a tunnel that runs under this Capitol in which we work that is about \n100 years old. There are concerns about the safety and security of \ntrains that go through there. There is a tunnel under Baltimore that is \nabout 130 or 140 years old. There are six tunnels that are about 100 \nyears old which go in and out of New York City and under the rivers. \nThey have problems with respect to ventilation, lighting, surveillance, \nand all kinds of safety concerns. They need to be addressed, and they \ncan be addressed at least partly with money made available here.\n  Not all enhancements to safety and security for rail need to be as \nexpensive as fixing old tunnels. Some of them can be as inexpensive as \nadding dollars for an old technology--the ability of our K-9 corps to \ndetect bombs and explosives. It is as good today as it was 20, 30, or \n40 years ago. With this money, those folks who are running our inner-\ncity passenger rail will be able to better use K-9, if that makes \nsense, for detecting and ensuring our trains don't end up with \nexplosives on board.\n  Again, in conclusion, we have come to a good place. This is not an \namendment that, frankly, asks for more money. It is an amendment that \nactually enables us to use some common sense in allocating the moneys \nthat have been added to the bill. It will allow us to enhance the \nsafety and operation of our commuter operations, whether it be commuter \ntrains or buses. Hopefully, we will also be able to use a good deal of \nthis money to enhance the safety of inner-city passenger rail and some \nof our freight operations. For that, I think we can all be grateful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3641) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to read a list of supporters \nof the pending amendment which provides for emergency agricultural \ndisaster assistance: the Alabama Farmers Federation, American Corn \nGrowers Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean \nAssociation, Georgia Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, Georgia \nPeanut Commission, National Association of Farmer Elected Committees, \nNational Association of State Departments of Agriculture, National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, National Barley Growers Association, \nNational Cotton Council, National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, \nNational Farmers Union, National Grain Sorghum Producers, National Milk \nProducers Federation, National Potato Council, National Sunflower \nAssociation, Southern Peanut Farmers Federation, U.S. Canola \nAssociation, USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council, USA Rice Federation, and \nWomen Involved in Farm Economics.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if consent is necessary, to \nadd as cosponsors to the pending amendment Senator Coleman of \nMinnesota, Senator Dayton of Minnesota, and Senator Clinton of New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think the growing support indicates we \nshould adopt this amendment. There may be a point of order raised. It \nwould be a technicality. I hope if that is raised, Senators will vote \nto waive that point of order so we can help some people in America, \nfarmers and ranchers in various States all around our country, who have \nsuffered from drought disasters or, as in the case in North Dakota--it \nis very interesting--from flood disaster.\n  It was very sad listening to Senator Conrad speak about North Dakota, \nhow part of the State has been devastated by flooding, with 18 inches \nof rain in 1 day, if you can believe it. The average annual rainfall in \nthe upper plains States is about 14 inches a year. They had 18 inches \nin 1 day. That is in one part of North Dakota. In another part of North \nDakota, they have had the worst drought he has said he has seen in his \nlifetime.\n  I might say, the condition is somewhat similar to that in Montana. \nNortheast Montana is getting a little more moisture than it usually \ngets, but southwest Montana is getting a lot less than it normally \ngets. It is hard to know where we are going to get drought and where we \nare not. But there is drought.\n  We are asking to use the formulas that are in the law; that is, the \nEmergency Livestock Feed Program and the Crop Disaster Assistance \nProgram. Let's use the formulas in the law. If they need disaster \nassistance, we should give it to them.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nMurray as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The more I speak, the more I am getting cosponsors. I \nought to keep talking. They are coming in at a rate of about four a \nminute.\n  With that, I urge Senators to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S9189]]\n\n                                 trees\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I would like to engage the Senator from Montana in a \ncolloquy on Senate amendment No. 3636, the agriculture disaster \nassistance amendment. I appreciate his hard work in bringing this \namendment forward. New York's farmers have suffered this year--both \nfrom heavy rains in July and from damaging winter frosts. In \nparticular, both apple trees and grape vines were destroyed in New York \nthis past winter. And while the losses for this year's crop will be \ncovered by the crop disaster assistance provisions of this amendment, \nit is the tree assistance program that assists growers in replacing \ntheir lost trees and vines. So I thank the Senator for including that \nprovision, and I would like to clarify with the Senator that the term \n``tree'' as used in his amendment is used in the same way as it is \ndefined in the 2002 farm bill. That is, term ``tree'' in this context \nmeans trees, bushes and vines, and would therefore assist New York's \napple growers and grape growers alike.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator from New York for her support of the \namendment, and I assure her that the Tree Assistance Program provision \nin my amendment is intended to cover eligible losses of trees, bushes \nand vines.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator for his assurance on this issue.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nbipartisan amendment offered by my good friends and colleagues from \nMontana, Senators Baucus and Burns, and am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of this measure important to my State of Minnesota.\n  Earlier this year, heavy precipitation and moisture prevented many \nfarm families from planting a crop at all and not long afterward, many \nof them lost what they had planted. This led to a disaster declaration \nrequest for three especially hard hit counties along the Canadian \nborder: Lake of the Woods, Roseau, and Marshall Counties.\n  Then, after a late start in the growing season, my State's farm \nfamilies were hit with a bizarre August, yes August, freeze that took \nits toll on another at least 29 counties for which disaster \ndeclarations are being sought. This includes pretty much everything \nnorth of Interstate 94 that runs from the Twin Cities northwest toward \nFargo Moorhead.\n  It's been said that Minnesota is a place with 9 months of winter and \n3 months of poor sledding but a freeze in August even surprised us.\n  But all kidding aside, this has been a rough season for my farm \nfamilies and depending on what happens in the next few weeks, it could \nget a lot worse and become a statewide problem. My farm families tell \nme, particularly south of I-94, that they need an extra 15 days of \ngrowing season beyond what is normal in order to get the heat units \nnecessary to produce a decent crop. If they don't, they are looking at \nsome of the lowest yields since the great flood of 1993, which I \nremember as the newly minted Mayor of Saint Paul when the same flood \nripped up parts of our capitol city.\n  Now, I know some folks think that we should not be providing disaster \nassistance to my farm families. They note that my farmers already have \ninsurance. In fact, better than 95 percent of my farm families do carry \ncrop insurance. But, those who face other kinds of disasters also carry \ninsurance, and yet this does not bar them from disaster relief--nor \nshould it. In fact, folks who carry insurance on their cars, on their \nboats, on their businesses, and on their houses carry insurance that--\nsave the deductible--allows them to recoup the market value of what \nthey have lost. Not so with farmers. Our farmers have to absorb as much \nas 15 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and sometimes even more of their \nloss alone before they even begin to qualify under their insurance \npolicy. So, disaster assistance is meant to help bridge the gap that \nexists for farmers but not for others.\n  This disaster assistance amendment is not out of bounds. It is the \ntraditional level of disaster provided in past years. There is a crop \ndisaster payment covering crops of every kind; a livestock assistance \nprogram that helps our livestock producers recoup feed costs resulting \nfrom natural disaster; and a quality loss program to help producers who \ndo not suffer yield losses but suffer quality losses that cut into the \nprice they receive in the market place.\n  Frankly, I believe it is time for us to put our heads together in a \nbipartisan fashion and craft a more coherent, predictable, fiscally \nresponsible, and long-term policy that better addresses natural \ndisasters. I know that this has been attempted in earnest numerous \ntimes in the context of crop insurance--with considerable success--as \nwell as in the context of an emergency reserve or standing disaster \nprogram, albeit with less traction in this regard. But, clearly, we \nneed to take another hard look at this issue and see what we can do \nabout alleviating the need for ad hoc relief like this, which is not \nvery reliable to those it's intended to help and not the best option in \nterms of Federal budgeting.\n  I urge the amendment's adoption, but I do so looking down the road a \nways in hopes that, in the future, we find a new and better way of \naddressing these crises whose timing we can not always predict but \nwhose occurrence we can certainly all foresee.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I support our amendment to \nprovide emergency drought disaster assistance for farmers and ranchers \nwho have suffered under a prolonged--in some areas a 5 year--drought. I \nam pleased to be working with Senators Conrad, Baucus, Dorgan, Burns, \nRoberts and Brownback to offer this amendment. It is a bipartisan \namendment, with strong support. This amendment has the strong support \nof our national farm organizations, such as the American Farm Bureau \nFederation and the National Farmers Union.\n  Nebraska's facing its fifth straight year of record drought, which as \nyou know has a damaging effect on the agriculture industry, as well as \nthe main street of every Nebraska community. The same is true in \nMontana, North Dakota, Kansas and other States as well. Droughts, \nhurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, are natural disasters and \ndeserve to be treated the same. Multiple years of drought have cost our \nNation billions of dollars in economic losses and have many farmers \nwondering whether they'll be able to carry on.\n  We were successful in 2003 in getting assistance to our producers, \nbut only at half the amount necessary. We passed a $3.1 billion \nassistance package that was offset with farm bill programs--a plan I \nopposed. I offered a $6 billion emergency assistance package that if it \nhad passed; we probably wouldn't be here today seeking what we were \ndenied in 2003.\n  I have continuously worked for the additional assistance we have been \nunable to secure. I have repeatedly called on the President and \nCongress to support funding for drought aid for our farmers and \nranchers, and to fully fund the crop and livestock disaster programs so \ncritical to Nebraska's farmers and ranchers. This is of the utmost \nimportance to farmers and ranchers in Nebraska and across all the areas \nsuffering from this natural disaster.\n  The estimated cost for this disaster assistance is $2.9 billion. The \nassistance will be provided through emergency assistance in the form of \na Corp Disaster Program, Quality Loss Program and a Livestock \nAssistance Program. This assistance is targeted to those who need it \nmost. It will help recover eligible losses sustained by producers in \ncounties designated as primary or continuous disaster areas during the \n2003 or 2004 production years.\n  Producers can choose to claim losses for either the 2003 or 2004 \nproduction years, but not both years. This flexibility will allow for \nranchers and producers to seek assistance for the year with the \ngreatest negative impact on their farm operation.\n  I am happy to report that a similar effort is underway in the House \nof Representatives. Nebraska's own Tom Osborne is leading a bipartisan \neffort to secure relief for agriculture producers. I am hopeful that my \nSenate colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment. We must \nrespond to the crisis this drought has caused in Nebraska and our \nMidwestern neighbors.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my fellow Senator from \nMontana in sponsoring this agricultural disaster amendment. Agriculture \nis Montana's largest industry, and these persistent weather-related \nlosses are devastating to our economy. Farmers and ranchers across the \ncountry are\n\n[[Page S9190]]\n\nstruggling to cope with weather-related disasters, and this amendment \nwill deliver needed relief to those producers. Whether we are talking \nabout hurricanes, floods, or the prolonged devastation caused by \ndrought, some of our producers are barely hanging on.\n  I am particularly happy that this amendment responsibly targets \nassistance to those individuals who need it most. It provides crop \ndisaster assistance, livestock disaster assistance, and funds for the \nAmerican Indian livestock feed program. It allows producers to choose \nwhich year's losses 2003 or 2004 were the worst. In Montana, most folks \nsuffered the biggest losses in 2003. Our crop losses that year were \nover $70 million. Livestock producers in many counties in 2003 lost a \ngood percentage of their pasture land to drought. For others, 2004 may \nhave been the year that nearly finished them off. Nearly half of our \ngrazing land is in poor or very poor condition. Record low streamflows \nare still being recorded, and our reservoirs are nearly empty. And even \nthough some of our wheat producers had good yields, topsoil moisture is \nstill well below average. The drought is far from over in Montana, and \nthroughout the West. Some folks need the assistance for 2003 losses, \nothers for severe weather losses incurred this year. This amendment \nwill let farmers and ranchers make the right choice, based on their \nindividual situation.\n  I know some of my colleagues have concerns about the price tag of \nthis bill, and I admit it worries me too. But there are people back \nhome who might not make it another year if they don't get relief from \nthe impacts of a 6-year drought. Drought is a silent killer. It doesn't \nmake headlines, and few television stations report on it. This \nassistance is essential for those people just like it is critical for \nfarmers with flooded cropland, or producers with unexpected summer \nfrost damage. This bill is targeted to just those who meet certain loss \nthresholds, to make sure that assistance goes where it is most needed, \nwhether that need be in Florida, Maine, or Montana. We cannot \ndiscriminate between producers or disasters.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this amendment, and look \nforward to its adoption.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Baucus \namendment. This amendment ensures that farmers and ranchers across the \ncountry will receive assistance for losses sustained through natural \ndisasters.\n  In Kansas this assistance is critical to provide aid to our farmers \nand ranchers who have been hit hard by a multiyear drought. While many \nhave viewed the terrible destruction wrought across Florida and the \nSoutheastern U.S. by successive hurricanes in recent weeks, I cannot \nforget the terrible drought that has continued to grip much of the \nwestern portion of Kansas.\n  I also cannot forget the eerie photographs, taken earlier this \nsummer, of a giant dust cloud that swept across western Kansas. This \ndire result of continuous drought caused Interstate 70 to shut down, \nits dust inundated homes and hospitals and even caused a tragic traffic \naccident that claimed the life of a distinguished Kansan, the late \nState Senator Stan Clark.\n  It may surprise my colleagues, but I am no fan of Federal disaster \nprograms for agriculture. They are difficult to pass and often a \ndisaster to implement.\n  It is unfortunate that the current farm bill, which I voted against, \ndoes not provide producers with assistance when they need it most--when \nthere is no crop to harvest.\n  Without the crop insurance program, which I fought to improve and \nenhance in 2000, and additional Federal disaster aid, many Kansas \nproducers might not be around another year to continue participating in \nthe current farm bill.\n  Mr. President, I stand in support of the Baucus amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been in a markup of the \nAppropriations Committee for the past several hours. I wanted to be \nhere when my colleagues offered the disaster relief legislation. I was \nnot able to be here at that point, but let me add to the comments that \nhave been made by my colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, and my \ncolleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, and many others.\n  The amendment that has been offered, as a bipartisan amendment on \nbehalf of Republicans and Democrats who represent a significant part of \nfarm country, is to ask the Congress to consider passing a disaster \nbill to respond to weather-related disasters in our part of the \ncountry.\n  Let me begin by saying it is my intention that I would support all \nand any resources that are necessary to respond to those who have been \ndevastated by successive hurricanes.\n  Those in Florida and other parts of the Southeast, and now those in \nthe gulf area who may well be hit by another hurricane, have had a \ndevastating time of it. It is sad to see the plight of the victims on \ntelevision when these hurricanes come through and destroy property and \ndestroy homes and destroy livelihoods. It is a pretty awful scene. When \nthat happens, this country has an obligation to extend its hand to \nthose victims and say: You are not alone. This country wishes to help.\n  I have always voted in favor of disaster assistance and always will \nbecause it is part of what this country needs to do for those who have \nbeen hit with tough times. That is certainly the case with respect to \nthose hit by the successive hurricanes in the southern part of our \ncountry. My colleague from Montana and others have said that as \ndevastating as those hurricanes are--and it is hard to adequately \ndescribe the devastation--there are, in addition to the damage from \nthose hurricanes, other areas of the country that have suffered \nweather-related disasters.\n  My State is one of those States. I will describe what has happened in \nmy State.\n  I have toured throughout the entire State of North Dakota in the past \nmonths. In the northern part of our State, torrential rains in the \nspring that came and stayed in a torrent of moisture meant that 1.7 \nmillion acres of ground could not even be planted in North Dakota. \nObviously, that is a serious economic problem for our State, but it is \na devastating circumstance for a farmer that had all of their ground \ninundated by these torrential rains and couldn't plant an acre. That is \na personal circumstance that is very difficult because they will lose \nall of their revenue. Many of them will go out of business. That is a \ntime when disaster assistance is necessary.\n  In other parts of North Dakota in the southwestern corner, I had \nranchers tell me that from January 1 to July 1, they received 2.2 \ninches of moisture total in 6 months. One can imagine what their crops \nlook like.\n  These are two pictures from my State. They describe the circumstances \nfaced by producers. This is a field inundated with water. It would not \nhave been planted, and this farmer would not have an opportunity to \nmake a living by planting this field because the field will be \nprevented from being planted by this water.\n  This, in the same State, looks like a moonscape. It is an area that \nis completely without moisture, a pastureland that has no growth. These \nare from the same State in the same year.\n  We had, in addition to the torrential rains and the drought in \ndifferent parts of the State, in the month of August, strangely enough, \na frost, and then a freeze. What happened as a result? My colleagues \ncan look at a cob of corn. This shows a healthy cob of corn. That is \nwhat you get when you produce it and you have the heat units and you \nare able to harvest and pick the corn. Here is what happens when you \nhave a freeze in August, exactly when corn needs heat units to grow. \nPerhaps even more dramatic, here is what a healthy field of soybeans \nlooks like. We have a lot of acres of soybeans. It looks great, a \nbeautiful green field.\n  Here is what that same field looks like after you have a freeze in \nthe month of August when you need the heat units to be able to have \nthese beans reach maturity and growth.\n  It is estimated by North Dakota State University that in North \nDakota,\n\n[[Page S9191]]\n\nthe impact of these weather-related disasters was about $1 billion \ntotal. The impact on farmers is more than half a billion dollars. And \nthat which is above that, which crop insurance would pay, is over a \nthird of $1 billion. That is a weather-related series of disasters that \nis significant and troubling to the producers in our State.\n  My colleague described the circumstances in Montana. Others will \ndescribe circumstances in their States. The point is, this damage was \nnot from a hurricane that came with a fury and in just a matter of days \nblew its way through and devastated a lot of property. In most cases, \nthis was either a slow motion drought that just drained the life from \nthe soil, or torrential rains, as happened in the northern part of \nNorth Dakota that made 1.7 million acres unplantable. Those, too, are \nweather-related disasters and circumstances in which the Congress \nshould want to--and I expect will want to--reach out its hand to say \nyou are not alone to family farmers and ranchers trying to make a \nliving, trying to survive tough times, trying to deal with weather-\nrelated disasters by themselves.\n\n  I hope this Congress will, once again, say to those family farmers \nand ranchers: You are not alone. You don't have to deal with this by \nyourself because we know you can't. When you lose all sources of \nrevenue for an entire year, then we want to help.\n  I have served in the House and the Senate. I don't believe I have \never failed to support disaster assistance when it is necessary. I will \ncontinue to aggressively support disaster assistance again now for the \npeople of Florida, the Southeast, the people in the gulf region who may \nbe hit. We need to pass that disaster assistance. I will strongly \nsupport that.\n  The amendment being discussed is offered by my colleague and me and \nothers who say there are other weather-related disasters as well that \nwe need to deal with in this bill. We expect our colleagues will \nunderstand that. But it should not in any way be misinterpreted as \nwanting to hold up the necessary resources to deal with and to help \nmake whole those--I guess we probably never make whole people who have \nsuffered a disaster, but at least to say to those folks who have been \nhit over and over again by the vicious hurricanes: You are not alone. \nThis country wishes to help. We are determined to do that.\n  I am pleased to at least raise my voice to say I am going to be one \nperson who supports aggressively that which is needed for the citizens \nof Florida and other parts that have been affected by hurricanes. My \nhope is that they, too, will help our family farmers and ranchers in \nSouth Dakota and North Dakota, Montana, and other regions of our \nnorthern Great Plains that have been hard hit by weather-related \ndisasters this year.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. May I put a question to my colleague?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. We all feel for the enormous damage that has occurred in \nthe State of Florida, and there is great risk that there will be \nadditional damage in other Southern States from these hurricanes. One \nof the great problems that strikes me about the kinds of disasters we \nare talking about in the northern plains, where we have had this severe \ndrought year after year after year, and the Missouri River now, I am \ntold, is at the lowest level in living memory, or at least since it was \nimpounded into the Missouri River Dam, one of the characteristics of \nthat kind of disaster is that it is as profound as a hurricane, but it \nis in slow motion. It does not turn buildings upside down, and it \ndoesn't throw cars around. But what it does to the Earth and the lives \nof these producers is catastrophic.\n  I am especially pleased with the recently adopted drought provision \nto the American Jobs Creation Act. With my support, the Senate adopted \nlegislation authored by Senator Daschle that would provide increased \nflexibility for livestock producers to rebuild their herd after \ndrought. The legislation extends the amount of time from two to four \nyears that producers have to reinvest an amount equivalent to the sale \nof cattle into their farm through the purchase of machinery or \nequipment with no tax owed whatsoever. Unfortunately, the American Jobs \nCreation Act has failed to emerge from conference so that it can be \nvoted on by this body. I am hopeful that we will see this bill emerge \nfrom conference soon, and that this exceptionally beneficial provision \nwill be included.\n  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) released $1.9 \nmillion in unused Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funding for \nstopgap water hauling measures, and authorized emergency grazing on \nConservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres in limited counties across the \ncountry. In South Dakota, only parts of a few counties have qualified \nfor emergency grazing. These measures fail to provide any substantive \nrelief for our agriculture producers during an exceedingly challenging \ntime. I am also concerned for the Agriculture Secretary's recent \ndecision regarding emergency nonfat dry milk assistance. Although nine \nstates and 95 counties were included in this program, South Dakota was \nexcluded from this assistance.\n\n  In 2002 and 2003, Senator Daschle and I pushed for a $6 billion \ndrought relief plan that would have helped many farmers and ranchers \nmake it through this multi-year drought. President Bush and others in \nthe Senate opposed our proposal and in the end, would only allow a $3 \nbillion package to pass. While it has taken an enormous amount of time \nand effort to secure bipartisan support for relief in such a harsh \nbudgetary year, I am pleased to see that Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle recognize the importance of ensuring that victims of \nagriculture disaster are deserving of a comprehensive assistance \npackage. I am pleased to support this amendment and am hopeful for the \nimpact on South Dakota agriculture.\n  I have walked across fields of South Dakota that frankly look like a \nmoonscape, where there is nothing growing. It is simply dirt. Stock \ndams where there is either no water, or the water is of such poor \nquality, it is so murky that it would be a mistake to allow cattle even \nnear the water. In fact, there are stories of pulling cattle out with a \ntractor because they get mired in the mud. It would seem to me that \nthis disaster, although different in nature than the others, is equally \nas profound, equally as damaging, and has an equally long-term negative \nconsequence on those who are victimized as any other disaster that may \nbe striking America today.\n  Does my colleague see it in that perspective?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Johnson has described well the circumstance in a \nnumber of areas.\n  I have seen big, strong family farmers and ranchers with tears in \ntheir eyes describing circumstances where they approached this year \nwith some hope and then discovered that almost everything they intended \nto do was gone. The grain they planted was washed away, or the field \nthey intended to plant was inundated with water and they couldn't plant \nit, or in the Southwest they planted seeds and they never grew because \nthey got no moisture. It is a devastating circumstance.\n  The network of farmers around this country who live on the land, \nunder that yard light all by themselves, they live on hope. They risk \neverything in the spring to put a seed in the ground. They live on hope \nthat somehow it will grow, that somehow they won't get too much rain \nbut they will get enough rain, that they won't have crop disease, that \nall of these things will happen, and they will be able to harvest and \nmaybe somehow there will be a good price when they harvest.\n  But it has been devastating when they can't plant a seed that will \ngrow because there is no moisture, or when they can't plant a seed at \nall because the water has inundated their land. They set their jaw and \nthey act like, well, they will get through this. But many of them have \ntold me that they won't get through this. You can't live without \nincome, especially with the cost of doing business on family farms \nthese days.\n  That is why at this time, in this circumstance, my colleagues who \nhave joined in offering this amendment are simply saying let's say to \nthese folks as well you are not alone. They have had a tough time. \nThis, too, is a weather-related disaster. Let's recognize it and deal \nwith it in an appropriate way. That is what this legislation does.\n\n[[Page S9192]]\n\n  We have done this before. It is time now, and there is a need to do \nit again--to say to family farmers and ranchers in this country: You \nmatter; we care whether you exist out there. You are part of the \nculture of this country in which family values exist, nurturing, \nrefreshing families' values from small towns to big cities.\n  That is part of the important culture of this country. When they are \nin trouble, this country is in trouble. I hope we will agree to advance \nthis amendment as we will advance all the help necessary for the \nhurricane victims.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will make a few comments concerning the \nBaucus amendment requesting $2.65 billion of drought assistance. I have \ntwo or three comments. One, it doesn't belong on this bill. This is the \nHomeland Security bill. This is not an agriculture bill, not even an \nurgent supplemental bill.\n  Senator Reid, the assistant minority leader, has stated repeatedly \nlet's do the supplemental separately from Homeland Security. I happen \nto think he is right. One could debate it, but he stated repeatedly and \nrecommended strongly to the Senate to have a separate bill on the \nPresident's request.\n  The President requested yesterday $3.1 billion for hurricane relief. \nHe requested it yesterday. That doesn't mean it has to be done on the \nHomeland Security bill. Senator Reid thought it should not be on this \nbill. We don't even have that amendment. The President didn't request \ndrought assistance. I looked back over the history of drought \nassistance and I see a lot of requests. In 2002, we had $600 million, I \nguess, in drought assistance. In 2003, it was $3.6 billion.\n  But I might say it was offset by reductions in other programs in the \nAgriculture Committee. How can we pay for this request, because we \ndon't have the Agriculture bill up to have offsets? This bill is not \noffset. This is just to add $2 billion or $3 billion of additional \nmoney. I would like to have it be paid for. I might support it if it is \npaid for. I might not. I want to see how it is paid for. I know in this \ncase it is not paid for. It would add to the deficit. I am not willing \nto do that. So a budget point of order will lie against the amendment, \nand this Senator plans on making one.\n\n  I don't think this is the way we should do business. I think we \nshould follow the regular order, to the extent we can. We should be \ntalking about an appropriations bill and maybe consider the President's \nrequest. If Congress wishes to change it or alter it, I guess we have \nthe right to do so. But to try to double it, when we just got the \nPresident's request, and not even consider an offset, not even look at \nan offset, I think is a serious mistake.\n  I don't know if this is more about helping farmers or politicians. If \nyou want to help farmers, I think we can find a couple billion dollars \nin offsets. We did last year. Why can we not find an offset to pay for \nit this year?\n  I make those comments. Senator Reid urged us time and again to do the \nurgent supplemental separate from Homeland Security. We just received \nthe President's request, which was $3.1 billion, and it didn't include \nthis. To pass an urgent emergency supplemental takes 60 votes, and it \nis this Senator's intention to hopefully join with Senator Cochran and \nSenator Stevens in objecting to the emergency designation and making \nthe budget point of order on this amendment, and passing Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Let's finish the job we have at hand. We have a real problem. Senator \nCochran has done an outstanding job in managing the bill. He has \nalready defeated amendments that totaled over $19 billion--not \nincluding the amendments this afternoon--for 2004, and $256 billion I \nthink over a 10-year period of time, using budget points of order. A \nbudget point of order lies against this amendment as well.\n  So I compliment Senator Cochran for his leadership and urge our \ncolleagues who are pushing this amendment to postpone it, hold it back \nanother day, or find offsets to help pay for it. That is what we did \nlast year. It had strong support last year after it was paid for.\n  If memory serves me correctly--and I am stretching it--early last \nyear we considered this and, initially, people tried to pass it without \noffsets. Objections were raised and eventually some offsets were found. \nThat was done in the early part of last year. That was done in February \nof 2003. I don't think we should just be adding another $2.5 billion to \nour debt and deficit in this manner. So I urge our colleagues, at the \nappropriate time, to support a budget point of order against this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the amount just referred to as \nan urgent supplemental requested by the President of $3 billion is the \nmoney that is requested by the President for Florida's two hurricanes \nthat just hit us. It does not include any amount for agricultural \nlosses. The $3.1 billion includes Department of Defense losses, NASA \nlosses, Small Business Administration losses. FEMA itself is $2 billion \nof that, with all of these ongoing expenses of the back-to-back \nhurricanes.\n  What is missing from the President's request is the agricultural \nlosses, which are substantial, from these two hurricanes. For example, \nthe citrus crop alone is over $\\1/2\\ billion in losses. The nursery \nindustry, which is a huge industry in Florida, has losses of $\\1/2\\ \nbillion.\n  Now, the question is, How do we address this? I was expecting that \nthe President was going to include the agricultural losses in his \nrequest. He has not. So how do we address this, since the needs are \nobviously there?\n  Presently, there are discussions going on between my office and the \nsponsors of this amendment. There is a little bit in this amendment for \nFlorida agricultural losses from the two hurricanes, but it is \nsomewhere in the range of $150 million to $300 million. That is a drop \nin the bucket compared to what the elected Florida agriculture \ncommissioner has totaled up the losses at, which is $2 billion.\n  It is my hope that we are going to be able on this amendment--if we \nproceed with this amendment, I will certainly support it because, as \nall of these Senators from the Midwest, both Republican and Democrat, \nsay, disaster doesn't know anything about partisan politics. Disaster \nknows something about hitting people where it hurts them, and that is \none of the reasons you have the Federal Government to protect people \nand to respond in times of disaster.\n  So I am going to help these Senators with their amendment. What I am \nhoping is that through our discussions we can expand this so it can be \nacceptable and address the needs of Florida agriculture after these \nback-to-back hurricanes. If those discussions are not fruitful, then it \nis my intention that I will offer an amendment to this bill for the \ndisaster to Florida agriculture. That will be somewhere in the range of \nabout a billion dollars in losses, which will not even get anywhere \nclose to the estimated $2 billion, but it will be a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Now, this is, as you know, ``no fooling'' time.\n  We have just been hit by two hurricanes. There is a third on the way. \nAnd until 2 days ago, that third one was headed for Florida. As a \nmatter of fact, until a day ago, that third one was headed for Florida, \nand that centerline now on the projected path is shifting to the West, \nand that centerline is headed straight for the State of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  We know there is an error because in hurricane path projection, it \ncan either go to the right or to the left. In the projected path, it \ncan go all the way over into the panhandle of Florida, or it can go all \nthe way to the left, as far as New Orleans. It is about a day out. It \nis churning in the Gulf of Mexico, moving in a northward direction.\n  What I am saying is if it continues on its present path to \nMississippi or to Alabama or to Louisiana, there are going to be other \nSenators who are going to be in here trying to help their people. This \nSenator is going to help them when that happens because that is the \nright thing to do. Now it is the right thing to do to help the people \nof Florida.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I do not know if there are other Senators \nwho wish to continue to debate. If there are, this would be a good time \nto do it.\n\n[[Page S9193]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, very briefly, I heard two arguments from \none Senator as to why this pending amendment, agricultural disaster \nassistance, should not pass. It is a very technical argument that it \nviolates the Budget Act.\n  I remind my colleagues, the unanimous consent agreement that applies \nto this bill, to this amendment basically says first-degree amendments \nare in order: First-degree amendments are in order, that they be \nrelated to the text of the bill, homeland security, and also natural \ndisasters.\n  This is a natural disaster amendment. It clearly is contemplated by \nthe unanimous consent agreement. The argument was made: Not on this \nbill. That is clearly not an argument because the unanimous consent \nagreement clearly contemplates amendments that relate to natural \ndisasters. So that argument is gone. That is wrong.\n  The second argument was made: Gee, the cost violates the Budget Act. \nA very simple point I make is if one wants to press that argument, it \nalso applies to disaster assistance for the State of Florida.\n  Agricultural disaster assistance is the same as Florida hurricane \ndisaster assistance under the Budget Act. They are the same. They are \ntechnically the same. There can be a point of order made against both. \nSixty votes are required. I do not know whether the other side is going \nto make a point of order against the Florida hurricane disaster \nassistance. I frankly doubt it. I think it would be very unwise. The \nvery same law, the Budget Act, applies to the pending amendment, which \nis the amendment providing for agricultural disaster assistance.\n  I say to my colleagues, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the \ngander. We are Americans, and let's work together as Americans. Let's \nhelp people who need help, and those are our farmers, ranchers, and \nFloridians because of the hurricanes--all of us. I see no reason why a \npoint of order should be made. And, second, if it is made, I see no \nreason why the point of order should be sustained. We are talking again \nabout natural disasters that apply--this amendment does not apply to \nFlorida, but it is tied with it because we are going to have that in \nthe next several days. They are all the same. We are all in the same \nboat.\n\n  I very much hope this does not become a partisan political measure. I \ndo not think it is. I remind my colleagues of the bipartisan support of \nthis amendment. Senator Brownback of Kansas is a cosponsor. Senator \nBurns, my colleague from Montana, is a cosponsor of this amendment. \nSenator Coleman from Minnesota told me an hour ago he wants to be a \ncosponsor of this amendment. Senator Roberts of Kansas is a cosponsor \nof this amendment. Senator Hagel of Nebraska is also a cosponsor of \nthis amendment. I hope Senators can all work together. Let's help each \nother. Let us help people in various parts of our country, not only in \nFlorida, but in other parts of America who are hurt very much by \nagricultural disasters.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I do not know what the chairman has \nin mind, but I hope whatever it is we can move rather quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I know some Senators who are interested in this issue \nare in discussions off the Senate floor, and pending completion of \nthose, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly in favor of the \nBaucus amendment because of the situation in my home State. Parts of my \nState have had the worst drought in a century. It is being compared by \nsome veteran farmers to what they witnessed in the Dust Bowl era--crops \nwithering and dying in the fields before the farmers' eyes without any \nability to address it.\n  I grew up on a farm. My family still farms. I was secretary of \nagriculture in Kansas. I have seen these situations.\n  The one point I want to add--I think people pretty well understand \nthese issues--what I want to address is that in some disaster relief--\nand we seem to be in a cycle because we have disasters hitting every \nyear, but it is a compassionate society that tries to help those in the \nworst situation. But more than that, they do not win if they get hit by \na disaster and then we do disaster drought assistance. I have not seen \npeople come out ahead.\n  What we try to do is get them back toward zero so they do not lose \ntoo much money, so they can continue to farm and continue to operate \ntheir ranch and work their crops. That is what we are trying to do, to \nhelp people sustain themselves and not have to go out of business \naltogether. They are not hitting the jackpot when we pass these types \nof bills. They are simply trying to sustain themselves in their \noperations--a commodity-based business. Margins are thin, and it is \ndifficult to make it. So we try to help them.\n  Crop insurance is helpful, it is important, but despite its critical \nvalue to farmers, it cannot mitigate effects of prolonged drought and \nits impact in the area. And the weather condition has been building for \nseveral years. Fortunately, in areas of my State this has broken. Not \nall areas.\n  I was at the State fair this past weekend and people continue to cite \nthe problem they are having with the drought and this continuing cycle \nof lack of rainfall.\n  I support the Baucus amendment. I appreciate him raising it.\n  It is difficult because we are in a budget situation where we all \nwant to get this budget more under control. Yet I do not think that is \nthe place to do it in a situation where we have people suffering \nbecause of natural disasters or natural causes. So I am pleased that \nthe amendment has been brought up. I am a cosponsor and am pleased to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the efforts of the \nSenator from Montana to make certain our farm families do not lose, as \nthe Senator from Kansas said, because of the droughts that have \nperiodically struck the Midwest. Missouri has suffered as well. I am \nvery interested in this issue being worked out in a way that is \nsatisfactory.\n  I do want to take a minute, though, on a different subject to thank \nthe ranking member and the chairman for what I understand is an \nagreement on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution I have offered in the \nform of an amendment, and I think it is going to be added later on a \nvoice vote. I believe it has been cleared on both sides. I wanted to \nmake the Senate aware of the importance of this subject.\n  We had a situation in St. Louis last year where our local Jewish \ncommunity was hosting the Maccabee Games. It is an international event \nwhere Jewish youths come and participate in effect in Olympic games. \nObviously, it is an event with special security risks in today's day \nand age. Locally, we needed several hundred thousand dollars in extra \nfunds for security.\n  The State had the Federal homeland defense money but not in the right \naccount, and despite all of our efforts on a Federal, State, and local \nlevel, we were unable to free up dollars to provide for the necessary \nsecurity. It ended up being okay, but it did not have to end up okay. \nAs a result of that, I have become very interested in allowing at least \nsome discretion on the part of the Secretary and the Director of the \nOffice for State and Local Government Coordination to approve waiver \napplications on the part of the State to reprogram some of their \nFederal grant homeland money when some new kind of security issue \narises that was unforeseen when they originally applied for those \ngrants.\n\n  So the sense-of-the-Senate resolution in effect says that we ought to \nbe able to do that. It is a first step toward what I hope will be a \nsuccessful change in the law by allowing this kind of discretion in \nthese kinds of cases.\n  I ask Senators to think about the situation because it could come up \nin anybody's State where an unforeseen new security risk arises and \ntheir local authorities have to spend substantial dollars in order to \nbe able to deal with it. That is exactly what we have this\n\n[[Page S9194]]\n\nhomeland defense money for. Under certain circumstances, they will be \nunable to access it without some kind of discretionary waiver authority \nbeing allowed the department. I hope we can follow up on this sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution with an appropriate change in the underlying \nauthorization.\n  Again, I appreciate the help of the Senator from Mississippi and the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia in getting this amendment \ncleared.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of an amendment \nthat I offer together with my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy. \nSenator Leahy serves as ranking democrat member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, which I chair.\n  The purpose of the Hatch-Leahy amendment is to help ensure that the \nUnited States Secret Service continues to carry out its most critical \nfunctions, including the protection of the President of the United \nStates. The Secret Service has a distinguished history over a 139 year \nperiod of protecting the President and protecting the financial \ninstitutions of this country.\n  This amendment clarifies that the Secret Service shall be maintained \nas a distinct entity within the Department of Homeland Security, \nforbidding it from being merged with any other subunit within the \nDepartment. And, it makes clear that Secret Service personnel report \ndirectly to the Director of the Secret Service who, in turn, reports \ndirectly to the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  It is important that the Secretary not re-delegate any of his or her \nauthority to other DHS officials or entities nor to unduly interfere \nwith the unique historical relationship that exists between the \nPresident and White House and the Secret Service. That is the intent of \nthe Hatch-Leahy Amendment.\n  This is a codification of what was originally intended when we \ncreated the Department of Homeland Security and ensures that the Secret \nService operates within the Department of Homeland Security just as it \ndid prior to September 11 within the Department of Treasury.\n  Given its proven track record of performance and independence, we \nmust\n\n[[Page S9196]]\n\nguard against this relatively small but critical agency from being lost \nin or swallowed up by the myriad of programs and entities within the \nnew Department of Homeland Security. Any attempt by DHS managers, \nhowever well-intentioned, to interpose themselves in the decision \nmaking processes, resource allocations, and field operations of the \nSecret Service should be avoided.\n  Simply stated, there is much wisdom in the old saying that ``if it \nain't broke, don't fix it.'' The Secret Service has operated well in \nthe past and operates well today. The Hatch-Leahy Amendment will help \nprovide the autonomy and responsibility that will help keep the Secret \nService operating well in the future.\n  We made a similar clarification with the Coast Guard and should do \nthe same for the Secret Service. I believe that this clarification of \nintent, and delineation of reporting requirements, will ensure that the \nmission of the Secret Service remains clear, definite, and unimpeded.\n  Senator Leahy and I urge all of our colleagues to support this \nimportant amendment which I understand is supported by the \nadministration.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have worked closely with the United \nStates Secret Service for many years. Their tradition of excellence and \nthe quality of their protective services and investigations is well \nknown. I know that the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, William Pickle, \nproudly served with them for many years.\n  As the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, with \njurisdiction regarding United States Secret Service matters, Senator \nHatch and I have introduced an amendment to ensure that the Service \nremains a distinct entity within the Department of Homeland Security. \nIt is important that the Secret Service continue, as they did under the \nDepartment of the Treasury, to function as a cohesive unit and not have \nits functions divided. It is also important that the Secret Service, as \nthey did under the Department of the Treasury, not be merged with other \nagencies which would dilute the Service's ability to achieve their \ncrucial mission. It is also important to preserve their current chain \nof command structure.\n  Our amendment requires that the United States Secret Service be \nmaintained as a ``distinct entity within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity'' and that the Secret Service not be merged with any other \nDepartment function. Further, our amendment requires that all personnel \nand operational elements of the Service report at all times to ``the \nDirector of the United States Secret Service'' who shall report \ndirectly to the Secretary of Homeland Security without having to report \nthrough other officials.\n  The United States Secret Service is doing an outstanding job in tough \ntimes and this amendment will assure that they keep fully devoted to \ntheir critical missions in the same excellent manner as they have done \nin the past.\n  I hope all Members will join us in including this important amendment \nin the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate has before it a $32 billion \nhomeland security appropriations bill. Chairman Cochran has put \ntogether a fair and balanced bill. Regrettably, the allocation that is \navailable for homeland security programs is simply inadequate. This is \nnot a criticism of Chairman Cochran, nor is it a criticism of full \ncommittee Chairman Ted Stevens. The fact is that the overall levels in \nthe allocation constrain our ability to address known threats to the \nsafety of the American people.\n  In response to the threats so often invoked by the President, the \nAttorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the FBI \nDirector, one might anticipate that the President would not be \nsatisfied with a bill that cuts funds for first responders, that leaves \nfirst responders unable to communicate, that leaves airline passengers \nworrying about whether a fellow passenger has brought explosives on \nboard, or that fails to adequately invest in securing our ports and \ntrains.\n  To address these shortcomings, I offered an amendment last week to \nadd $2 billion to the bill. The amendment would have funded \nauthorizations signed by the President; it would have funded 9/11 \nCommission recommendations; and it would have addressed known \nvulnerabilities not funded in the committee bill.\n  The amendment was defeated. The principal argument made against the \namendment was that it was not paid for. So today, I offer an amendment \nthat provides $470 million for homeland security, and it is fully paid \nfor.\n\n[[Page S9197]]\n\n  Last March, during debate on the budget resolution, an amendment was \nadopted with support on both sides of the aisle. The amendment would \nhave set up a reserve for homeland security programs. The reserve was \npaid for by directing the Secretary of the Interior to cancel planned \ndeliveries of oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and to instead \nsell the oil on the open market in order to finance homeland security \nprograms.\n  As a provision on a budget resolution, that amendment did not have \nthe force of law. Today, I offer an amendment that will make America \nsafer.\n  The amendment adds funds for first responders that, consistent with \nthe \n9/11 Commission recommendation, will be allocated based on threat; for \nsecuring mass transit systems; for expediting the modernization of \nCoast Guard ships, planes and helicopters and improving Coast Guard \noperations; for purchasing equipment for screening passengers and \ncarry-on baggage for explosives; and for port security.\n\n  The amendment addresses vulnerabilities that we all know exist. And, \nlet there be no doubt, if we know that these gaps exist, so do the \nterrorists.\n  The amendment includes $125 million for port security grants, \nbringing the total in the bill to $275 million, the same level assumed \nin the budget resolution. A 1-month closure of a major port would cost \nour national economy $60 billion. But because of the tremendous volume \nof containerized cargo, Customs officials are inspecting only 5 percent \nof the 9 million containers that come into our ports on vessels each \nyear. With Chairman Cochran's support, we have provided additional \nresources on the floor for Customs and Border Protection inspectors. \nBut, we must do more for securing the ports.\n  The Coast Guard has estimated that $1.125 billion will be needed in \nthe first year and $5.4 billion will be needed over the next 10 years \nfor the ports to comply with the Federal regulations mandated by the \nMaritime Transportation Security Act, which was signed into law by \nPresident Bush with great fanfare in November 2002. It has been 2 years \nsince the law was signed. If this amendment is adopted and becomes law, \nCongress will have approved only $770 million for port security, far \nless than the $1.125 billion Coast Guard estimate for the first year of \nimplementation.\n  It has been more than 2\\1/2\\ years since Richard Reid, the so-called \n``shoe bomber,'' tried to blow up a Miami-bound aircraft over the \nAtlantic Ocean with explosives he carried onto the aircraft. Last \nmonth, two Russian airplanes simultaneously were blown out of the sky, \nmost probably by Chechnyan terrorists who carried the explosives on \nboard the aircraft. The \n9/11 Commission Report states clearly and succinctly that the threat \nposed to passenger aircraft by explosives being carried onto the plane \nis real.\n  The additional $70 million in this amendment will significantly \nexpand the effort to screen air travelers for explosives. We know that \nnewly developed passenger portals can detect whether passengers are \ncarrying explosives. These systems have been tested and proven to work. \nWe need the money to physically deploy these systems at our Nation's \nairports.\n  Following the March 11 Madrid railroad bombings, the administration \nissued security bulletins to law enforcement officials and transit \nauthorities warning of the danger of similar attacks here at home. But \nthey requested no funding to help our mass transit agencies hire more \nguards, train new canine teams, or install additional cameras. Paper \ndirectives and press releases will not stop terrorist bombs.\n\n  With Chairman Cochran's support, we have provided $278 million for \nmass transit security grants. But that level does not come close to the \nlevel authorized by the Senate Banking Committee, on a bipartisan \nbasis, on May 6, 2004. The committee authorizes $5.2 billion for \ntransit security. On May 21, 2004, the Senate Commerce Committee, also \non bipartisan basis, approved S. 2273, which authorizes $1.2 billion \nfor additional rail security activities. My amendment would add $75 \nmillion for mass transit and Amtrak security.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommends allocating first responder funds based \non threat rather than on population. My amendment adds $100 million to \nthe $875 million currently provided in the Senate bill for urban area \nsecurity initiative grants. These grants are targeted to cities \ndetermined to be at greatest risk of a terrorist attack, that have the \nhighest number of critical assets, such as tunnels, bridges and \nchemical plants, and that have high population densities. We need to \nget funds to the places most at risk.\n  My amendment also includes $100 million for the Coast Guard, \nincluding $80 million for the Deepwater Program and $20 million for \ntraditional Coast Guard missions, such as search and rescue and \nprotection of our marine resources. The committee bill funds these \nactivities at levels $575 million below the levels just authorized by \nthe Congress and the President.\n  Prior to September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard began to modernize its \nfleet of assets. Since the attacks on 9/11, the Coast Guard's \nresponsibilities have grown substantially. As a result, assets vital to \nhomeland security are being used more today than ever in the Coast \nGuard's history. The Government Accountability Office recently reported \nthat ``resource usage as measured by the number of hours the Coast \nGuard's cutters, boats, and aircraft used to perform its missions--was \nup almost 40 percent from the pre-September 11 baseline.''\n  The Coast Guard Commandant, in testimony before the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, testified that the \ncurrent condition of the aging fleet threatens Coast Guard mission \nperformance. He testified that Coast Guard assets are in a ``declining \nreadiness spiral.''\n  Yet, the President has not responded. My amendment will help address \nthe Coast Guard's ``declining readiness spiral.'' The funding would go \nto accelerate the Coast Guard's highest priorities, which are to \nenhance safety and reliability on the HH-65 helicopter, to accelerate \nthe design of the fast response cutter for near shore missions, and to \ncomplete design of the offshore response cutter for the high endurance \nmissions of the Coast Guard.\n  The amendment is paid for by suspending the fill of the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. This step makes economic sense. Using Federal \ndollars to buy high-priced oil for the reserve does not. Oil prices hit \nan all-time high on August 20, and oil is currently trading at about \n$44 per barrel. By filling the reserve in this high-priced environment, \nwe are paying more for oil now than we would if we waited until prices \nwent down. This makes no sense for U.S. taxpayers.\n  Suspending the fill of the reserve in no way threatens our energy \nsecurity. The reserve is already filled to 96 percent capacity, with \n669 million barrels now stored, the highest level that it has ever \nbeen. The reserve currently covers 67 days of import capacity.\n  Buying oil when the market is so high makes no economic sense. It is \na bad deal for the taxpayer. Failing to fund critical homeland security \nmeasures that the 9/11 Commission has recommended and that address \nclear vulnerabilities is also a bad deal for the taxpayer. This \namendment is a good deal.\n  I urge Members to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I was going to respond to the Senator's \ncomments and his amendment which would add funding to this bill in the \namount of $470 million for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I don't know at what point we want to consider the fact that, because \nof the way it is drafted, the impact the amendment would have on future \nappropriations for fiscal year 2006 would actually, according to the \nBudget Committee staff and chairman, violate the Budget Act and that a \npoint of order would lie against this amendment.\n  Reluctantly and with great respect for my friend from West Virginia, \nI am constrained to make that point of order. Rather than going through \nall the talking points that my staff has prepared on the subject of the \nindividual amounts to be added by the amendment and the offsets that \nare identified, which is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, I am \nconstrained to make a point of order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator would withhold making the point of\n\n[[Page S9198]]\n\norder for a few minutes so I have an opportunity to speak in support.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to reserve that right and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi yields the floor.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I greatly appreciate my old friend from Mississippi \nyielding.\n  We are in an energy crisis. I will speak about that part of the Byrd \namendment particularly, which would use the money from not continuing \nto fill the 96-percent filled Strategic Petroleum Reserve and taking \nthe money that would then be made available and using it for some \ncritical homeland security needs.\n  I congratulate the Senator from West Virginia for both identifying \nsome very significant needs in the homeland security area, as well as \npaying for it in a very rational way; that is, to suspend further \ndeliveries into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  The energy crisis is obvious. We are paying a record amount per \nbarrel for oil. The addition of these millions of barrels to the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve is significantly adding to the cost of oil \nand is weakening our economy.\n  Last week, Alan Greenspan stated:\n\n       [E]conomic activity hit a soft patch in late spring. . . . \n     That softness in activity no doubt is related, in large \n     measure, to this year's steep increase in energy prices.\n\n  Chairman Greenspan further stated:\n\n       Most macroeconomic models treat an increase in oil prices \n     as a tax on U.S. residents that saps the purchasing power of \n     households and raises costs for businesses.\n\n  Yet in the face of this crisis, the administration is decreasing \nrather than increasing the supply of oil. Day after day, month after \nmonth, regardless of how much American consumers and industry need oil, \nregardless of how high the cost is of this oil, the administration has \nbeen taking millions of barrels of oil off the market and depositing \nthem into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And by doing that, the \nadministration is increasing the price of oil and gasoline and \ndecreasing our energy security.\n  The use to which the $470 million that would be saved by using this \noil in the commercial market rather than depositing it into a reserve--\nwhich is already 96 percent filled--those uses provide a win-win \nsituation for national security and energy security. For energy \nsecurity, we would have this energy placed into the private sector, \ninto commercial inventories, rather than into the Petroleum Reserve. \nFor national security, the way in which the Senator from West Virginia \nwould use these funds--for airline security, port security, mass \ntransit and rail security, firefighter grants, State and homeland \nsecurity grants--these are all very important needs and uses.\n  Now, very quickly, supplies are tight. That is the reason crude oil \nprices are high. Demand is strong. Commercial inventories are low. \nSupplies are vulnerable. Supplies are tight because OPEC is producing \nbarely enough oil to meet demand. Private sector inventories of crude \noil are near the lows, historically, for this time of year. Of course, \nthere is also great concern over the vulnerability of Iraqi oil \nsupplies to terrorism--we see that again today--the problems in Russia \nwith Yukos, the largest oil company in that country; and the turmoil in \nNigeria and Venezuela, which have added a premium to prices.\n  Over the last 2 years, private sector inventories have declined \nsignificantly. Last January, private sector inventories fell to their \nlowest levels since the mid-1970s. The SPR Program is a major reason \nfor the decline in private inventories. From April 2002 through \nDecember 2003, the Department of Energy deposited about 78 million \nbarrels of oil in SPR. During that same period, private sector \ninventories declined by about 61 million barrels. Thus, the total \namount of oil in inventory in the United States in both private and \npublic storage increased by only 17 million barrels over this entire \nperiod.\n  The SPR Program is directly the reason for recent price increases to \nthe extent of somewhere between 10 cents and 25 cents a gallon when \nlooking at gasoline.\n  Goldman Sachs, one of the largest and most successful crude oil \ntraders in the world, reported, on January 16 of this year, that \n``large speculative positions, builds in strategic petroleum reserves, \nand low inventory coverage have contributed to current price levels.'' \nIn this report, Goldman Sachs also stated that ``past government \nstorage builds will provide persistent support for the market,'' and \nthat ``current plans for the injection of 130 thousand [barrels a day] \nof royalty-in-kind barrels into the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n(SPR) between now and the end of September . . . will likely provide \neven further support.''\n  Goldman Sachs estimated that the strategic reserve programs in the \nUnited States and Europe in 2003 and 2004 are adding about $4.25 to the \nprice of each barrel of crude oil sold in the United States.\n  Now, DOE's plans, regardless of the price of oil, are to continue to \ndeposit oil into the Petroleum Reserve. Until late 2001, the policy of \nthe Department of Energy was to buy oil for the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve when prices were low and to buy less oil when prices were high. \nThat policy was explained by DOE officials, in late 2001, to energy \nofficials in other countries, and the presentation was entitled: ``The \nKey To A Successful Strategic Reserve Is Cost Control.'' The DOE \nidentifies the ``Lessons Learned to Control Oil Acquisition Costs'' as \nfollows--this was the DOE, before they changed their policy in 2002--1, \n``let the markets determine your buying pattern;'' 2, ``buy in weak \nmarkets;'' 3, ``delay delivers during strong markets;'' and 4, ``use \nyour acquisition strategy to stabilize markets.''\n  That was prior to early 2002. They have now reversed it. Instead of \nbuying low and selling high, they are buying high and shorting supply. \nIt makes absolutely no sense to do this. We are all paying more for the \nprice of gasoline and heating oil and jet fuel as a result of this \npolicy. We should stop continuing to deposit oil into the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, which is 96 percent filled. And when we do this in a \ntight supply, which is now the case, we are adding to gasoline prices \nalone somewhere between 10 and 25 cents per gallon.\n  Indeed, ``buy low, sell high'' is just plain common sense. \nUnfortunately, in early 2002, the Department of Energy abandoned this \ncommonsense approach. Instead, since early 2002, DOE has been buying \noil for the SPR without regard to the price of oil. No matter how high \nthe price of oil has been or will be, DOE has been and will be buying \nmore and more oil for the SPR.\n  Since over this period the price of oil has been very high--often \nover $30 per barrel--and the oil markets have been tight, this cost-\nblind approach has increased the costs of the program to the taxpayer \nand put further pressure on tight oil markets, thereby helping boost \noil and gasoline prices to American consumers and businesses.\n  It is a rip-off of the taxpayers to pay $45 a barrel for oil in \ntoday's market, when the same oil could be acquired for $10 to $15 a \nbarrel less in a couple of years.\n  We need oil in the private sector more than in the SPR. In the \ncurrent tight market, there is a critical need to prevent minor \nshortages or disruptions from causing major price spikes. Increasing \nprivate inventories, not the SPR, is the best way to meet this need.\n  Canceling the deposits into the SPR could lower gasoline prices by 10 \nto 15 cents a gallon. Each $1 increase in the price of oil increases \ngasoline prices by about 2.5 cents. Depending on which estimates of the \neffect of the SPR fill is correct, postponing the upcoming SPR deposits \ntherefore could lower gasoline prices by 10 to 25 cents.\n  Postponing SPR deliveries will signal speculators that the U.S. \nGovernment is willing to take action to put a lid on increasing prices. \nThe administration has repeatedly stated that it will keep on filling \nthe SPR regardless of price. The market, therefore, correctly believes \nDOE will not stop SPR deliveries or release SPR oil no matter how high \nthe price of oil. This has eliminated an important potential brake on \nspeculation that prices will keep rising. In effect, the \nadministration's statements have taken off any lid on prices. Stopping \nSPR deliveries will signal this is not the case, and could take \nspeculative steam out of the market.\n  In 2002, DOE SPR staff urged the postponement of deliveries in tight \nmarkets. In 2002, when the administration told DOE to change its policy \nand buy oil for the SPR regardless of the price, the DOE career staff \nattempted\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\nto persuade the administration to retain the old policy of taking price \ninto consideration.\n  DOE staff wrote the new policy:\n\n       [I]s a business model different from that followed by all \n     private market participants, and if followed by a significant \n     number of market participants would lead to explosive price \n     swings.\n\n  In another memo, DOE SPR staff reported the current policy ``appears \nirrational to the market place.''\n  In spring 2002, as prices were rising and inventories falling, the \nDOE SPR staff recommended that DOE postpone filling the SPR:\n\n       This is good public policy. Commercial inventories are low, \n     retail prices are high and economic growth is slow. The \n     Government should avoid acquiring oil for the Reserve under \n     these circumstances.\n\n  The market conditions today are the same as they were in 2002 when \nthe DOE SPR staff recommended that SPR deliveries be postponed.\n  Many other oil industry leaders and economists believe now is not the \ntime to fill the SPR.\n  In May of this year, Bill Greehey, CEO of Valero Energy, the largest \nindependent refiner in the U.S., said:\n\n       They tell Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. Then they put \n     it into Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It just doesn't make any \n     sense at all.\n\n  Writing in Forbes magazine, Professor Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, commented:\n\n       The oil price run-up and scarcity of private inventories \n     can be laid squarely at the White House's door. Since Nov. \n     13, 2001 private companies have been forced to compete for \n     inventories with the government.\n\n  This May, The Houston Chronicle stated:\n\n       With oil at more than $40 a barrel and the federal \n     government running a huge deficit, it should take a timeout \n     on filling the stockpile until crude prices come down from \n     record levels. That would relieve pressure on the petroleum \n     market and ameliorate gasoline prices.\n\n  A leading energy consulting firm, PFC Energy, wrote this May:\n\n       The Bush Administration has actually been helping OPEC to \n     keep spot prices high and avoid commercial stock increases by \n     taking crude out of the market and injecting significant \n     volumes into the SPR.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of other comments \nbe included in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senate has twice acted on this issue to restore some \ncommon sense to our SPR policy. The Senate passed an amendment Senator \nCollins and I offered, by a bipartisan vote of 52 to 43, SPR deliveries \nand use the receipts from the sale of the royalty oil for homeland \nsecurity programs. The Senate amendment regrettably was not retained in \nconference.\n  Last fall, the Senate unanimously passed an amendment to the Interior \nAppropriations Bill that Senator Collins and I offered that would have \nrequired DOE to adopt procedures to acquire oil for the SPR in a manner \nthat minimizes the program's cost to the taxpayers while maximizing our \noverall energy security. The Senate amendment was not retained in \nconference, and, unfortunately, DOE has chosen to ignore the Senate's \ndirection in the amendment.\n  The major reason given by DOE for not postponing any of the scheduled \nshipments into the SPR is that, according to DOE, the amount of oil \nthat is placed into the SPR is only a small fraction of the global \ndaily supply and demand. This comparison is not relevant in a tight \nmarket. The amount that is being put into the SPR is about as much as \nis produced in several of our own States--Wyoming or Oklahoma, for \nexample. It is about three-quarters of our daily imports from Kuwait. \nIn a tight market, this additional demand can cause a large price \nincrease. Moreover, these daily deposits add up to a lot of oil over \nweeks and months. The Department of Energy's own documents explain this \neffect as follows:\n\n       Essentially, if the SPR inventory grows, and OPEC does not \n     accommodate that growth by exporting more oil, the increase \n     comes at the expense of commercial inventories. Most analysts \n     agree that oil prices are directly correlated with \n     inventories, and a drop of 20 million barrels over a 6-month \n     period can substantially increase prices.\n\n  I support the filling of the SPR, but not at any price. DOE, like any \nwell-managed business, should acquire more oil when prices are low, and \nless when prices are high. DOE should not be diverting crude oil from \ndepleted private-sector inventories when prices are high and supplies \nare tight. Deferring further shipments to the SPR at this time will \nreduce energy prices, lower taxpayer costs, and help strengthen our \neconomy. It will also make about $470 million available for vital \nhomeland security programs.\n  Clearly, now is not the time to be taking more oil off the market. \nThis amendment is a win-win for consumers, taxpayers, and the \nGovernment.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from West Virginia for his \namendment, for both parts of it, for both adding money to needed \nhomeland security needs but also finding the source from suspending \ndeposits in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                      comments on the spr program\n\n       ``Commercial petroleum inventories are low, retail product \n     prices are high and economic growth is slow. The Government \n     should avoid acquiring oil for the Reserve under these \n     circumstances. . . . Essentially, if the SPR inventory grows, \n     and OPEC does not accommodate that growth by exporting more \n     oil, the increase comes at the expense of commercial \n     inventories. Most analysts agree that oil prices are directly \n     correlated with inventories, and a drop of 20 million barrels \n     over a 6-month period can substantially increase prices.'' \n     John Shages, Director, Office of Finance and Policy, \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserves, U.S. Department of Energy, \n     Spring 2002.\n       ``As a U.S. Senate committee pointed out Wednesday, the \n     U.S. government was filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     last year as prices were rising. And by my estimate, had the \n     U.S. government not filled the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or \n     returned the 20 million barrels they'd put in back to the \n     market, prices right now would be around $28 a barrel instead \n     of $38 a barrel and gasoline prices might be 25 to 35 cents \n     lower.'' Philip Verleger, NPR Morning Edition, March 7, 2003.\n       ``We believe the administration has been making a mistake \n     by refilling the reserve to the tune of about 11 million \n     barrels since the start of May. . . .

Omaha World Herald, \n     August 14, 2003.\n       ``They've continued filling the reserve--which is crazy, \n     putting the oil under ground when it's needed in \n     refineries.''

So, \n     I think they've completely mismanaged the strategic \n     reserve.'' Bill Greehey, CEO of Valero Energy, largest \n     independent refiner in the U.S., Octane Week, September 29, \n     2003.\n       ``Over the last year, the [DOE] has added its name to this \n     rogues list of traders by continuing to acquire oil for the \n     nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In doing so, it \n     has (1) wasted taxpayer money, (2) done its part to raise \n     crude oil prices, (3) made oil prices more volatile, and (4) \n     caused financial hardship for refiners and oil consumers.'' \n     Philip K.

Who seeks recognition?\n  The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3636\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we have set aside the Baucus-\nBurns-Brownback et al. amendment. I just want to come to the floor to \nexpress my support for the amendment as well. This is a bipartisan \neffort. It is long overdue. As others have noted, the need is great. \nThere are disasters around the country that have to be addressed, \nincluding some in South Dakota. It is not just the severity of the \ndrought, but it is the length of time that drought has existed in some \nparts of our country, especially in South Dakota.\n  So I am very hopeful the Senate will express itself on a unanimous \nbasis and provide the kind of support that our farmers and ranchers and \nothers need. I hope the amendment will be adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3649\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I just want to speak briefly in support \nof Senator Byrd's amendment as well.\n  This amendment will make available to the market an additional 19 \nmillion barrels of oil that the Federal Government will receive in \nfiscal year 2005 as in-kind royalties. Without this amendment, the \nFederal Government would hold this oil off the market by putting it in \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2005. Because this Federal royalty \noil would be sold, under this amendment it would generate an offset of \n$470 million, which the amendment then proposes to use for important \nhomeland security measures, such as port security grants, aviation \npassenger screening, the Coast Guard, mass transit grants, and the \nSAFER Program.\n  It is important to note that the amendment will not take out of the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve any oil that is now in the Reserve.\n  It is merely suspending further filling of the reserve. Suspending \nthe fill of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during times of high oil \nprices makes economic sense. Using Federal dollars to buy high-priced \noil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve does not make economic sense.\n  Oil prices hit an all-time high on the NYMEX on August 20, trading at \n$49.40 a barrel. Today oil is trading at close to $45 a barrel, which \nrepresents a price increase of more than 30 percent since the beginning \nof the year. By filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in this very \nhigh-priced environment, we are paying more for oil now than we would \nif we waited until prices went down.\n  Filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when oil prices are high \ncosts\n\n[[Page S9201]]\n\nAmerican taxpayers unnecessarily. It also puts more pressure on already \ntight fuel markets and keeps oil prices higher for longer.\n  The royalty-in-kind oil program used to fill the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve was first envisioned in a low-price environment. The Government \nbought oil from domestic producers on Federal lands when prices were \nlow in order to absorb some of the excess oil. The royalty-in-kind \nprogram was used to keep domestic oil prices from falling even further, \nbut we were then talking about below $14 per barrel, not below the $45 \nper barrel which is currently prevailing. The royalty-in-kind program \nwas not established to help high oil prices remain high, but buying in \na high-priced environment has that exact effect.\n  Suspending the fill of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve does not pose \nan immediate security threat, as the Senator from Michigan pointed out. \nThe reserve is already 96 percent of capacity, with 669 million barrels \nnow stored. That is the highest level of storage we have ever had in \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It currently covers 67 days of import \ncapacity at a level of 10 million barrels per day of imports. Using \nscarce Federal dollars to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve while \nfailing to fund necessary homeland security measures presents a \nsecurity threat itself.\n  Some of you may recall--I think we all recall--that the Senate passed \na similar amendment to this to the budget resolution that was \nconsidered earlier this year, the Levin-Collins amendment.\n  I urge support of Senator Byrd's amendment this evening. It will put \nour limited homeland security dollars to work in the most beneficial \nway for Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3636\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are at a point now where I think we \ncan proceed to dispose of an earlier amendment that was offered. If \nthere is no objection to setting aside the pending Byrd amendment for \nthat purpose, I ask unanimous consent that the Byrd amendment be set \naside and that we proceed to a voice vote on the Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Baucus amendment No. 3636.\n  The amendment (No. 3636) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3649\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Byrd amendment has been presented and \ndiscussed by the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from Michigan, \nand the Senator from New Mexico. Compelling arguments have been made \nfor the additional funds that would be made available to the Department \nof Homeland Security under this amendment. The difficulty, however, is \nthat the amendment would provide appropriations that are not consistent \nwith the Budget Act. Section 501 of H. Con. Res. 95, the fiscal year \n2004 concurrent resolution on the budget, limits the amount and type of \nadvance appropriations which may be provided for fiscal years 2005 and \n2006. The pending amendment would provide advance appropriations for \nfiscal year 2006 which are not on the list of programs, projects, \nactivities, or accounts identified in the joint explanatory statement \nof managers accompanying the budget resolution.\n  Thus, I raise a point of order pursuant to section 501(b) of H. Con. \nRes. 95, the 108th Congress, against the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Mississippi, and his excellent staff for \ntheir assistance in working out this amendment.\n  This is an amendment that would continue to provide funding for the \nmental health counseling that the fire department and police department \nand other first responders have been receiving because of their \nexperiences arising out of September 11. We are finding that only now \nare some of the firefighters, police officers, and others coming \nforward and expressing their need for some kind of intervention and \nassistance.\n  This is a program that has worked very well. I am grateful for the \nFederal assistance to start this program, and we are hopeful that this \namendment will enable FEMA, which already has money set aside arising \nout of already appropriated money for New York and for purposes like \nthis, to obtain the requisite support they need to go forward with this \nmental health counseling. So I am very grateful that we have worked \nthis out.\n  There is no new money in it, there is no new earmarking or \nappropriations; it is merely giving FEMA the go-ahead, with the \nappropriate authorization, to continue the mental health program that \nhas proven so successful.\n  So, again, I appreciate greatly the chairman and his staff's \nassistance. I ask for a voice vote on this amendment, if appropriate at \nthis time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are happy this has been resolved. I \nthink it improves the bill. We are ready to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EMERGENCY DESIGNATION.\n\n       The amounts appropriated in this title are designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of S. Con. Res. \n     95 (108th Congress), as made applicable to the House of \n     Representatives by H. Res. 649 (108th Congress) and \n     applicable to the Senate by section 14007 of the Department \n     of Defense Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law 108-287; 118 \n     Stat. 1014).\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have had two major \nhurricanes in Florida that have done a great\n\n[[Page S9203]]\n\ndeal of damage to our agricultural industry in Florida. Our \nagricultural industry is a $62 billion industry. We have just passed a \ndisaster relief bill for drought for several Midwestern States which \nwas a $3 billion disaster relief bill.\n  Naturally, where we have an existing disaster that has occurred over \nthe course of the last 6 weeks, we have a lot of farmers hurting, and \nthe well has run dry in the Department of Agriculture funds. Naturally, \nthe Federal Government will respond, which we do in times of disaster, \nand this Senator and Senator Graham want to make sure we have the \nfunds.\n  We have bipartisan unanimity in our House delegation, along with \nSenator Graham and me, on what we are requesting in this particular \namendment I have sent to the desk. This is requesting $700 million of \ndisaster relief for agricultural disaster. The figure may be more.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and I will \nenter into a colloquy in which I can be assured this matter is going to \nbe addressed in this bill when it goes to conference and that the funds \nare going to be needed.\n  I engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  We are told the administration has existing funds to address the \nmassive damage done to Florida agriculture by Hurricanes Charley and \nFrances, and, indeed, Secretary Veneman has authorized $300 million in \nsection 32 funds which are certainly welcome and appreciated. However, \nI can state that back in Florida we are also told that already the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture is running out of relief funds. I ask the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee if he will work \nwith me to ensure additional emergency appropriations for USDA disaster \nrelief can be provided to address this crisis in Florida?\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will provide the needed disaster relief for Florida \nagriculture as soon as possible. This relief will come in the form of \nappropriations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture disaster relief \nprograms. These funds will be used to help Florida citrus farmers as \nwell as other Florida farmers. If the funds are not provided before we \naddress Hurricane Ivan, we will address this issue when we do address \nIvan in the conference on this bill, the Homeland Security bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and I appreciate his cooperation.\n  I ask the chairman, with his commitment in the Senate, am I in a \nposition to guarantee the agricultural industry of my State that we \nwill provide additional USDA disaster relief or other disaster funds to \nmeet this need in supplemental appropriations in the conference report \non this bill, the Homeland Security appropriations bill?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, yes, that is my commitment to the Senator \nfrom Florida. We fully intend to take up the Hurricane Ivan funds as an \namendment to this bill in conference when the supplemental request is \nreceived.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, around this place, a man's word \nis his bond, and that is good enough for me.\n  I thank the Senator. Our people are hurting. The President has \nrequested, in addition, a $3.1 billion relief package for FEMA and \nother agencies of Government other than the agriculture relief. He did \nnot request that. That is the reason for bringing this to a head at \nthis late hour.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3652 Withdrawn\n\n  Therefore, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I commend Senator Nelson on \nthis issue and thank Senator Stevens for his efforts.\n  This amendment represents the first step in correcting an injustice. \nThat injustice is the lack of meaningful disaster relief for the \nfarmers, ranchers, and growers of Florida.\n  Agriculture is the second largest generator of income in Florida. It \nis responsible for $7 billion in cash receipts and accounts for a total \nof $60 billion in total economic impact.\n  Mr. President, 44,000 farmers and growers produce 280 different crops \nranging from tropical fruits to winter vegetables to greenhouse and \nnursery products to aquaculture and honey and more.\n  The twin disasters of Charley and Frances devastated a significant \nportion of this economic sector. Preliminary estimates indicate more \nthan $2 billion in damage to Florida agriculture.\n  Some growers were hit twice; before they could determine their \ninitial losses, they lost the rest of their crops. It may take months \nto determine the final cost of these storms. The ground first must dry \nout before growers can learn if they will be able to plant and harvest \na crop this year.\n  The growers and their families need help now. Yet today's request \nfrom the administration contains no aid for them.\n  Between fiscal year 1989 and fiscal year 2003, Congress added $49.2 \nbillion to USDA programs. Of that amount, $21.4 billion went for market \nloss payments to compensate for low prices, and $17.9 billion went to \ncrop disaster payments to producers who suffered a natural disaster \ncrop loss.\n  In the past, the Senate has responded when our farmers and ranchers \nwere in need. We again must respond in an appropriate way by providing \nthe aid that is contained in this amendment.\n  I want to commend those officials who have been trying to help \nFlorida agriculture since Hurricane Charley first hit the State. \nDedicated public servants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and \nthe Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services have been \nassessing the damage and directing farmers to available assistance \nprograms. The private sector has worked long hours to minimize the \ndamage. Producers who may have suffered only minor losses are helping \ntheir neighbors who are not as fortunate.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture as always is using its resources \nto aid the victims of these disasters. Additional funds are necessary \nto begin recovery operations. Yet, those funds were not included in the \nadministration's recent request.\n  I want to explain why these funds are necessary. Some natural \ndisasters destroy crops. These hurricanes have destroyed more than \ncrops. For example, nurseries and greenhouses collapsed or were crushed \nby the storms. Replacing a structure is more difficult and costly than \njust replacing plants.\n  Consider the citrus industry. In some groves, you can walk from end \nto end and never touch the ground because it is covered with fallen \ngrapefruits. Next year, another crop may grow, but the grove's owners, \nand their families, need help today. Even worse, the storms destroyed \nthousands of citrus trees. It takes 5 years for a new tree to produce \nfruit and seven years for it to turn a profit.\n  We are approaching that time of year when people throughout the \ncountry order and send gifts of Florida citrus. Its been estimated that \npacking houses and related businesses could lose as much as $100 \nmillion from the storms. Consider the impact on the workers in these \nfacilities.\n  Preliminary estimates indicate that the sod industry in Florida has \nsuffered $300 million in losses. Many of the sod farms are flooded, and \ntoo much water is not good for sod.\n  Florida's cattle and calving operations generate more than $370 \nmillion in cash receipts. The storms destroyed fences and dumped debris \non grazing lands. Florida calves are fed and grow at feedlots in other \nparts of the country.\n  Consider the plight of the winter vegetable growers. Many in Florida \nbegan preliminary planting before the hurricanes hit. Existing programs \ndo not cover their pre-planting costs. They must plant by a certain \ndate to be eligible for aid. If the ground is too wet and they can't \nplant in time, they suffer twice--the lack of a cash crop and the lack \nof disaster aid.\n  The amendment does not ignore the human side of agriculture. It \nincludes funds to assist groups that provide emergency services to the \nmany people who work on farms where crops have been destroyed. Many \nfarm workers have lost their jobs. They also have seen their homes \ndestroyed, or they find themselves without water or power.\n\n[[Page S9204]]\n\n  I realize that the preliminary estimates of $2 billion in losses will \nbe reduced, once insurance and other payments are taken into account. \nBut the need exists today.\n  The transmittal letter for the emergency supplemental asked Congress \n``to limit this emergency request to those items directly related to \nthe recovery efforts from the impact of these recent major disasters.'' \nThis amendment meets this requirement.\n  After a more detailed examination of the damage, we may have a need \nfor additional funds for agriculture assistance. That is why I consider \nthis amendment to be just an important first step but not the final \nstep toward the goal of helping the farmers, ranchers, and producers of \nFlorida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3656\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3656.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for rail and transit security grants)\n\n       On page 20, line 7, strike ``$1,200,000,000'' and insert \n     ``1,550,000,000''.\n       On page 20, line 13, strike ``$150,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$500,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know the hour is late, \nbut as I am sure this body knows, these issues, I believe, are \nextremely important and have to be considered. This amendment deals \nwith rail security. It is rail security and transit grants.\n  Now, first, I do want to say that we are providing $278 million for \nthese grants. The amendment by my friend from West Virginia raised the \namount to that. But it is not close to enough when we are considering \nthat rail is one of the great dangers we face in this war on terrorism. \nIf anything, we have learned since last year's appropriations bill that \nal-Qaida has chosen rail as one of its methods of terror. We all looked \nin shock at what happened in Madrid.\n  Our rail systems, whether they be mass transit, subways, commuter \nrails, passenger rails, freight rails, are utterly unprotected. While \nwe are making small steps in the direction of protecting them, we are \nnot moving close to quickly enough. Despite the significant threat to \ntransit systems, the funding for transit security has been grossly \ninadequate.\n  Over the last 2 years, Congress appropriated only $115 million in \ntransit security: $65 million in fiscal year 2003; $50 million--less--\nin 2004. The administration's budget requested no additional funding. \nNow, of course, we have raised it a little bit here but not close to \nenough.\n  Furthermore, only 30 to 40 percent of what has been appropriated for \ntransit security has been received by transit agencies. So even with \nthe small amounts we have appropriated, our agencies that are supposed \nto make our subways, our mass transit, our commuter rail, our passenger \nrail safer have not been able to do it. As a result, many transit \nagencies, including those in my city, in my State, many of which are \nlikely to be at risk, have pressing security needs that are still \nunfunded. In fact, the Banking Committee found that we have invested \n$9.16 per passenger on aviation improvements but less than 1 cent per \npassenger on transit security improvements. Now does that make any \nsense: $9.16 on air travel, less than 1 cent on transit?\n  On April 8, the Commerce Committee passed the Rail Security Act of \n2004. The bill would provide $1.2 billion to enhance the safety of our \nNation's mass rail systems. On May 6, the Banking Committee unanimously \npassed the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. That \nbill would provide over $5 billion to enhance the safety of the \nNation's mass transit systems and would mean so much to the New York \narea where we face a need for hundreds of millions of dollars to shore \nup our security. So when my friend from Mississippi will get up and \nsay, well, we are giving some money, it is not close to what the \nauthorizing committees felt was needed. It is not a little less; it is \nnot a lot less; it is a huge amount less. If the Commerce Committee \nwould say that $1.2 billion is needed and the Banking Committee would \nsay that $5 billion is needed and we are appropriating as little as we \nare, clearly we are not doing something right.\n  These two bills were not taken up by the Senate leadership for \nseveral months, and then, in July, Secretary Ridge announced there was \ncredible information indicating al-Qaida is moving ahead with plans for \na large-scale attack in the U.S. aimed at disrupting the political \nelections. In reaction, all of a sudden the Senate leadership decided \nto try to pass some security measures that were long overdue. I am told \nthe reason they did not bring them up is because they felt these \nmeasures cost too much. I am sure my esteemed colleague from \nMississippi will make that argument again today, that spending $350 \nmillion to secure the thousands of miles of tracks, tunnels, bridges, \nand stations used by millions of Americans every day is too expensive. \nI have to respectfully disagree. We are vulnerable. God forbid 10 \nterrorists strap explosives to themselves and go into 10 of our busiest \nrail stations and detonate them at a single time. This would cause huge \nloss of life, tremendous suffering, and economic hardship.\n\n  There are things we can do. We can develop detectors that fit mass \ntransit as we are doing in the airports. We are not. We can protect our \ntunnels and bridges upon which trains go. We are not. The bottom line \nis, we are doing virtually nothing.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I ask my friend to withhold? We have a \nunanimous consent request that Members have been waiting on for a \nwhile.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are at a point where we can advise \nSenators of amendments that will now be presented to the Senate for \nvotes. We hope we can get this unanimous consent agreement adopted so \nwe will have an orderly process to follow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that other than any amendments cleared by \nboth managers, the only remaining amendments be the following and that \nthere be no second degrees in order to the listed amendments prior to \nvotes in relation to those amendments: the pending Kennedy amendment \nfor 5 minutes equally divided; the Schumer amendment on rail safety \nwith 10 minutes equally divided; the Schumer amendment on immigration \nwith 10 minutes equally divided; and the Clinton amendment, No. 3631, \nwith 10 minutes equally divided--and I am sure the Senator from Florida \nwill call up his amendment on funds for the Red Cross, and we will \nadopt that on a voice vote--further, that any other pending amendments \nbe withdrawn, and following disposition of the above-listed amendments, \nthe bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to passage as \nunder the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I appreciate the understanding of my \ncolleague from Mississippi. I think I have used pretty much my time on \ntransit even though I have been given another 10 minutes.\n  I just want to say this in conclusion: We are currently spending $5 \nbillion a month in Iraq alone. While I wholeheartedly support making \nsure that our troops have everything they need--and I have supported \nall of these funding requests--if we can spend $5 billion a month in \nIraq, we can surely spend $350 million over 5 years to help ensure the \nsafety of our transit riders here at home. The priorities are wrong. \nThere is a disconnect. We spend what it takes to win a war on terror \noverseas, as we should. We spend virtually nothing to protect ourselves \nat home. To say that a couple hundred million dollars is too much when \nthe safety of our citizens is at stake and we are spending $5 billion a \nmonth in Iraq is a schizophrenia that this country, as we fight this \nwar on terror in this brave, new world, cannot afford.\n\n[[Page S9205]]\n\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment would add $350 million to \nthe bill for rail and security transit grants. A previously adopted \namendment has already added $128 million to the bill for this purpose.\n  The amendment will cause the bill to exceed the committee's 302(b) \nallocation; therefore, I make a point of order under section 302(f) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provides spending in \nexcess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purpose of the pending amendment. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these votes \nbe stacked that are in order: the two Schumer amendments, the Clinton \namendment, the vote on final passage, and any vote in relation to the \nKennedy amendment as well--that they be stacked so we can then proceed \nwith debate on the second Schumer amendment or the Clinton amendment \nand dispose of the discussion, and then we will have a vote on all of \nthose issues at the same time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3655\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I offer the Schumer amendment on \nimmigration security. The amendment is at the desk, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3655.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To appropriate an additional $350,000,000 to improve the \n          security at points of entry into the United States)\n\n       On page 7, line 16, strike ``$2,413,438,000,'' and insert \n     the following: ``$2,763,438,000, of which $200,000,000 shall \n     be reserved for the International Civil Aviation Organization \n     to establish biometric and document identification standards \n     to measure multiple immutable physical characteristics, \n     including fingerprints, eye retinas, and eye-to-eye width and \n     for the Department of Homeland Security to place multiple \n     biometric identifiers at each point of entry; of which \n     $50,000,000 shall be reserved for a program that requires the \n     government of each country participating in the visa waiver \n     program to certify that such country will comply with the \n     biometric standards established by the International Civil \n     Aviation Organization; of which $25,000,000 shall be reserved \n     for the entry and exit data systems of the Department of \n     Homeland Security to accommodate traffic flow increases; of \n     which $50,000,000 shall be reserved to integrate the entry \n     and exit data collection and analysis systems of the \n     Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and \n     the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation; of which $25,000,000 shall be reserved to \n     establish a uniform translation and transliteration service \n     for all ports of entry to identify the names of individuals \n     entering and exiting the United States;''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, there are so many places where we have to \ntighten up our security at home. We have talked about security in the \nair and security at the ports and security on the rails and security \nwith trucks. We have talked about helping our police and our \nfirefighters and hospitals. There is another area that we do have to \naddress even at this late hour because it is so crucial. That is \nsecurity at our country's borders.\n  The question is, Who can come across our borders, whether by land or \nsea or by air, and how do we monitor who they are, and how do we make \nsure terrorists do not come into this country as they did in the years \nand months before 9/11, where one part of the Government knew that \nthose who came across the borders might well cause harm, but those who \nwere at the borders letting people into this country did not?\n  The good news is that technology can help us. We can keep our borders \nopen and free. We can have commerce that we need and at the same time \nseparate those few bad apples. Technology will allow us to do that. But \nwe are not doing it. Again, we run the risk that our porous borders \nwill serve as an attraction to those who want to be in this country to \ndo evil things, either here or abroad.\n  The amendment I have offered would provide funding necessary to \nstrengthen the eyes and ears and coordination of personnel at our \ncountry's borders. Perhaps the greatest threat to our country as a \nwhole is what New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman has called \n``people of mass destruction'' or PMDs coming through our borders. It \nwas people of mass destruction who turned airplanes into missiles on 9/\n11, and we have to do something to avoid that.\n  My amendment contains five parts. First, the amendment provides $200 \nmillion to help bring the biometric technology already at our busiest \nports of entry up to the standards called for by the 9/11 Commission \nand the task force report. The 19 hijackers who invaded my city and our \ncountry 3 years ago ran through the borders in a wave of deception. \nWere there more accurate measures of identifying those terrorists when \nthey entered the country, we might not have suffered 9/11.\n  Three years after 9/11, it is staggering that we are leaving so much \nof our safety up to the subjective, fallible judgment of individuals \nrather than to superior biometric technology. The first part of the \namendment deals with upgrading that technology.\n  Second, my amendment would provide $50 million to help ensure that \nall travelers entering the United States are held to the same high \nlevel of scrutiny. Specifically, the amendment would provide funding to \nhelp persuade visa waiver program governments to produce passports \ncompatible with the state-of-the-art biometric technology that I hope \nwill be deployed at U.S. ports of entry.\n  Third, the amendment would provide $25 million to fund the expansion \nof the Homeland Security Department's exit and entry data systems to \naccommodate the ever increasing traffic of travelers in and out of our \nNation's ports of entry. As the pace of globalization quickens, U.S. \nairports, bridges, and ports see a rising number of visitors. We have \nto have the technology to keep up with that increasing number.\n  Fourth, the amendment addresses the need to integrate the entry and \nexit data systems housed within the Department of Homeland Security, \nthe FBI, and the Department of State. We have in our Government a \nnumber of sophisticated databases collecting critical information about \nindividuals who could harm our country. Each of these systems has \ndifferent access rules and runs on different algorithms. It makes \nintegration of these systems with one another and with the people at \nthe borders very chancy and difficult.\n  Finally, the amendment would provide $25 million to support a uniform \ntransliteration and translation system to identify each visitor \nentering and exiting. You don't want to let someone in because Mohammed \nor Bill was spelled incorrectly and that person slipped through the \nborders.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The bottom line is simple. We have a long way to go to \nmake our borders safe. The frustration that many of us have is we can \ndo it but we are not. Again, we are taking tiny baby steps where bold, \nimaginative, and large steps are required. No one, no matter what their \nideology, party, or even vote on this measure, wants to repeat what \nhappened at 9/11 when people came across our borders and should not \nhave. This amendment will help close that loophole. It is worth the \ncost. I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment would add to the bill $350 \nmillion for components of the United States Visitor and Immigration \nStatus Indicator Technology system, known as US VISIT. We have included \nthe amount requested by the administration in this bill for the US \nVISIT system in the amount of $340 million. So\n\n[[Page S9206]]\n\nthe Senator's amendment would double the amount that is already \nincluded in the bill. The amendment will cause the bill to exceed the \ncommittee's 302(b) allocation. Therefore, I make a point of order under \nsection 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment \nprovides spending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purposes of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be. There is.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under the order previously entered, there \nis an opportunity for consideration of a pending Kennedy amendment or \nthe offering of amendment No. 3631 by Senator Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3631\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3631.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this amendment--sponsored by myself and \nSenators Ensign, Lautenberg, Feinstein, Boxer, and Corzine--follows the \nrecommendation in the 9/11 Commission. What it does is to put into our \nbill language that permits the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to allocate the money above the minimum that goes to all \nStates. In other words, 38 percent of the money for homeland security \nwill be distributed on a per capita basis to all States. The remaining \n62 percent, which is the subject of my amendment, will be distributed \nas recommended by the 9/11 Commission and every other expert who has \nstudied this issue on threat factors and risk assessments that will \ntake into account matters such as population, population density, \ncritical infrastructure, and such other factors as the Secretary \nconsiders appropriate.\n  We have debated this on the floor for a number of years. I engaged in \na colloquy about this back in July of 2003 when we were considering the \nHomeland Security appropriations. I have spoken on numerous occasions \nwith Secretary Ridge. I know we have been given assurance that there \nwould be developed some kind of threat matrix so we could take into \naccount the full range of issues that should be considered. I am not in \nany way suggesting what those factors should be. I think food security \nshould be among them. I think our petrochemical complexes should be \namong them.\n  I think our laboratories in States such as New Mexico should be among \nthem. I think there are probably threat-based assessments that would \napply to every single State. But we know, having gone through this \ndebate now year after year, that what happens is the path of least \nresistance is followed and the money is distributed on a per capita \nbasis. I don't think that is good for any State, whether it is a large \nState or a small State, or any State in any part of our country.\n  Some have argued my amendment would take money away from other \nStates, particularly the small States. It does not. The money that was \nguaranteed to the small States, to all States, will continue to flow. \nBut what we have done is to say, wait a minute, the Secretary of this \nDepartment should begin to be able to develop a threat assessment. And \nlet's look at our critical infrastructure. Every State has such \ninfrastructure. Instead, the money is going out to the States and they \nare spending it as they see fit, without necessary regard for our \nnational interests and our homeland security concerns, some of which \ncross State and county borders, and I believe that looking to this \nopportunity as recommended by the 9/11 Commission is absolutely \nessential.\n  So my amendment embodies the factors that were noted by the 9/11 \nCommission and it gives the administration--not me--and the Department \nof Homeland Security the discretion and authority to come up with any \nother factors they believe are relevant.\n  It is time we follow the advice of the experts--this Commission and \nthe Rudman Commission. Every commission and every security expert who \nhas looked at this has come to the same conclusion: We should give the \nSecretary discretion to develop a threat matrix to do a risk analysis, \nand then to make sure the money is distributed accordingly. I hope for \nthe sake of our homeland defense and in keeping with the words of this \nCommission, you will support the Clinton-Ensign amendment. Senator \nEnsign wanted to get back in time to be part of the debate, but it \nmoved a little more quickly than we had expected. I look forward to \nworking with him and working with our colleagues to ensure that we do \nthis right.\n  We have spent a lot of money and we have given a lot of equipment and \ngiven a lot of local communities money that, frankly, according to the \narticles that are often printed about this, they are looking for ways \nto spend.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will vote for this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Schumer be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the funds allocated for this program in \nthis bill are done on a formula basis under the provisions of the \nU.S.A. PATRIOT Act. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held \nhearings on this issue and has reported out a bill, S. 1245, the \nHomeland Security Grant Enhancement Act, to deal with domestic \npreparedness grants and how they are distributed. That is the \nlegislation that is the appropriate vehicle for further debate and \namendments if Senators want to offer amendments dealing with the \nformula for distributing State and local first responder grant funding.\n  This should not be done on an appropriation bill, on this bill, as \nthe Senator seeks to do with her amendment. Therefore, I move to table \nthe amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we are at a point now where the \nSenator from Massachusetts has an amendment, which is the only one left \nunder the agreed-upon process for finalizing the handling of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3626\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have 2\\1/2\\ minutes. I \nyield myself 1 minute 15 seconds. I will yield the remaining time to my \nfriend and colleague, the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham.\n  Mr. President, in May of 2001, President Bush appointed General \nScowcroft to review the intelligence system to make recommendations \nabout how it could be more effective for the President of the United \nStates. General Scowcroft has been relied upon by Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents. He is one of the distinguished generals and \nforeign policy experts and arms control individuals. He issued such a \nreport 3 months after 9/11.\n  It seems to me the most important decision we are going to make in \nthis body by the time we have adjournment is going to be intelligence \nreform. This particular amendment says we believe the Scowcroft \nCommission report ought to be made available to all the Members of the \nSenate. If there has to be a classified annex, so be it. Over the \ncourse of the last weeks, we have had Secretary Rumsfeld who commented \non it. This is what he said in the Armed Services Committee:\n\n       I have been briefed on the Scowcroft Commission record. I \n     don't see any reason why there shouldn't be a process so it \n     can be declassified.\n\n  I asked him a question:\n\n       Was there anything in there that you thought could be \n     declassified?\n\n  He said:\n\n       No, I cannot recall anything that could not be \n     declassified.\n\n  Senator Warner, for the record, said the Scowcroft Commission has not \nbeen released by the White House. We are going to seek to see whether \nwe can have greater access to it.\n  Senator Roberts said:\n\n       I had talked to Scowcroft last Thursday. I begged on my \n     hands and knees to release the report.\n\n  That is what we are doing, releasing the report.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I strongly support the amendment. We have had\n\n[[Page S9207]]\n\ntoo much classification of material, which has had the result of making \nus less secure, not more secure. The expert opinion of people like \nGeneral Scowcroft ought to be made available to the American people and \nthe Congress so it can be used as we attempt to construct systems that \nwill make us safer.\n  There is no reason for the extensive classification process used in \nthis administration, ranging from the Scowcroft report to the \nclassification of 27 pages of our Senate-House joint inquiry relating \nto the role of foreign governments in assisting the terrorists. This \nwould be a good place to start. The American people will be safer by \nour actions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me make a couple points I think are \nimportant before we vote on this amendment. This is a report--the \nsubject of this amendment by Senator Kennedy--that was prepared at the \nPresident's request to advise him on intelligence issues. The report \nconstitutes privileged advice to the President from a confidential \nadviser.\n  In order to protect the ability of not only this President but future \nPresidents in their ability to receive advice as a matter of separation \nof powers, recognized previously by the courts, Presidents of both \nparties have long declined to turn over to Congress privileged advice \nthat is prepared for them at their request. For this same reason, the \nPresident does not ask Members of Congress to turn over advisory \ninformation prepared for us by our staff members. We think this is a \ntradition that should be honored in this case.\n  I am prepared to move to table the amendment if no other Senator \nwants to be recognized. If others want to speak on the issue, I am \nhappy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n            dugway proving ground's first responder classes\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to compliment my friend, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S9210]]\n\nCochran. He has been a tireless advocate for defending the homeland. \nHis subcommittee has made impressive strides in helping to prepare \nfirst responders for a day that we all hope will never come. Therefore, \nI rise to share my thoughts about the First Responder Classes that are \ntaught at Dugway Proving Ground.\n  These Ph.D driven courses focus on agent characteristics, sampling, \nprotection, detection, decontamination and chemical/biological \nproduction recognition, such as the difference between clandestine drug \nlaboratories, industrial accidents or chemical/biological production \ncapabilities. Additionally, Dugway, as part of its effort to provide \ninnovative training capabilities, has also built a ``training town'' in \norder for students to assess a situation and determine the proper \ncourse of action. The high quality of these classes is reflected in the \ncomments from the Chief of the HAZMAT Unit of one of our largest cities \nwho has categorized the program as ``one that all first responders \nshould attend'' and many other students that have stated it was the \nbest training they had experienced.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank my colleague for his kind words. Identifying the \nvery best in first responder training programs is a priority for the \nsubcommittee. Accordingly, the subcommittee has created a system in \nwhich the Department of Homeland Security distributes funding through a \ncompetitive grant program. I appreciate the Senator's comments on the \nquality of classes conducted at Dugway Proving Ground. I look forward \nto hearing about the program's continued progress in the future.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's comments.\n\n\n                          port security grants\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy \nconcerning language in the Senate version of H.R. 4567, the Department \nof Homeland Security Appropriations Act, regarding the distribution of \nthe port security grant program.\n  Under current policy, any port designated as a critical national \nseaport terminal may apply for a port security grant even though the \ngrants are funded through the Urban Area Security Initiative, UASI, \ngrant program. I would like to clarify that it is the intent of \nCongress that the port security grant program continue to be \nadministered in this manner, and not limited to ports in UASI cities, \nas such a policy would deprive many American ports of crucial security \nfunding.\n  I would like to ask my distinguished colleague from Mississippi if he \nagrees that it is the intent of Congress to continue the distribution \nof port security grants to all national critical seaports as has been \ndone in the past?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Hawaii is correct. I \nappreciate the opportunity to clarify this point. It is not the intent \nof the Appropriations Committee to limit the recipients of port \nsecurity grants to only UASI cities but rather to maintain the \ndistribution criteria utilized in the fiscal year 2003 wartime \nsupplemental.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi yield for a clarification?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield to the senior Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the House \nversion of the Homeland Security appropriations bill has language that \nclarifies this point. I would like to express my hope that the House \nlanguage be preserved in the final version of the bill.\n\n\n                            flood assistance\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd \nfor working with Senator Biden and me to try and assist the community \nof Glenville, in New Castle County, DE. About 1 year ago, on September \n16, 2003, Tropical Storm Henri dropped between 8 and 10 inches of rain \non the northern part of our State over a 14-hour period. Glenville was \nhardest hit. Every street in that development, home to 200 families, \nwas flooded. Many resident's had to be rescued from their homes by \nboat. Hurricane Isabel hit just days later, causing further damage. \nVirtually the entire community is now uninhabitable.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Delaware Governor Ruth Ann Minner's \nrequests for Federal disaster relief following Henri and Isabel was \napproved and FEMA was on the ground in Glenville immediately to assist. \nSince last September, however, we have come to the realization that \nmore help is needed. Repairs to flood-damaged homes would be difficult \nbecause Glenville, hit hard in 1994 by Hurricane Floyd, is certain to \nsuffer repeated flooding. The State of Delaware and New Castle County \nhave now stepped in with $15 million each to purchase and destroy \nflood-damaged homes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the Senators' comments regarding the \ndisaster situation in Delaware last September. There are two programs \nat the Federal Emergency Management Agency to address a portion of this \nproblem. The first program is the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program which \nis available to States such as the Senators' which have been declared \ndisaster areas by the President. I am informed by FEMA that funds are \navailable to assist the Glenville community with home buyouts. The \nother program available to the State is the Pre-Disaster Mitigation \nProgram which is a Federal grant program which accepts competitive \napplications. However, I understand that these programs do not provide \nthe resources to fully buy out the Glenville community at one time.\n  Mr. CARPER. I appreciate the Senator's comments. Delaware is now \nfacing the beginning of another hurricane season. With the amount of \nmoney the State and the county have put into the mitigation effort in \nGlenville, we are concerned that they may be hard pressed to respond \neffectively to another storm like Henri or Isabel.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I know that no existing FEMA program was intended to buy \nout an entire community but $30 million is a lot of money in a State \nlike mine. I believe additional Federal assistance for Glenville will \nhelp the State and the county finish their work there while maintaining \nsufficient emergency response capacity to deal with future storms.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senators from Delaware for this discussion \nand assure them that I will continue to assist them in their effort to \nwork with FEMA on additional Federal funding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations bill, Senators Cochran and Byrd, for agreeing \nto accept an amendment that I cosponsored. This amendment will ensure \nprompt funding for the accelerated deployment of Northern Border Air \nWing run by the Department of Homeland Security.\n  In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Congress mandated the \nestablishment of a Northern Border Air Wing. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity, which is responsible for implementing this initiative, \nintends to have 5 bases, in Washington, Montana, North Dakota, \nMichigan, and New York, from which planes can be dispatched to track, \nidentify, and intercept any unauthorized aircraft detected on the \nnorthern border.\n  I have been working with Department officials in particular on their \nplan to base one of those air wings in Grand Forks, ND, which is a \nmajor aerospace center, and would be an invaluable base in this effort.\n  Despite the urgency of this initiative, the dollars were simply \nlacking for its prompt implementation. At the funding levels called for \nin the administration's budget and the original appropriations bill, \nthe Northern Border Air Wing would not have been fully established, \nstaffed, and equipped until 2008.\n  This amendment will allow the Department of Homeland Security to \nprocure aircraft for, and begin operations at, all 5 air bases on the \nnorthern border in fiscal year 2005.\n  I believe that this is an essential step, and I thank my colleagues \nfor accepting our amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of this Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations bill today, but I do so with great reservation \nand with the knowledge that its funding levels are woefully inadequate \nfor the job of providing an effective defensive front in the war on \nterror.\n  Our highest priorities, as a Congress and as a Nation, have to be the \nsecurity of the homeland and prevailing in the fight against terrorism. \nI fear that the bill before us does not provide the resources necessary \nto meet these priorities.\n  This bill does not reflect my priorities, nor does it represent a \nhomeland\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\nsecurity budget I would write. I voted against the President's budget \nwhen it was before the Senate earlier this year. One of the main \nreasons I gave then for my opposition to the majority's budget \nresolution was its low level of funding for homeland security. Today, \nunfortunately, we are seeing the results of that budget.\n  The President's priorities seem to be along the lines of tax cuts for \nthe wealthy and a missile defense system. Those are not my priorities. \nMy priorities are the safety and security of my constituents and of the \nNation. This bill reflects the President's priorities, as his tax cuts \nhave left us with too few dollars to adequately secure the homeland.\n  Let me give just a few examples of where this bill is deficient. \nSenator Byrd offered an amendment to add $2 billion to this $33 billion \nHomeland Security Appropriations bill. I voted in favor of this \nproposal; yet, the majority voted in lock-step against it. Senator Byrd \nincluded in his amendment funds to double the amounts allocated to \ndeploy radiation monitors at our ports. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity estimates it will cost $496 million to deploy enough radiation \nmonitors to screen all inbound containerized cargo at the Nation's \nbusiest ports; yet, the Department has insisted upon deploying this \ntechnology over a 5-year period. I do not believe we have 5 years to \nwait, and Senator Byrd would have doubled the pace of this effort. How \ncan opponents justify voting against these funds?\n  Also included in this $2 billion amendment was an additional $100 \nmillion to beef up passenger security screening at airports. One of the \nportions of the 9/11 Commission's Report that leapt out at me dealt \nwith the security vulnerabilities that remain in our airports. \nAccording to the Commission, ``[t]he TSA and the Congress must give \npriority attention to improving the ability of screening checkpoints to \ndetect explosives on passengers. As a start, each individual selected \nfor special screening should be screened for explosives.''\n  I expect it would surprise many of my constituents to know that the \nlong lines we all go through at airports do not result in passengers \nbeing screened only for metal objects. When Russian airplanes are being \nblown out of the sky, likely by Chechen terrorists carrying explosives, \nand when the so-called ``shoe bomber,'' Richard Reid, tries to blow up \na Miami-bound plane with carried-on explosives, we know we need to do a \nbetter job. But this bill provides only $75 million to continue to test \nfor chemical and explosive material. Industry representatives have \nreported to me that these systems are ready to be deployed now, and \nthat we need merely to spend the resources necessary to deploy them \naround the country. The $100 million proposed by Senator Byrd would \nhave started us down that road, and I do not know how those who voted \nagainst these funds justify their position.\n  How can my friends on the other side of the aisle vote against \nadditional resources to secure our seaport and railway systems? The $2 \nbillion I referenced earlier also included an additional $350 million \nfor transit and rail security grants, along with an additional $125 \nmillion for port security grants.\n  Not once since the attacks of 9/11 has the administration asked for \nan additional dollar of funding to protect passengers on our Nation's \nrails. More people pass through Penn Station in New York City every day \nthan pass through all 3 of that city's major airports, to take just one \nexample. But not a dime of new money has been requested by the \nPresident to protect those passengers.\n  The Commerce committee, under the leadership of Senator McCain and \nSenator Hollings, has reported legislation authorizing over $1.1 \nbillion to enhance rail security. As my good friend from California has \nsaid, that legislation has not passed the Senate. In fact, since the \nattacks of 9/11 the Congress has refused to authorize additional \nsecurity resources for Amtrak. Anonymous holds on the other side of the \naisle have blocked action for 2 Congresses. The administration has done \nnothing to get that legislation--bipartisan bills--moving. That ought \nto be a scandal.\n\n  I am pleased that the amendment offered by Senator Carper and Senator \nBoxer has been accepted. That will give Amtrak a fighting chance to get \nsome of the funding this bill makes available for rail and transit \nsecurity. But this will not feed the bulldog, Mr. President. This will \nnot close the obvious gaps in our rail security. Given the low priority \nthat rail security has been given, despite known and announced threats, \nI can only hope that Amtrak will get its share of the funds. I hope \nthat when we revisit rail security in the next Congress, we will not \nregret the delay and penny-pinching that we have displayed on this \nissue.\n  This bill is underfunded and shortsighted, and I regret that the \namendments I supported to add needed homeland security dollars were not \nincluded. While the bill before us today does not reflect my \npriorities, I will vote for it so that funds can continue to flow to \nour States, our critical infrastructures, and for the day-to-day \noperations of the Department of Homeland Security. But I look forward \nto debating appropriations bills that do reflect my priorities, and \nthat truly do all we should do to secure the homeland and wage an \neffective war on terror.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I lend my support to a very important issue \nthat would provide funding for the permanent installation of explosive \ndetection system, EDS, equipment in airports. This amendment would \nincrease the overall amount of money of EDS installation from $250 \nmillion to $325 million. I have been joined by Senator John Ensign of \nNevada and a bipartisan group of Senators in this very important effort \nto enhance security and convenience for our Nation's air travelers.\n  As passengers traveling through St. Louis, Kansas City, and other \nairports across the country have surely noticed, a number of bulky \nbaggage screening machines sit in crowded terminal buildings where they \nwere temporarily placed in the aftermath of 9/11.\n  I am concerned that the current situation creates safety and security \nrisks and unduly inconveniences the traveling public since passengers \nare forced to work their way around these obtrusive machines. \nAdditionally, the current in-lobby configuration unnecessarily wastes \nFederal resources since in-lobby equipment requires additional \nscreening personnel to operate, transfer bags, and the like.\n  The goal of our amendment is to provide additional resources to move \nEDS equipment from airport lobbies out of the way and behind the scenes \nas part of an airport's baggage system. This is a costly undertaking \nrequiring extensive construction at airports. The project cost estimate \nat St. Louis, for example, is $90 million, and $34 million at Kansas \nCity. Nationwide, estimates to permanently install EDS equipment in \nairports run from $4 billion to $5 billion.\n  While costly, it is clear that EDS installation should be a high \npriority for the Federal Government. I made that point in a March \nletter to the Senate subcommittee responsible for drafting the DHS \nspending bill. Additionally, I would note that the 9/11 Commission \nReport, which Congress is in the midst of considering, also calls for \nexpediting the ``installation of advanced (in-line) baggage screening \nequipment as part of its aviation-related recommendations.''\n  Our amendment is fully offset through a reduction of $75 million in \nan account aimed at establishing information technology connectivity \nbetween TSA and airports. While IT connectivity is certainly an \nimportant goal, that account has been increased by $154 million over \nlast year's level under the current bill, and a $75 million reduction \nstill leaves $218 million available for that purpose.\n  Given the difficulties that airports around the country are beginning \nto face with increasing wait times at screening checkpoints as air \ntraffic continues to rebound, it is critical that we act now to move \nforward with EDS installation projects as quickly as possible. Adoption \nof this amendment is critical if we are to make any real progress in \nthat regard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we debate the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill for fiscal year 2005, threats against our \ncountry and our way of life continue to mount. The reality of the world \nin which we live today is that terrorists are plotting ways to destroy \nour way of life\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\nand seek to destroy the freedoms and liberties we cherish.\n  The recently released 9/11 Commission report outlines the failures \nthat lead to the September 11 terrorist attacks and poses 41 \nrecommendations on how to address identified failures and deter future \nterrorist attacks. Senators Lieberman, Specter, Bayh and others have \njoined with me introducing legislation that encompasses all of the \nCommission recommendations. A number of the Commission's \nrecommendations relate directly to the Department of Homeland Security \nand merit discussion today.\n  Obviously, one of the best ways to prevent terrorists from attacking \nour country is to prevent them from entering in the first place. The \nCommission urges the Government to integrate watch lists, speed up the \nfull implementation of USVISIT, which is an automated biometric exit \nand entry program, and work with our allies to better coordinate \nterrorist travel intelligence. Actions must be taken to close current \ngaps in our security that allow people to travel into the United States \nwithout passports or other identification. Though challenging, it will \nbe possible to tighten security and implement needed changes as \nrecommended by the Commission without unnecessarily impeding the flow \nof people in and out of our country.\n  The Commission also was clear that ``[h]omeland security assistance \nshould be based strictly on an assessment of risks and \nvulnerabilities'' and that ``Congress should not use this money as a \npork barrel.'' As the Commission reported, ``[p]opulation density, \nvulnerability and critical infrastructure should be the criteria by \nwhich homeland security assistance is based. I whole-heartedly agree. \nWe must continue to resist any urge to earmark homeland security funds \nand I am pleased by the restraint the Appropriations Committee has once \nagain shown while considering this homeland security funding \nlegislation.\n  Just 2 years ago, we created the third largest Government agency, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, bringing 21 distinct Federal agencies \nunder the direction of one Department. Since that time, considerable \nprogress has been made in protecting our country. However, as \nsuccinctly stated in the Commission's report, we are still not safe. We \nhave yet to adequately develop strong measures to protect our air, \nland, and sea ports of entry. Our borders remain porous. We need to \ndevelop more efficient ways for states and localities to receive much \nneeded funding to increase their preparedness for a terrorist attack. I \nalso remain very concerned at the continuing problems surrounding \ninteroperability.\n  I commend the chairman of the DHS Subcommittee, Senator Cochran, for \ndeveloping an appropriations bill with minimal earmarks or unrequested \nspending. Although this is only the second Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill, I remain encouraged that the Appropriations \nCommittee has resisted the urge to load its DHS appropriations \nlegislation with unrequested spending. I urge my colleagues to hold \nstrong as the bill continues through the legislative process.\n\n  I would be remiss if I did not point out that the few earmarks \ncontained in this bill are targeted, as usual, to the home States of \nappropriators. Examples of earmarks and directive language include:\n  The bill provides $15.4 million for the Coast Guard's bridge \nalteration program, despite the fact that the President requested no \nfunds for this program. The report then earmarks the funds as follows: \n$4.4 million for the Florida Avenue Bridge, New Orleans, LA; $3 million \nfor the EJ Railroad Bridge, Morris, IL; $5 million for the Fourteen \nMile CSX Railroad Bridge, Mobile, AL; $3 million for the Burlington \nNorthern Santa Fe Bridge, Burlington, IA.\n  The bill provides $5 million above the President's request for \nidentified perimeter security and firearms range needs, and the report \nspecifies that the extra funds are to be spent at the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center in Artesia, NM;\n  Agricultural pests: citing Hawaii's ``globally significant natural \nenvironment,'' the Committee report states that DHS should work with \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Hawaii Department of \nAgriculture in sharing information and expertise to ensure protection \nagainst agricultural pests. In this time of heightened security and \nexploding federal budgets, one should question the need for such a \nprovision. I, for one, had not been unaware of an impending scourge of \nagricultural pests--pests that obviously have the good sense to live in \na state that is popular travel destiny--pose a threat to the security \nof the homeland.\n  Out of the acquisition, construction, improvements and related \nexpenses account provided for the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter, the committee report specifically identifies alterations and \nmaintenance funding for buildings at four locations three of which \nhappen to be represented by appropriators. The locations are Artesia, \nNM; Cheltenham, MD; Charleston, SC; and Glynco, GA.\n  Mr. President, the role of our Department of Homeland Security is \nperhaps most vital when it comes to protecting our Nation's borders. I \nam pleased that the committee has continued to fund improvements in the \ntechnology available for the Department of Homeland Security to protect \nour borders. However, money alone will not solve this problem. We must \nreform our immigration laws while we work to improve border security.\n  Historians will judge the 108th Congress by the way we address \ninternational terrorism and respond to the attacks of September 11. \nWhile much work remains to be done to secure our homeland, including \naction on 9/11 Commission recommendations, we can take another \nimportant step by passing this legislation.\n  Mr. President, once again, I thank the appropriators for their \nefforts to move a relatively clean homeland security appropriations \nbill. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate today with mixed \nemotions. A very important, very trusted member of my staff--Katie \nIlg--is leaving our office to embark on a host of new adventures in \nChicago. While I am happy for her and proud of her as she begins this \nnew chapter in her life, I am also sad to see her go. Katie has become \na central figure in our office. As my executive assistant, she has been \nmy right hand for the last year and a half. She has been my friend.\n  I take a few minutes today to talk about Katie and the impact she has \nhad on my office and me and to thank her for all she has done for us.\n  Katie first came to us in April 2000, after graduating from John \nCarroll University near Cleveland. Her first job in my office was as a \nstaff assistant, where she answered phones, dealt with flag requests, \nand gave tours of the Capitol. The thing that most impressed me about \nKatie was that she would always go the extra mile for Ohio \nconstituents--or anyone who wandered into my office, for that matter. \nShe would listen to them with great compassion and concern. She was \npatient and understanding and a great ambassador for my office.\n  Of course, this is not surprising to anyone who knows Katie. The fact \nis that people are drawn to her. She endears herself to people. She is \nkind to people. She goes out of her way for others. She isn't showy or \nelaborate or judgmental. She just cares about people--constituents, \ncolleagues, strangers. She reads people, and she worries about them.\n  It is also not surprising that Katie moved up in my office quickly. \nBy December 2000, she took a position as my personal assistant. Though, \nafter a year and a half, she left our office briefly to work for JP \nMorgan, she came back in February 2003--this time as my executive \nassistant, a management position that put her in charge of my personal \nassistant and scheduler.\n  Katie has thrived in this job. She is an excellent manager and role \nmodel. She works so hard and is so dedicated. She is always looking out \nfor me--always taking care of me, always putting up with me--which, \nsome would say is certainly not an easy thing to do. I've called her at \nall hours, and she's always there to help--always there with the same \nenthusiasm and good nature. Katie never complains, or makes excuses, or \npasses the buck to someone else. No job is ever too small--or too big.\n  Indeed, Katie Ilg is a very special young woman. No one knows that \nbetter than the people Katie has worked with in my office. I'd like to \nshare some of the words that my staff has used to describe Katie. I \nthink they paint a very accurate picture of exactly who she is.\n  Katie is ``thoughtful and thorough.'' She is ``sweet, bubbly, \nebullient, compassionate, generous, warm, steady--a calming \ninfluence.''\n  ``She is willing to do anything for others. She is always there for \nyou when you need her--whether in a work environment or on a personal \nlevel. She is the person everyone goes to for support, a good job done, \na laugh, a joke. . . . She keeps the office alive!''\n  ``Katie is cute, perky, friendly, positive, upbeat.''\n  And, no matter who you ask, there are four words that everyone uses \nto describe her:\n  Katie is caring, selfless, genuine--and short! She makes me look \ntall! Though Katie is a tiny little thing in body, she is a giant in \nspirit. She is a powerful, positive force, who is smart, quick, and \nintuitive. She makes good decisions--good choices. She follows her \nheart and trusts her instincts. Above all else, Katie makes a \ndifference each day--not in big splashy ways, necessarily, but in just \na touch on the shoulder or through a kind word.\n  Katie is a good person. And, there is goodness in everything that she \ndoes.\n  As her dear friend Matt said, ``Whether comforting a family member in \na time of loss or discomfort, counseling a friend through a difficult \nlife challenge or affliction, celebrating a success with a co-worker or \nclassmate, or orienting an old friend to a new city, Katie is always \nthere with genuine and heartfelt words, actions, and deeds no matter \nthe occasion and regardless of the other personal commitments she has \nat the time. . . . She has the ability to be a friend and confidant to \nall, whether you have known her for 8 years or 8 days.''\n  In conclusion, I'd like to say a word to Katie's parents, Tim and \nMimi Ilg. Thank you. Katie is solid in her values and beliefs. She is \ngrounded. She is ethical. She has a great sense of right and wrong. \nAnd, she loves her family more than anything else in the world. She is \na good daughter to you; granddaughter to Lois; sister to Julie; \ncompanion to that boy in Detroit, we know as Mert; and friend to \ncountless others.\n  Every once in a while, we are fortunate enough to have a Katie Ilg \ncome into our lives. Without question, Katie has been one of the best \nthings to happen to my office since I have been here in the Senate. \nWhile my wife, Fran, and I are sad to see her go, we know it is time \nfor her to move on, as she has many more lives to touch and people to \nhelp.\n  We know she will just be a phone call or an e-mail away. And, I'm \nsure we'll see her at a few OSU football games this fall. Nevertheless, \nwe're going to miss you, Katie Ilg. God bless you, and thank you for \neverything. You are certainly one of a kind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9213-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On May 30, 2000 in Salt Lake City, UT, a man armed with a pellet gun \nstormed into a gym, fired several shots, and made threatening comments \nto the gay people in the gym. The club's manager said the gym is a \nhealth and social club for gay and straight men.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9213-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9213-S9214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO NANCY KASSEBAUM BAKER AND AMBASSADOR HOWARD BAKER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto our former Senate colleagues, Nancy Kassebaum Baker and Ambassador \nHoward Baker, for their leadership in organizing a regional conference \nin Tokyo on ``strategies for combating human trafficking in Asia.'' \nTogether, they led the U.S. Embassy's effort to bring together \ngovernment officials, nongovernmental organizations and multilateral \norganizations in a 2-day\n\n[[Page S9214]]\n\nconference in June on the most effective ways to deal with the global \nscourge of human trafficking. The conference was cosponsored by the \nVital Voices Global Partnership and the International Labor \nOrganization.\n  The conference took place several days after the publication of the \nState Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report. Japan and \nother countries were placed on the ``watch list'' for not fully \ncomplying with minimum standards for the elimination of human \ntrafficking. Officials from the National Policy Agency of Japan and the \nJustice Ministry participated in the conference, and several high level \nofficials were among the keynote speakers. Japan announced that it has \nestablished an inter-ministerial body to address the challenge through \na number of actions, including drafting new legislation to strengthen \nexisting rules and penalties. Representatives from many other countries \nincluding India, Cambodia, Thailand, the Philippines, Russia, and \nColombia, also participated in the conference, as did U.S. Government \nofficials.\n  Each year, at least 1 million human beings, predominantly women and \nchildren, are shipped across national boundaries and sold into what has \nbecome modern-day slavery. Traffickers use fraud, coercion and outright \nkidnapping to obtain their victims. No country is immune from this \nproblem. Both the United States and Japan are destination countries. \nSuch trafficking is a flourishing criminal industry, second only to \ncriminal drug and arms trafficking. Human trafficking is an urgent \nglobal challenge and progress against it is possible only through \ninternational cooperation.\n  As Ambassador Baker said in opening the meeting: ``I hope the ideas \nthat come out of this conference help victims all over the world.'' I \ncommend our two former Senate colleagues for convening this significant \nconference to raise international awareness of human trafficking and \nfor bringing countries together to exchange best practices and develop \neffective strategies to combat it. Their leadership is an excellent \nexample of our Nation's commitment to address this global scourge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9214-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DEATH OF HUGH LANGDON ELSBREE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Hugh Langdon \nElsbree, who served as the Director of the Library of Congress' \nLegislative Reference Service, LRS, from 1958 to 1966. The LRS was the \nforerunner of the Congressional Research Service, CRS. Dr. Elsbree, a \nresident of the Washington area for more than 50 years, died on August \n30, 2004. He was 100 years old.\n  Dr. Elsbree joined the Legislative Reference Service as a research \ncounsel in 1945 and served as senior specialist in American Government \nand Public Administration from 1946 to 1954. After he was promoted to \nDeputy Director in 1955, he became Director in 1958 and served in that \nposition until he retired in 1966.\n  Dr. Elsbree was born in Preston Hollow, N.Y., on Feb. 24, 1904. He \ngraduated from Phillips Andover Academy in 1921 and received three \ndegrees from Harvard University: a Bachelors in 1925, Masters in 1927, \nand Doctorate in 1930. He was also elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa.\n  Dr. Elsbree taught in Harvard's Government Department from 1928 to \n1933 and then at Dartmouth University from 1933 to 1943. Dr. Elsbree \nwas a political science professor from 1937 to 1943 and chairman of \nDartmouth's Political Science Department from 1937 to 1941.\n  His Government service began with a short stint as a research \nspecialist for the Federal Power Commission in 1934 and continued \nduring World War II. He moved to Washington and worked for the Office \nof Price Administration as principal business economist from 1943 to 45 \nand for the Bureau of Budget as an administrative analyst from 1945 to \n46.\n  During the period of his library service, he was given a special \nassignment as deputy director of research for the Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations from 1954 to 1955, and from March 1957 to \nSeptember 1958 he served as chairman of the Political Science \nDepartment at Wayne State University.\n  A longtime member of the American Political Science Association, Dr. \nElsbree was the managing editor of the American Political Science \nReview--1952-56. After he retired from the LRS, Dr. Elsbree and his LRS \npredecessor, Ernest S. Griffith, edited a series of 35 volumes on U.S. \nGovernment departments and agencies.\n  When Dr. Elsbree retired in 1966, the Senator Robert Byrd paid \ntribute to Dr. Elsbree's accomplishments in the Congressional Record. \nSenator Byrd said in part: A political scientist of wide repute and a \ndedicated public official, Dr. Elsbree has earned the respect and the \nconfidence of the Congress through his skillful and competent \nleadership of the Legislative Reference Service in a period when \nCongress has experienced its greatest need for research assistance.\n  To Dr. Elsbree's brother, Willard, his son, Hugh L. Elsbree, Jr. and \nhis family, friends, and former colleagues, I extend the Senate's \ndeepest sympathies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9214-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9214-S9215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ARTHUR H. VANDENBERG\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I join all of my colleagues in paying \ntribute to one of the giants of the United States Senate, a son of \nMichigan, Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg.\n  Earlier today, the Senate Commission on Art unveiled a wonderful \nportrait, painted by Tennessee artist Michael Shane Neal, of Senator \nVandenberg in the Reception Room just outside of this Chamber. The \nSenate, in 2000, selected Senator Vandenberg for this rare honor, along \nwith Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York. They join only five others, \nknown as the ``Famous Five'' whose portraits grace the beautiful \nReception Room, Senators Henry Clay of Kentucky, Daniel Webster of \nMassachusetts, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, Robert M. La \nFollette, Sr. of Wisconsin, and Robert A. Taft of Ohio.\n  Arthur Vandenberg was born in Grand Rapids, MI on March 22, 1884. \nAfter studying law at the University of Michigan, he worked as a \nreporter for the Grand Rapids Herald, later becoming the managing \neditor for the paper. Following the death of U.S. Senator Woodbridge \nFerris in March 1928, he was appointed by Governor Fred Green to fill \nthe vacancy, a seat that he was already campaigning for. In November of \n1928, he was elected in his own right. He was reelected three times, \nrose to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and \nthe President Pro-Tempore of the Senate and served in the Senate until \nhis death, from lung cancer, in 1951. Although he is best known for his \nviews on foreign policy, among his many notable accomplishments was the \nestablishment of the FDIC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in \n1933.\n  Vandenberg entered the Senate as an isolationist, an advocate of very \nlimited U.S. involvement in international affairs. However, after the \nJapanese attack at Pearl Harbor, he recognized the Nation's greater \ninterest and rose above partisanship to become one of the strongest \nproponents of a bipartisan foreign policy. On January 10, 1945, in this \nchamber, he delivered the ``speech heard round the world'' calling for \nthe establishment of the United Nations. He was largely responsible for \ndrafting the 1945 United Nations Charter, and he steered its passage \nthrough the Senate. He played a leading role in constructing the \nMarshall Plan, and he engineered the Senate ratification of the NATO \nTreaty.\n  A couple of years ago I read David McCullough's best-selling \nbiography of Harry Truman. The book makes clear the indispensable role \nof Vandenberg in forging and maintaining the bipartisan coalition in \nCongress that supported Truman's successful post-World War II strategy \nestablishing America's place as a leader of the free world and setting \nin motion the foreign policy which ultimately decades later won the \ncold war.\n  Senator Arthur Vandenberg's call to ``unite our official voice at the \nwater's edge'' resonated for many years, uniting Republicans and \nDemocrats in support of the Nation's foreign policy through \nadministrations of both parties. The impact of his words were all the \ngreater because of his own political roots as a isolationist Republican \nleader. Vandenberg, himself, often liked to\n\n[[Page S9215]]\n\npoint out, Pearl Harbor ended isolationism for any realist.\n  Arthur Vandenberg was a forward-looking man who saw beyond partisan \npolitics and worked for the good of the country. His service in the \nSenate is an example of true bipartisan leadership, which is so \ndesperately needed today.\n  I know that all of my colleagues in the Senate and the people of \nMichigan join me in celebrating the life and works of this son of \nMichigan, and in congratulating the family of Senator Arthur H. \nVandenberg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9215-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, today, it is with a heavy heart that I pay \ntribute to a fallen California firefighter.\n  Firefighter Eva Schicke was killed on Sunday, September 12, when her \ncrew was overwhelmed by flames after being dropped by helicopter to \nfight a wildfire in the Tuolumne River Canyon of the Stanislaus \nNational Forest.\n  Eva Schicke was part of an elite 7-person helicopter wildfire crew \nstationed at Columbia Air Attack Base in Columbia, CA. She and the six \nother members of this helicopter crew selflessly risked their lives \ntrying to protect our communities and our treasured forests.\n  A graduate of California State University at Stanislaus where she \nplayed basketball and majored in criminal justice, Eva Schicke worked \npart time as a firefighter for more than 4 years. When she died she was \nbeginning to pursue a career in nursing--yet another testament to her \ngenerosity of spirit and her desire to serve the community.\n  Not only was Ms. Schicke one of the few female firefighters to serve, \nshe is now, tragically, the first ever female firefighter from the \nCalifornia Department of Forestry to die in the line of duty.\n  I offer my sincere condolences to her family, friends, and \nclassmates. I know they must be devastated by the loss of this \ncourageous, young woman.\n  I take this opportunity to extend my gratitude to the search and \nrescue team that went back in to recover Ms. Schicke's body.\n  I also extend my gratitude and express my admiration for all of our \nfirefighters, particularly the six members of the Columbia Helitack \nTeam that fought by Ms. Schicke's side and were themselves injured in \nthat fire. The people of California honor their work. May God bless \nthem for their dedication and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9215-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WILLIAM McSWEENY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my wife Marcelle and I have been privileged \nto know Bill and Dorothy McSweeny during the time I have been in the \nSenate.\n  During my conversations with them, I have especially appreciated \ntheir sense of history. When Mr. McSweeny writes an op-ed piece, based \non his knowledge and experience, I think we should pay special \nattention.\n  Recently, he wrote one for the Washington Post. Nothing I could say \nwould add to the value of this fine statement, so I ask unanimous \nconsent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 18, 2004]\n\n                      No Debating a Sense of Duty\n\n                         (By William McSweeny)\n\n       I am from that generation of younger brothers who just \n     missed World War II and went to war against communism in \n     Korea in 1950. Many of us became fathers to those who fought \n     in Vietnam and grandfathers to those fighting in Iraq.\n       I would not presume to speak for a whole generation, but as \n     a veteran of that combat, I say it is time to tell both \n     presidential campaigns to cease their macho posturing and get \n     on with real programs to run--or save--our country.\n       In our long-ago time, we went to war reluctantly against an \n     unknown enemy in an unknown land.\n       But, we went.\n       The conditions were harsh. The fighting--pre-instant TV--\n     was ferocious at the front and mostly unseen at home. When we \n     came back, no one particularly cared, and only one film \n     (``Pork Chop Hill'') and a handful of books remain to mark \n     our passing.\n       That and a free South Korea.\n       We weren't noticeably upset at men who deferred service and \n     went to college (except those who stole our girls). We didn't \n     come home with rows of medals--although many of us came home \n     with injuries that still warn us of changes in the weather. \n     We didn't do any complaining. We just came home and got on \n     with our lives.\n       Why did we go? Why did we allow our young bodies and our \n     young psyches to be subjected to a war so forgotten that even \n     today it has not been mentioned by either candidate, both of \n     whom failed to notice the anniversary of its June beginning \n     and July ending?\n       I believe it was because we knew that we should. Some of us \n     enlisted as regular Army infantry privates and later became \n     combat officers because other men of the ``greatest \n     generation'' had done it and we should too. It is a young \n     man's reaction to a sense of responsibility and duty, done \n     without much forethought.\n       That, I believe, is the key ingredient in John Kerry's \n     service in Vietnam--and why both campaigns should drop this \n     contrived issue.\n       He did not have to go--because he had been. His tour on a \n     destroyer was overseas time enough. But he went to the boats \n     because other young men were there. The men and the boats had \n     a mission--and he commanded, because he could. That is enough \n     for me. I couldn't care less whether he received a medal. The \n     rest of it is frosting. There is no honor in this debate for \n     our country. We need to know whether a man can save the \n     economy and slow terrorism, not listen to harangues about who \n     was a shooter and who was a dodger.\n       Most of the real heroics are performed by young kids and \n     young officers who just accept it as a cost of doing business \n     in the peculiar exchange that is a combat battleground. The \n     whole place--and it does not matter which war we describe--is \n     one of fear, noise, smoke, confusion and a strange \n     comradeship where you might risk your life for someone you \n     will never see again. I don't know what the expression is in \n     the Navy, but the Army's bittersweet joke is that the two \n     most dangerous words in the English language are ``follow \n     me.'' It takes courage to utter those words and to follow \n     that command--something any veteran of any combat will \n     recognize.\n       It is time for some of us older veterans to take one last \n     stand and call on both parties to drop this base and \n     meaningless debate. At the end of the day, and the end of the \n     battle, medals are just symbols. And the bravery of thousands \n     of our soldiers has passed into history unheralded by stars \n     and ribbons. By engaging in mudslinging over this issue, both \n     campaigns undermine the bravery and honor of all who serve in \n     times of war and peace. And they distract us from the real \n     issues of this election.\n       John Kerry heard the siren song of his moment--that fragile \n     call on the wind that is the call to the colors. He went. He \n     came back. I give him credit for that. If he threw some \n     ribbons over the fence, he's welcome to mine. They lie \n     quietly in a desk drawer, entombed with memories of better \n     men who lie in the dirt of faraway fields, where there really \n     is no glory, but where courage and compassion came with the \n     C-rations.\n       They believed ours was a great country, one that fought not \n     for conquest or for gain but because freedom isn't free and \n     someone has to pay for it. The bill comes due again in this \n     election. Let's hope these two candidates don't leave us \n     paupers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9215-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9215-S9216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HUNGARIAN GOLD TRAIN\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on May 24, 2004, 17 Senators wrote to \nAttorney General John Ashcroft to urge him to resolve the claims \nbrought by several thousand elderly Holocaust survivors in the matter \nof the Hungarian Gold Train. These survivors seek restitution and an \naccounting for the mishandling, loss and theft of their property in the \nyears after World War II. Administrations of both parties have made \nclear our belief that when faced with evidence of wrongdoing, \ngovernments should not rely on legalisms and technicalities to avoid \nresponsibility. Those of us who wrote the Attorney General hoped that \nour own Government would rise to the same level of accountability when \nits own conduct was at fault.\n  Unfortunately, the Justice Department continues to resist these \nsurvivors strenuously in court. One disturbing tactic is to try to \nundercut the Government's own research and admissions. The facts about \nthe Hungarian Gold Train were first brought to light by the \nPresidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets, chaired by\n\n[[Page S9216]]\n\nEdgar Bronfman, in a ``Progress Report'' issued in October 1999. The \ncommission called the Gold Train ``a mysterious example of a single \negregious failure of the United States to follow [its own] policy'' \nregarding restitution of Holocaust victims' property after World War \nII. Now, however, in its recent filings in Federal court, the Justice \nDepartment claims that the PCHA somehow retracted or backed away from \nits findings. However, I recently received a powerful letter from Edgar \nBronfman, the chairman of that commission. Mr. Bronfman makes plain \nthat the commission stands by its report, which, as he points out, is \nstill prominently displayed on its website. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Mr. Bronfman's letter be made part of the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Edgar M. Bronfman,\n\n                                    New York, NY, August 25, 2004.\n     Hon. Hillary R. Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I have been reading your efforts as a member \n     of the United States Senate to address some of the open but \n     extremely important issues in the arena of restitution for \n     living victims of the Holocaust and their heirs. In \n     particular, I am aware, as was reported in the recent edition \n     of The National Journal, that you have taken on a leadership \n     role in seeking a fair and rapid settlement of the Hungarian \n     Gold Train matter.\n       As you know, I had the privilege of serving as the Chairman \n     of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets \n     in the United States (``PCHA'') from its inception in 1998 \n     through its conclusion in December 2000.\n       PCHA was established by act of Congress (P.L. 105-186) in \n     1998. the enabling legislation directed PCHA to ``conduct a \n     thorough study and develop a historical record of the \n     collection and disposition of the assets'' taken from victims \n     of the Holocaust by Nazi Germany or by the governments it \n     controlled, ``if such assets came into the possession or \n     control of the Federal Government'' at any time after January \n     30, 1933. As part of its task, PCHA was directed to file such \n     interim reports with the President as it deemed appropriate, \n     and to submit a final report to the President containing any \n     recommendations for legislative, administrative or other \n     actions it deemed necessary or appropriate.\n       Puruant to its Congressional mandate PCHA issued one such \n     interim report on October 14, 1999, the Progress Report On: \n     The Mystery Of The Hungarian Gold Train (``Progress \n     Report''). The Progress Report is a comprehensive and in-\n     depth historical analysis of the Gold Train story and is, in \n     my view, an accurate account of the United States' handling \n     and disposition of the ``Gold Train'' property. Tragically, \n     that report made public the long-concealed facts that the \n     United States mishandled the Hungarians' property and \n     disposed of it in violation of our laws, a blemish on an \n     otherwise magnificent record at that time.\n       When I learned that the Department of Justice has \n     criticized the Progress Report, and attempted to minimize its \n     significance in the current Federal court litigation, I \n     wanted to contact you about this urgent matter and state my \n     position as the former PCHA Chairman.\n       In December 2000 PCHA issued its final report as required \n     by P.L. 105-186. This report, Plunder and Restitution: The \n     U.S. and Holocaust Victims' Assets (``Plunder and \n     Restitution''), did not repeat all the findings of the \n     Progress Report. There was no need to repeat all of the \n     specific findings because they had already been made public \n     and remained available. Rather the findings were summarized \n     along with many others in the final report. In no way, \n     however, did PCHA intend to retract or retreat from the \n     findings of the Progress Report. In fact, for years the \n     Progress Report remained prominently displayed on PCHA's web \n     site and it remains there today at http://\nwww.holocaustassets.gov/.\n       I hope this clarifies the historical record and addresses \n     any questions your colleagues may have on this point.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                Edgar M. Bronfman.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. It is time for the Justice Department to do the right \nthing. It is time to stop the delay and stop hiding behind legalisms \nand technicalities. The Government should work with the survivors to \npay fair, timely and long overdue restitution. As my colleagues and I \nwrote in May, for these survivors, justice delayed is justice denied.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9216-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n40TH YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH AND SERVICE AGENCY\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize a significant service agency in my home State of Colorado.\n  Forty years ago in Denver, CO a small group of visionaries worked to \nachieve their dream of eliminating the disparities that existed between \nLatinos and the mainstream community.\n  Prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act on July 2, 1964, these \nvisionaries incorporated the first 501(c) 3 non-profit agency in the \nNation to address the specific needs of Latinos. On March 3, 1964, the \nLatin American Research and Service Agency was born. Working with these \nvisionaries was an enlightened philanthropic organization that was the \nfirst in the Nation to take a risk of giving a significant grant to a \nLatino based agency. That agency at the time known as the United Fund \nis today known as the Mile High United Way.\n  Much has happened over the past four decades since attorney Roger \nCisneros first wrote the incorporation papers for LARASA. In November \nof 1964 Mr. Cisneros became the first Hispanic elected to the Colorado \nSenate since the early 1900's. Bernard (Bernie) Valdez, the first \nHispanic appointed to a Denver Mayor's Cabinet was the first Chairman \nof LARASA's Board of Directors. Ms. Lena Archuletta who was the first \nHispanic to serve as a school principal in the Denver Public Schools \nsystem was the first Secretary of the Board. Also serving on the first \nboard of directors was Rodolfo ``Corky'' Gonzales a leader in the \nChicano Movement and Herrick Roth former leader of the Colorado Labor \nMovement and founder of the Colorado Forum.\n  Today LARASA continues to provide leadership in the areas of health, \neducation, public policy, leadership development and community \noutreach. On the occasion of their 40th Anniversary I am proud to \nrecognize their significant achievements by entering this statement \ninto the Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9216-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING IOWA EDUCATORS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE NATIONAL HISTORY DAY \n2004 SUMMER TEACHER INSTITUTE, POLITICS AND THE PRESS: THE INFLUENCE OF \n                          THE MEDIA ON HISTORY\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words today \nabout the significance of observing September 14, 2004 as National POW/\nMIA Recognition Day, which honors the memory of the POWs and MIAs who \nhave served in our Nation's wars.\n  As my colleagues know, the United States has fought in numerous wars \nand thousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured by \nthe enemy or listed as missing in action. In 20th Century wars alone, \nmore than 147,000 Americans were captured and became Prisoners of War; \nof that number more than 15,000 died while in captivity. When we add to \nthis number those who are still missing in action, we realize that we \ncannot do enough to remember their service.\n  As a veteran who served in Korea, I personally know that the \nremembrance\n\n[[Page S9217]]\n\nof another's sacrifice in battle is one of the highest and most noble \nacts we can perform. Remembering demonstrates our indebtedness and \ngratitude for those who served that we might live in freedom.\n  Many of us have visited one or more of the military academies that \ntrain America's future military leaders. These academies have varied \nmissions and yet all of them share in the critical task of developing \nleaders for their particular branch of service. On the grounds of each \nacademy is a chapel, spectacular places that are easily identifiable as \nplaces of worship.\n  In each chapel, a place has been reserved for those prisoners of war \nand the missing in action from each particular service. A pew has been \nset aside and marked by a candle, a powerful symbol that not all have \nreturned from battle. These hallowed places have been set aside so that \nall POWs and MIAs are remembered with dignity and honor. It is a moving \nand emotional experience to pause at these reserved pews, to be \nencouraged by the burning candle, to recall the valor and sacrifice of \nthose soldiers, sailors, marines, and pilots and to be inspired today \nby what they have done.\n  Yet, I believe we can and should do more to honor the memory of all \nthe POWs and MIAs who have so gallantly served our Nation.\n  The display of the POW/MIA flag is a forceful reminder that we care \nnot only for them, but also for their families who personally carry \nwith them the burden of sacrifice. We want them to know that they do \nnot stand alone, that we stand with them and beside them, as they \nremember the loyalty and devotion of those who served.\n  Mr. President, I believe that those who have been captured or are \nmissing in action in the Nation's wars deserve to be honored with \ndignity and devotion. So today I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring these Americans and their families by remembering their \nsacrifice and declaring that it will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9217-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO COACH SAMMY DUNN\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I pay tribute to a great Alabamian \nwho has made it his life's work to teach our youth about being great \nathletes, fair sportsmen, and strong members of their community.\n  Mr. Sammy Dunn, baseball coach of Vestavia Hills High School, was \nrecently inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and named the \nNational High School Coaches Association baseball coach of the year. He \nhas dedicated his life to coaching young men, not just on the athletic \nfield, but in life's lessons.\n  For 27 seasons, Coach Dunn served as head baseball coach at Vestavia \nHills High School, where he built a nationally recognized program. He \nwon more games than any baseball coach in the history of Alabama and \nhas a 621-159 record, a staggering .796 winning percentage. From 1991 \nto 2000, he led the Vestavia Hills Rebels to 10 State titles, including \na record 7 consecutive titles between 1994 and 2000. In 1998, the \nRebels were voted national champions by Baseball America and the \nBaseball Coaches Association. In 2000, Vestavia Hills High School named \nits baseball field in honor of Coach Dunn.\n  Throughout Coach Dunn's tenure, more than 100 players signed baseball \nscholarships, and some went on to play professionally, including \nveteran Oakland Athletic's pitcher Chris Hammond, Cincinnati Red's \npitcher Josh Hancock, and New York Yankee pitching prospect Colter \nBean. Moreover, his leadership inspired a handful of his former players \nto pursue coaching careers, including his son Casey, who is the head \ncoach at Samford University.\n  Coach Dunn's lifelong devotion to young people and the sport of \nbaseball made him an outstanding coach and much deserving of these \nrecent accolades. He is a devoted husband to Linda, dedicated father to \nCasey, father-in-law to Marty, and grandfather to Sam. I wish him my \nsincerest congratulations on all of his achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9217-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WCAX TELEVISION\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to WCAX \nChannel 3, the CBS affiliate based in South Burlington, VT, which will \nreach a milestone this month when it marks its 50th year of \nbroadcasting.\n  WCAX has documented many changes in my home State during that half-\ncentury, some for the better, some not. But Channel 3's crucial role in \nchronicling history cannot be overstated. From its coverage of high \nschool baseball to State House politics, Channel 3 gives Vermonters the \nnews they need. The station's patriarch, Stuart ``Red'' Martin, is as \nmuch a part of the Vermont fabric as the State's dairy farms and dirt \nroads.\n  Vermont had the distinction of being the very last State in the \nNation to have its own television station when WCAX aired its first \nbroadcast from a transmitter at the top of Mount Mansfield, according \nto the authors of the recently released book, ``Freedom and Unity: a \nHistory of Vermont.''\n  In this book, the authors write, ``By then, the image of Vermont both \nwithin and outside the State as an isolated, rural, museumlike, \nhomogeneous, and unchanging society was becoming increasingly difficult \nto maintain.'' Indeed it was, and Channel 3 was there to broadcast \nVermont's changing image into living rooms from one end of the State to \nthe other.\n  Today, Channel 3 has a little more competition than it did back in \n1954, but it maintains the distinction of being ``Vermont's Own.'' Over \nthe years, Channel 3 has amassed a variety of impressive awards too \nnumerous to list. But suffice it to say that many a political career \nhas risen or fallen based on Channel 3 news coverage, and some of us \nare better off for it. Now if they would just purge that old file tape!\n  Thank you, Channel 3, for being there through all these years of \npublic service--from helping farmers through the Agriculture Extension \nService to the advent of satellite hookups--to capture Vermont's rich \nand unique history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9217-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9217-S9218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:09 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1318.

A bill to provide for increased planning and funding for \nhealth promotion programs of the Department of Health and Human \nServices; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Health \nPromotion FIRST (Funding Integrated Research, Synthesis and Training) \nAct, legislation to provide the foundation for solid planning and a \nscientific base for health promotion.\n  Between one half and two-thirds of premature deaths in the United \nStates and much of our health care costs are caused by just three risk \nfactors: poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco. Recent news \nreports have highlighted the alarming increase in obesity across the \nNation. In the last 10 years, obesity rates have increased by more than \n60 percent among adults--with approximately 59 million adults \nconsidered obese today.\n  We also know that medical costs are directly related to lifestyle \nrisk factors. The September 2000 issue of the American Journal of \nHealth Promotion reported that approximately 25 percent of all employer \nmedical costs are caused by lifestyle factors. Emerging research is \nshowing the value may be closer to 50 percent today.\n  Medical care costs are reaching crisis levels. Some major employers \nare actively exploring discontinuing medical insurance coverage if \ncosts are not controlled. The Federal Government has the same cost \nproblems with its own employees, and the cost to Medicare of lifestyle-\nrelated diseases will only increase as Baby Boomers retire, and more \nand more beneficiaries are diagnosed with lifestyle-related illnesses.\n  An obvious first step to addressing our health and medical cost \nproblems is to help people stay healthy.\n  The good news is that both the public and private sectors are \nstarting to do more in the area of health prevention and health \npromotion. For instance, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 \nincluded several new prevention initiatives for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Also in recent years Congress and the Administration have worked \ntogether to pass numerous pieces of legislation to establish grants to \nprovide health services for improved nutrition, increased physical \nactivity, and obesity prevention.\n  However, despite the success of many health promotion programs, there \nis a quality gap between the best programs and typical programs. This \noccurs because most professionals are not aware of the best practice \nmethods. Furthermore, even the best programs reach a small percentage \nof the population and do poorly in creating lasting change.\n  The Health Promotion FIRST Act will build the foundation for a stable \ncoordinated strategy to develop the basic and applied science of health \npromotion, synthesize research results and disseminate findings to \nresearchers, practitioners and policy makers.\n  The bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to \ndevelop strategic plans focusing on the following: how to develop the \nbasic and applied science of health promotion; how to best utilize the \nauthority and resources of the Department of Health and Human Services \nand other federal agencies to integrate health promotion concepts into \nhealth care and other elements of society; how to synthesize health \npromotion research into practical guidelines that can be easily \ndisseminated and; how to foster a strong health workforce for health \npromotion activities.\n\n[[Page S9223]]\n\n  Additional funding is also provided for the Centers for Disease \nControl and the National Institutes of Health to augment current \nactivities related to health promotion research and dissemination.\n  We have made a good start, at the Federal level, in addressing the \nneeds of health promotion. However, we need to go further. I believe \nthis legislation will serve as a good basis for Congress and the \nadministration to take the next step in developing health promotion \nprograms for the next decade.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2799. A bill to amend title 18 of the United States Code to \nincrease the penalties for smuggling goods into the United States; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President. The safety and security of our Nation's \nborders has been on all of our minds lately. In the past, we have \napproached the problem in a stovepipe manner, focusing on what illegal \nitems criminals were bringing across our borders. We need to begin \nthinking about these challenges differently.\n  Increasingly, smuggling organizations do not tie themselves to the \nmovement of one particular commodity, but are specialists in smuggling \nmerchandise of any type into the United States undetected. So long as \nthere is profit to be made, smugglers don't really care what they \nsmuggle. If we are going to encourage effective investigations and \nprosecutions of these smuggling organizations, we must ensure \nsufficient penalties to send a clear message that smuggling--whether \nit's heroin, pirated CDs, AK-47s, or look-a-like designer hand bags--is \nwrong, and will be severely punished.\n  Today I am introducing a bill that will do just that. It is very \nsimple. Raise the penalty for smuggling contraband into the United \nStates from a maximum of 5 years to a maximum of 20 years. This will \ngive prosecutors and law enforcement agents a better tool to go after \nthose who try and evade our customs, border, and port security efforts. \nIf we are serious about securing our borders, then we need to be \nserious about punishing those who try and evade our controls. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 2800. A bill to amend title 36, United States Code, to grant a \nFederal charter to the Pulaski Cadets, Ltd; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ncreate a Federal charter for the Pulaski Cadets, Ltd. The purpose of \nthis organization is to perpetuate the history of General Kazimierz \nPulaski and military personnel of Polish origin with other nationals \nwho served with the Continental Army of America in the Revolutionary \nWar. Leaders of the Pulaski Cadets work hard devoting time and energy \nto the memory of a military hero, General Pulaski.\n  It is fitting that the Pulaski Cadets should be granted a Federal \ncharter to show the appreciation and respect Congress maintains for \nthis organization and the values espoused by its members. I am proud to \nstand before the Senate and proclaim my admiration for this group and \nthe many soldiers and leaders of Polish origin who have made our \ncountry great and continue to protect Americans at home and abroad. \nTheir contribution has been recognized by many in New Jersey, including \nMayor Joe Vas, of Perth Amboy, who has been a key supporter in their \nquest for a charter.\n  I believe it is vital to study and emulate those leaders who came \nbefore us, particularly those who left such an impressive mark on our \ncountry's behalf. As such, I ask the United States Senate to support a \nFederal Charter for the Pulaski Cadets.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2800\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pulaski Cadets, Ltd...................................250101''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2801. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to enhance Social \nSecurity account number privacy protections, to prevent fraudulent \nmisuse of the Social Security account number, and to otherwise enhance \nprotection against identity theft, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nprotect one of Americans' most valuable but vulnerable assets: Social \nSecurity Numbers. The bill I propose today is identical to legislation \nthat is making progress in the House of Representatives. Just before \nrecess, the House Ways and Means Committee passed the bill not only \nwith bipartisan support, but with unanimous support. Even though this \nbill has differences from S. 228, which I proposed at the beginning of \nthis Congress to help prevent the misuse of Social Security numbers, \nthe issue is too important for me, or for any other Senator, to stand \nby and do nothing.\n  The legislation, which in the House is H.R. 2971, was authored by \nRepresentative Clay Shaw, the Republican from Florida's 22nd \nCongressional District. Very briefly, the key provisions of the \nlegislation will do the following: It will generally prohibit the \nFederal and State governments, and private businesses, from displaying, \nbuying, and selling Social Security Numbers. However, realizing that \nthere are certain instances where Social Security Numbers must be \ncommunicated, the bill makes exceptions for areas such as law \nenforcement, national security, vehicle registration, and certain \nlimited forms of research.\n  The bill will also toughen the methods that the Social Security \nAdministration uses to verify birth records, and that it uses to issue \nSocial Security numbers to newborn infants.\n  Additionally, the legislation will prohibit companies from requiring \nconsumers to provide their Social Security Numbers, and will treat any \nsuch requirement as a prohibited unfair trade practice.\n  The bill will also punish violators with fines and up to five years \nin prison, with up to 25 years for those who are involved in drug \ntrafficking or terrorism.\n  The bill also allows other sections of Federal law to impose stronger \nrestrictions, and calls for reports analyzing the process for issuing \nSocial Security Numbers.\n  This legislation is necessary to help stop the epidemic of identity \ntheft that has been plaguing America and its citizens.\n  According to a report that the Federal Trade Commission released in \nSeptember, 2003, almost ten million people were victimized by identity \ntheft in the previous year. This led to losses of over 47 billion \ndollars.\n  The damage is not merely monetary. According to the same FTC report, \nthe average victim had to spend thirty hours that is, three-fourths of \na standard work-week--to resolve the problems. Often, the entire \nprocess can drag out for years.\n  Perhaps worst of all, victims must confront the trauma that someone \nelse has hijacked their very identity. According to the Identity Theft \nResource Center, a non-profit group that operates in my home state of \nCalifornia: ``Each time you answer the telephone or go to the mailbox, \nyou wonder what new bill will appear. The idea of dealing with yet \nanother collection agency or a newly discovered credit card leaves you \nfilled with dread, rage and helplessness. . . . Some feel like they are \nexperiencing a form of `post-traumatic stress disorder' for a short \ntime.''\n  Theft of a Social Security number can be especially devastating, \nbecause that piece of information has become a de facto universal \nidentifier in American society.\n  One recent book on privacy in the United States documents how far the \nuse of Social Security Numbers has spread beyond its original purpose, \nwhen they were created in 1936, of tracking American workers' earnings \nand benefits. According to the book: ``The SSN began to be used for \nmilitary personnel, legally admitted aliens, anyone receiving or \napplying for federal benefits, food stamps, school lunch program \neligibility, draft registration, and federal loans. State and local \ngovernments, as well as private sector entities such as schools and \nbanks, began to use SSNs as well--for drivers' licenses, birth \ncertificates, blood donation, jury selection, worker's compensation, \noccupational licenses, and marriage licenses. `` (SOURCE: Daniel Solove \nand Marc Rotenberg, Information Privacy Law, Aspen Publishers, 2003, at \npage 447-48.)\n\n  Despite this widespread use of Social Security Numbers, according to \nthe General Accounting Office, ``No single federal law regulates the \noverall use or restricts the disclosure of SSNs by governments.'' \n(SOURCE: Social Security Numbers: SSNs are Widely Used by Government \nand Could be Better Protected, 2002 (Report Number GAO-02-691T) at page \n5). As a result, the use of Social Security Numbers is regulated by an \ninconsistent and insufficient patchwork of State and Federal laws, that \noften leaves the numbers in plain view of the whole world.\n  It isn't surprising, then, that the sale of Social Security Numbers \nis proceeding at a furious pace. According to the GAO in a report that \nit released earlier this year, ``Internet-based information resellers \nwhose Web sites we accessed also obtain SSNs from their customers and \nscour public records and other publicly available information to \nprovide the information to persons willing to pay a fee.'' (SOUCE: \nSocial Security Numbers: Private Sector Entities Routinely Obtain and \nUse SSNs, and Laws Limit the Disclosure of this Information (2004, \nReport Number GAO-04-11), on Highlights Page).\n  I personally first became aware of the need for a law to restrict the \nsale and display of Social Security numbers about eight years ago, when \none of my staff members sat me down and downloaded my own Social \nSecurity Number from the Internet in a matter of minutes. Congress has \ndone shockingly little to protect Social Security Numbers since then.\n  Therefore, we badly need a uniform law such as the one that the GAO \nreport anticipates. Year after year, I have advocated and proposed such \nlegislation that would restrict the public display and use of Social \nSecurity Numbers.\n  In the 106th Congress, I introduced S. 2966.\n  In the 107th Congress, I introduced, S. 848 and S. 3100.\n  In the 108th Congress, I introduced S. 228.\n  None of these bills moved. Today, I stand before you yet again, to \nintroduce a fifth bill to take steps that will make it more difficult \nfor thieves to steal this precious resource. This is not a partisan \nissue--all of the bills that I introduced in the past were bipartisan. \nAnd so is this bill: in the House, as I mentioned, it was passed \nunanimously in the Ways and Means Committee, and also has 41 co-\nsponsors, including 16 Republicans and 25 Democrats. This issue does \nnot concern Republican government or Democratic government; rather, \nthis is an issue of good government.\n  Earlier this year, the President signed into law a bill that I helped \nto author, to increase punishment for those who steal the identities of \nothers. But punishment is not enough. We need to stop identity theft \nfrom occurring in the first place.\n  We have only three weeks until the end of this Congress to enact this \nlegislation to prevent such thefts by protecting Social Security \nNumbers. If we do not pass this legislation now, we will have to wait \nyet again to give basic protection to information that should have been \nunder lock and key long ago. It is time for us to act. Thank you.\n\n[[Page S9225]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent, the text of the accompanying bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2801\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 424\n\n       Whereas perpetrators of financial crimes frequently target \n     their fraud schemes at older Americans because older \n     Americans possess a large percentage of the individual \n     household wealth in the United States;\n       Whereas many older Americans have been divested of their \n     hard-earned life savings by fraud and frequently pay a high \n     emotional cost, losing not only their money, but also their \n     self-respect and dignity;\n       Whereas perpetrators of fraud schemes against older \n     Americans reach their victims through the telephone, the \n     mail, or the Internet;\n       Whereas the United States Postal Inspection Service \n     responded to nearly 80,000 fraud complaints, arrested 1,453 \n     fraud offenders, secured nearly 1,387 fraud convictions, and \n     initiated 102 civil or administrative actions involving fraud \n     in fiscal year 2003;\n       Whereas fraud investigations by the United States Postal \n     Inspection Service in fiscal year 2003 resulted in nearly \n     $1,500,000,000 in court-ordered and voluntary restitution \n     payments;\n       Whereas older Americans are often the disproportionate \n     targets of cross-border fraud, including prize promotions, \n     sweepstakes scams, foreign money offers, advance-fee loans, \n     and foreign lotteries, and file 20 percent of all cross-\n     border fraud complaints;\n       Whereas there was an 80 percent increase in 2003 of reports \n     of Internet fraud targeting older Americans, and the amount \n     of money lost by older Americans to Internet fraud increased \n     from $2,690,618 in 2002 to $12,818,313 in 2003, a 375 percent \n     increase in money lost;\n       Whereas the Federal Trade Commission reports that \n     27,300,000 people in the United States have been victims of \n     identity theft in the last 5 years, including 9,900,000 \n     people in the last year alone, and that identity theft has \n     cost businesses and financial institutions nearly \n     $48,000,000,000, in addition to the reported $5,000,000,000 \n     in out-of-pocket expenses incurred by consumer fraud victims;\n       Whereas there was a 200 percent increase in 2002 of \n     identity theft targeting older Americans, and credit card \n     fraud is perpetrated against older Americans at a higher rate \n     than the general population of the United States;\n       Whereas the Federal Trade Commission continues to \n     successfully implement its do-not-call registry, with 60 \n     percent of consumers surveyed stating that they registered \n     and 80 percent of the registered consumers surveyed reporting \n     fewer calls, but more older Americans need to be aware that \n     the do-not-call registry is available;\n       Whereas fraud schemes targeting older Americans have caused \n     losses estimated at millions of dollars a year, and have cost \n     some older Americans their homes;\n       Whereas consumer awareness is the best protection from \n     telemarketing, mail, Internet, and identity fraud schemes, \n     and the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Postal \n     Inspection Service have resources available to educate and \n     assist the public; and\n       Whereas it is vital to increase public awareness of the \n     enormous impact that fraud has on older Americans and to \n     educate the public, older Americans, their families, and \n     their caregivers about a wide array of fraud schemes, such as \n     telemarketing, mail, Internet, and identity fraud, and how to \n     report suspected fraud to the appropriate authorities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2004 as ``Protecting Older Americans \n     From Fraud Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the \n     month with appropriate activities and programs that--\n       (A) prevent the purveyors of telemarketing, mail, Internet, \n     and identity fraud from victimizing the people of the United \n     States; and\n       (B) educate and inform the public, older Americans, their \n     families, and their caregivers about a number of financial \n     crimes, such as telemarketing, mail, Internet, and identity \n     fraud.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 425--HONORING FORMER PRESIDENT WILLIAM JEFFERSON \n              CLINTON ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 58TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Reid) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Bush, William \n     Jefferson Clinton `showed a deep and far-ranging knowledge of \n     public policy, a great compassion for people in need, and the \n     forward-looking spirit the Americans like in a President': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate honors former President William \n     Jefferson Clinton on the occasion of his 58th birthday on \n     August 19, 2004, and extends best wishes to him and his \n     family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9231-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9231-S9232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3630.

Mr. President, like many Americans, I was concerned to \nlearn that former President Bill Clinton was suffering serious heart \ndisease and had to be hospitalized for heart bypass surgery. Like many \nAmericans, I was relieved to learn that his surgery had gone well, and \nthat the former President is recuperating in his home in New York. The \nformer President is known for his energy, and I hope that he will have \na speedy recovery and will return to full health soon. I offer my best \nregards to him and his family, including our distinguished colleague, \nSenator Clinton.\n  Inspired, no doubt, by this concern, our Democratic colleagues have \njoined in sponsoring a resolution to honor the former President on his \n58th birthday. I wish to join them in wishing former President Clinton \ngreetings on his 58th birthday, and I wish him many more.\n  Unfortunately, there is language in this resolution that is \nincorrect, at least because it is historically inaccurate, and at most \nbecause it seriously distorts the historical record and defames the \nmemory of 200,000 victims of genocide in southeastern Europe.\n  There is a bizarre clause in this otherwise laudable attempt to give \nthe President a legislative birthday card that states:\n\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton rallied the members of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to put an end to \n     ethnic cleansing in the Balkans and to depose the murderous \n     regime of Slobodan Milosevic, actions which eventually led to \n     the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords . . . .\n\n  I know that, in the hurried pace of work around here, particularly in \nthis type of political season, a certain sloppiness can find its way \ninto legislative language. But this statement, as I have said, is \nincorrect and offensive.\n  It is incorrect because, as anyone who knows the history will \nconfirm--and I was here in the Senate throughout the bloody wars of \nsoutheast Europe in the 1990s--the removal of Slobodan Milosevic from \npower occurred in 2000, almost 5 years after the Dayton Peace Accords \nwere signed in the autumn of 1995. That's why the statement is \ninaccurate.\n  The statement is offensive because almost 200,000 innocent civilians \ndied as victims of ethnic cleansing from the outbreak of the wars of \nsoutheast Europe in 1992 until the United States finally acted in the \nlate summer of 1995. The majority of those deaths, I must remind my \ncolleagues, occurred during the first three years of the Clinton \nPresidency.\n  From the outbreak of the wars of Yugoslavia in 1992, I came to this \nfloor advocating a policy of ``lift and strike'': lift the \ninternational arms embargo imposed on Yugoslavia and strike, with air \npower, the Yugoslavian army under the control of the mass murderers \nSlobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. I was joined on \nthe Senate floor by my colleagues Joe Biden, Joe Lieberman and Bob Dole \nand many other Members of this body. The first Bush administration \nignored us and left office shortly after the wars began. President \nClinton, who ran on a campaign platform supporting ``lift and strike,'' \nreversed his position upon entering office and assumed a policy \nconsistent, it appears, with current Democratic foreign policy \nthinking, that deferred to the international community.\n  We can recall the effectiveness of the United Nations in Bosnia, when \nwe think of blue-helmeted U.N. forces remaining by the sidelines as \nSerb forces captured Srebrenica in the summer of 1995, and herded \nthousands of unarmed men and boys--boys--to their slaughter in mass \ngraves.\n  That summer, a summer that began with Serb militaries surrounding the \neastern enclaves of Bosnia and the Clinton administration refusing to \nlift the arms embargo preventing the Bosnians from defending \nthemselves, while Bosnian Prime Minister Siladzic came to Washington \nand begged not to leave his people to die unarmed, the Dole-Lieberman-\nHatch resolution lifting the arms embargo passed by 69 votes. This \nveto-proof measure, along with the photos of the horrors of Srebrenica \non the front page of The Washington Post--one horrid photo showed a \nwoman hanging herself in despair--caused the Clinton administration to \nrelent.\n  When Bill Clinton acted, in late 1995, he saw that, when the United \nStates leads, the international community will follow. When he acted \nagain, in 1999, to stop Milosevic's campaign in Kosovo--a campaign we \nknew would happen when Milosevic was not removed from power in 1995--\nthe international community followed. In both cases, I supported the \nPresident, as did a number of Republican Members in this body. He acted \ntoo late for hundreds of thousands, but he finally acted. It will be \nleft to the historians, along with the members of that administration, \nto ponder and justify and explain why there was value in waiting while \ngenocide raged across southeastern Europe.\n  A birthday gesture to a former President is not the place for this \ndebate, and I certainly would not speak here were it not for this ill-\nconceived language that appears in this resolution. But legislation of \nany kind becomes a permanent record of the work of the United States \nCongress. This language, when stating historical fact, contributes to \nthe interpretation of history. I am a proud member of the council of \nthe Holocaust Museum and I am proud to support the mission of that \nrevered institution, which could simply be stated that the truth of \ngenocide should always be stated. To allow the clause I have just read \nfrom this otherwise harmless birthday resolution to become a statement \nof historical fact is a whitewash of history, something a democratic \nbody should never do.\n  But worse, it is a calumny, a grave dishonor, on the memories of \n200,000 civilians of southeastern Europe, people who died in a \ngenocidal war in Europe less than 50 years after the Holocaust, \ncivilian men and women and children who died while the international \ncommunity failed, the U.N. failed and two administrations, including \nPresident Clinton's administration, for almost 3 years, waited for a \npower to act like only the United States can.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand the preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 5008, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5008) to provide an additional temporary \n     extension of programs under the Small Business Act, and the \n     Small Business Investment Act of 1958 through September 30, \n     2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to address H.R. 5008, a bill \nto provide a temporary extension of programs under the Small Business \nAct and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and to enhance the \noperations of the Small Business Administration.\n  The bill before us would extend until September 30, 2004, SBA \nprograms that have expired. In addition, it would provide clarification \nas to the SBA's method of reimbursing its Fiscal and Transfer Agent, \nwhich assists in the operation of the SBA's vital loan programs.\n  In July 2004 I introduced S. 2700, a bill that extended these same \nSBA programs and also provided this clarification regarding the Fiscal \nand Transfer Agent. The Senate unanimously approved S. 2700 on July 20, \nbut unfortunately the other body failed to pass that bill, leaving many \ncritical small business assistance programs unauthorized. Today, we \nhave another opportunity to renew these programs and to provide this \nlegislative improvement, and we should not miss the chance.\n  Since 1953, nearly 20 million small business owners have received \ndirect or indirect help from one of the SBA's lending or technical \nassistance programs, making the agency one of the Government's most \ncost-effective instruments for economic development. The SBA's current \nloan portfolio of more than 175,000 loans, worth more than $45 billion, \nmakes it the largest single supporter of small businesses in the \ncountry.\n  According to the SBA, the $65.5 billion awarded to small businesses \nin Federal prime and subcontracts in FY 2003 allowed small businesses \nto create or retain close to 500,000 jobs. Over the last five years the \nSBA's programs and services have helped create and retain over 6.2 \nmillion jobs.\n  The Senate agreed unanimously in September 2003 to pass a bill I \nintroduced, the Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary \nReauthorization Act of 2003, to authorize the entire SBA for a three-\nyear period. However, we have been unable to reauthorize the SBA \nbecause the other body has been stalled in its consideration of SBA \nauthorization legislation. According to the SBA, reauthorizing the \nagency will result in an estimated 3.3 million jobs created or retained \nover the next 5 years, with the SBA and its programs predicted to \nsupport over 1 million additional jobs over that same period through \nprime contracts and subcontracts.\n  In the absence of a full reauthorization of the Agency, which I am \nstill working to bring about, it is vital that we extend those programs \nthat can provide current assistance to small businesses. The bill \nbefore us, H.R. 5008, would renew the authorization for several SBA \nprograms, including the Preferred Surety Bond Program. This program \nprovides an essential service to small businesses by guaranteeing \nsurety bonds for small business contracts, thereby permitting small \nbusinesses to undertake thousands of projects which would otherwise be \nout of reach.\n  H.R. 5008 would also specify the manner in which the SBA may \ncompensate its Fiscal and Transfer Agent. This agent administers \npayments and fee collection in the SBA's loan programs and in the \nsecondary market for those loans. This legislative change, requested by \nthe administration in its budget submission to Congress for Fiscal Year \n2005, would provide guidance as to the SBA's method of compensating its \nagent.\n  Additionally, this legislation will preserve the operations of \nexisting Women's Business Center that currently serve women \nentrepreneurs in almost every State and territory. Today, more than \n10.6 million women-owned small businesses are helping to fuel our \neconomic recovery: they employ over 19 million Americans and contribute \n$2.46 trillion in revenues. In my home State of Maine, there are more \nthan 63,000 women-owned firms, generating more than $9 billion in \nsales. Numbers like these speak for themselves, and are clear evidence \nof the success of the Women's Business Centers Program.\n  Moreover, according to research, between 2001 and 2003, women's \nbusiness center clients reported starting over 6,600 new firms and \ncreating more than 12,000 new jobs.\n  Mr. President, without this legislation, many of the Centers may be \nin jeopardy of closing their doors. This would be a significant loss, \ngiven that some of these Centers have proven to be powerful engines of \neconomic development in communities across the Nation.\n  As we work toward the larger goal of a full reauthorization of the \nSBA, I urge my colleagues to support the enactment of H.R. 5008. This \nlegislation would allow essential SBA programs to continue to assist \nsmall businesses during the remainder of this Fiscal Year.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join Chair Snowe in \nsupporting legislation to keep the Small Business Administration and \nits financing and counseling assistance available to small businesses. \nThis bill temporarily authorizes the SBA and most of its programs \nthrough September 30, 2004. In addition to the temporary extension, \nthis bill includes a provision necessary to bring the administration \ninto compliance with a January 2003 recommendation by the SBA's \nInspector General. This change will save the SBA hundreds of thousands \nof dollars by allowing the agency's fiscal and transfer agent for the \n7(a) loan program's secondary market program to keep the interest \nearned on fees lenders pay before they are remitted to the Government. \nCurrently, the SBA does not have that authority. The committee wants \nthe program to continue running smoothly and successfully, and we think \nthis change should accomplish this.\n  Six SBA programs were halted after S. 2700, a similar bill sponsored \nby Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee Chair Olympia \nSnowe and myself, passed the Senate on July 20 but did not pass the \nHouse prior to the August recess. The six programs reinstated by H.R. \n5008 are: the Women's Business Center Sustainability program, the Small \nDisadvantaged Business, SDB, program, the Preferred Surety Bond, PSB, \nGuarantee program, the Small Business Development Center, SBDC, Drug-\nFree Workplace Assistance Grants program, the Very Small Business \nConcerns program, and the SBA's co-sponsorship authority.\n  With passage of this bill, the committee expects the SBA to move \nforward on grants for all its programs and certification for minority \nbusinesses, and any other activities it has been delaying.\n  And while I am pleased that this bill will extend all of SBA's \nprograms and pilot programs, I am disappointed that the dire and urgent \nneeds of the women's business center program have yet to be fully \naddressed. Given the abysmal job creation record of this \nadministration, we must aggressively seek and support innovative ways \nto create jobs, and the women's business center program has a proven \ntrack record of doing just that. Last year alone, the women's business \ncenter network helped over 100,000 female entrepreneurs grow their \nbusinesses, employ more people, and expand economic opportunity.\n  A study recently released by the National Women's Business Council \nshows that over the past 2 years, while funding for the women's \nbusiness center program has remained essentially flat, the number of \nclients served increased by 91 percent and the number of new businesses \nstarted went up 376 percent.\n\n[[Page S9240]]\n\nThe study also found that the businesses counseled by women's business \ncenters had an economic impact of $500 million in gross receipts, $51.4 \nmillion in profit, and created 12,719 new jobs. With these numbers, it \nis clear that the women's business center program is a wise investment \nthat will continue to pay dividends to women in business, the \nGovernment and our national economy well into the future.\n  As many of my colleagues know, there are currently 87 women's \nbusiness centers. Of these, 35 are in the initial grant program and 53 \nhave graduated to the sustainability part of the program. These \nsustainability centers make up more than half of the total women's \nbusiness centers, but under the current funding formula are only \nallotted 30 percent of the funds. Without changing the portion reserved \nfor sustainability centers to 48 percent, as the Senate-passed Snowe-\nKerry bill, S. 2267, directs, all grants to sustainability centers \ncould be cut in half, or worse, more than 20 experienced centers could \nlose funding completely.\n  I believe it is very important to pass H.R. 5008 and extend the pilot \nso that our most experienced centers can continue their good work for \nwomen-owned businesses; however, the current funding formula for the \nWomen's Business Center still needs to be updated. As the author of the \nbill to establish the sustainability program, I am hopeful that my \ncolleagues in Congress will soon come together to fix this problem and \nsecure the women's business center network once and for all.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of small businesses and for \nconsidering immediate passage of this important small business \nbill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5008) was passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/14/senate-section/article/S9240-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
