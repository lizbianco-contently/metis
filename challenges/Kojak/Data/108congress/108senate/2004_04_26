Mr. President, this week the Senate will spend most of its \ntime on the question of taxation of the Internet. Having been the \nprincipal sponsor of the legislation on this subject in the Senate \ntwice, I would be the first to say this subject inherently is about as \ninteresting as prolonged root canal work. But at the same time, I think \nit is fair to say the decisions the Senate makes with respect to this \nsubject will say a whole lot about the future of the Internet.\n  For example, the decisions will determine, to some extent, whether e-\nmail\n\n[[Page S4338]]\n\nand spam filters and Google searches and Web sites and instant \nmessaging are singled out for discriminatory tactics. The Senate is \ngoing to have to make some decisions about whether Internet access \nthrough cable is tax free, but consumers who choose DSL Internet access \nwould get taxed.\n  I wanted to take just a few minutes this afternoon to go through some \nof the history with respect to this issue, and particularly suggest \nthat I think the key, as the Senate takes up this subject, is to keep \nin mind two principles that have been important to me.\n  First has been the question of technological neutrality. I think it \nis absolutely key that as the Senate looks to make technology a policy \nthat we ensure there is fair treatment and true competition among all \nof the various technologies that drive decisions in this field.\n  I say to the President pro tempore of the Senate, I can recall when \nwe were looking at this legislation initially, and the Senator from \nAlaska was enormously helpful to me. What we found out was, for \nexample, early on, if you bought the Wall Street Journal in some States \nand you got the interactive edition, you paid a big tax, but if you \nbought it the traditional way, through snail mail, for example, there \nwas no tax. That, it seemed to me, was not technologically neutral. \nThat did not ensure we would have competition in the greatest possible \nway to benefit the consumer, and that was very much at the heart of my \nconcern as I authored in the Senate the first internet tax freedom \nbill.\n  The second concern that was foremost in my mind was the question of \nhow this would affect our States and localities with respect to \nrevenue. At that time, we had a number of Governors, mayors, county \nofficials, and others expressing tremendous concern with respect to \nrevenue. I have always tried to take those concerns very seriously. \nThat is why I wanted to outline some of what was said during the years \nwhen those early bills were debated because I think we are going to \nhave a repeat of those discussions.\n  To some extent, some of the State and local officials who raised \nconcerns about the revenue impact of what we did during the first two \niterations of the internet tax freedom bill have dusted off the \narguments and, in effect, brought them to the Senate again.\n  To go through some of the history, if I might, back in 1997, the \nNational Governors Association, an organization I tremendously respect, \nsaid the Internet Tax Freedom Act would ``cause the virtual collapse of \nthe State and local revenue base.'' But the record shows that the \nfollowing year, State and local sales tax revenues were up $7.2 \nbillion.\n  Let me repeat that. We were told in 1997 that we would have a virtual \ncollapse of the State and local revenue base. The following year, we \nsaw a significant increase in local and State tax revenues.\n  In 2001, when we dealt with the issue again, opponents said:\n\n       The growth of e-commerce represents a significant threat to \n     State and local tax revenues and they might lose tax revenue \n     in the neighborhood of $20 billion in 2003.\n\n  Once again, the record shows otherwise. According to the National \nAssociation of State Budget Officers, State sales tax collections rose \nfrom $134.5 billion in 2001 to $160.4 billion in 2003, an increase of \nmore than $15 billion in just 2 years.\n  We saw this pattern continue in 1998 as well when the National League \nof Cities said:\n\n       A tax-free Internet would place Main Street retailers at \n     competitive disadvantage and would doom the sales tax.\n\n  But e-commerce still only represented 1.6 percent of total retail \nsales in 2003, while brick-and-mortar retail sales grew from $2.6 \ntrillion in 1998 to $3.4 trillion in 2003, according to the Commerce \nDepartment.\n  In three instances with respect to projections by the National \nGovernors Association, the National Association of State Budget \nOfficers, and the National League of Cities, as the Senate dealt with \nthe two iterations of the tax freedom bill, when this body was told \nthat tremendous amounts of revenue would be lost, in each instance, as \nI have just documented this afternoon, actual revenues collected went \nup rather than revenues going down.\n  The reason I have taken the time to go through that is I am sure \nduring the course of this week, we are going to hear the same kinds of \nprojections. We are going to see State and local officials come and say \nif the Senate reauthorizes this law that has been reauthorized twice, \npretty much Western civilization is going to come to an end. They are \ngoing to say they are going to be in dire straits with respect to the \nfunds they are going to need for critical services and that they will \nfind all form of financial calamity.\n  I am very interested in addressing those concerns. I have great \nempathy for the challenge of funding State and local services, but I \njust want the Senate to know, and why I am focusing on this point at \nthe start of the debate, that again and again over the last 7 years, as \nthis debate has gone forward, the Senate has been given these \nprojections about calamitous losses to our States and localities if the \ninternet tax freedom bill is passed, and as I have pointed out, in \ninstance after instance, revenue has gone up rather than down.\n  I think it is fair to say that all of these technologies, in the \nissue of whether someone gets internet access over DSL or whether they \nobtain it through cable, are complicated. That is why I, Senator Allen, \nSenator McCain, and others who have worked on this issue have tried to \nspend time talking to all concerns. Frankly, we have made a number of \nchanges in an effort to try to accommodate the issues brought up by \nthose who do not share our view.\n  For example, we have in several instances tightened definitions of \nInternet access that have been raised. We have agreed to a request for \nnew statutory language on what is called bundling, where various \ntechnologies are bundled together. We have added language to protect a \nhost of taxes for States and localities, such as property and income \ntaxes that have never been affected by the original legislation, but \nbecause there was concern on the part of States and localities, we \nwanted to drive home our intent not to have these areas taxed.\n  We have also agreed to a request for provisions to protect universal \nservice, regulatory proceedings, and we also agreed to deal with some \nrequests from States for what is called grandfathering so as to protect \nexisting sources of revenue.\n  At the end of the day, we want to make sure that consumers who now \nhear the message ``You've got mail'' don't get a message, ``You've got \nspecial taxes.'' That is what this issue has always been about. It is \nclear from the history of this legislation that we do not want the \nInternet to get preferential treatment, nor do we want it singled out \nfor discriminatory treatment. That is what I sought to do when we began \nthis debate late in 1996. I pointed out, for example, how a newspaper \nthat was purchased online would be taxed, but a newspaper that was \npurchased in the traditional way would not be taxed. That is not \ntechnological neutrality.\n  That is what the sponsors of this legislation are seeking to protect. \nThe alternative that several of our colleagues are interested in would \ntake a very different approach. That alternative would essentially \nbreak up Internet access into individual components so that if they \nchose to do so, States and localities could tax each one of those \ncomponents.\n  Under that, for example, Internet consumers could be subjected to \nclose to 400 separate telecommunications taxes, administered by \nsomething like 10,000 different jurisdictions.\n  In effect, each piece of e-mail, the filtering systems that families \nuse to block pornography and spam and each Web site, each blackberry \nmessage conceivable is exposed to tax by scores of jurisdictions. Each \ntown that chooses to do so could tax the e-mail flowing through its \nphone or cable lines even if the e-mail was not being sent from or to \nsomeone in the jurisdiction. I think it is fair to say if even a modest \nportion of the jurisdictions that could impose these taxes chose to do \nso, we would be talking about a massive increase in the cost of \nInternet access to every consumer in America.\n  What I think this is really all about is that the States and \nlocalities essentially see the Internet as the last cash cow in the \npasture. In effect, they have been barred by the courts from going \nafter phone sales. They have been barred by the courts from going after\n\n[[Page S4339]]\n\nmail order. So now along comes the Internet, and the Internet is being \nseen as an enormous cash opportunity.\n  The fact is, Internet sales in 2003 are still only 1.6 percent of \ntotal retail sales. They grew at a far more modest rate than brick and \nmortar sales grew over the last few years, but that is not even the \ncentral point.\n  All of us understand the value of the Internet as a tool for \nbusinesses and communication and to improve health care and extend \ncultural opportunities. The Chair and I share a State with mostly small \ntowns and folks who have to go great distances, and the Internet is one \nof the best tools, if not the ideal tool, for compensating for major \ndistances from commercial centers and major population centers.\n  So I hope my colleagues will think through the history I have \noutlined with respect to the revenue protections and the question of \nwhether vast amounts of revenue are going to be lost because I think \nthe record shows those dire projections to State and localities have \nnot come to pass.\n  I hope my colleagues will also see the principle of technological \nneutrality that I sought 7 years ago still is a sound one and one that \nthe Senate ought to preserve. It does not make sense to me to say, for \nexample, that cable Internet access ought to be tax free and then stick \nit to consumers who choose DSL Internet access.\n  So we are going to be dealing with these issues over the course of \nthe week, but I wanted to take a few minutes to make clear that we are \ngoing to be protecting the States and localities from property and \nincome taxes and telecommunications carriers. They are concerned about \nit. We agreed to their proposal to deal with what is called bundling to \nmake sure that Internet service providers cannot hide from tax services \nthat would otherwise be subject to bundling. We narrowed the definition \nof Internet access so as to try to find common ground.\n  States and localities were concerned about sweeping up all \ntelecommunication services into Internet access so that no \ntelecommunication service could be taxed. The changes in definitions \nthat we made narrowed the definition and ensured that the Senate would \nstill keep up with the significant technological developments in the \nfield.\n  The bill ensures that all platforms, whether dial-up, digital \nsubscriber lines, cable mode, satellite, wireless, or any other \ntechnology platform, as well as the components used to provide Internet \naccess, would be covered by the moratorium.\n  So I think we are going to have an important debate this week. I \nexpect to spend a fair amount of time on the Senate floor as we discuss \nit. This has never been a partisan issue. I have worked on this \nlegislation with Chairman McCain and with Senator Allen over the last \nfew years since he has come to the Senate. I think ultimately the \ndecisions that the Senate makes are going to say a whole lot about \nwhere the Senate wants Internet to go in the future.\n\n  I cannot believe the Senate wants to subject e-mail, blackberries, \nand a variety of technologies to scores of new and discriminatory \ntaxes. That is what this debate has always been about: should the \nInternet be subject to discriminatory taxation. If a jurisdiction, for \nexample, taxes brick And mortar sales, they can tax sales online and \nthrough the Internet in exactly the same kind of fashion.\n  I hope the Senate can find common ground on this legislation this \nweek and continue a law that has worked. I am proud to be able to have \nbeen a part of this consideration over the last 7 years, and I hope we \ncan pass reauthorization for a third time so as to promote true \ncompetition between all technologies in a fashion that ensures that \nthis idea of technological neutrality we had 7 years ago is preserved, \nand to do it as we have sought to do so that the dire revenue \nprojections we will hear this week about States losing vast amounts of \nmoney will not come true as they have not come true over the last 7 \nyears.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation? Are we \nstill in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, last Thursday I came to the floor to mark \nEarth Day, and I wanted to highlight the laser-like focus of the Bush \nadministration in rolling back 30 years of environmental protections. \nWhen one looks at their record, it is literally breathtaking.\n  The reason I am concerned about this is that most of our \nenvironmental legislation was put together by bipartisan coalitions. In \nmy State of Vermont we do not think of the environment as a Republican \nor a Democratic issue. We think of it as an issue of protecting what is \nbest about our country and protecting it for not only ourselves but for \nour children and our grandchildren.\n  Unfortunately, this administration tends to look at the environment \nas something where they should react to their largest contributors and \ntake advantage of what it may do for them today and let our children \nand our grandchildren worry about it tomorrow.\n  Why do I say this? Three years into office, the Bush administration \nhas taken well over 300 actions to weaken and sometimes to gut \nenvironmental protections to clean the air we breathe, the water we \ndrink, and the food we eat. They have taken huge steps to hand over our \npublic lands to timber, oil and gas companies for more drilling and \nlogging.\n  With this record, it is no wonder that the administration continues \nto use every page of its public playbook to downplay the effect of \nthese rollbacks.\n  One of their favorite tactics is announcing environmental rollbacks \non Fridays or around holidays when they think the American public will \nnot be paying attention. In fact, we all know if you have something \ngood you want to announce, you do it early in the week, you do it with \na lot of fanfare. But if you have something you don't want anybody to \npay much attention to, you do it late on Friday.\n  The administration has announced at least 40 environmental rollbacks \non Fridays, another 20 on holidays. Actually, for them, every Friday is \nFriday the 13th: Friday, November 22, the clean air rollback; Friday, \nJanuary 3, 2003, fast-tracked logging; Friday, January 29, 2003, clean \nwater protections threatened; Friday, July 11, 2003, weakened our \ndrinking water protections; Friday, October 10, 2003, changed \nenvironmental rules for mining waste; on Friday, October 17, 2003, \ndioxin regulation, or in this case deregulation. And on and on. These \nare just a few of the actions they have taken on Friday. They show just \nhow far the administration has gone in gutting the Clean Air Act, \nramping up logging in some of our spectacular national forests, dumping \nmore mining wastes on public lands, and dumping more sewage sludge on \nprivate lands.\n  Another favorite tactic is either ignoring or sometimes, if the \nscience doesn't suit their political needs, if they cannot get away \nwith ignoring the science, then they just change it. One of the most \nblatant examples of this was the White House scrubbing of an annual EPA \nair report to avoid any mention of evidence of climate change.\n  Just recently, the New York Times reported on the creative White \nHouse fact spinning of the administration's proposed retreat from \nstrong mercury controls at powerplants.\n  We all recognize their favorite tactic: If you are going to gut the \nenvironment, then just give it a nice name. You can see the number of \nfocus groups they must use in the administration to come up with these \nnames. They don't say, we are going to join Polluters-R-Us, or we are \ngoing to give a payoff to some large polluting corporation because they \nhelped out in a fundraiser. Instead, they will go to focus groups and \nfind out what will sound good to people, what is a good line we can use \nand maybe they won't look behind it, maybe they will just look at the \nrhetoric and ignore the reality.\n\n[[Page S4340]]\n\n  I will give some examples. ``Clear Skies'' and ``Healthy Forests''--\nthese are lines they use, but they are just about as accurate as ``No \nChild Left Behind.''\n  They have used all of these tactics when it comes to misleading the \npublic. For example, on wetlands protections, last January--on a \nFriday, of course--the administration announced one of its most \nsweeping rollbacks to take away protections under the Clean Water Act \nfor 20 million acres of wetlands. This policy created such a \ngroundswell of opposition from hunters, anglers, environmental groups, \nand others that the President finally withdrew the proposed rulemaking \nlast December. One of the things they found out is hunters, anglers, \nand environmentalists often include a whole lot of Republicans as well \nas a whole lot of Democrats, and that the environment is not just for \none party. But they got such enormous objection that they withdrew it--\nthey had to withdraw it--but they did not tell the public they were not \nrevoking the underlying instructions to Federal agencies to follow the \nsame policy that leaves 20 million acres of wetlands at risk.\n\n  That is why I found it so interesting that the President would start \nhis reelection attempts to greenwash his administration's anti-\nenvironmental record by talking about wetlands. Here you have this \nenormous anti-environmental record. You put at risk 20 million acres of \nwetlands. You would think the last thing in the world they would want \nto do is talk about wetlands, but that is what he started with. He had \nsome nice photo-ops walking around the salt marshes and wetlands of \nMaine, but when you look between the lines of his Earth Day \nannouncement, it doesn't hold water.\n  While the President was touting his plan to restore 1 million acres \nof wetlands, he made no mention of his policy to revoke protection of \n20 million acres. We will give you 1, we will take back 20. He didn't \ntell the folks in Maine that he proposed to cut the funding next year \nfor one of the programs, the Wetlands Reserve Program, that was \nsupposed to help meet his 1 million-acre target. You take back 20 \nmillion acres, you promise 1 million acres, but then you say, we won't \neven give you the money for the 1 million. He did not tell the folks in \nMaine that his administration has not fully funded this program since \nCongress expanded it in the last farm bill.\n  Yes, as he said in Maine, the President did indeed sign the farm bill \nto expand it. That is part of his job. But it is quite a leap for the \nadministration to now promote that as one of their environmental \naccomplishments. In fact, the administration has done everything it can \nto shortchange the conservation programs that are so important, not \nonly to Maine and Florida but to every other State. He not only \nproposed cuts to the WRP but also to other programs that might help \nlandowners and farmers conserve the resources on their land.\n  When the President went down to Florida campaigning the next day, he \nalso forgot to mention a few key facts, such as the fact that the Army \nCorps has allowed more than 3,800 acres of wetlands to be drained or \nfilled in the Everglades. The Bush administration stood by and watched \nas the Army Corps signed off on development permits that are destroying \nthe Everglades. It has also argued against Clean Water Act regulations \nof water being pumped from urban Broward County into the Everglades.\n  If you go back to the 300-plus rollbacks under this administration, \nit brings up even more policies that are hurting the environment in \nMaine and Florida and Vermont. The administration's retreat from \naggressive mercury controls on powerplants has just been the most \nrecent of these all-out environmental assaults.\n  It is hard to say we are family friendly when we are going to put \nmore mercury into the air, the water, and the fish pregnant women eat, \nor by which the newborn children might be affected. That is not being \nfamily friendly, to say we have to support our polluting industries \nbecause they have been strong supporters of the President and it is \ntough about the newborn children.\n  The President, as any President of any party, can always get nice \nphoto-ops.

Mr. President, the United States remains the only \ndeveloped nation that does not protect its consumers from drug price \ndiscrimination and, as a result, American consumers continue to pay the \nhighest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\n  Drug spending in the United States and Canada rose by 11 percent last \nyear to $230 billion, which accounts for nearly half of all the \nworldwide sales. Among seniors, total prescription drug spending rose \nan estimated 44 percent between 2000 and 2002. In 2002, a Families USA \nstudy found that for the 50 drugs most frequently used by seniors that \nyear, prices rose 3.4 times the rate of inflation in 2002.\n  The House Committee on Government Reform report released last year \nfound that seniors who lack drug coverage must pay twice as much for \nthe five most popular drugs as purchasers in foreign countries, those \nprices being 131 percent higher than the United Kingdom, 112 percent \nhigher than Canada, and 105 percent higher than France. For some drugs, \nU.S. seniors pay well over twice the price. For example Zocor, a \ncholesterol medication, costs only $37 in France for a monthly supply, \nbut in the United States that same drug costs $117--over three times as \nmuch. A month's supply of Prevacid, an ulcer medication, costs only $42 \nin the United Kingdom compared to $118 in our country.\n\n  Clearly, this price discrimination must be addressed. Many, including \nmyself, had hoped that the Medicare drug bill would be the first step \nin tackling the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. Unfortunately, \nthe final product did very little to address these concerns. The new \nlaw expressly prohibits the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services from negotiating lower prices.\n  Again, this law not only does not correct the price differential, \nbelieve it or not, the new Medicare drug bill signed by the President \nlast December actually prohibits the United States from negotiating \nlower drug prices the way every other foreign nation does. The United \nStates remains alone.\n  When I traveled to South Dakota earlier this year to discuss the \nMedicare bill, seniors back home found this astonishing.\n  The new law also includes provisions that will allow the Secretary to \nprohibit real access to drug reimportation. Meanwhile, the cost \nestimates of the new prescription drug program continue to rise--to \nsomewhere between $500 billion and $600 billion over 10 years.\n  We are in need of real solutions to this problem. It is my hope a \nreal discussion could occur about drug pricing. What do we do about \nthat gap and about the fact that American citizens pay twice the price \nor more as citizens of other nations?\n  There are several alternatives. We could allow drug reimportation \nfrom Canada or other countries and take advantage of their lower \nprices, and do so in a carefully monitored way that will secure the \nsafety of those drugs. That would be one course. But, unfortunately, \nthe White House and President Bush are opposed to that.\n  Second, we could be more direct. We could join the rest of the \nindustrialized world and negotiate in behalf of our own citizens lower \nprices. That is what everybody else does. That is why France, Italy, \nGermany, Scandinavia, Great Britain, Mexico, Canada, and every other \nindustrialized nation have\n\n[[Page S4341]]\n\nprices far lower than the United States. But President Bush and the \nadministration don't want to do that either.\n  Do you know what their answer is? Their answer increasingly is to use \nour trade rules not to cut the price of drug costs for U.S. citizens \nbut to demand that other countries raise their drug prices on their \ncitizens. That almost boggles the mind--that the solution is not to \nlower the cost of drugs for U.S. citizens but to raise them for \neverybody else in the world. Maybe in this case it is the United States \nthat is out of step and the rest of the world has been in step in terms \nof drug pricing. The rest of the world has figured it out and we \nhaven't.\n  In this country, we have done an extraordinary job of guaranteeing \nthat the pharmaceutical industry has incredible levels of profits. And, \nof course, this new effort to use the trade rule would further enhance \nthe profitability of the big drug companies, but it would do little or \nnothing for U.S. citizens. What good does it do U.S. citizens to know \nthat the citizens of other nations have to pay higher prices? We need \nto moderate those prices and get the United States in step with the \nrest of the industrialized world.\n  It is an outrageous tactic to push the U.S. Trade Representative--\nUSTR--to try to force other countries, through trade agreements, to up \nthe price of prescription drugs in those nations. Most recently, the \nSpeaker of the House and some in the Republican leadership in the \nSenate have advocated that USTR negotiate with Australia to increase \nits drug prices within its Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, or PBS. \nThese proposals are outrageous for several reasons.\n\n  First, our Government should not be telling other nations how to run \ntheir health care system. How would we feel if Australia asked us to \ndevelop a universal health care program and do so in a way that would \ncost our citizens more than was necessary? Many of my colleagues and I \ndo not believe anybody would believe it is appropriate for another \ncountry to tell us how we should run our health care system in America. \nAdditionally, I find it inappropriate that some in Congress and the \nadministration find it appropriate to ask other countries to increase \ntheir drug prices, but we certainly wouldn't do the same for our \ncitizens at their request.\n  Would we be willing to increase drug prices under the VA program \nbecause Australia asked us to? I doubt it. I hope not.\n  Some of our colleagues will say other countries need to share the \nburden of research and development and that in so doing we will \nindirectly help to reduce prices in the United States. We should be \nvery clear. Any trade agreement proposal that would require another \ncountry to increase its prescription drug prices provides no guarantee \nthat prices will go down for U.S. consumers.\n  Does anyone really believe the pharmaceutical industry, which is \nreaping the highest profits of any sector of the Fortune 500, wouldn't \npocket these as additional profits and say, Thank you, very much? Why \nwould they lower costs to U.S. citizens? There is no data available to \nindicate that our prices would go down. In my mind, if this argument is \nthe underlying justification for promoting these types of policies, the \nTrade Representative and members of Congress supporting these plans and \nthe President owe it to our trade partners and American consumers to \nprovide them the data--the proof that American consumers would benefit \nfrom increasing drug prices for everybody else around the world.\n  I also think we need to be very careful when making these \nassumptions--the unspoken assumption here--that research and \ndevelopment is the cause of our higher prices in this Nation. Isn't it \nthe reality--that the lion's share of the prices paid by American \nconsumers is not going into R but is going into the pockets of the \npharmaceutical industry and its stockholders rather than research and \ndevelopment. There are very few industries that can boast the type of \nsales claimed by the drug industry, which has enjoyed average annual \nsale increases of 15 percent in recent years.\n  A Public Citizen June 2003 report found that in 2002 the top 10 drug \ncompanies netted profits of $36 billion, or more than one-half of all \nthe profits of all the Fortune 500 companies.\n  While some may argue this increased spending is justified because it \nreduces other costs of health care spending, the overall rate of health \ncare inflation continues to soar with no end in sight.\n  Beyond straight profits, the pharmaceutical industry continues to \nincrease their spending on direct consumer advertising and lobbying. \nOne study found that eight major American pharmaceutical companies \nspent more than twice as much on marketing and administrative costs as \nthey did on R For all the talk about research and development, in \nfact, more than twice of that is being spent on marketing and \nadministrative costs.\n  The Security and Exchange Commission's 2002 financial data finds that \nfor the fiscal year ending in December of 2002, the average profits of \nPfizer, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Abbott and Wyeth was $5.1 billion, \nmarketing and administration were $5.2 billion and R was much less at \n$2.3 billion. And let's not forget the campaign spending habits of the \ndrug industry. During the 2000 election cycle, the drug industry gave \ndisproportionate support to President George W. Bush and seventy \npercent of the industry's unprecedented $24.4 million in campaign \ncontributions was spent on Republicans.\n\n  With all this in mind, I find it very hard to believe that American \nconsumers are carrying the research and development burden, rather than \nthe stockholder profit burden. And given that drug companies spend more \non TV ads, marketing and administration than they do on drug research, \nperhaps we should first ask why the domestic pharmaceutical industry \nwon't spend more of its money on developing new drugs, before we start \nasking our trading partners to pay higher prices for drugs.\n  The outcome of the Australia trade agreement included requirements \nthat the PBS program in that country provide more transparency in how \ndecisions are made about covered drugs. The PBS system seems to me to \nbe a very good system. Before a medicine can be subsidized by the \nAustralian government, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee \nor PBAC must recommend that a drug be listed on the PBS. When deciding \nwhat drugs make the list, the PBAC takes into account the medical \nconditions for which the medicine has been approved for use, its \nclinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness compared to other \ntreatments. A drug providing new benefits receives a higher price \nreflecting that advantage. This system rewards true innovation by the \npharmaceutical industry while ensuring value for the taxpayer dollar.\n  This is a well thought out and scientific process and I think the \nU.S. should at least explore similar steps in order to reduce drug \nprices under the Medicare program. I also think that the clinical \ncomparative effectiveness analyses that the PBAC conducts are something \nthat we should be making a priority in our country. The U.S. should \nalso establish an independent source of this type of information. Right \nnow, one of the reasons drug costs are so high in the U.S. is because \nconsumers, doctors and purchasers do not have access to objective, \nunbiased, reliable data to compare how drugs measure up to one another. \nThis type of information would force drug companies to truly compete \nwith one another based on the value of their products. Australia is on \nthe right track here and we should follow suit.\n  With the help of Senator Conrad, I am pleased we were able to obtain \nsupport during the Fiscal Year 2005 budget markup for a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution supporting $75 million for the Agency for Health Care \nResearch and Quality for getting these types of studies--drug \ncomparative effectiveness studies--that are needed to find out what the \nreal facts are. Having such information available and accessible to \nphysicians and their patients has the potential to reduce our nation's \nprescription drug expenditures, by enabling doctors to make better \ninformed prescribing decisions. I hope that my colleagues will support \nfunding this year for these fund, which in the long run will mean lower \ndrug prices for all Americans.\n  The very notion that the response from the Bush administration is not \nto allow cheaper drugs into the United States and not to negotiate \nlower\n\n[[Page S4342]]\n\nprices for our citizens the way every other nation does but to try to \ndemand that other countries raise the prices for their drugs indicates \nthat the administration is out of touch and out of tune with the real \nneeds and real priorities of American citizens. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in rejecting these proposals and ask that all members of this \nbody work together to achieve real solutions to address the \nskyrocketing costs of prescription drugs.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while this week we will take up the \nInternet tax issue, which is complicated and, in some ways, \ncontroversial--and I expect it will take some time--I wanted to mention \nsomething about fiscal policy for a moment and hope that perhaps this \nweek, or in the intervening weeks, we may take up a couple of these \nissues.\n  As you know, we have a Federal budget deficit that will be in this \nfiscal year the largest in the history of this country, by far. They \nsay now there will be over a $530 billion Federal budget deficit in \nthis fiscal year. I think everyone understands that saddling our \nchildren and their children with debt they must pay because this \nPresident and this Congress has decided we will spend money we don't \nhave--we will borrow it and saddle someone else with the responsibility \nto pay it--is wrongheaded fiscal policy. It is bad for this country; it \ndoesn't represent a value system that we should embrace, and, second, \nin the long-term it retards economic growth and crushes opportunity in \nthe future for our children and those who follow them.\n  My hope is we will begin to address this issue of fiscal policy. We \ncannot spend more for defense--nearly $100 billion more for defense and \nsay, by the way, we don't have to pay for it. We cannot spend more for \nhomeland security and say it doesn't count, we don't have to pay for \nthat. We cannot cut taxes as we spend more for defense and homeland \nsecurity and, as we spend more for health care, which costs more each \nyear, say we will just charge all that. That is not a responsible thing \nto do.\n  But we have a Federal budget that is sent to us, which comes from the \nPresident, and then the Congress works on this budget plan that says a \ncouple of things. We know we are going to have increases in health care \nspending. We know that because both Medicare and Medicaid represent \nentitlement programs, we know the cost of health care spending is \nincreasing. We know the President is recommending very substantial \nincreases in costs for defense. We know the President is recommending \nsubstantial increases in spending for homeland security. We also know \nthe President is recommending making permanent tax cuts, which at this \npoint are temporary.\n  The point is that this doesn't add up. It is a fiscal policy that \ndoesn't add up. So how could we begin to make some sense of this? There \nare a couple of things that have happened in recent weeks which I think \nwe need to address. This past weekend there was a story in the \nWashington Post about the issue of the $145 billion mistake that was \nmade in the estimate of the cost of the prescription drug plan for \nMedicare.\n  We are told now from press reports that the chief actuary who works \non the Medicare Program knew long before the Congress voted on a \nprescription drug plan in the Medicare Program that this would not cost \n$400 billion, as was provided for in the budget, but, in fact, would \ncost over $140 billion more than that during the 10-year period. But he \nwas told he would be fired if he informed Congress of this information. \nSo the Congress acted without having information that was available in \nthe executive branch because the chief actuary, who is not partisan--he \nis not part of the political system, he has been a career public \nservant and, by all accounts, an excellent one--was told he would lose \nhis job if he informed the Congress of what this would cost.\n  I think there needs to be an investigation into who threatened this \nperson's job, who had this information and refused to turn it over to \nCongress, who indicated it was inappropriate for the Congress to know \nthis information before it voted on this legislation. I believe this \nCongress owes it to the American people to investigate that because how \ncan we legislate in the future on issues of this type without having \nadequate information or without being able to trust the information \nthat is coming from, in this case it was Health and Human Services and \nfrom the chief actuary of the Medicare Program?\n  I believe one way or another in the coming weeks, we ought to find a \nway to investigate that circumstance. I believe we owe that to the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4342-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4342-S4343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FUNDING MILITARY OPERATIONS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, what I want to talk about, in addition to \nthe prescription drug issue, is the notion that--at the end of last \nweek it was addressed--we would probably need more money for the \nmilitary with respect to the fighting that is occurring in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. This Congress passed a supplemental emergency bill that \nwas nearly $87 billion--I believe it was just under $87 billion--some \nmonths ago. We were told that would take us through the end of this \ncalendar year and perhaps even a bit more.\n  The President's budget that was sent to us contained zero money \nrequested for the activities in Iraq and Afghanistan. The reason the \nPresident recommended there would be no funding in the regular budget \nfor Iraq and Afghanistan is because he and the administration said they \ncould not estimate what it would cost; therefore, they recommend zero.\n  We know it is not zero. We know we are spending $5 billion a month--\n$4 billion in Iraq and $1 billion in Afghanistan. If we are spending $5 \nbillion a month or $60 billion a year, it is unfathomable to me that we \nget a budget request from the President that says, ``I recommend \nnothing at this point because I will later on ask for an emergency \nappropriations.''\n  Late last week we heard perhaps more money will be needed than was \notherwise expected and that Congress would be asked to appropriate this \non an emergency basis.\n  It is clear to me we will do whatever is necessary to protect the \nsafety of the troops we have sent to Iraq. There is no question but \nthat when we ask American men and women in uniform to fight for this \ncountry and to defend this country's interest and then to send them \noverseas, there is no question we have an obligation to protect them \nand provide for their safety. If they need more equipment, if we need \nto spend more money to provide for their safety, this Congress, in my \njudgment, is going to do that.\n\n  Let me make a point about all of this. In addition to providing the \nsupplemental emergency funding that was necessary for the Pentagon some \nmonths ago--almost 6 months ago now--we also were requested by the \nPresident to appropriate $20.3 billion for reconstructing Iraq.\n  I offered an amendment in the Senate to strike that spending. It was \nthe largest proposed spending cut for this fiscal year that was offered \nin the Congress. The single largest spending cut that was offered last \nyear is one I offered on the floor of the Senate to strike the $20.3 \nbillion for reconstructing Iraq.\n  I came up short. I had over 40 votes for the amendment, but, \nnonetheless, it did not prevail. I want to explain why I did that and \nwhy it has relevance today.\n  I proposed striking that funding for a very simple reason: We did not \ntarget Iraq's infrastructure. When we decided to displace Saddam \nHussein and send American troops to Iraq, we did not\n\n[[Page S4343]]\n\ntarget their roads, bridges, dams, or electric grid. That is not what \nwe targeted. We did not try to bomb Iraq in a way that destroyed their \ninfrastructure.\n  It is my judgment the American taxpayers should not be required to \nrebuild the Iraq infrastructure. Iraq has the second largest reserves \nof oil in the world, next only to Saudi Arabia. In fact, one of the \ntroops who came back from Iraq with the National Guard unit from North \nDakota told me one day he was standing in an area in Iraq, in some \nsandy area, and the bottom of his boots became black with oil.\n  There is a great deal of oil in the country of Iraq. I believe, based \non Ambassador Bremer's testimony of how much oil they would be pumping \nthis year and next year, that when they get to 3 million barrels of oil \na day, which is something they will reach very soon, they will have $16 \nbillion of net export value of oil in Iraq--$16 billion a year. That is \n$160 billion of net export value of oil in 10 years. That is above and \nbeyond that which they need to use in Iraq.\n  It seems to me with respect to the reconstruction of Iraq, it makes a \ngreat deal of sense for a country with the second largest reserves of \noil in the world to be told the Iraq people ought to use Iraqi oil to \nreconstruct Iraq. It is not the job or the burden or the responsibility \nof the American people to reconstruct Iraq.\n  I lost that debate in the Senate and lost the vote. So now we have \njust under $20 billion available to reconstruct Iraq. There is a very \nthick booklet that describes the reconstruction of Iraq. There is a \njobs program for Iraq paid for by the American taxpayers. There is a \nhousing program for Iraq paid for by the American taxpayers. There is a \nhighway program for Iraq, a health care program for Iraq, a security \nprogram for Iraq, all paid for by American taxpayers. There is marsh \nrestoration and there is the creation of ZIP codes, all paid for by the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Since I lost that vote on the floor of the Senate and since nearly \n$20 billion was then appropriated for the reconstruction of Iraq, paid \nfor by the American taxpayers, I have watched the progress of that \nreconstruction and I noticed, for example, some of the things that were \nhappening in Iraq with respect to expenditures. I have been bothered \nabout it, but nonetheless I had my vote and I lost that vote.\n\n  Then last week, I learned we are short of money for the troops in \nIraq, and it is very likely an emergency supplemental request will need \nto be passed by the Congress and, indeed, we will pass it if it is \nnecessary to support the troops in Iraq. I checked and discovered at \nthe last count, somewhere close to $17 billion--$16-plus billion--\nremains unspent with respect to the reconstruction funds that were \nappropriated by the Congress for Iraq. It seems to me what we ought to \ndo is transfer that unexpended reconstruction funding and use it for \nthe benefit of the support of the American troops in Iraq.\n  If, in fact, we are short of money, if we are going to need to expend \nadditional emergency funds in Iraq, why not use the funds that are \nunspent at this point for the reconstruction of Iraq and, indeed, use \nthat for the support of the American troops in Iraq, and then engage \nthe Iraqi government--first of all the provisional government and, \nsecond, the government that takes effect on July 1--and have that \ngovernment securitize future production of Iraqi oil and raise their \nown funds to reconstruct this country. It is their job, not the job of \nthe American taxpayers, to have a program for housing, health care, \njobs, and highways in the country of Iraq. That ought not be the burden \nof the American taxpayer.\n  When we have a fiscal policy that is desperately out of balance and \nwe are borrowing money at a record pace--$530 billion this year alone--\nI think it is responsible for us to take a look at how we might ease \nthat burden and at least one small portion of that ought to be to \nrevisit this proposition of a reconstruction fund for Iraq. A \nsubstantial amount of that money is as yet unspent.\n  Incidentally, while I am on the subject, let me also say with respect \nto the military funding, we need to do a much better job with that \nexpenditure. I noticed, for example, the Halliburton Corporation--I \nheld a hearing on this subject in the Democratic Policy Committee a \ncouple of months ago--the Halliburton Corporation has had to now \nrestore funding for kickbacks they made for inappropriate expenditures.\n  Here is a company, for example, that was billing the U.S. Government, \nthe Defense Department--therefore, the U.S. taxpayers--they were \nbilling us for serving 42,000 meals a day. The problem was they were \nonly making 14,000 meals a day for the American troops. Somehow 28,000 \nmeals got lost. They were overbilling by 28,000 meals a day. I come \nfrom a small town of about 300 people. I can understand somebody \noverbilling for 10 meals, maybe 100 meals, but 28,000 meals a day? That \nis absurd.\n  That is the sort of thing that the American taxpayer reads about and \nis angry about, and should be because there is a substantial amount of \nmoney being wasted, yes, even in these defense contracts. That is \nsomething the American taxpayers expect better of with respect to the \nuse of their funds.\n  I want to come back to this central point. I think it is time we \nrevisit this question of reconstruction funds for Iraq. I suggest we do \nthat by deciding that which is yet unspent be used to support the \nAmerican troops because we are told there is not sufficient money to do \nthat at this point, and I believe, because it is not the American \ntaxpayers' burden to reconstruct Iraq but it is the American taxpayers' \nburden to support troops who we have asked to go in harm's way on our \nbehalf, that this would represent a positive step and would also help \nwith fiscal policy that now is creating the largest deficits in \nhistory.\n  We will be on the subject of the Internet tax issue soon, and I will \nhave more to say on that subject later, but in the meantime I yield the \nfloor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole).

BROOKS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, South Dakotans have a proud tradition \nof military service and volunteerism. Today, in Iraq, a new generation \nis carrying that tradition forward. South Dakota's percentage of its \ncitizens serving in active duty in Iraq is among the highest in the \nNation.\n  The spirit of service and volunteerism runs throughout South Dakota's \ntowns and neighborhoods, and young children grow up learning that they \nhave an obligation to one another, to their communities, and to their \ncountry. The families of South Dakota look upon the service of our \nyoung men and women with great pride, because they are carrying the \nvalues of South Dakota across the world and bringing freedom to the \npeople around the world and the people of Iraq.\n  Alongside our pride for our soldiers' service comes an awareness of \nthe cost. As our soldiers shoulder much of the burden of battle, so, \ntoo, must our communities shoulder a greater burden of grief.\n  We were reminded of this yet again this past week.\n  On April 19, SGT Keith O'Donnell, a native of McIntosh, SD, and a \nmember of the 141st Engineer Combat Battalion in the North Dakota \nNational Guard, was injured when an explosive device detonated during \nhis patrol.\n  South Dakota this week also mourns the death of Staff Sgt. Cory \nBrooks, from Philip, SD. SGT Brooks was a Combat Engineer in the 153rd \nEngineer Battalion. SGT Brooks' death comes just 1 week after the death \nof another member of the 153rd, Specialist Dennis Morgan, from Winner, \nSD.\n  Cory Brooks was typical of South Dakota's youth. He grew up playing \nbackyard wiffle ball in the summertime and football in the fall. He was \na loving son, a good student, and a caring friend.\n  Ray Rhodes, the father of Cory's closest friend and one of Cory's \nhigh school football coaches said, ``He was just like family. He was \none of those kids you love to work with. He was\n\n[[Page S4344]]\n\nvery happy-go-lucky.'' Cory's friend, Ray Coyle, remembered him for his \nsense of fun and his friendship. ``He was a very loyal friend. I could \ncount on him for whatever,'' he said. ``We shared a lot of laughs. Cory \nwas up for anything to have fun.''\n  Perhaps what made Cory most typical of South Dakota's children was \nhis eagerness to serve his country. He joined the National Guard after \nhigh school, in 1989, and served continually for the past 15 years. His \nbattalion was deployed in February. Staff SGT Brooks and his comrades \nwere stationed at Forward Operating Base Chosin, south of Baghdad. They \nwere engaged in the difficult and dangerous work of defusing roadside \nbombs and other explosives. It was the kind of service the friends of \nSgt. Brooks would have expected from him: He put himself at greater \nrisk in order to make things safer for those around him.\n  Forty years ago, President Kennedy noted that no nation ``in the \nhistory of the world has buried its soldiers farther from its native \nsoil than we Americans or closer to the towns in which they grew up.'' \nCory Brooks learned the values of service growing up in South Dakota. \nAnd it is the measure of those values that he and so many other \nchildren of my State have volunteered to put their lives at risk to \nbring freedom and security to people all across the world.\n  Cory Brooks, like those who preceded him in Iraq, was a hero in the \ntruest sense. His Nation mourns his loss and offers his parents, Darral \nand Marilyn Brooks, its prayers, its condolences, and its gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4344-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4344-S4345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY McGRORY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, today is the funeral of another \nAmerican. This American fought for 50 years, in her own inimitable way, \nto defend the ideals of our democracy.\n  Mary McGrory was the most elegant political writer I have ever known, \nand one of the bravest. She loved many things in life: a well-told \ntale, a good joke, good books, good dogs, orphans, lazy August days in \nItaly, time with her family in Boston, and almost everything about her \nIrish-American heritage. Most of all, Mary McGrory loved politics and \nnewspapering. I sometimes thought she had newspaper ink in her veins. \nShe never tired of asking questions, chasing stories or writing truth.\n  I can't count the number of times that I have held press briefings in \nthe hallway just off this floor, surrounded by two or three dozen \nreporters, all jostling for position. And there, among them, was Mary, \nreporter's notebook in hand. She was 40, 50 years older than some of \nthe other reporters, but there she was, in the thick of it. She didn't \nneed to be there. She could have asked a colleague to pose her question \nfor her and relay the answer to her. But that was not the way of Mary \nMcGrory. She had an extraordinary eye for the telling detail. She \nwanted to see and hear things herself, and form her own judgments. \nPresident Nixon put her on his enemies list, but many of us adored her.\n  In the last year, a stroke robbed Mary of her legendary ability to \nfind just the right word. But she remained a passionate observer of \npolitics and of life. Many of us hoped that she might regain her \nmastery of words and resume writing. If anyone could conquer the \nravages of a stroke, Mary seemed like a likely candidate. But Mary will \nlive through her words. She was an American treasure.\n  Many times this past year, I have missed Mary's wise voice. I am sure \nI will miss her often in the future, too. These are hard times for our \nNation. We could use Mary's insight, her passionate commitment to peace \nand her fierce belief in democracy. Fortunately, Mary has left us more \nthan a half-century of extraordinary work--work for which she won a \nPulitzer Prize and the respect of untold millions. There is more than \nenough beauty, wit and wisdom in her words to last a lifetime.\n  I am honored to have known Mary McGrory. My thoughts and prayers are \nwith her family and her many, many friends. We have lost a legend.\n  Mary's cousin, Brian McGrory, is a columnist for the Boston Globe. \nLast November, he wrote a column for the Washington Post about what he \ncalled ``the amazing journey that is Mary McGrory's life'' and ``one of \nthe most important, colorful and enduring newspaper careers that the \nAmerican public has had the pleasure to experience.'' The headline on \nthe column was ``The Best I'll Ever Know.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that his column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 11, 2003]\n\n                        The Best I'll Ever Know\n\n                           (By Brian McGrory)\n\n       Today, I ask your indulgence. I'm about to commit the \n     boorish act of bragging about a relative, and I'm hoping \n     you'll understand why.\n       Mary McGrory is my cousin. Merely typing those words fills \n     me with pride. For the unknowing, she's a Post columnist, a \n     lion of the left, winner of the Pulitzer Prize.\n       Born in Roslindale and educated in Boston, she has written \n     about the world's most significant events for nearly 50 \n     years. People still quote her words from the Kennedy \n     assassinations. She landed prominently on President Nixon's \n     enemies list. The elder George Bush once lamented in his \n     private journal, ``She has destroyed me over and over \n     again.''\n       I raise these points because in the amazing journey that is \n     Mary McGrory's life, this has been a bittersweet week. \n     Wednesday in New York she received the John Chancellor Award \n     for Excellence in Journalism, but a sad reality came clear \n     amid the laudatory words and the applause.\n       Mary fell ill in March, and eight months later she has yet \n     to fully recover. Barring a breakthrough, she has probably \n     written the last of her syndicated columns, ending one of the \n     most important, colorful and enduring newspaper careers that \n     the American public has had the pleasure to experience.\n       While most Washington pundits closet themselves with their \n     own profound thoughts, interrupted only by lunch at the Palm \n     with the secretary of Something, Mary employs old-fashioned \n     tools: a sensible pair of shoes, a Bic and a notebook. She \n     haunts congressional hearings. She sits with the unwashed in \n     the back of the White House briefing room.\n       And after finding her perpetually lost keys and remembering \n     where she parked, she rushes back to The Post to create \n     elegantly understated prose, on point and on deadline.\n       Times have changed in the news business, but Mary never \n     has. Technology baffles her, and I'm not talking about Palm \n     Pilots and Blackberries. I mean the answering machine and the \n     computer. I've received countless voice mails from her that \n     proceed: ``Hello?'' Pause. ``Cousin?'' Pause. ``Click.'' In a \n     rant against Toshiba, she once wrote, ``I came along in an \n     era when the transmission of one's copy did not require an \n     advanced degree from MIT,'' adding of the old days, ``all I \n     had to carry was my portable typewriter, and I never really \n     carried that.''\n       Indeed, from the very beginning, she mastered the role of \n     the helpless naif. On her many campaign trips, if her \n     colleagues aren't carrying her jumble of bags, then the \n     candidate probably is. No one is exempt; to her, I'm more \n     porter than reporter.\n       But that's just part of the deal. The reward is an \n     invitation to Sunday supper. Members of Congress from both \n     parties, diplomats, newshounds and activists gather regularly \n     to dine on her lasagna and sing Irish songs. Newcomers are \n     first sent to work in her garden; George Stephanopoulos might \n     still be fertilizing her impatiens but for Bill Clinton's \n     victory in 1992.\n       Her one true love was the Washington Star--``just a \n     wonderful, kind, welcoming, funny place, full of eccentrics \n     and desperate people,'' she once told an interviewer. Star \n     editor Newby Noyes plucked her from the anonymity of the book \n     section in 1954 to cover the Army-McCarthy hearings with the \n     advice, ``Write it like a letter to your favorite aunt.''\n       When the Star closed in 1981, she went to the more formal \n     newsroom of The Post, where she liked to remind people of the \n     fun they didn't have. Still, its staff and owners have poured \n     out their hearts to her since she fell ill, with a generosity \n     like a throwback to another time.\n       Hers is a world of soft irony. She checks into elaborate \n     spas in Italy every year, but while there always gains a few \n     pounds. She was audited during the Nixon administration and \n     got a refund. At a stiff Washington party, she once whispered \n     to me, ``Always approach the shrimp bowl like you own it.''\n       Blood aside, in my chosen field, she's the best I'll ever \n     know, and that's the joy and the sadness of it all.\n\n\n[[Page S4345]]\n\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I would like to address my remarks \nfor the next few minutes on the discussion that we have been having for \nthe last 6 months in this body on the question of how to deal with the \nphenomenon of high-speed Internet access. It is the fastest growing new \ntechnology in America, according to a New York Times article last week. \nWe have some differences of opinion about how to proceed in terms of \nthe taxation and regulation of this phenomenon, not only what it should \nbe but whether the Federal Government, the State government, or local \ngovernment should do it.\n  The leader has asked all of us who have different opinions to work \ntogether. We have tried that. We have worked hard. Senator McCain, \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, has been especially involved. I am \ngrateful to him for that. Senator Allen and Senator Wyden, who have \nprincipled positions on this discussion, have worked hard to try to \ncompromise on the issues, as have I and my colleagues, but we simply \nhave a difference of opinion.\n  Now, today, we begin debating a motion to proceed and to move down a \ntrack in the Senate that, I believe, is the wrong track. I welcome this \nopportunity and I thank the leader for giving us a chance to have a \nfull debate, which we will be having this week. I am confident that by \nthe time we are finished the Senators who have had a chance to spend \nmore time on this, and that the citizens of the country who have had a \nchance to understand more clearly what we are talking about, and the \nState and local officials who will see exactly what we are doing which \nmight affect the future of State and local governments in America will \nsuddenly say there is a little more to this than meets the eye and that \nwe will come to a good conclusion.\n  I believe it was President Harry Truman who had on his desk a sign \nthat said, ``The buck stops here.'' What we are about to do today and \nlater this week with the consideration of S. 150 is to begin a series \nof votes about passing the buck. I looked on the Truman Presidential \nlibrary Web site to see why Harry Truman, who was noted for plain \nspeaking, liked the phrase ``The buck stops here.'' Here is what the \nTruman Web site says:\n\n       The saying ``the buck stops here'' derives from the slang \n     expression ``pass the buck'' which means passing the \n     responsibility on to someone else. The latter expression is \n     said to have originated with the game of poker, in which a \n     marker or a counter, frequently in frontier days a knife with \n     a buckhorn handle, was used to indicate the person whose turn \n     it was to deal. If the player wishes to deal, he could pass \n     the responsibility by passing the buck, as the counter \n     came to be called, on to the next player.\n\n  That would be my text today, if I were preaching a sermon, because we \nare about to vote about passing the buck. By passing the buck, if we \nwere to do this, we would create permanent confusion about how to \nregulate and tax the fastest growing new technology in America--high-\nspeed Internet access. We would create a permanent tax loophole for the \nhigh-speed Internet access industry and the telecommunications \nindustry, and the high-speed Internet access industry, so far as I can \ntell, must already be the most heavily subsidized in America by \nFederal, State, and local laws. We would be voting for higher taxes, \nnot lower taxes, because if you order taxes to be lowered on \ntelecommunications or high-speed Internet access, you are raising taxes \non local property taxes or local sales taxes on food or local \ncorporation taxes on manufacturing companies that might be struggling \nto keep from moving their jobs overseas.\n  It is a big trick to say this is a bill that lowers taxes. It does \ncreate a tax loophole for one industry. But what cost does that mean? \nThat just means everybody else pays higher taxes.\n  Aren't a lot of people going to be surprised if this should be \nenacted and suddenly they find their mayor and their Governor raising \nlocal property taxes, raising local sales taxes on food and imposing a \ncar tax again? That is what happens. You lower this tax and you raise \nthat tax.\n  Then the worst thing to me as a former Governor--and there are many \nin this body who have been Governors, who have been State tax \ncommissioners, who have been mayors, who have been State treasurers, \nwho have been local officials--the worst thing to me is we are breaking \nour promise about doing no harm to State and local governments, \nparticularly on my side of the aisle, the Republican side of the aisle.\n  We were elected promising to do no harm to State and local \ngovernments. I will be talking a lot about that this week because I \nbelieve in that. I heard it. It wasn't just from me.\n  In 1994, the Republican revolution began to occur. In 1995 and 1996, \nwe had Presidential elections. When the Republican Party gained control \nof Congress in 1995, the first thing it did in this body was pass S. 1.\n  The Presiding Officer very well knows the distinguished Senator who \nwas the majority leader at that time. His name was Senator Bob Dole of \nKansas. He carried around in his pocket the tenth amendment. He said S. \n1 means no more unfunded mandates.\n  If we vote to put into motion S. 150 and the companion measure that \npassed the House, we will be imposing a massive unfunded mandate on \nState and local governments. We will be breaking our promise.\n  It is rare that the Senate has had an opportunity to do so much harm \nwith one vote. It is very difficult to find a situation where you can \ncast one vote and create permanent confusion about the fastest growing \ntechnology and a permanent tax loophole for the most subsidized \ntechnology I can find. With that one vote, you could also impose higher \ntaxes, local property taxes, car taxes, taxes on food, and sales taxes, \nand break your promise to State and local governments to do no harm.\n  There is a better way to go about this. I believe that I and my \ncolleagues have suggested that. Senator Carper and I and a group of \nnine other Senators of both parties have said: Wait a minute. Let us do \nthis a different way. There is a way we can vote to ban new taxes on \nInternet access for 2 years. We can provide the Senate time to consider \nwhat to do about this phenomenon of high-speed Internet access growth, \nand we can keep our promise to State and local governments.\n  Rarely has there been a chance to do so much good with one vote, and \nthat would be to pass the Alexander-Carper compromise, or take the \noriginal moratorium of 1998 and enact it for 2 more years. That would \nbe a vote for no taxes, it would be a vote for no unfunded mandates, \nand it would be a vote for time to study it. That would be the wise and \nprudent course. That will be the argument we will be making today.\n  Today, we begin a series of procedural motions--that is the way the \nSenate works--designed to give us a full opportunity to consider and \ndiscuss these issues.\n\n[[Page S4346]]\n\n  Senators Allen and Wyden have offered S. 150 which will be coming up \nthis afternoon. I am under no illusions about the fact we will be \ngetting to it even though I think it is moving us in the wrong \ndirection and along the wrong track. Senator Carper and I, and nine \nothers, have offered the compromise I just suggested. I believe that \nwould be the best way to go--a 2-year extension of the current ban on \nState and local taxing of international access. We did it in 1998. \nCongress did it in 2000. Congress can do it again in 2004.\n  By voting to extend the original moratorium on taxation for 2 more \nyears, Members of Congress will be casting a vote against taxing \nInternet access--casting a vote for allowing time to consider what the \nbest long-term solution is and casting a vote for doing no harm to \nState and local governments. I believe, if the House were to agree with \nus, we could get the legislative action we desire in this session.\n  I am prepared to move ahead, as I have been all year, and I have \nsuggested for 2 years ways we could move ahead. I am for banning \ntaxation for the next 2 years. I am willing to support that. I am for \nno unfunded mandates and I am for time to study. Prospects for \nlegislative action might have been different this year, if the House of \nRepresentatives had sent to the Senate a different piece of legislation \nto begin with instead of sending legislation to extend the current \nmoratorium.\n  Moratorium means a temporary timeout. That was the idea in 1998. \nEverybody said we have this new thing, the Internet. In 1998, when the \nmoratorium was passed, I would wager that almost no one in the Congress \nhad ever heard of high-speed Internet access. The only kind of Internet \naccess we were using was AOL which hooks up to your dial telephone. But \nwe said--and I agreed with this and I supported this--that we don't \nreally understand what this is. This is new. Let us just put in a \ntemporary timeout. Then we will decide what to do. The assumption, in \nmy mind at least, was that as the Internet industry grew and became \nmature, it would pay the same taxes as everyone else. We don't say the \nSenator from North Carolina and the Senator from Tennessee will pay \ntaxes which the Senator from Wyoming will not pay. We have to have an \nawfully good reason for that. We believe in the fair and equitable \ndistribution of taxes.\n  We are talking about whether the Internet industry should pay the \nsame sales taxes and the same kind of business taxes that everybody \nelse is paying or whether we should lower their taxes permanently and \ncreate a great big loophole for them, subsidize them some more, and \nthen have higher taxes for everybody else.\n  The House didn't send us another temporary timeout which would have \nbeen the third on State and local taxation of Internet access. The \nHouse sent over a permanent ban. But it was more than that. Instead of \nbanning State and local taxation of Internet access--which would mean \nmy relationship to the Internet service provider, the same as my \nrelationship to a telephone company or a cable company or a satellite \nTV company--they broadened the definition of Internet access.\n\n  Whether intentionally or unintentionally, this train got on the wrong \ntrack, running completely out of control. Maybe it was because this is \na very complex subject, we have a lot going on here, and not many \npeople were paying close attention, but it got out of control.\n  Basically, what started out as a modest benefit to consumers, a \ntemporary timeout while we could see what was happening, the House \nturned it into a permanent big tax loophole for the Internet access \nindustry, the telecommunications industry. Then, on top of that, they \nturn around and send the bill to State and local governments. We do not \ndo that much. We debate taxes all the time. We reduce taxes. Sometimes \nthey go up, but we do it ourselves. I did not know you could do this.\n  I ran for the Senate the same year as the Presiding Officer the \nSenator from North Carolina. If I knew the Senate could do this, I \nmight have run for the Senate promising to make a Federal law \nabolishing local property taxes as my way of encouraging home \nownership, or I might have run for the Senate promising to pass a \nFederal law to abolish State car taxes as a way of encouraging \ntransportation to work, or I might have run for the Senate promising to \npass a Federal law abolishing State taxes on food because there are a \nlot of hungry people. But that would have been a trick on the voters. \nThe voters would have caught up with me and said, Wait a minute, Lamar, \nwho are you trying to fool? You cut our sales taxes, and now we will \nhave an income tax in Tennessee. Because if sales taxes go down, this \nmust go up.\n  I suppose one could say we will close a few schools, raise tuition, \nand cut the cost of Government. But it means lower taxes for one group \nof taxpayers and it means higher taxes for another. That is what we \nhave over here.\n  Sometimes it has been said these figures that have been used are not \naccurate, so I have some detailed information for the Congressional \nRecord. For example, the bill sent to the Senate from the House of \nRepresentatives in the name of a simple, permanent ban on the little \nconnection we make to the Internet access would do this: One, it would \nput at risk $10 billion collected annually in telephone transaction \ntaxes in the State and local governments. State and local governments \ncollect more than $10 billion annually in taxes on telephones. If we \ntell them they cannot do that, what do they do? Senator Feinstein has \nsaid, and I am sure she will say later this week, she has 125 cities \nand counties in California that say this might interrupt 5 to 10 \npercent of their local budgets. We cut one tax and they raise the \nproperty tax. That is not what we are supposed to do. We promised not \nto do that in 1995.\n  There are 62 Senators serving here today who in 1995 voted to pass \nthe Unfunded Mandates Act which said no money, no mandate. If we break \nour promise, throw us out. I want to keep the promise.\n  The first problem with the House bill is $10 billion in telephone \ntaxes. The second problem is $7 billion annually in business taxes \ncurrently collected. I have a source from each one of these. The first \nis the Congressional Budget Office. The source for the $7 billion is in \nthe Multistate Tax Commission memoranda and a letter from the \nCongressional Budget Office. The third unfunded mandate in the House \nbill, half a billion annually in business taxes currently collected on \nthe Internet backbone. We will hear more about that this week. The \nbackbone is the infrastructure of the Internet. The same kind of \nbusiness taxes on the backbone is like business taxes on any other \nbusiness. Nobody likes to pay taxes, but are we going to exempt them \nand make everybody else pay? Four, cost to State and local governments \nwas $80 to $120 million. On grandfathered States--that means 11 States \nwere permitted after the 1998 temporary timeout moratorium; there are \nabout 16 States already taxing dial-up Internet service so they are \npermitted to keep doing that--that is $80 to $120 million out the \nwindow, and another $40 to $75 million in 27 States where they are \ntaxing the part of the Internet access provided by the telephone \ncompanies, DSL.\n\n  Finally, the language of H.R. 49, the bill that came over from the \nHouse, would hurt universal service fund fees and September 11 service \nfees. That is very important in Alaska, rural North Carolina, and \nTennessee. If there is less money in the fund, there is less money for \nSeptember 11 and universal service.\n  This bill came to the Senate like a freight train. Nobody voted \nagainst it. It passed by consent order. What did it do? It came over \nwearing a dress that said, ``I am Ms. Internet Access Tax Ban.'' But it \nactually was $10 billion in telephone taxes, $7 billion more in \nbusiness taxes, half a billion in business taxes, sales taxes of a \ncouple hundred million a year, universal service fund fees, September \n11 fees, all of that which is the responsibility of State and local \ngovernments. We say, here, you cannot collect. That is an unfunded \nFederal mandate of the worst sort.\n  Now after some discussion, the bill has gotten a little better. \nSenator Allard, to his great credit, has worked hard. There may be no \nbetter-humored Member of the Senate.\n  He and I joined in a debate at the Heritage Foundation on a minority \nof principle. We had a good debate and discussed the issues. He \nimproved the bill some. There are fewer unfunded mandates.\n  I will be asking unanimous consent at the end of my speech to have \nprinted\n\n[[Page S4347]]\n\nin the Congressional Record the unfunded Federal mandates in his bill, \nS. 150. Still, as far as I know, his bill threatens $3 to $10 billion \nin telephone taxes currently collected. He and I have said to each \nother we do not intend to do that. However, that was several weeks ago \nand we have been working hard to write language we agreed on that \nexpressed our mutual intention. We have failed so far.\n  No. 2, his legislation continues to say to State and local \ngovernments, you cannot collect half a billion a year in business taxes \nthat are currently collected on the Internet backbone.\n  No. 3, his legislation would phase out the sales taxes State and \nlocal governments are currently collecting on Internet access. So S. \n150 continues down the wrong track. It continues to provide a big \nsubsidy to the fastest growing technology already heavily subsidized.\n  How much does it cost the Federal taxpayer? Not a penny. Not a penny. \nWe will send the bill to Governors and mayors and local governments and \nlet them raise property taxes, let them raise sales taxes on food, let \nthem worry with all the other unfunded mandates and add this right on \ntop of it. That is what we are doing. We are passing the buck.\n  I ask unanimous consent at the end of my remarks I be allowed to have \nprinted in the Record the unfunded Federal mandates on H.R. 49 first, \nand unfunded Federal mandates on S. 150 next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, there is no doubt this is an unfunded \nFederal mandate. We can talk about that more this week. Some of my \ncolleagues on my side have come up and said that does not sound like an \nunfunded mandate. I thought an unfunded mandate was when we told you \nyou had to do something and pay for it. But if I tell you you have to \nstop doing something, that you cannot collect that tax, that is a cost \nI have imposed on you. If I and the Congress say to Governor Alexander, \nin Tennessee, ``Stop collecting property taxes, stop collecting sales \ntaxes,'' then I have to go think of some other tax--lower taxes here; \nhigher taxes there. Nothing makes local officials madder than some \nMember of the U.S. Senate or Congress to come up here and have some big \nidea and pass a law, and take credit for it--lower taxes on the \nInternet--and then send the bill home to them and then that same Member \nof Congress or Senator is usually down to the district the next weekend \nmaking a big speech about local control. Nothing gets the blood up in a \nSenator or Governor or mayor or county commissioner more than that, and \nthat is exactly what we are doing.\n\n  If the Congress wants to create a big, additional tax break for high-\nspeed Internet access, then Congress should pay for it and not send the \nbill to State and local governments. I think we, as Members of \nCongress, ought to do as Paul Harvey says, and tell the rest of the \nstory: If we lower your taxes on Internet access, we are going to raise \nyour property taxes or your car taxes. Sure as the world, it is going \nto be our responsibility. We can call this the Raising the Local \nProperty Tax Act of 2004 or the Car Tag Act of 2004 or the Sales Tax on \nFood Act of 2004 or the Raise the Corporate Tax on Manufacturing and \nSend the Jobs to China Act of 2004. That is what we will be doing.\n  One of the other issues I hope we talk about this week is whether \nthere needs to be an additional Government subsidy for high-speed \nInternet access on top of the billions already provided by Federal, \nState, and local governments.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, there is already at \nleast $4 billion in Federal tax subsidies to encourage the use of high-\nspeed Internet access. I have a report from the Alliance for Public \nTechnology. I will not inflict its length on the Congressional Record \ntoday, but it is filled with State and local programs to encourage the \ngrowth of high-speed Internet access--dozens and dozens of State and \nlocal subsidies, in addition to the Federal subsidy to encourage the \nspread of high-speed Internet access.\n  Why is there a need for more subsidy at all when the New York Times \nreported, last week, that high-speed Internet access is the fastest \ngrowing new technology in America? It is growing at an astonishing \nrate. According to a Congressional Budget Office report in February, \nthe United States has the highest number of broadband subscribers--\n``broadband'' is another name for high-speed Internet access--at 19.8 \nmillion. It is probably a lot higher today.\n  An April 19 story from the Associated Press tells us that a new study \nby the Pew Internet and American Life Project has found that almost \none-quarter of all Americans--more than 48 million people--have high-\nspeed Internet access at home. This is two out of every five Web users \nwho have it at home. The same study showed that more than half of \nAmericans have it at work. CBO told us, last December, that 88 percent \nof all ZIP codes have at least one high-speed subscriber, and 29 \npercent have access to more than five.\n  In September of 2002, the U.S. Department of Commerce told us \nconsumers are adopting broadband technologies at a faster pace than CD \nplayers, cell phones, color TVs, and VCRs during the same period in \ntheir development. CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, reported, in \nDecember of last year, that cellular phones took 6 years from their \nintroduction to reach 7.5 million subscribers; high-speed Internet \naccess reached 7.5 million subscribers in half that time.\n\n  Then, why do we need additional taxpayer subsidy? Why do we need to \nsay to these folks: You pay less taxes and the rest of us will pay \nmore? You can barley pick up a newspaper today without reading about \nsome new initiative from the private sector offering high-speed \nInternet access.\n  According to CBO, from 1996 to 2001, the four largest telephone \ncompanies increased their investment in broadband technologies by 64 \npercent. Cable companies increased their investment by 68 percent in \nthe same period.\n  Now, sometimes this discussion makes my head hurt because high-speed \nInternet access is a subject that is unfamiliar to most of us, and you \nalmost have to warm up in order to be able to talk about it and \nunderstand the complexities of what is going on. But, in effect, it is \nvery simple: It is just faster access to the Internet. It can be \nprovided in lots of different ways. Your cable company will sell it to \nyou. Your telephone company will sell it to you. There is a nice young \nwoman who comes on your direct satellite television and she will sell \nyou high-speed Internet access.\n  There is another way we might get it. There may be more. Things are \nchanging. But your electric company may sell it to you over electric \nwires. There is a lot of talk about how we need to create more and more \nsubsidy so we can reach more and more Americans, that we will have \npeople left out. Well, thanks to the expansion of the rural \nelectrification system in America during World War II, almost every \nAmerican has an electric wire somewhere near them. Electric companies \nhave begun to offer high-speed Internet access service.\n  Madam President, I have an article from the Washington Times of April \n5, 2004. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the \nRecord, in the proper sequence, following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. According to this article--and we will be talking \nabout this more this week--according to the Federal Communications \nOffice of Engineering and Technology, having another major player--the \npower companies--has helped to bridge the digital divide. The power \ncompanies have the infrastructure to make broadband available \nnationally.\n\n       There are a lot of utilities out there that really, really \n     want to do this, [says the head of another firm].\n       It is being offered today in Manassas, VA. The city of \n     Manassas offers high-speed Internet access through their \n     electric company for $26.95 a month.\n       Customers typically pay $30 to $40 a month for DSL service \n     and $40 to $50 a month for Internet access over cable.\n\n  If we are really talking about taxes on Internet access, we are only \ntalking about $1 to $3 a month, for most Americans, that they would \nsave if we Senators and our fellow Members of Congress go home and say: \nLook at us. We just banned State and local taxation of\n\n[[Page S4348]]\n\nInternet access. Well, that will save you $1 to $3 a month. That is not \nwhat they are doing, though. They are exempting a whole industry from \ntaxation that most industries pay. But for those who worry about \nwhether high-speed Internet access is going to be available to every \nsingle American, it will be available from your electric company soon.\n\n  Now, there is another phenomenon we should talk about in terms of \nwhether we need to have a subsidy. All this growth is happening, just \nas it should. We have a promarket economy. Traditionally, we do not \npick economic winners and losers. That is what they do in Japan. They \ndo it a lot more than we do. Our economy is stronger and better than \ntheirs because the Government does not do as good a job, we believe, at \npicking winners and losers as the free market does. That is, at least, \nwhat a great many of us over here on the Republican side traditionally \nsay, that we do not like industrial policy. We do not like picking and \nchoosing winners and losers.\n  So we asked the Congressional Budget Office, Congress did, last year, \nabout this. CBO reported to us, Congress:\n\n       [T]he broadband market is booming. . . . [N]othing in the \n     performance of the residential broadband market suggests that \n     federal subsidies for it will produce any economic gains.\n\n  Yet here we are, getting ready to spend a whole week sending billions \nof dollars more in subsidies to the high-speed Internet access market. \nWhy are we doing this? To even encourage broader use of it? Well, I am \nnot sure it will have that effect.\n  This is an example from the Atlanta Constitution Journal of September \nof a couple years ago. It is a little old, but it is good information.\n  In LaGrange, GA, they give away high-speed Internet access for free. \nSo we can ban taxation. We can keep Gwinnett County from imposing a \ndollar tax on your high-speed Internet access in Georgia, but we won't \nbe able to do that because they give it away for free. And what has \nhappened? Despite the fact they give it away for free, only half the \ncity has subscribed a year later. A lot of people didn't want it. This \nstory tells why.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article from the Atlanta Constitution be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It is an interesting article. It is like a lot of \nother things. Just because we in Washington think everybody in America \nought to have high-speed Internet access tomorrow doesn't mean they \nwill take it, even if we give it to them. So then why should we give \nthe telecommunications industry another big subsidy to offer high-speed \nInternet access to people who are already getting it free and won't \ntake it?\n  Finally, just in case Congress should, in its wisdom, decide to grant \nan additional subsidy to high-speed Internet access, the first thing we \nshould do is make sure Congress pays for it and doesn't send the bill \nto State and local governments. The House bill and the Allen-Wyden \nbill, S. 150, which this motion to proceed is about, expressly violate \nthe Budget Act which was amended in 1995 by the Republican majority, \nenthusiastically. And President Clinton signed it. Sixty-two Senators \nnow serving in this body voted for it, and 300 Republicans stood on the \nCapitol steps in late September, early October, right before the \nelection that produced the Contract with America and the first \nRepublican Congress in a long time, and this is what we said: Our \nparty, no money, no mandate. If we break our promise, throw us out.\n  This is about the Congress keeping its promise. I have a great many \nspeeches that say in words more effectively than I how important \navoiding an unfunded Federal mandate is. Most of them were made by \nMembers of this body. There will be an opportunity to hear those \nspeeches again this week because they were good in 1995, and they are \ngood in 2004.\n  There is one way to provide a further subsidy to encourage the use of \nhigh-speed Internet access, if we think it is necessary, that would \nmake a lot more sense than the various proposals that have been offered \nso far. That, interestingly, is the Texas plan. It was the plan \nauthored by our President, George W. Bush, when he was Governor of \nTexas. It is very simple. It is aimed at consumers, not big companies. \nIn 1999, Governor Bush signed a law exempting the Texas State sales tax \non Internet access up to the $25 the consumer paid each month. In other \nwords, there is no State tax in Texas on the first $25 you pay for \nInternet access.\n  We just heard that in Manassas, VA, it doesn't cost you more than $25 \nto get Internet access from your power company. So you don't pay any \ntax on Internet access in Texas. The Governor suggested to the Congress \nsome time ago that if Congress were bound and determined to give \nanother big subsidy to the telecommunications and high-speed Internet \naccess industry, do it this way. Use Governor Bush's idea; use the \nTexas plan. Then I would say we ought to figure out what it cost State \nand local governments and reimburse them for it.\n\n  It is ironic that last year we stood here and cried about the \ncondition of State and local governments and sent a $20 billion welfare \ncheck to the States. This year we are taking credit for lowering taxes \non Internet access $1 a month and sending the bill to State and local \ngovernments. I suggest if we really want to consider a Federal law that \naffects State and local taxation of Internet access over the long term, \nwe ought to look at President Bush's idea when he was Governor of \nTexas. Then I would argue it is up to us to decide what tax we are \ngoing to raise to pay the bill, or are we going to increase the deficit \nor are we going to cut services, because that is precisely what the \nmayors are going to have to do. That is what the Governors are going to \nhave to do, and the county commissioners are going to have to do.\n  If everybody would go home 1 week and ask, How would you like one \nmore unfunded mandate to deal with along with all the others, I think \nthey would get an earful. At least I do when I go home.\n  I look forward to this week. I hope this is the beginning of a \nconstructive debate. I hope the end result is that we reject the \nproposal we are moving to proceed on this afternoon. Those are \nproposals that would create permanent confusion in this complex area of \ntrying to deal with the growth of high-speed Internet access that would \ncreate an unwarranted additional tax loophole for one of the most \nheavily subsidized industries in America, the high-speed Internet \naccess industry; that would create higher taxes because when you order \ntaxes lowered on some people, they are going up on others; and that \nwould break a promise this Congress made to State and local governments \n9 years ago that we would do no harm, that we would not pass any more \nunfunded Federal mandates.\n  What we should be doing is what we are doing in other parts of the \nCongress and in the courts and in the Federal Communications \nCommission. The chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, has \nalready held a hearing about high-speed Internet access, its \nregulation, and its taxation, and tried to sort out what to do about it \nsince it was not envisioned by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The \nSenator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, has said several times that he thinks \nwe need to revisit the Telecommunications Act and do this in a \ncomprehensive way.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Michael \nPowell, has talked about the importance of digital migration, high-\nspeed Internet access. We will be able to carry to our homes movies, e-\nmail, all sorts of services. It is wonderful. But when it does that, it \nmay have the effect of wiping out 5, 10, 15 percent of the State and \nlocal tax base. We should think about that before we do that.\n  Among all of the principles we need to discuss, one of those is \nfederalism, the improper relationship of strong State and local \ngovernments to the Federal Government. We should not slam through like \na freight train a permanent tax loophole for this industry without \ncarefully considering the long-term consequences to State and local \ngovernments and the parks and the schools and the universities and the \nhealth care and other services they are expected to provide.\n  A vote for the legislation that came from the House and for S. 150 or \nanything like it is a vote for permanent\n\n[[Page S4349]]\n\nconfusion, a vote for unwarranted tax loopholes, a vote for higher \ntaxes, and a vote to break a promise.\n  A vote for the Alexander-Carper compromise is a vote to ban taxes for \nanother 2 years, to extend the moratorium, extend the temporary \ntimeout. It is a vote against taxes. It is a vote against unfunded \nmandates because it does no more harm to State and local governments. \nAnd it is a vote for a reasonable period of time, up to a couple of \nyears, for us to thoughtfully consider what to do.\n  Madam President, I am new to this body, but I have watched it for a \nlong time. I had my first opportunity to work in it when the Senator \nfrom North Carolina and I both came to Washington a few years ago. I \nhave great respect for the wisdom here and for the rules of this body. \nThey offer us a chance to deliberate a little longer than our friends \nin the House are able to, and sometimes that is important to do. I \nbelieve it is on this issue.\n  I am ready to move, ready to come to a conclusion. There are at least \na couple of ideas out there that will get a legislative result this \nweek if we would like to do it. But I am not ready to vote for \npermanent confusion, another big tax loophole, higher taxes, and I am \nnot ready to break our promise to State and local governments about \nunfunded mandates.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in sequence following my \nremarks the following articles:\n  One is a November 4, 2003, editorial from the Washington Post. The \nSenator from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, brought this to our attention at \nthat time, saying this Congress should step back from the brink \ntemporarily, extend the moratorium, and sort this all out in a way that \ndoesn't intrude on State prerogatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record an editorial from the Dallas Morning News. \n``Congress must get this right,'' it says in its last sentence, ``and a \n2-year moratorium with all new Internet access fees will give Congress \nenough time to sort through the issue.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 5.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter from Commissioner Loren Chumley from the \nDepartment of Revenue from the State of Tennessee. She points out \nTennessee is now not taxing, not imposing a sales tax on Internet \naccess because our State law doesn't permit it. In fact, the direction \nof things has been that States have repealed their taxes on Internet \naccess. States do things like that. But this points out in very clear \nterms how important it is for our State, which doesn't have an income \ntax--how important it is for us here not to try to tell them what taxes \nto collect and what services to provide. Again, I ask unanimous consent \nthat that be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 6.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Finally, there are two articles which are a little \nlong, but they are important. I know Senators and staff members will \nbring their attention to this subject, and we know we will be debating \nit for the next several days, and that truly we will be considering it \nfor the next couple of years as the Commerce Committee wades through \nall of the issues surrounding digital migration and, hopefully, come to \na comprehensive approach toward how we approach taxation and \nregulation--I hope minimal taxation and regulation, but appropriate \ntaxation and regulation of high-speed Internet access, and how we \ndivide that among the various governments. These are the best two \narticles I have found that help explain the history behind the Internet \naccess tax moratorium bill and the issue before us.\n  The first is by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, dated \nMarch 15, 2004, entitled `` The Alexander-Carper Internet Access Tax \nMoratorium Bill, S. 2084: a True Compromise That Substantially Broadens \nthe Original Moratorium.''\n  I point out that the leader asked us who are opposed to this to \ncompromise, and we have. The Alexander-Carper legislation is broader \nthan the original moratorium, and it levels the playing field so all \nproviders of high-speed Internet access are treated the same--at least \nso far as the Congress is concerned--on the last mile between the user \nof high-speed Internet access and the provider.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article's summary be printed in the \nRecord in sequence following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 7.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Finally, I want to offer another recent article by \nHarley Duncan and Matt Tomalis, from the Multistate Tax Commission, \nentitled ``The Forgotten First Sentence.''\n  The definition of Internet access is what is causing a lot of the \nproblem here. We hear a lot about that from the Senator from Ohio and \nthose on both sides of the issue. The problem is, the way the bill is \nwritten, it doesn't focus only on the consumer and provider of Internet \naccess, it goes way back up the line and bans the State and local \ngovernment from collecting taxes on the whole industry, and a whole \nvariety of services that are now part of the State and local tax. \nNobody wants to pay taxes on anything, but if we ban those taxes, we \nraise these taxes. This article helped us to clearly understand how the \ndefinition of Internet access is the problem here.\n  I see the Senator from Ohio, a former chairman of the National \nGovernors Association before he was a Senator. He can speak with \nauthority about what happened in 1994 and 1995 because he was a \nnational leader in the movement to persuade Congress to stop unfunded \nFederal mandates and to pass the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act, which \namended our Budget Act. He is a principled man and I am delighted to be \nworking with him on this issue and on others.\n  Again, I thank the leader for setting in motion the series of \nprocedural steps that will give us a chance to fully debate this issue \nthis week. I thank Senator Allen and Senator Wyden for their courtesies \nand patience as we worked on an issue we disagree about. I look forward \nto a full discussion and, I hope, a temporary 2-year timeout to give us \na chance to think about that which bans taxes for 2 more years, but \nkeeps our promise and does no harm to State and local governments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              Unfunded Federal Mandates Created by H.R. 49\n\n       1. $10 billion annually in telephone transactions taxes \n     currently collected--under H.R. 49, the telecommunications \n     industry could be exempted from the collection of state and \n     local taxes on gross receipts taxes, sales an use taxes, and \n     other telecommunications transactions taxes.

City \n     officials there began marketing the service in February.\n       Today, only about 300 U.S. consumers pay for high-speed \n     Internet access over power lines, but this new method of \n     delivering Web content could jolt the market for Internet \n     service.\n       Allentown, Pa., and Cincinnati are the only other U.S. \n     cities where residents are paying for the new high-speed \n     Internet service, but electric companies from North Carolina \n     to Hawaii are testing the service or plan to begin a pilot \n     project. Federal regulators hope broadband access over power \n     lines becomes widely available, especially in rural areas.\n       In Manassas, 60 homeowners and a handful of businesses have \n     Internet access through power lines. Another 1,200 homeowners \n     have asked to be hooked up. That's nearly 10 percent of the \n     city's 12,500 homes.\n       By the end of the year, broadband over power lines could be \n     available to all Manassas residents. It would be the first \n     U.S. city where the new technology is available to all \n     residents.\n       Internet access from power lines began to get attention \n     last year, when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) \n     promoted it as a way to offer high-speed Internet services \n     for people in rural areas. The FCC also saw broadband access \n     from power lines as an alternative to high-speed access from \n     phone, cable and satellite companies that could lower \n     consumer prices.\n       Since the power grid is ubiquitous, broadband over power \n     lines could be available to nearly every U.S. home.\n       ``Having another major player--the power companies--has to \n     help bridge the digital divide. The power companies have the \n     infrastructure to make broadband available nationally,'' said \n     Ed Thomas, chief of the FCC's Office of Engineering and \n     Technology.\n       The FCC in February proposed rules to govern broadband over \n     power lines. The rules aren't final, but a handful of cities, \n     utilities and technology companies are pushing forward.\n       Current Communications Group in Germantown, Md., is working \n     with Ohio utility Cinergy Corp. to market broadband service \n     over power lines in Cincinnati.\n       Current Communications also has a pilot project with Pepco \n     in Potomac to test the new Internet service.\n       ``There are a lot of utilities out there that really, \n     really want to do this,'' said Jay Birnbaum, vice president \n     of Current Communications, a privately held firm founded four \n     years ago.\n       Main.net Powerline Communications in Reston is working with \n     Manassas, which owns its electric plant, to deliver Internet \n     content over the power lines.\n       Main.net and Current Communications are two of the primary \n     companies in a small cluster of firms that market technology \n     to send Internet data over power lines and make the modems \n     that subscribers plug into wall sockets.\n       Experts long have known power lines could accommodate \n     Internet data. Electricity travels at a lower frequency than \n     an Internet signal, so the two can share a power line.\n       Public works department employees in Manassas hook up new \n     Internet subscribers nearly every day.\n       ``They're beating down our doors,'' said John Hewa, \n     assistant director of the city's electric utility.\n       That's because few people there have high-speed Internet \n     access, Mr. Hewa said.\n       ``A lot of people are telling us they can't get high-speed \n     services where they live. There are a lot of areas where it's \n     not available, and they're using dial-up service,'' he said.\n       The FCC found in June 2003 that there were no high-speed \n     Internet subscribers in 9 percent of U.S. zip codes, where \n     about 1 percent of residents live. In another 16 percent of \n     U.S. zip codes, there was just one broadband provider.\n       The American Public Power Association, which represents \n     utilities, says 75 percent of its members serve communities \n     with fewer than 10,000 people, many of whom don't have high-\n     speed Internet access.\n       About 24 million people subscribe to broadband service, \n     according to Washington research firm Precursor Group.\n       But spokesmen for Verizon Communications Corp. and Comcast \n     Corp. both say they are equipped to deliver high-speed \n     service in Manassas.\n       The new broadband service in Manassas also might be popular \n     because the city charges $26.95 a month, less than digital \n     subscriber lines (DSL) or cable Internet providers. Current \n     Communications charges a basic rate of $29.95 a month in \n     Cincinnati. Customers typically pay $30 to $40 a month for \n     DSL service and $40 to $50 a month for Internet access over \n     cable.\n       Although the FCC is hopeful that broadband over power lines \n     helps lower prices and provides access to underserved areas, \n     Precursor Group analyst Pat Brogan isn't so sure the service \n     will take off because DSL and cable Internet services have \n     been around for years. Broadband over power lines simply \n     might be too late to catch up, he said.\n       But electric companies want to make money off their power \n     lines, and consumers who have been relegated to using low-\n     speed dial-up services are interested in subscribing to \n     broadband access over power lines, said Joseph Marsilii, \n     president and chief executive of Main.net.\n       ``I firmly believe there is a huge market for this,'' he \n     said. ``I think we're on the cusp.''\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Sept. 2, 2004]\n\n A Georgia City Decided To Provide Its Residents With; A Year of Free \nInternet Access. But Only Half Have Signed on. Why LaGrange Isn't More \n                               ``Wired''\n\n                        (By Ernest Holsendolph)\n\n       LaGrange.--A delegation of 11 Japanese legislators came \n     calling on the city of LaGrange recently to learn more about \n     its efforts to connect every household in the city to the \n     Internet free of charge for a year.\n       The assemblymen for Gunma Prefecture were here ``to \n     understand the community strategy,'' said Kazuo Aikyama, \n     chairman of the delegation.\n       They aren't the first to come on such a quest.\n       A well-worn path to city hall on Ridley Street has seen \n     similar delegations from England, Canada and Bulgaria as well \n     as curious groups from cities and towns in the United States.\n       At the urging of City Manager Tom Hall and others, LaGrange \n     set out to provide easy access for residents to create a \n     ``wired'' community able to interact with one another--and do \n     business more easily with City Hall, agencies and other \n     stopping points.\n       They would do it by connecting the homes, for free at \n     first, hopefully showing people how valuable the service was \n     and later get them to pay for subscriptions.\n       However, Dave McGee, a LaGrange native who is a glass \n     worker, was unaware of the program. ``I have heard things \n     about this Internet, but I don't know anything about it,'' \n     said McGee, 47, as he walked along a side street off \n     Lafayette Square.\n       And Mable Abercrombie, who gave her age discreetly as \n     ``over 65,'' said she had heard of the LaGrange project but \n     was keeping her distance from it.\n       ``I am too busy in my garden; need to spend more time \n     there,'' she said over the counter of the Merle Norman \n     cosmetics display where she works.\n       McGee is an African-American, Abercrombie a senior citizen. \n     Each represents a group that has been a special challenge to \n     LaGrange's effort to bring all its residents online.\n       ``We expected that with the service offered free of charge, \n     we would have big interest in communities where people had \n     been unable to afford Internet service,'' said Joe Maltese, \n     economic development director.\n       Instead, he said, there was an overall acceptance of nearly \n     50 percent--with no high interest in the southern city \n     communities where the black population is heaviest.\n       Interestingly, LaGrange recently was named one of the top \n     seven ``intelligent'' communities in the world by the \n     prestigious World Teleport Association.\n       In addition, LaGrange, about 65 miles southwest of downtown \n     Atlanta, has been cited as ``Intelligent City of the Year'' \n     by the\n\n[[Page S4351]]\n\n     association. And so, while gaining recognition for its \n     technological push, the distinction seems lost on a major \n     share of its 26,000 citizens.\n       Partly to keep plugging away with residents who remain \n     unexcited, city officials decided two weeks ago to extend the \n     free offer for another year.\n       ``We have worked hard to make service relevant to people's \n     lives,'' said Hall, 40, the city manager of LaGrange since \n     1994.\n       Under Hall and Maltese, the city has pushed to get interest \n     and response, working with school officials and holding \n     rallies in public housing communities with U.S. Sen. Max \n     Cleland (D-Ga.) as a speaker. They also have advertised in \n     papers and on television and have mailed letters directly to \n     residences.\n       Subscribers can get the service either through cable modems \n     and personal computers, or they can access it via television \n     through the black set-top box.\n       Residents can use wireless keyboards, as with WebTV, to \n     connect to the Internet, or to special city networks where \n     they can learn about community activities, church events, \n     shopping opportunities, the weather and other information.\n       That's all the stuff tech-savvy people now take for granted \n     in the information age. But there's a problem, says Greg \n     Laudeman, a community information specialist with Georgia \n     Tech's economic development outreach program.\n       There is a gap, he said, between segments of society who \n     embrace computers and digital information, and other people.\n       ``Early adopters (of new ideas and technology) and the \n     group that comes right behind them have different needs, \n     desires and interests than others,'' he said.\n       ``And in a curious way, the technology companies, early \n     adopters start coming up with more and more that suits their \n     interests at the same time that others ignore it because they \n     do not need it, or immediately see the usefulness of it.''\n       Laudeman and others say the ``digital divide,'' when \n     examined this way may not be racial, or even economic \n     entirely, but more a different way people view developments.\n       ``Many of us (early adopters) learn to value information \n     apart from what we do, or apart from the material or physical \n     things we own or use . . . we value it as a resource,'' \n     Laudeman said, ``while other people value information only \n     as it relates to what they are doing.''\n       He added, ``It's like the world is divided between those \n     who enjoy talking and thinking about technology, and those \n     who simply use it.''\n       Hall and Maltese grapple with that dichotomy between groups \n     nearly every day.\n       ``Some people say the service has no relevance to their \n     lives,'' said Hall, ``and others are just against it because \n     . . . well, because it is new and something they're not \n     accustomed to.''\n       Jabari Simama, who directed the establishment of community \n     technology centers in Atlanta, said his staff noticed also \n     that access alone is not enough to get response from \n     predominantly black, lower-income areas.\n       ``Income may be a barrier, but it is not the only one,'' \n     Simama said. ``Other factors that keep people from getting \n     involved in Internet technology include lack of reading \n     ability, and an absence of information they want or need.\n       ``It's one thing to say you'll put up information about the \n     city or city services, but you need to put up things about \n     the neighborhoods and communities where people live--and that \n     means you must use the same focus-group approach cable TV and \n     others have used to reach those audiences.''\n       Simama's view is corroborated by a study of the Children's \n     Partnership, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization that \n     mostly focuses on the needs of young people. But it also \n     reached conclusions about reaching lower-income people.\n       Among the barriers to strong Internet interest in the hard-\n     to-reach communities, the study found, are literacy, \n     language, culture and lifestyle, and the ``lack of most \n     urgently needed local information.''\n       How specific might that information be? One respondent \n     said:\n       ``Many of the people in the housing project where I work \n     want to find out about jobs they can do in the neighborhood. \n     If the neighborhood was more connected and mapped online, \n     this kind of information would really make a difference to \n     residents.''\n       The study projected that some 50 million Americans may be \n     inhibited by one or more of the barriers, with 41 million \n     specifically held back by lack of reading ability.\n       These are the kinds of extended considerations the leaders \n     in LaGrange will have to confront in the second year of \n     effort to get more residents involved in Internet \n     communication.\n       Among the barriers that must be scaled, are inertia among \n     people who see no ``need'' as well as others who are outright \n     suspicious.\n       Abercrombie, the gardener, when asked why she would not try \n     something that is free of charge, replied: ``Well, yes, but \n     what happens after the year when it's free?''\n       The LaGrange arrangement allows someone to try it, then to \n     decide what it's worth. ``But,'' she said, ``I am not sure I \n     want to be interested.''\n       She was given a computer by her son, who wanted her to \n     trade e-mail, but she has not done that, despite prompting by \n     grandchildren and others.\n       Patricia Graves, who works in the city cemetery office, has \n     been a subscriber to the Internet service for a year and \n     loves it.\n       Graves, who is black, said she enjoys e-mail, learning \n     about places to vacation, and just gathering information.\n       ``I have not made a purchase yet, but I am thinking about \n     it,'' she said.\n       Asked why some of her friends had not shown the same \n     enthusiasm, she was candid. ``I just find many people are \n     just afraid of computers. And some people are suspicious of \n     the city and wonder why this interest in putting these \n     machines in their homes. Some even wonder if they are for \n     watching them.''\n       State Rep. Carl von Epps, a south LaGrange merchant, said \n     he does not subscribe to the city service.\n       ``Don't get me wrong,'' he said. ``It is fine, and it is a \n     great way for people to get their foot in the door and learn \n     about the Internet, but it is not as fast as my service that \n     I've had for some time.''\n       Von Epps, who is black, said he was aware of some feelings \n     of suspicion and fear. ``But a lot of that will be overcome \n     by working more with churches and community organizations and \n     people the neighbors trust,'' he said. ``It's just a matter \n     of time.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 4, 2003]\n\n                             Tax and Click\n\n       State and local governments have broad power to tax as they \n     see fit--everything from clothes and food to electricity and \n     telephone service. Nearly everything, that is, except the \n     Internet. Under a supposedly temporary law passed in 1998 and \n     already extended once, Congress prohibited states from taxing \n     Internet access fees, monthly charges imposed by Internet \n     service providers. Proponents argued that the nascent engine \n     of the Internet shouldn't be slowed by taxing it and that it \n     would take time to devise a system to prevent duplicative or \n     discriminatory taxes. Now, with the tax moratorium having \n     expired on Saturday, Congress is poised to make the ban \n     permanent, broaden its reach and wipe out existing taxes that \n     had been grandfathered in under the previous law. With state \n     budgets under stress and the Internet thriving, this is an \n     unnecesary--and costly--incursion on states' rights.\n       The argument for permanently barring taxes on Internet \n     services centers on two issues. One is the argument that \n     taxing Internet access, whether through phone lines or cable \n     modems, would amount to double taxation, because the phone \n     lines and cable service are already taxed. That's true, but \n     purchasing Internet access provides a separate--and \n     separately taxable--bundle of services. Terming this double \n     taxation is like saying that a shopper who pays tax on a pair \n     of slacks should then be exempt from being taxed on a shirt \n     bought with it.\n       The other argument is that taxing Internet access would \n     worsen and prolong the digital divide, the computer gap \n     between rich and poor. This may be a problem, but prohibiting \n     taxation is not the answer. It's not the extra few cents on a \n     monthly bill that's stopping the less well-off from Googling \n     their way to the middle class. A policy to erase the digital \n     divide, however laudable, doesn't justify the no-tax \n     solution. The federal government wants to spur home ownership \n     for low-income familes--surely a bigger problem than lack of \n     Internet access--but that doesn't lead it to tell local \n     governments that they can't impose property taxes.\n       What's driving this legislation is that telecommunications \n     companies and Internet service providers see an opportunity \n     not only to make the tax moratorium permanent--in itself a \n     bad idea--but to save what could amount to billions in \n     additional taxes. The law frees service providers from having \n     to pay taxes on telephone service they use to provide \n     Internet access. And as the Internet becomes a more effective \n     medium for providing phone service and delivering products \n     such as downloaded movies, software and music, the \n     legislation could sweep such offerings within the ambit of \n     services that states are prohibited from taxing.\n       The Internet shouldn't be subject to conflicting taxes, but \n     that's no reason to argue that it shouldn't be taxed at all. \n     There should be a level playing field for taxing Internet \n     access, whether it comes through ordinary dial-up, cable \n     modems or high-speed telephone lines. The last thing Congress \n     should do now to cash-strapped states is pass a law that \n     would not only permanently put Internet access off limits for \n     taxation but also deprive them of revenue that they now \n     collect. Proponents of the law are busy demagoguing the \n     issue, suggesting, as Senate sponsor Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) put \n     it the other day, that users ``could be taxed every time they \n     send an e-mail, every time they read their local newspaper \n     online or check the score of a football game.'' Congress \n     should step back from the brink, temporarily extend the \n     moratorium and sort this all out in a way that doesn't \n     intrude on state prerogatives.\n\n                               Exhibit 5\n\n                 [From Dallas News.com, Mar. 30, 2004]\n\n    Internet Access Fees: Don't Let Removal Have Unintended Effects\n\n       Getting rid of a bad tax isn't as easy as one might think.\n       Late last year, a couple of bills that would have done away \n     with Internet access fees began winding their way through \n     Congress. (An Internet access fee is one of those mysterious \n     fees you find near the bottom of your monthly phone bill.)\n       The bills had gained support until lawmakers discovered a \n     major problem. The\n\n[[Page S4352]]\n\n     bills also would have exempted virtually all \n     telecommunications activity from taxation. Cities and states \n     would have been left out on a precarious financial limb, \n     possibly unable to collect traditional right-of-way and \n     franchise fees that fund city and state operations.\n       Welcome to the law of unintended consequences.\n       For that reason, we urge Congress to go slowly in this area \n     and to extend a moratorium on new Internet access fees for \n     another two years.\n       We aren't thrilled about leaving in place a bad tax that \n     encumbers an emerging technology--even one that provides $45 \n     million annually in Texas. But it's the right decision and \n     one that buys time for a more thoughtful discussion of the \n     Internet and taxes. The moratorium has support from a growing \n     number of lawmakers, including Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-\n     Texas.\n       Technology breakthroughs are changing telecommunications \n     faster than legislation can keep pace. For years, Congress, \n     the Federal Communications Commission and state regulators \n     have wrestled with how much to regulate the Internet but have \n     had less-than-satisfying results.\n       The Internet shouldn't become an easy target for revenue-\n     hungry jurisdictions, but neither can it expect to be a tax-\n     free haven for commerce. Congress has a responsibility to \n     find a satisfactory middle ground, recognizing the revenue \n     needs of cities and states while also not crippling the \n     telecommunications and information services industries.\n       Congress must get this right, and a two-year moratorium on \n     all new Internet access fees will give it enough time to sort \n     through the issue.\n\n                               Exhibit 6\n\n                                               State of Tennessee,\n\n\n        Department of Revenue, Nashville, TN, January 9, 2004.\n\n     Re S. 150--the Internet Tax Moratorium.\n\n     Senator Lamar Alexander,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: It was a pleasure to see you at the \n     recent meeting for the National League of Cities in \n     Nashville. Again I want to thank you for your courageous \n     assistance with regard to protecting the interests of the \n     State of Tennessee on the subject of the Internet Tax \n     Moratorium.\n       I wanted to make you aware of a recent development in this \n     matter. Tennessee has taxed Internet access as a \n     ``telecommunications service'' under its sales and use tax \n     laws since 1996. In my presentations to Harrison Fox and Joe \n     Cwiklinski concerning the adverse impact S. 150 and the \n     Managers' Amendment would have on Tennessee's tax base, I \n     explained that Tennessee has been involved in lawsuits \n     concerning whether Internet access falls within Tennessee's \n     definition of ``telecommunications.'' The Court of Appeals \n     decision in Prodigy Services Corp., Inc. v. Johnson, 2003 WL \n     21918624 (Tenn. Ct. App., Aug. 12, 2003) has now become \n     final. In this case, the Court held that, under Tennessee \n     law, Internet access is not taxable as a telecommunication \n     service in Tennessee. Therefore, the Tennessee Department of \n     Revenue will issue a notice in the near future explaining \n     that Internet service providers should no longer collect \n     sales tax on sales of Internet access to consumers. I advised \n     your office that the sales tax on the true Internet access \n     component of the prior Internet Tax Freedom Act was \n     approximately $18 million annually for Tennessee.\n       This Tennessee Court decision does not in any way impact \n     our stringent opposition to S. 150 and the Managers' \n     Amendment. Both S. 150 and the Managers' Amendment put \n     Tennessee's entire telecommunications sales tax base at risk \n     because the amendment sought by the telecommunications \n     companies incorporates the very broad definition of \n     ``Internet access'' under the original Internet Tax Freedom \n     Act. While certain constituencies have questioned the states' \n     estimates of the bills' fiscal impact, the critical problem \n     is about the language in the bill and about the policy. As \n     long as the amendment sought by the telecommunications \n     industry includes the phrase ``Internet access'' and as long \n     as the definition of ``Internet access'' remains as it was \n     under the federal law, then the fiscal problem identified by \n     the states and local governments remains.\n       Tenness strongly supports the amendment that you proposed \n     to S. 150, the Alexander-Carper amendment. If there is \n     anything that I can do to assist on this matter or any other \n     matter concerning Tennessee taxes, please do not hesitate to \n     let me know. Thank you again for all of your help.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Loren L.

This bill would \n     reinstate and broaden the ``moratorium'' on state and local \n     taxation of Internet access services originally imposed in \n     1998 by the Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA). S. 2084 would \n     bar state and local governments for two more years from \n     taxing the typical $10-$50 monthly charge that households and \n     businesses pay--to an Internet access provider like America \n     Online, or to the local phone or cable TV company--to be able \n     to access the World Wide Web and send and receive e-mail.\n       S. 2084 would broaden the original ITFA moratorium \n     substantially by newly exempting from taxation all \n     telecommunications services ``purchased, used, or sold by an \n     Internet access provider to connect a purchaser of Internet \n     access to the Internet access provider.''\n       This new language in S. 2084, which amends ITFA's \n     definition of Internet access, exempts from new state and \n     local taxes almost all communications services that an \n     Internet access subscriber can use to connect to her Internet \n     access provider--so-called ``last mile'' telecommunications. \n     S. 2084 would, however, grandfather existing state and local \n     taxes on ``last-mile'' telecommunications services. \n     Grandfathering currently-collected taxes is consistent with \n     the sponsors' position that Congress should not impose a new, \n     expensive, ``unfunded mandate'' on state and local \n     governments, especially at a time of severe fiscal stress.\n       The new language to be added to ITFA's Internet access \n     definition by S. 2084 seeks to achieve ``technological \n     neutrality'' in the tax treatment of high-speed access by \n     exempting from tax all the forms in which the ``last mile'' \n     connection is made: cable modems, ``Digital Subscriber \n     Lines'' (DSL), dedicated ``T-1'' lines used by businesses, \n     wireless connections (e.g., Blackberry), and satellite \n     transmissions. The only exception to the tax exemption for \n     ``last mile'' telecommunications would be ordinary voice \n     telephone lines used for ``dial-up'' (conventional modem) \n     access to the Internet; taxes on such lines would still be \n     allowed under S. 2084.\n       S. 2084 is a significant expansion of the moratorium. As \n     enacted in 1998 (and as renewed in 2001), the Internet Tax \n     Freedom Act had excluded (carved out) from the definition of \n     tax-exempt ``Internet access'' all telecommunications \n     services--as that term is defined by the Federal \n     Communications Commission. Thus all states and localities \n     were allowed to continue taxing all telecommunications \n     services, even those used to obtain or provide Internet \n     access on the ``last mile.''\n       The authorization of state and local governments to \n     continue taxing telecommunications was consciously and \n     intentionally included in ITFA in order to preserve state and \n     local taxes and fees imposed on all forms of \n     telecommunications services used at any point along the \n     Internet. While some have claimed that S. 2084's grandfather \n     provision condones ``illegal'' taxes on Internet-related \n     telecommunications imposed by states and localities \n     attempting an ``end run'' around ITFA, the legislative \n     history of ITFA clearly refutes those claims.\n       Renewing ITFA in its original form would preserve state and \n     local taxes on all Internet-related telecommunications. The \n     proposed S. 150 would prohibit all state and local taxation \n     of both ``last mile'' telecommunications services and the \n     ``upstream'' telecommunications services that constitute the \n     underlying infrastructure and ``backbone'' of the Internet. \n     (According to the Federation of Tax Administrators, states \n     and localities would lose approximately $500 million annually \n     if ``upstream'' telecommunications services were no longer \n     taxable.) In prohibiting new taxes on ``last mile'' \n     telecommunications, S. 2084 represents a true compromise \n     between these two alternatives.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, first of all, I want to thank the \nSenator from Tennessee for the tremendous amount of time and effort he \nhas put into this issue. We all got into this together last year when \nwe saw the train moving very fast and we wanted to do what we could to \nslow it down. We were able to accomplish that. Since that time, the \nSenator from Tennessee and the Senator from Delaware have been working \non a bipartisan basis to try to spend a great deal of time with the \nfolks who have a different point of view, trying to reconcile the \ndifferences.\n  Unfortunately, those differences have not been reconciled. But it \ncertainly is not based on a lack of trying. The Senator from Tennessee \nnow has become the expert on this. Madam President, I wish you had been \nat a meeting I had with him last week, where he was teaching the \nteachers on this legislation. I thank him so very much for all of his \nhard work and dedication to this issue. I hope our colleagues will \nlisten to us today and perhaps come up with another compromise that \nwill allow us to spend more time to deal with this subject. This is a \nvery complicated issue and we need to be careful how we proceed.\n  Today we are going to consider a motion to proceed on S. 150, the \nInternet Tax Nondiscrimination Act of 2003. When the Senate first \nconsidered this legislation last November, I argued the\n\n[[Page S4353]]\n\ndebate on S. 150 was not about taxing e-mail or increasing taxes on \nInternet access. It was suggested by some members of this legislative \nbody that we were in favor of taxing the Internet or e-mail. In fact, I \nstand here today in opposition to taxes on Internet access and firmly \nopposed to any and all taxes on e-mail by any level of government--\nFederal, State, or local. But that is not what today's debate is about.\n  Rather, the debate on S. 150 is about federalism, unfunded mandates, \nand protecting the States' ability to collect revenue at a time when \nState and local governments are struggling to make ends meet.\n  As a former State representative, counter auditor, counter \ncommissioner, Lieutenant Governor, mayor of Cleveland, and Governor of \nOhio, I have seen firsthand how the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and our State and local counterparts affect our citizens and \nthe communities in which they live.\n  My experience has fueled my passion for federalism and the need to \nbalance the Federal Government's power with the powers our Founding \nFathers envisioned for the States. This very body was created in part \nto guarantee that States have adequate and equal means to assert their \ninterests before the Federal Government, and I can assure you that if \nwe Senators were still elected State legislators, this issue would not \nbe before us today.\n  The relationship between the Federal Government and State and local \ngovernments should be one of partnership. However, that is not always \nthe case. I am concerned about the tendency of the Federal Government \nto preempt the functions of State and local governments and force on \nthem new responsibilities, particularly without also providing funding \nto pay for these new responsibilities. Madam President, that is why I \nfought for the passage of unfunded mandates reform.\n  As a matter of fact, I will never forget the first time in my life I \nset foot on the floor of the U.S. Senate was when the unfunded mandates \nreform legislation passed. Then, later at the Rose Garden, I was there \nrepresenting State and local governments when President Clinton signed \nUMRA in 1995. As I said, I was representing State and local \ngovernments, and, Madam President, your husband a former Senator from \nKansas, Mr. Dole, was representing the national interests. It is a day \nI will never forget. In fact, I have the pen that was used to sign the \nlegislation proudly displayed in my office in the Senate.\n  As I will explain in a moment, S. 150 violates the principles of \nfederalism. When S. 150 was pulled from the Senate floor last November, \nadvocates on both sides of the issue agreed to resolve our differences. \nFor the past 6 months, we have been engaged in meaningful dialog, but \nwe just cannot reach an agreement. At this point in time, I am \nconcerned that the philosophical differences between the two sides may \nbe too deep to bridge.\n  Madam President, I have three problems with the definition of \nInternet access:\n  First, it is so broad that it prevents State and local governments \nfrom collecting taxes on all telecommunications services used to \nprovide Internet access over the entire broad band network. We are \ntalking about the entire network, last mile, middle mile, and backbone. \nStates are currently collecting between $3 billion and $10 billion \nannually in telephone taxes. I am concerned that this tax base may \nerode as traditional phone service migrates to cutting edge technology \ncalled voice over Internet protocol, VOIP. In fact, the migration is \nhappening at a rapid pace. For example, on April 9, 2004, Newsday \nreported that AT expects to add 1 million VOIP customers by the end \nof 2005 and there are many other companies rolling out this service as \nwell. This will have a tremendous change in the way telephone service \nis provided in the United States.\n  As a part of our good-faith negotiations on S. 150, Senators Allen \nand Alexander were working on language to preserve the States' ability \nto collect taxes on VOIP, but they have not yet reached an agreement. \nIn addition, the Federation of Tax Administrators noted that S. 150 \nwould prohibit States from continuing to tax some transactions such as \nbusiness-to-business transactions between Internet service providers \nand telephone companies, and they estimate this could cost State and \nlocal governments $500 million annually in lost revenues.\n  Second, S. 150 violates the spirit of the original moratorium by \nmaking a brand new definition of Internet access permanent. The \noriginal 1998 moratorium was 3 years in duration, and in 2001, Congress \nextended it for 2 more years. With technology changing so rapidly, we \nmust be cautious when trying to define Internet access.\n  Third, according to the CBO, S. 150 imposes an intergovernmental \nmandate under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Let me repeat, CBO says \nit is an unfunded mandate. On page 6 of the September 29, 2003, \nCommerce Committee's report on S. 150, CBO said:\n\n       By extending and expanding the moratorium on certain types \n     of State and local taxes, S. 150 would impose an \n     intergovernmental mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act. CBO estimates that the mandate would cause State \n     and local governments to lose revenue beginning in October \n     2006; those losses would exceed the threshold established in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act . . . by 2007. While there \n     is some uncertainty as to the number of States affected, CBO \n     estimates that the direct costs to State and local \n     governments would probably total between $80 million and $120 \n     million annually, beginning in 2007.\n\n  There is no question, this is an unfunded mandate.\n  Furthermore--and this is the part to which we really need to pay \nattention:\n\n       Depending on how the language altering the definition of \n     what telecommunications are taxable is interpreted, that \n     language also could result in substantial revenue losses for \n     States and local governments. It is possible that States \n     could lose revenue if services that are currently taxed are \n     redefined as Internet access under the definition of S. 150 . \n     . . However, CBO cannot estimate the magnitude of these \n     losses.\n\n  In other words, at this stage of the game, they have no idea how \nlarge these losses will be to State and local governments if the \ndefinition of Internet access in S. 150 is passed.\n  To follow up on CBO's assessment, I went to my own State and said: \nCan you examine the proposals and let me know what they would cost our \nstate?\n  Under S. 150, as reported, it would cost the State of Ohio $350 \nmillion a year at a time when they are trying to balance their budget. \nThey are making cuts in services right now to try to balance the State \nbudget. The Allen-Wyden managers' amendment we discussed in November \nwould cost about $150 million for 2 years, and the Alexander-Carper-\nVoinovich amendment would cost my State about $40 million a year. So \nany proposal under consideration would cost my State money.\n  Logic tells me that if CBO cannot calculate the potential loss in \nrevenue to the States, and my State projects large revenue losses, why \nwould we make dramatic and permanent changes to the Internet tax \nmoratorium? Why would we do that to our friends in State and local \ngovernment?\n  Last month, Senator Collins, chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, confirmed in a letter to me that the Allen-Wyden managers' \namendment to S. 150 also contained unfunded mandates as defined by \nUMRA. The CBO says it and the Governmental Affairs Committee says it is \nan unfunded mandate.\n  Unlike Congress, by law States must balance their budgets. They do \nnot have the option of printing money like we do. Therefore, if the \nSenate passes S. 150 or the managers' amendment, Congress will, in \neffect, force States to raise taxes or cut services in order to make up \nthe difference, which is why each State and local government and \norganizations are opposed to this legislation with the exception of the \nNCSL.\n  However, NCSL did send a strong message earlier this year. In fact, \nthey were in favor of this bill last November but have since removed \ntheir support and are now neutral on the legislation. They are giving \nmore consideration to this issue.\n  The financial impact of S. 150 would be devastating to our State and \nlocal governments, but there are other problems with the legislation \nthat are beyond our control. The Federal Communications Commission \nclassifies DSL as both an information service and telecommunications \nservice. I just wonder how many of our colleagues really understand \nwhat this is all about. This is a very complex issue and we really need \nto pay attention to both the language in the proposals and, now to the \ncourts as well. Under the 1998 moratorium, State and local governments \nare\n\n[[Page S4354]]\n\nable to collect taxes on the telecommunications portion of DSL service.\n  The problem that supporters of S. 150 point out is that cable modem \nInternet service has been classified by the FCC as an information \nservice and, therefore, it is not subject to State and local \ntelecommunications taxes. My colleagues argue that we need to bring \nparity to the industry by enacting an expanded definition of Internet \naccess. I agree with them in principle. However, earlier this month the \nNinth Circuit overruled the Federal Communications Commission decision \nthat cable modem broadband service was a single information service. \nThe court ruling means that cable modem service now can be classified \nas part information service and part telecommunications service, just \nlike DSL. So under the Ninth Circuit, there is now parity between DSL \nand cable modem.\n  The Ninth Circuit case may be appealed to the Supreme Court. This \nwhole area still is in flux. But it does not end there.\n  As I mentioned, we think it will go to the Supreme Court, and, if so, \nthey may not render a decision until June of 2005. The case, obviously, \nhas significant impact on the debate today.\n  When we have so much uncertainty, Congress should proceed very \ncautiously and not run out and do something that will have a tremendous \nimpact on all the future decisions that are made on this issue.\n  I am one of 11 Members joining Senators Alexander and Carper on S. \n2084, the Internet Tax Ban Extension and Improvement Act. The bill \nprovides a 2-year solution that expands the definition of Internet \naccess to the level playing field for all Internet providers: DSL, \ncable, modem, wireless, and satellite. In other words, our bill would \nput them all in an equal position and would resolve the issue with the \nNinth Circuit Court because it would basically say we agree with the \ncourt.\n  Our legislation would make the last mile of Internet service from the \nInternet provider to the customer tax free. In addition, our \nlegislation retains the existing grandfather clause in effect for 2 \nyears, that is 11 States; expands the grandfather clause by allowing \nStates that are now collecting taxes on DSL service to continue to do \nso for 2 more years, currently 16 States; and prohibits States that are \nnot collecting taxes on DSL from doing so.\n  It would also prevent them from collecting taxes on cable and other \nservices on the Internet. Unfortunately, our legislation was not \nacceptable to the sponsors. We thought it was very reasonable because \nthey believed we needed a broader policy to promote the growth of the \nInternet. However, recent trends on the growth of broadband services \nmay suggest otherwise.\n  When I was chairman of the National Governors Association back in \n1998, I helped negotiate the first Internet tax moratorium because \nthere was a big concern about what it would do to the Internet. Our \ngoal then and our goal today is the same: to encourage the growth of \nthe Internet as a driving force in our economy. We want that to happen. \nI believe we have been successful.\n  In fact, I will highlight how much Internet technology has grown over \nthe past years. It is unbelievable. According to a study released by \nthe Pew Internet and American Life Project last week, 55 percent of \nAmerican Internet users have access to broadband either at home or at \nthe workplace. The report also noted that home broadband usage is up 60 \npercent since March of 2003, with half of that growth since November of \n2003. DSL technology now has a 42-percent share of the home broadband \nmarket. This figure is up from 28 percent in March of 2003. What I \nwould like to point out is that it all happened since the moratorium \nended.\n  I think the Chair will recall that our opponents were concerned that \nif the moratorium expired, States would rush out and tax the Internet. \nThat has not happened. In fact, we have just seen an exponential growth \nin the use of the Internet. Additionally, on April 21, a major \ntelecommunications company, SBC released their 2004 first quarter \nearnings.\n  I will read the first two sentences from the company's press release \nbecause it illustrates how fast this technology is growing.\n\n       SBC Communications, Inc., today reported first-quarter 2004 \n     earnings of $1.9 billion as it delivered strong progress in \n     key growth products. In the quarter, SBC added 446,000 DSL \n     lines, the best ever by a U.S. telecom provider . . .\n\n  I congratulate this company for fostering the growth of DSL service \nin our country and for building a solid business plan that allowed them \nto have such a positive impact on their bottom line. Their financial \noutlook proves that Congress should not subsidize a growing industry at \nthe expense of our State and local governments.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, not one State has passed legislation to tax \nInternet access in the absence of a Federal moratorium. In fact, we \nhave reports that a couple of States have even backed off from what \nthey were doing before. Therefore, the sky that was predicted to fall \nhas not.\n  That is not to say that I am opposed to an Internet tax moratorium. \nNothing could be further from the truth. There is still more room to \ncompromise, and I think it is fair to say that some of my colleagues \nagree with my assessment.\n  The inability of both sides to reach an agreement prompted Senator \nMcCain to offer a new proposal. I commend my good friend from Arizona \nfor trying to reach a middle ground on this complex issue and, for that \nmatter, I congratulate him on trying to bring us together.\n  I do not know whether the Senator from Tennessee is going to opine on \nthat proposal, but the four principles are: Establishes a 4-year \nmoratorium; allows States to collect taxes on telephone calls made over \nthe Internet; extends the original grandfather clause for 3 years; \ninitiates the 2-year grandfather clause for States that are currently \ncollecting taxes on DSL services.\n  I am very concerned because the term of the moratorium is longer than \nthe two grandfather clauses, which may trigger the unfunded mandate \nthat I have been talking about in the point of order.\n  I appreciate the attempt of the Senator from Arizona to offer a \nsolution. But here we are here again at the last minute trying to get \nsomething done, and now we have a new proposal. We have no idea of what \nimpact it is going to have. I for one, would like my state to review \nthe proposal.\n  It seems to me that at this stage the best thing we can do is to \nunderstand that we have unresolved issues, and that S. 150 was passed \nout of the Commerce Committee by voice vote. That is the way it came \nout of the committee. If one examines S. 150 and they examine the \nAlexander-Carper-Voinovich, et al., bill they will find both bills have \n11 cosponsors. There are 11 for our bill and 11 for the legislation of \nthe Senator from Virginia. Six cosponsors of each bill are from the \nCommerce Committee.\n  So it is evident that even within the Commerce Committee there are \ngenuine differences of opinion on the best way to proceed. I think we \nunderstand that given the longstanding impasse on negotiations and the \npossible Supreme Court action, there has to be an easier way to get \nthis done.\n  I understand Senator Enzi will introduce a 15-month extension of the \noriginal moratorium, and perhaps that is the most reasonable solution \nbecause it will provide all stakeholders, including the Commerce \nCommittee, the FCC, the State and local government groups, and the \nindustry time to draft a reasonable bill.\n  If the motion to proceed to S. 150 passes this afternoon, I believe \nthe Senate will not be able to reach an agreement on the underlying \nbill, which may signal the end of the Internet tax moratorium. If we \ncannot agree, that is the end of it. I do not want that to happen. \nTherefore, I implore my colleagues to continue negotiations on the \nInternet tax moratorium.\n  Our goal should be to reach a sensible solution with two simple \nprinciples in mind: First and foremost, do no harm to the States. \nSecond, foster the growth of high-speed Internet access by leveling the \nplaying field for all Internet service providers.\n  So a way out of the thicket may be to extend the moratorium for \nanother 2 years or for 15 months, give the Commerce Committee more of \nan opportunity to work on the issue, give the FCC more time to be \ninvolved, see\n\n[[Page S4355]]\n\nwhich way the court cases are going, and come back with something where \nall of us can agree that makes sense. We need a proposal that respects \nthe State and local governments, does not violate unfunded mandates, \nand at the same time make sure we can move forward with the Internet \nand achieve the phenomenal success that it already has achieved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I have already spoken, so if the \nSenators from Virginia or Delaware want to speak, I will certainly \nyield to them.\n  But I certainly congratulate the Senator from Ohio. He knows what he \nis talking about when it comes to State and local government. He has \nbeen a mayor. He rescued a major American city from bankruptcy. He \nchaired the National Governors Association. The people of Ohio know he \nworks in a very principled way. He understands, as I believe I do, that \nthis train is on the wrong track.\n  I say this to the Senators from Ohio and Delaware and then I will \nstop and yield to the Senator from Delaware: How much subsidy is enough \nsubsidy? I notice, in this thick list of subsidies that States give \nhigh-speed Internet access, Texas is generating $1.5 billion of subsidy \njust to encourage the growth of high-speed Internet access. Then, in \naddition, it has already made exempt from taxation the first $25 you \npay for high-speed Internet access. Now we are talking about giving \nfurther subsidies to the companies that provide that access. I don't \nsee the sense of that.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Ohio, look forward to working with \nhim, and now that I see the Senator from Delaware with whom I have \nenjoyed working, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I am delighted to be on the floor with \nyou and particularly pleased to be with Senators Voinovich and \nAlexander.\n  I wish to ask a question of Senator Voinovich, if I could--I know, \nbefore he was the Senator from Ohio, he was the Governor of Ohio. We \nserved together at that time--to what other elective positions Senator \nVoinovich has been elected by the people of Ohio? As I recall----\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I have already listed them in my formal presentation \non the floor. There are so many it is hard to remember.\n  But I did mention the fact that we all worked together as members of \nthe National Governors Association. In fact, the Senator from Delaware \nwas vice chairman of the National Governors Association when I was \npresident of the National Governors Association, and we worked together \nand collaborated on a lot of issues.\n  I have been concerned about this issue since I was president of the \nNational League of Cities back in 1985. As the Presiding Officer knows, \none of the biggest issues we had in 1995 and 1996 was unfunded \nmandates. We went right across the country pointing out how devastating \nthese mandates coming out of Washington were for State and local \ngovernments. We thought we had done something very significant about \nit.\n  But to answer the question of the Senator from Delaware, from my \nperspective, the passage of this bill would be the most egregious \nunfunded mandate we have seen since 1995, when the unfunded mandates \nrelief legislation was passed. It seems to me we still have Members of \nthis body who were around when unfunded mandates relief legislation was \npassed and there was great support for it. It seems to me those who \nsupported it at that time should give some real consideration to the \nfact that we are about, if this were to pass, to have the biggest \nunfunded mandate, as I said, since that bill passed.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I would say, Madam President, Senator Voinovich is not a \nJohnny-come-lately on this subject. I recall, early in my time as \nGovernor, working through the National Governors Association, the kind \nof leadership he provided, encouraging the Congress, the House and \nSenate, and then President Clinton, to pass and enact an unfunded \nmandates law. He played a major role in getting that done.\n  It is kind of ironic that a decade or so later, we are back again and \nthe issue is very much the same. I am pleased to see we stand today \nwhere we stood then. I am honored to be involved in this battle on the \nsame side with Senator Voinovich and Senator Alexander.\n  We have been joined on the floor by the former mayor of San \nFrancisco, Senator Feinstein, and I see we have been joined on the \nfloor by another former Governor, Governor Allen, who in this instance \nis our adversary but remains our very good friend.\n  That having been said, I do have some other comments I would like to \nmake. Let me observe we have gotten into some very bad habits here in \nWashington. We all know we are living beyond our means. We all know \nabout our growing budget shortfall and our escalating level of \nindebtedness. We all know the most popular way to pay for things around \nhere is simply to issue more and more debt on our Nation's credit card \nand on our taxpayers' dime.\n  Moreover, we all know that our budget shortfall is actually bigger \nthan we report it to be. We all know we are using Social Security funds \nto mask the actual size of our Federal budget deficit.\n  We are using the payroll tax contributions that working Americans pay \ninto Social Security, and employers pay, to pay for other Government \nspending and to partially offset corporate tax breaks and reductions in \ntaxes on inherited estates.\n  What we do not talk about very often is that piling up more debt and \ndrawing on Social Security are not the only means we are resorting to \nthese days to continue to spend more than we take in. The other way we \nfound to spend without constraint or accountability was to pass the \nbuck to our friends in State and local government.\n  If you think about it, it is a sweetheart deal. We order up a feast \nhere in Washington of more spending or more special interest tax breaks \nand more corporate subsidies. Then we stick the Governors, mayors, and \nState and local taxpayers with the tab. It is not surprising that we do \nthis. In doing so, we get to take credit for helping an array of \ndifferent groups and businesses represented here in Washington. Yet we \ndon't have to raise a single tax or cut a single program to pay for it.\n  In government as in business, however, there is no such thing as a \nfree lunch. This policy of passing unfunded mandates has not been \nnearly as convenient for our Governors, for our mayors, and State and \nlocal taxpayers as it has been for us here in our Nation's Capital. I \ndon't have to tell my colleagues their States and localities \nare struggling to cope today with the worst fiscal crisis--some say \nsince World War II. Classrooms are becoming even more crowded as school \nbudgets are cut. Prisoners in a number of States are being released \nfrom jail as corrections budgets are cut. Governors and mayors are \npushing through unpopular and frequently regressive tax increases \nbecause they have a constitutional mandate to balance their budget.\n\n  We all know this. Yet when it comes right down to it, we proceed to \nact here in Washington as if we are oblivious to what is going on all \naround us. We continue to treat State and local budgets almost as piggy \nbanks that we can break in order to pay for our own priorities.\n  Just about everyone in this body supports a moratorium on State and \nlocal taxes on Internet access. In 1998, the Congress passed such a \nmoratorium. In 2001, we extended that moratorium. In fact, I believe we \ndid so just about unanimously.\n  Last year the Internet tax moratorium expired. There was no reason \nwhy that should have happened. If the bill had been brought to the \nfloor of the Senate simply to extend that moratorium once again, it \nwould have passed once again by acclamation. The American people \nsupport the moratorium. I support the moratorium. All of us want to see \nit extended.\n  However, as was the case last year, the bill we are debating this \nweek does not simply extend the expired Internet tax moratorium. I wish \nthat it did. Instead, what this bill does is to take advantage of the \nneed to extend that moratorium to attach billions of dollars in new \nsubsidies for the telecommunications industry.\n  Such a bill would not normally stand much of a chance of passage in \nthe Senate.\n\n[[Page S4356]]\n\n  The simple truth of the matter is we don't have the money at this \ntime of budget deficits at home and war abroad to pay for billions of \ndollars in new subsidies for what is already a highly profitable \nindustry. But the proponents of this legislation have discovered an \neasy solution to their problem. Why pay when we can send the bill back \nhome to our Governors and to our mayors? Just think of it as political \nwelfare. We spend and they pay.\n  Passing the buck in this way is bad enough, but it gets worse. \nBelieve it or not, we can't actually say what this legislation will \ncost our friends in State and local governments. We know it will not \ncost us a dime here in Washington, but the truth is we do not know how \nmuch it will cost in Dover, DE, in Raleigh, NC, in Richmond, VA, in \nColumbus, OH, in Nashville, TN, or in Sacramento, CA.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us this legislation is written \nin a way that is extremely broad and vague. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office cannot even give us a rough estimate of what the effect \nwill be on State and local budgets except to say this:\n\n       We believe it could grow to be large.\n\n  Here is what we are saying in effect to our Governors and to our \nmayors: We are extending to you the great honor of picking up our \ndinner tab tonight. We can't tell you exactly how much we have ordered \nor what the final bill will be, but we believe it could grow to be \nlarge.\n  At times like these when property taxes are being raised, when sales \ntaxes are being raised, when school budgets are being cut, when \nprisoners are being released prematurely, our first responsibility in \ndealing with our partners in State and local government should be to do \nas Senator Voinovich has already said--no harm. Indeed, that is the \npledge our Senate majority leader, Senator Frist, made to our Nation's \nGovernors when he spoke to them back in February, a couple of months \nago, when they were here in town. As a doctor--and a good one--the \nmajority leader said his approach to legislation would be, ``First, do \nno harm.'' This, it seems to me, at least is a sensible approach. My \nhope is that rather than wasting time with an unproductive fight here \non the floor, we will return to the negotiating table and work out a \ncompromise that keeps faith with this Hippocratic pledge to do no harm.\n  Unfortunately, the way it stands, we are choosing the way of lawyers \naround here rather than the way of the doctors. The Congressional \nBudget Office says the language of the legislation we are proceeding to \nhere in the Senate is so confusing lawyers will ultimately have to get \ninvolved and we will not know what the implications for State and local \nbudgets will be until it all gets sorted out in the courts.\n  If we had to choose between extending the Internet tax moratorium and \nkeeping faith with our pledge to do no harm, we would truly be faced \nwith a difficult decision. But in reality, that is not the decision \nwith which we are faced. We can extend the Internet tax moratorium. \nNobody I have talked to is opposed to that. States and localities have \nbeen living under the Internet tax moratorium for more than 5 years \nnow. None of them are counting on revenues from taxes prohibited under \nthe Internet tax moratorium.\n  Extending the Internet tax moratorium is not what creates a large, \nnew, unfunded mandate. What creates a large, new, unfunded mandate is \nusing the occasion of the Internet tax moratorium renewal to create new \nindustry subsidies and then emptying State and local treasuries to pay \nfor those subsidies.\n\n  This bill departs from the original intent of the previous moratorium \nwhich was to ensure the monthly bills our constituents receive from \ntheir Internet service providers remain tax free. Instead, this \nlegislation picks the pockets of State and local taxpayers who have \nalready suffered their fair share of tax increases over the past 3 \nyears.\n  Senator Alexander and I are Senators. Like all of our colleagues, we \nhave constituents who use the Internet and who want the Internet tax \nmoratorium to remain in place. Like most others in this body, we want \nto extend the Internet tax moratorium. But Senator Alexander and I are \nalso former Governors. We know what it is like to be on the receiving \nend of unfunded Federal mandates, as do my colleagues Senator \nFeinstein, former mayor of San Francisco, and Senator Hutchison, a \nformer State treasurer from Texas.\n  Senator Alexander and I, together with Senator Voinovich, Senator \nGraham, Senator Hutchison, Senator Feinstein and others, have offered \nwhat we believe is a straightforward, commonsense alternative. As we \ndid in 2001, let us examine the Internet tax moratorium for another 2 \nyears. If we need to expand the moratorium slightly to ensure all \nconsumers can access the Internet tax free, regardless of whether they \nchoose cable or DSL, then let us do that. But beyond that, let us do no \nharm.\n  Let us do no harm because doing harm is not necessary to ensure \nconsumers can access the Internet tax free. Doing harm is only \nnecessary if we believe the telecommunications industry needs billions \nof dollars in new subsidies. Beyond that, doing harm is only necessary \nif we believe Congress cannot or should not pay for such subsidies it \ndecides to create.\n  Senator Alexander and I, together with Senators Voinovich, Feinstein, \nHutchison, Graham and others, have been working in good faith with our \ncolleagues on the other side of this issue. We are committed to \nreaching a reasonable compromise. We are willing to meet every day if \nnecessary to work out such a compromise. However, what we are not going \nto do is turn our backs on our former colleagues in our Nation's State \nhouses and our Nation's city halls. We are not going to stand by as yet \nanother unfunded mandate gets passed down and wreaks havoc on the \noperations of State and local governments.\n  We don't think it is constructive to try to write this bill on the \nfloor. Furthermore, we believe we should only proceed to consideration \nof a bill that adheres to the principles of doing no harm.\n  If our colleagues want to attach industry subsidies to an Internet \ntax moratorium, they should offer an amendment to do so, and that \namendment should be debated openly here on the floor of the Senate.\n  If the majority leader wants to try to write this bill on the floor \ndespite our reservations, then we are prepared to go through that \nexercise.\n  We have many specific concerns with the bill that has been called up. \nWe have a number of amendments we will offer for our colleagues' \nconsideration, including amendments to return to the original intent of \nthe moratorium and to require any new subsidies be directly passed on \nto consumers in the form of reduced rates.\n  We will also offer our colleagues an opportunity to pay for the \nbillions of dollars of subsidies that have been added to this bill.\n  If this body does not believe the resources exist at the Federal \nlevel to pay for these subsidies, we will raise a point of order \nagainst the bill.\n  As the Congressional Budget Office has already indicated, this bill \nviolates the promise Congress made in 1995 that we would not continue \nto pass large, unfunded mandates. The Senate has the power to waive the \npoint of order that is supposed to prevent Congress from passing large, \nunfunded Federal mandates. If we are going to do so, however, Senator \nAlexander and I believe the Senate ought to be put on record as \nacknowledging our continued reliance on unfunded mandates as a chosen \nmeans to avoid our fiscal responsibility, and it should not have to \ncome to that. Our hope is it will not come to that.\n  We believe the negotiations we have had with our friends on the other \nside, though they have been limited, have been productive, and we have \ntried as fully as we can consistent with our principles to address \nindustries' demands.\n  We believe we have come a long way since this debate began early last \nyear. We are committed to continuing that process. If that process is \nshort circuited, however, as it seems it will be, at least for now, we \nwill insist upon a serious and informed debate in the Senate this week.\n\n  This is the body that our Founding Fathers created to represent the \ninterest of States. This is the body that must defend our Federal \nsystem of government and stand against the trend of passing more and \nmore unfunded Federal mandates.\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\n  Win or lose, Senator Alexander and I are committed to ensuring that \nthis is one unfunded mandate that will not be passed silently in the \ndead of night.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to urge my \ncolleagues to support the motion for cloture to proceed to S. 150, the \nInternet Tax Nondiscrimination Act. This bill does have strong \nbipartisan support.\n  Let me say a few things in response to my good friend, the junior \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Carper. If those who oppose this measure \nwant to extend the moratorium, why are we having this debate tonight? \nWhy are we going to have to have a motion for cloture on moving to \nproceed on the bill?\n  I agree that we should do no harm. Those who are for this measure \nwant to prevent harm to consumers so that they are not loaded up with \ntaxes from State and local governments. I will get into the details of \nthat in my remarks.\n  The cost, the so-called unfunded mandate aspect of this is a very \nsmall amount in the scheme of things, $80 to $120 million, then another \n$40 million for the taxing of DSL. Updates in the new technologies need \nto be made in the definition of Internet access to make sure DSL and \ndigital subscriber lines using telephone lines get high-speed Internet \naccess or broadband. We need to have that changed to make sure the \nfolks at the State and local level recognize that there has been an \nupdate and upgrade, there have been advancements in technology in the \ntransport of the Internet, particularly broadband, but DSL lines should \nnot be subject to taxation.\n  The intent of the first Internet tax moratorium was to make sure the \nInternet was free of taxation. The Internet is a freeway. If you want \naccess to information, you click on. Now that transport is being taxed. \nWho pays? The consumer pays.\n  I will use an analogy. Now we have a freeway. You are going to \nCharlotte, NC, from Washington, DC, you get on Interstate 95 and switch \nover to Interstate 85. It is a freeway. Then you get off on an exit to \nwherever you want to get in the city of Charlotte, NC.\n  The advocates of taxing the Internet and those who oppose S. 150 \nwould like to turn that freeway into the New Jersey Turnpike, a toll \nroad.\n  Clearly, the consumer getting that information on the backbone of the \nInternet is going to have to pay for it, increasing their costs.\n  Companion legislation was passed by the House 8 months ago. My \ncolleagues have heard me say on many occasions, I believe what we ought \nto be advocating in the Senate, in the Congress, at the Federal level, \nand every level of government in the United States of America, are \npolicies that allow people to compete and succeed. That means tax \npolicy, regulatory policies that promote freedom and opportunity for \nall Americans. We ought to, as leaders, be advancing ideas that help \ncreate more investment, creating, thereby, more jobs and more \nprosperity rather than more burdens of taxation and regulation.\n  Senator Wyden from Oregon and I joined together early last year with \nthis bill. We want to make sure there is equal access to the Internet \nfor all consumers and also protect e-commerce transactions from \ndiscriminatory taxes or multiple taxes. The Internet is one of the \ngreatest tools invented by this country. It is a symbol and an actual \ntool of innovation and individual empowerment. Accordingly, I would \nthink everyone in the Senate would want to help the Internet continue \nto grow and flourish as a valuable tool for commerce, for information, \nfor education.\n  However, as of November 1 of last year, the Federal moratorium, which \nwas originally enacted in 1998--and Senator Wyden was a key sponsor of \nthat measure--expired, leaving consumers vulnerable to harmful \nregressive and discriminatory taxes for the first time in 6 years.\n  If the Senate does not act now and move to consider S. 150, it is \nunlikely we will get another chance in this election year. If we do not \ninvoke cloture, the Senate will be known as a Senate that favors new \ntaxes on the Internet; the Senate that turned a blind eye; and a Senate \nthat limited individual opportunity while enabling harmful, regressive \ntaxation of access to the Internet.\n\n  When Senator Wyden and I introduced this legislation over a year ago, \nit was consistent with the founding principles of the original \nmoratorium that the Internet ought to remain as accessible as possible \nto all people in all parts of the country forever. Unfortunately, in \nthe last year of debate, the focus has shifted away from that \nprinciple, causing unnecessary confusion and delay.\n  Let me be clear, this legislation is not about tax breaks for \ntelecommunications companies. It is not about mayors and Governors. It \nis certainly not about the 1994 Republican revolution that has \nabsolutely nothing to do with traditional telephone calls migrating to \nthe Internet. Rather, our legislation has everything to do with \nconsumers and the impact of taxation on real people and our American \neconomy.\n  All of the protax arguments and misleading accusations presented by \nthe opposition are unrelated distractions aimed at confusing Senators \nand stalling consideration of this very important measure. In fact, the \nissue is not about telephone services migrating to the Internet. \nRather, it is the ongoing campaign by State and local tax lobbyists to \nmake sure telephone taxes, which average 15 to 18 percent, migrate to \nthe Internet.\n  I ask my colleagues and anyone else who might be listening to think \nof their telephone bill. Think of the bill you receive each month with \nall sorts of taxes included--usually multiple local taxes, State taxes, \nas well as Federal taxes.\n  In effect, the opponents of our measure would have our monthly \nInternet service provider bill be loaded down with all those taxes, as \non our telephone bill.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would the distinguished Senator from Virginia yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for an excellent presentation.\n  Is it not correct that in the late 1990s we heard the same kind of \narguments we are hearing today, that the States and localities would be \nbereft of revenue, and there would be financial calamity? Is it not \ncorrect in 1997, 1998, the National Governors Association said the \nState and local revenue system would collapse, and that very next year \nrevenue went up something like $7 billion? Was that not the history all \nthrough this debate over the last 6 or 7 years, that we have had the \nprojections from State and local officials that there would be \ndisastrous financial consequences, and then you and I and Senator \nSununu would look a short time later, and every single time revenue \nwent up; is that correct?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to my friend, the Senator from Oregon, he is exactly \ncorrect.\n  I recollect back in 1997, I was Governor of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia when Senator Wyden and Congressman Chris Cox of California \nintroduced this measure. I was one of four Governors who believed this \nwas clearly interstate commerce. If there is anything that is \ninterstate in nature by its architecture, design, and engineering, it \nis the Internet. I thought we ought to have a national policy, that it \nbe more ubiquitous or more available, understanding that taxation harms \nit.\n  I believed, as did the Senator from Oregon and Senator Sununu, this \nwould be a great engine for innovation, growth, investment, and jobs. \nThat is exactly what happened.\n  The amount of revenues lost by those first, most avaricious, those \ndesiring to go in and start taxing at the local and State level, is \nvery small.\n  But if you look at the economic growth led by the Internet, and the \nrevenues that came after it--and it does not have to be a technology \nbusiness; it could be a mom-and-pop startup business; it could be a \nmajor corporation; it could be somebody working from their home on \neBay--you see the revenue growth, you see more jobs and, therefore, \nmore revenue for the Government.\n  So when you look at the effect of the localities and States not being \nable to tax this interstate commerce, you find that it actually has \nbeen beneficial for the economy. The lost revenues are very small. In \nfact, there were about 10 States, I believe it was, that were\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\ngrandfathered in that had already started taxing prior to 1998. About \nthree-quarters of those States are still taxing Internet access.\n  Six years later, you would figure they would wean themselves off of \nit. But there were about a quarter of these States--South Carolina, \nConnecticut, Iowa and the District of Columbia, and others--that have \nsaid: Gosh, this is harmful. This makes our jurisdiction, our State \nless attractive for investment and jobs, and it is bad for our \ncitizens, and they voluntarily stopped taxing the Internet.\n  The reality is, all of these fiscal impacts that we hear of are so \nfarfetched. In fact, the CBO confirmed that our opponents and the State \ntax agencies have overstated the revenue impact of this clarification \nto make sure that DSL and broadband is not taxed. They overstated it by \n100 times. The fiscal impact, if you throw them all together, at best, \nwould be $200 million. Across the whole country, our opponents are \nsaying it is going to cost $20 billion.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, will the Senator from Virginia yield for \na question?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I am happy to yield to my friend from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. The Senator from Virginia has mentioned those 10 or 12 \nStates that were grandfathered under the original Internet tax \nmoratorium. I think it is important to understand--because the \nopponents have claimed there is an unfunded mandate--isn't the only \nreason the Congressional Budget Office will score an unfunded mandate \nbecause those 10 or 12 States were grandfathered in the first place? In \nother words, if we had not made any effort to allow those States to \ncontinue to collect some taxes on Internet access, there would be no \nunfunded mandate because those taxes would have been eliminated, as one \nmight argue they should have been in the first place? But isn't that \nthe only reason there is a so-called unfunded mandate in the first \nplace?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, he is \nexactly correct. The unfunded mandate aspect of this is a kind of \nperverse reasoning because the States that were grandfathered back in \n1998 have yet to wean themselves off of this tax on Internet access. We \nare actually giving them, in our measure, 3 more years, and that is a \nloss of revenue to them? Then there are those in the last couple years \nthat have made rulings that are taxing the backbone or the transport, \nmore importantly, the high speed transport or broadband. That is about \n$40 million. So the point is, they have had plenty of time to wean \nthemselves off of this tax, and we are actually going to give them even \nmore time.\n  Also, it is not unprecedented for Congress to recognize the \nimportance of a coherent national policy regarding matters of \ninterstate commerce. In 1973, States were prohibited from imposing a \ntax, a fee, or a head charge on all air commerce. In 1985, Senator Bob \nDole led a measure affecting food stamp purchases. States were putting \nsales taxes on food stamp purchases, and Senator Dole introduced a \nbill, and it passed in 1985, prohibiting States from imposing sales \ntaxes on food stamp purchases.\n  Most recently as we were passing the Medicare drug bill this last \nwinter, just a few months ago, Congress prohibited States from imposing \ninsurance premium taxes on drug insurance policies. The fiscal impact \nof that was approximately $60 million.\n\n  Now, in the last 10 years, of course, the Internet has grown, with \nthe policy of our country that we would not tax it. We wanted it to \nflourish, to grow, and provide opportunities for individuals. What our \nopponents will have us do, though, is--again, remember, they want to \nhave unelected tax administrators or local and State governments to tax \nthe Internet backbone or, for that matter, high-speed or broadband \ntelephone service.\n  Let me speak about everyone's telephone bill. Look at all those taxes \non it. This is why the moratorium is so essential, that we stop them \nfrom taxing anymore than they are now, and wean them off.\n  Realize it is nearly impossible to repeal taxes because--do you know \nwhat?--on your telephone bill, for every single citizen, every single \nperson in America who has telephone service, part of those taxes that \nyou are paying is a luxury tax that was put on 105 years ago as a \nluxury tax on telephone service to finance the Spanish American War. \nGuess what? We are still paying it. That war has been over for over 100 \nyears and we won. Yet we are still paying that tax.\n  That is why it is important, number one, to wean the few States and \nlocalities off of this negative, burdensome tax on opportunity and \nfreedom but also to stop it from happening in the future.\n  The President of the United States, on numerous occasions--recently, \nin New Mexico, in Michigan, in Minnesota--has stated a goal for this \ncountry, in the year 2007--which is also the 400th anniversary of the \nfounding of Jamestown by the Virginia Company--he wants to have \neveryone in this country having access to broadband.\n  Broadband is essential for rural areas. I know in southwestern \nVirginia, in Southside Virginia, in any rural areas in this country, \nthey look at having broadband, high-speed Internet access as key to \ntheir young people having opportunities--whether it is educational \nopportunities or health care with telemedicine, or for small businesses \nto be able to be competing internationally, as opposed to young people \nhaving to leave their home and their roots and their heritage to find \njobs elsewhere.\n  It is the President's view that we are falling behind--and we are \nfalling behind--other countries as far as broadband and high-speed \naccess. You see a disparity, one based on income. Every study and \nanybody with a scintilla of common sense will understand, if you tax \nsomething, fewer people can afford it. Those who are lower income or \nlower middle income cannot afford it. Every study--by Pew and others--\nshows that the cost of Internet access is the reason for them not being \nonline. For broadband, if you want to get broadband deployed and \navailable in rural areas, and have competition and choice for \ncustomers, clearly DSL will be an approach, wireless will be an \napproach, maybe satellites. Most cannot use a cable modem because there \nis just a lot of dirt to dig to get to many rural areas that are \nsparsely populated.\n  The fact is, the most recent studies show there is a disparity not \nonly in the economic digital divide, which manifests itself with \nHispanic Americans and African Americans, but also rural versus city \nareas. City areas have almost three times as much utilization and use \nof broadband in their homes than out in the country in rural areas. \nBroadband deployment is only 10 percent in rural areas while it is over \n28 percent in city or suburban-city areas.\n  For rural areas to be able to compete, and for the vitality of their \nfuture, adding a 15- to 18-percent tax--these are the \ntelecommunications taxes that our opponents would impose--will diminish \nthe availability of the Internet. That 15- to 18-percent tax means it \nis going to take more money to get broadband access to those people, \nand fewer people will be able to access it. Therefore, the investors \nwill not invest the money to get into that community.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, will the Senator from Virginia yield for \none additional question?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I am happy to yield to my friend from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, the Senator from Virginia is talking \nabout the kind of Internet access-specific taxes that the opponents of \nthis bill would like to apply. There are a number of States that are \ntaxing Internet access today. There are a handful of others that have \nbegun to tax DSL and other forms of broadband. These are all taxes that \nare unique to Internet access. Yet the opponents continue to suggest \nthat there is a subsidy involved here.\n\n  I want to ask the Senator from Virginia to clarify this point because \nI can't think of any taxes that are applied broadly from which this \nbill would exempt Internet access providers. Isn't it true that if you \nare an Internet access provider, you would still have to have pay State \npayroll taxes?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Yes, you would still have to pay corporate taxes, State \npayroll taxes.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Would they be subject to capital gains taxes in those \nStates where it was applicable?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Yes, they would.\n\n[[Page S4359]]\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Would they have to pay property taxes in those States \nwhere they owned property and operated facilities?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Absolutely, they would have to pay those taxes.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. If there were an Internet transaction that was selling a \ngood within a State that had a sales tax, just like a mail order \nproduct, wouldn't they be responsible for the applicable sales taxes in \nthose States?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Sales and use taxes, if they have a physical presence in \nthat State, yes, they would have to collect and remit those taxes.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Would the Senator agree that there are no taxes that are \nbeing applied uniformly or broadly in States that these Internet access \nproviders would be exempted from? This is a bill that simply avoids \ndiscriminatory taxes that single out Internet access or multiple \ntaxation where you can have taxes levied at the State level and the \ncounty level and the city level; isn't that the ultimate goal of the \nbill?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I would say to the Senator from New Hampshire, he has it \nexactly correct, as well as protecting consumers from access taxes. The \nSenator from New Hampshire understands this issue very well. Maybe the \nopponents would like to stop these delay-of-game tactics so we can \nactually get to protecting the people.\n  I find it interesting--and as I said, this has nothing to do with \nsubsidies of telecommunications companies--that virtually every Senator \nwill say, let's figure out subsidies; let's figure out tax breaks to \nget broadband to rural areas. Why would you want to have subsidies and \nexpenditures and then on the other hand say, let's tax it, when you are \ntrying to get more people utilizing and having access to broadband for \na variety of reasons?\n  I see the chairman of the Commerce Committee has arrived. I will \nsimply say, the United States has been a leader for freedom. We are \nfalling behind other countries in broadband, its deployment, and its \nuse to Asian and European countries. Simply put, taxes on access to the \nInternet reduce the number of consumers who can afford to purchase this \nservice, thereby limiting opportunities for millions of Americans. \nReduction of demand will stifle investment in rural and underserved \nareas. It will slow the deployment of the next-generation broadband \ntechnologies.\n  I urge, most respectfully, my colleagues to stand on the side of \nfreedom, embrace innovation and improvement, and not tax this tool for \nindividual empowerment and opportunity. I urge my colleagues to support \ncloture on the motion to proceed. It is a motion to proceed for \nopportunity and for freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from California if \nshe would like to take 5 minutes. I know she has been patiently \nwaiting.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to speak after the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from California. I appreciate her \npatience and hope she is able to speak, as I know she has strong \nbeliefs on this issue.\n  Over 5 years ago, Congress took appropriate action to pass the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act which encouraged the growth and adoption of \nthe Internet by exempting Internet access from State and local taxation \nand by protecting e-commerce transactions from multiple or \ndiscriminatory taxes. As my colleagues know, since then the Internet \nhas grown from a tool used by a relatively small percentage of our \npopulation to a broadly utilized communications, information, \nentertainment, and commercial medium as well as an important vehicle \nfor political participation.\n  To keep promoting the growth of the Internet, many of my colleagues \nhave made efforts to extend the Internet tax moratorium. Regrettably \nthese efforts have stalled. Six months ago, we left unfinished business \nbefore the Senate. At the time, many of us were prepared to vote to \nextend the Internet tax moratorium. Unfortunately, a vote never took \nplace because of disagreement over what components of Internet access \nshould be free from taxation and how long the moratorium should last. \nAs a result, the moratorium expired and State and local governments are \nnow free to impose new taxes on the Internet.\n  Today, we return to the consideration of S. 150, the Internet Tax \nNondiscrimination Act, which would permanently extend the moratorium on \nthe taxation of Internet access. After 10 months of negotiations, there \nis still no clear consensus in the Senate over what types of Internet \naccess services should be tax free, nor is there any clear consensus \nover how long the moratorium should last. One thing is clear, though: \nThere is broad agreement that the Internet tax moratorium should be \nreinstated. It is also clear that the Members who have been involved in \nthis long negotiation process have listened closely to the concerns of \nState and local governments.\n  For example, to address issues raised by opponents of S. 150, \nSenators Allen, Wyden, Sununu, Ensign, Warner, Smith, Leahy, Grassley, \nBaucus, Hatch, Boxer, Chambliss, Lincoln and I--a strongly bipartisan \neffort--offered a substitute amendment that would have narrowed the \nscope of the moratorium and clarified its effects on State and local \nrevenues. This time around, we will go a significant step further by \noffering a compromise amendment written to address the core concerns \nexpressed by State and local governments over the extension of the \nInternet tax moratorium.\n  Before I get into the details of the amendment, let me be crystal \nclear about one thing: This compromise will not make everyone 100 \npercent happy. There are several aspects that will accommodate State \nand local governments, but the legislation also contains components \nthat are favored by industry and ultimately benefit consumers. So there \ncontinue to be disagreements.\n  The Members who sit on the edges of this debate bell curve will \ncontinue to oppose anything that falls short of their desired outcome. \nHowever, any practical person who reads the amendment objectively will \nhave to agree. What we are offering constitutes a reasonable middle \nground in the debate between those who want to make the Internet tax \nmoratorium permanent and broad and those who want to make the \nmoratorium brief and narrow.\n  Throughout the negotiation process, State and local groups asked for \na temporary extension to the Internet tax moratorium. Specifically, \nthey have asked for a 2-year extension of the moratorium. The \nsubstitute amendment would extend the moratorium for 4 years from \nNovember 1, 2003. This alone is an extraordinary concession, especially \nconsidering the fact that the House of Representatives, in a strongly \nbipartisan effort, passed a permanent extension of the moratorium last \nyear, and there remains significant support in the Senate for such a \nmeasure.\n\n  President Bush has expressed his strong support for a permanent \nextension of the moratorium. Nevertheless, I hope my colleagues who \nfavor a permanent moratorium will support this proposal in an effort to \nreach an acceptable compromise between industry and consumers and State \nand local governments.\n  Another concern we have heard from State and local governments is \nthat extending the Internet tax moratorium would somehow impact \ntraditional telephone services. That certainly was never the intent of \nthe original legislation, as has been made clear by the Commerce \nCommittee's report accompanying the bill.\n  The report reads:\n\n       The modified definition [of Internet access] would not \n     affect the taxability of voice telephony over the public \n     switched telephone network (so-called ``plain old telephone \n     service'' or ``POTS'').\n\n  The matter is further clarified in this amendment. Simply put, this \nlegislation would not impact in any way, shape, or form the revenue \ngenerated by State and local governments from traditional phone \nservices. Again, a concern of State and local governments was \naccommodated to the full satisfaction of State and local authorities.\n  State and local governments have also expressed worry that this bill \nwould hamper their ability to tax voice services and other services \nthat run over the Internet.\n  For example, the National Governors Association has stated that one \nof its main concerns is that this legislation will prohibit states and \nlocalities from taxing telephone services as they migrate to the \nInternet. The Senators\n\n[[Page S4360]]\n\nfrom Tennessee and Ohio today have also emphasized that this is one of \ntheir three core concerns in this debate. In an attempt to respond to \nthe concern about the migration of telephone services to the Internet, \nSenators Allen and Alexander agreed in principle to carve voice over \nInternet Protocol, VOIP, telephon services out of the scope of the \nInternet tax moratorium. Unfortunately, their negotiations over the \nprecise definition of VOIP telephone services were not successful.\n  The amendment that I offer bridges the gap in this matter by setting \nforth a broad definition of services--including voice services--that \nare provided over the Internet that would not be considered Internet \naccess and would therefore not be subject to the Internet tax \nmoratorium. My compromise would further narrow the definition of \nInternet access, while ensuring that services incidental to Internet \naccess--such as e-mail and instant messaging--would remain tax-free. \nOnce again, this provision fully addresses the concerns of state and \nlocal governments.\n  Mr. President, the list of compromises goes on and on. For example, \nmy amendment would clarify that the Internet tax moratorium does not \napply to nontransactional taxes such as taxes on net income, net worth, \nor property value.\n  My amendment would clarify that otherwise taxable services would not \nbecome tax-free solely because they are offered as a package with \nInternet access.\n  The amendment would grandfather for three years from November 1, \n2003, the States that were taxing Internet access in October 1998.\n  My amendment would grandfather for two years from November 1, 2003, \nthe States that began to tax--according to many, improperly--Internet \naccess after October 1998.\n  The amendment would ensure that universal service would not be \naffected by the moratorium.\n  And finally, my amendment would ensure that 911 and E-911 services \nwould not be affected by the moratorium.\n  Each of the compromise provisions is included in direct response to \nState and local government concerns about S. 150. And so my amendment \nwill ensure that the $20 billion in telecommunications taxes that is \ncollected annually by State and local governments will largely remain \nprotected. Any statement to the contrary would be patently false.\n  Mr. President, my amendment goes a long way to meeting the concerns \nof the States and localities. However, before those on the other side \nof this debate start to protest, I would remind them that what I am \nproposing is truly a compromise between the interests of State and \nlocal governments on the one side and industry and consumers on the \nother. This legislation therefore doesn't--and, as a compromise, \ncan't--adopt the State and local governments' position wholesale.\n  For that reason, the legislation would make Internet access 100 \npercent tax-free for all States in its fourth year.\n  Some question whether it's wise for Congress to make Internet access \ntax free, but this body has a long history of giving tax incentives and \nother economic support to industries and commercial activities that we \nbelieve help our society. The Internet is clearly a technology that \nalso merits strongly the support of Government, as it is a source of \nand vehicle for significant economic benefits to our country.\n  Contrary to statements that have been made on the floor, yes, the \nrailroads were assisted; yes, highways are assisted; yes, our airlines \ncontinue to be subsidized; and yes, we need to assist this new \nincredible technology that is changing America and the world.\n  In the case of the Internet tax moratorium, however, we are not \ntalking about subsidies. We are merely talking about a national policy \nof taking a hands-off approach to the continued growth of the Internet. \nThe Internet is now accessed at home by 75 percent of the population--\nan estimated 204 million people in the U.S.--up from 64 percent in \n2002, and 26 percent in 1998 when Congress rightly decided to implement \nthe ban on taxes on Internet access. That's an impressive 3 times what \nthe Internet use rate was just over 5 years ago. And though the \nInternet tax moratorium has obviously had its intended effect of \ncontributing to the growth of the Internet, our job is not yet done.\n  Today, the Internet offers the promise of broadband access services, \nwhich provide higher bandwidth connections that permit faster data \ntransmissions and thus facilitate and enhance services such as \nstreaming audio and video. Nevertheless, many of the households with \nInternet access have only basic dial-up access, and have not migrated \nto broadband services. In fact, the Pew Internet Project estimates that \nonly 24 percent of American households have broadband access, while \nmost homes still connect through dial-up modem connections. In fact, \nthe United States is falling behind many other developed countries such \nas Japan, South Korea, and Canada in our deployment of broadband \nservices--and many experts even call the broadband services that we \nhave ``broadband on training wheels'' because they do not provide the \nspeeds provided by the broadband networks of other nations.\n  Clearly, there remains a strong need to ensure that taxes on Internet \naccess will not pose a hurdle to the continued adoption of basic dial-\nup access or to the migration from basic Internet access to broadband \nInternet access. Keeping the Internet tax-free translates into lower \ncosts for consumers, and lower costs give our citizens freer access to \nimportant online services like telemedicine and e-learning.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator for his \ntenacity. Typically, he wants to work to find a compromise that can \nsatisfy both sides. I think he has done that. I am sure there are those \non both sides of the issue and the aisle who may not feel this is \nperfect, but they will have an opportunity, when we get on the \nlegislation--the substance of it, as this is a vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed--they will be able to offer \namendments.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for what he has done. I urge my \ncolleagues to certainly support this motion on cloture and allow us to \nget to the substance of the bill and to be able to reach conclusion on \nthis important issue. So I recognize the Senator's efforts.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi. I \nthank him for his involvement in this issue. As everyone knows, he is a \ngenius at working his way through difficult and thorny issues. I \nappreciate his involvement in seeking to try to resolve differences \nbetween the two sides--at least to a point where we can move forward. I \nlook forward to his continued assistance as we address this issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n   Mr. McCAIN. Wider adoption of broadband services could also \ntranslate into economic growth and greater job creation for our \ncountry. I would suggest then that, as States and localities are \nshoring up their budgets and increasing their tax revenues after a few \nyears of budget shortfalls, we should not move to stifle economic \ngrowth by taxing the Internet.\n   But this debate isn't just about the economic benefits of affordable \nInternet access. During my presidential candidacy, one of the many \nrewarding experiences I had was seeing how the Internet served as a \nmedium for political participation. Hundreds of thousands of people \nlogged on to my campaign Web site where they were able to access \ninformation and organize. For me, keeping Internet access tax-free is \nabout protecting consumers' wallets and about helping our Nation's \neconomy, but it also is about improving our political process and the \nright and ability of our citizens to participate fully in that process.\n   Because my amendment is not one-sided, I know that a few of my \ncolleagues who have been firmly on one side of this debate or the other \nwill not join us in this compromise. Some of my colleagues, for \nexample, believe that Internet access should receive little--if any--\nprotection from taxation. We have heard statements from some on that \nside that my amendment is not a true compromise, which both boggles the \nmind and indicates that for some in this debate the attitude is ``my \nway or\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\nthe highway.'' Others I'm sure continue to believe that all data \ntransmissions over the Internet--including VoIP services--should be \ntax-free. But I ask those Members who see merits to both sides of this \ndebate to join me in this effort to break the deadlock that has delayed \naction on this matter for far too long. Doing so will not only strike a \nfair balance in this debate, but it will also clarify the confusion \nthat has been hanging over the tax treatment of Internet access for \nseveral months.\n   Mr. President, for all of the reasons stated, I urge my colleagues \nto vote in support of cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 150 and in \nfavor of the Internet tax compromise that I will offer. I trust that we \nwill add this measure to the long line of pro-consumer legislation we \nhave passed during this Congress--including the Do-Not-Call registry \nlegislation. I hope that we will again join together to give American \nconsumers affordable access to the Internet, which we all agree is a \ncrucial medium of communications, education, commerce, and political \nparticipation in America.\n  Again, I will summarize. This proposal is a temporary 4-year \nmoratorium, which makes the Internet access 100 percent tax free, but \nnarrows the definition of ``Internet access'' by excluding traditional \ntelephone service, and it further narrows the definition of Internet \naccess by carving out voice and other services provided over the \nInternet, while ensuring that services incidental to Internet access, \nsuch as e-mail and instant messaging, remain free.\n  My amendment grandfathers States that were taxing Internet access in \n1998 for a 3-year period. It grandfathers States that currently tax \nInternet access, including those that tax the last mile that were not \nprotected by the 1998 grandfather clause, for a 2-year period, and it \nincorporates all other components of the substitute amendment to S. 150 \nand the Alexander Internet tax bill, the accounting rule to address \nbundling, and the explicit inclusion of nontransitional taxes from the \nInternet tax moratorium and savings clauses addressing the regulation \nof Internet access, universal service, and e-911.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 5:30 p.m. having arrived, under \nthe previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the \nSenate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 353, S. 150, a bill to make permanent \n     the moratorium on taxes on Internet access and multiple and \n     discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce imposed by the \n     Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n         Bill Frist, George Allen, Jon Kyl, Orrin Hatch, James \n           Inhofe, Elizabeth Dole, Larry Craig, John Ensign, \n           Gordon Smith, Mitch McConnell, Norm Coleman, Sam \n           Brownback, Trent Lott, Conrad Burns, Jim Talent, John \n           E.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 150, the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, \nshall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the \nrule. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n   Mr. McCONNELL.

(Ms. Murkowski.) On this vote, the yeas are \n74, the nays are 11. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank all of my colleagues for their \nvote. It is certainly a signal that a majority of Senators want to move \nforward and address this issue. I believe many believe they would like \nto get involved as well.\n  If the opponents are going to talk for a while, after that is over, \nsince we are in 30 hours of postcloture debate, if it is sought to be \nused, it is my intention to propose tomorrow the amendment which I \ndescribed earlier. I hope we can then move forward with amendments and \ndebate and votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I defer to the leadership. I \nhave some remarks to make on another subject as in morning business, to \ncome out of my hour with regard to the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senators who are concerned about this \nlegislation are trying to make a decision as to what is going to happen \nnext, what they are going to do next. It would be to everyone's best \ninterests if we had some time when we could go to the bill tomorrow.\n  I direct this question through the Chair to the Senator from \nTennessee: When do you think you will be in a position to decide \nwhether we can have a time certain to go to the bill or whether we will \nwork off the 30 hours postcloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the assistant Democratic \nleader. I thank Senator McCain for his efforts over the weekend to \ndevelop a substitute amendment which we received this afternoon and \nwhich we are studying.\n  My hope is we have a constructive movement toward a result this week \nthat does no harm to States, that bans State and local taxes for a \nshort period of time, and that gives Congress time through the Commerce \nCommittee to create a comprehensive approach.\n  The leadership has asked us to try to do this in an orderly way. I \nwant to do that. I have two or three Senators to discuss that with in \nthe next 30 minutes or hour. The Senator from California has remarks \nshe would like to make, so I say to the assistant Democratic leader, \nwithin the next 30 minutes or hour I will have a response to him and \nthe majority leader about how we would like to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida still has the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S4362]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I was simply going to observe now that \nwe have had the cloture vote on a motion to proceed, there is a 30-hour \nperiod postcloture. My expectation is we would go on this bill at some \npoint tomorrow. My hope is it would be at 2:15, for example, following \nthe caucus meetings tomorrow. However, that is a decision those who \noppose the cloture motion will want to address.\n  The bill we are going to be considering in the Senate is a piece of \nlegislation that came out of the Commerce Committee. When it came out \nof the Commerce Committee, it had one area that was not resolved. We \nunderstood when we voted it out it was not resolved. It could have some \nvery significant ramifications on State and local revenue base and \nother issues. We decided to try to resolve it on the way to the floor. \nIt is not yet resolved. As a result, it will require substantial work--\namendments, debate, some compromise here and there--to see if we cannot \nget a piece of legislation that does what all of us want it to do; that \nis, to have a moratorium on the taxation of access to the Internet but \ndone in a way with respect to definitions that is not going to have \nloopholes big enough to drive trucks through.\n  There have been circumstances in which if you have a definition that \nis not appropriate and not carefully crafted, the moratorium on taxing \nthe Internet itself could be a moratorium on taxing a wide range of \nproducts that are already taxed. We are going to have to work through \nthis in the coming days.\n\n  I would like to see us work in a cooperative way and get on the bill \nand find a way to find some middle ground that accomplishes the \nobjectives we all have. Speaking for myself, I supported the moratorium \npreviously. I support a moratorium now. But it must be done in a manner \nthat is consistent with definitions we all understand and one that \naccomplishes the objectives we all set when we wanted to pass this \nlegislation in the first instance.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from Florida yielding.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, we are not on the bill, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                               Venezuela\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, while we are getting all of \nour ducks in order with regard to the procedure and there is this \nmomentary lull in the consideration of the instant legislation, I rise \nto discuss conditions facing the United States with regard to an \nimportant neighbor of ours in this hemisphere; that is, Venezuela.\n  Venezuela is a country in deep crisis. I worry, as has been the case \nwith so many of our neighbors to the south, that it is not getting \nenough attention in relation to this crisis. We all should know the \nPresident of Venezuela, President Chavez, is right now the subject of a \npetition drive aimed at holding a referendum on a recall of his \nPresidency. That is provided for under section 72 of the Venezuelan \nConstitution. What is also well known is President Chavez and his \nallies have done everything in their power to make it impossible to \nhold a legitimate referendum.\n  A week ago I was in Venezuela. I spoke to numerous officials of the \nChavez government, including the Foreign Minister, the Energy Minister, \nthe Vice President of the National Assembly. I also spoke to leaders of \nthe opposition who have been leading the drive to hold a recall \nreferendum under the provisions of the Venezuela Constitution. This is \na recall on whether the President will continue in office.\n  In addition, I met with numerous business leaders from American \ncompanies, many in the energy sector, to hear their views on what is \nlikely to happen to Venezuela, what is going to happen to Venezuela-\nUnited States relations, and what our policy should be there.\n  Everyone I spoke with recommended the United States must strongly \nsupport a negotiation led by the OAS and the Carter Center aimed at \nresolving disputes related to holding the referendum. Typically, this \nwould not be a dispute. They have many more signatures than is required \nfor the referendum. However, an objection has been raised that \nsignatures are not accurate as to the people. That is easy to check.\n  I met with one of the mediators at the Carter Center who described to \nme the proposals his team and the OAS team had made to try to bridge \nthe gap between the Chavez government and the opposition. When I asked \nif anyone outside of the government, any of the opposition in the \nbusiness leaders actually think the Chavez government, and specifically \nPresident Chavez, will allow the continuation of this referendum to go \nforward, I got the same answer from all quarters. It was, ``No.''\n  Because of the way President Chavez has governed, because of the way \nhe has tried to silence opponents, it is widely believed he will never \nallow the recall referendum to go forward. I hope he will hear this \nchorus of concern being expressed now from the Senate that under \nsection 72 of the Venezuelan Constitution he should allow the process \nof democracy to work.\n  Just last week, the Venezuelan National Election Commission announced \nprocedures for conducting the reparos--the verification of over 1 \nmillion disputed signatures on the original recall petitions. For a few \ndays at the end of May, those who signed the petitions will have the \nopportunity to come forward and present evidence that verifies their \nsignature.\n  It is a cumbersome process. Even if it works perfectly, and even if \nthe signatures are legitimate, there may not be enough time to verify \nthem all. That is another concern, that the process is being drug out \npurposely, so as to avoid the timeframes involved. But even worse, \nthere is so little trust being expressed that the Chavez government is \ngoing to conduct the process fairly that the effort may be doomed even \nbefore it starts.\n  This political crisis, which has been going on in one form or another \nin Venezuela for 3 or 4 years, leaves me deeply concerned about the \ndirection of Venezuela and the prospects for its democracy. It is a \ntragedy that a country of such enormous promise, with vast natural \nresources, and a vibrant entrepreneurial population and well-\nmodernized, could find itself in such a dire circumstance.\n  I am afraid that the United States is not doing enough to make clear \nhow much we have at stake in the protection of democracy in Venezuela. \nWith a recent United Nations report indicating that a majority of the \npeople in Latin America have their doubts about the value of democracy, \nwe cannot afford to leave any doubt about where we, the United States, \nstand and what our policy is. I think we also have reason to worry \nabout the impact on the economy in our hemisphere of a major oil \nsupplier to the United States, the fourth largest supplier to the \nUnited States; we have to be concerned. What about the interests of the \nUnited States if suddenly Venezuela were destabilized?\n  That is why I was so impressed with the impact that a statement by \nSenator John Kerry had on both the Government and the opposition in \nVenezuela. Senator Kerry's call for strong U.S. support for the \nOrganization of American States and the Carter Center process genuinely \nshook up the Chavez government, and it gave renewed hope to the \nopposition.\n  Without a sustained push by the United States at its highest levels, \nI have grave doubts that President Chavez will ever permit the \nreferendum. Senator Kerry made this statement, much to the delight of \nthe opposition in Venezuela, on March 19 of this year. It is a very \nstrong statement on reform that is needed, and how the Chavez \ngovernment needs to get behind democracy and stop the kind of direct \nattacks on the United States in which it is engaging.\n  Now, other nations to which the United States should be reaching out, \nto use their influence as well: Brazil, Chile, Spain, and France, are \nall, in some respects, better positioned than the United States to try \nto influence the Venezuelan Government. But those states need to see \nsustained leadership from the United States.\n  The threat to democracy in Venezuela is not, by any means, the only \nreason for our concern. President Chavez has caused us a number of \nother headaches recently. He struck up a close alliance with Fidel \nCastro. He has started to strike up an alliance with a\n\n[[Page S4363]]\n\ngentleman named Morales in Bolivia who is trying to expand the drug \ntrade in Bolivia. And there is extensive evidence of cooperation \nbetween Cuban and Venezuelan intelligence services. There is also the \nemployment of a great number of Cuban nationals in Venezuela.\n\n  Venezuela has provided assistance or, at a minimum, safe haven to \neven those who are drug runners, such as the FARC, a group that \nbasically is involved in the drug trade, fighting the legitimate \nGovernment of Colombia. And the FARC continues to conduct a terrorist \ncampaign against the Government and the people of Colombia. At a time \nwhen Colombia is making slow but steady gains in its long struggle \nagainst the FARC, the last thing it needs is to have a neighboring \npower; namely, Venezuela, give assistance to this brutal adversary, as \nthey would go across the line into Venezuela.\n  President Chavez has also made some truly outrageous statements, such \nas praising Iraqi insurgents who attack American soldiers. He has also \ntried to use his oil supply relationship to have a lever on the small \nnations in the Caribbean to get them to oppose U.S. policies. And \nPresident Chavez has threatened to cut off oil exports to the United \nStates.\n  Venezuela also suffers from a potent market in false documentation, \nsuch as passports and other identity cards. I am becoming increasingly \nconcerned at the ease, by paying $800 or $900, of getting full \ndocumentation of everything from a passport to a driver's license, all \nof which is legitimate, simply by buying off officials. I am certainly \nconcerned that international terrorist groups will discover their \nability to acquire and make use of forged Venezuela documents to \nconduct terrorist attacks.\n  We may have a net set up to try to protect people from coming into \nour borders, but Venezuelans can travel on their documents to European \ncountries. And that begins to start the process of mischief. The \nVenezuelan Government is not doing nearly enough to put a stop to this \npractice.\n  I had a friendly meeting with the Foreign Minister, and I raised all \nof these concerns with him. He said, with regard to the forged \ndocuments that are legion in Venezuela, that he was not aware of the \nproblem. But 3 days after I left, the Government announced the arrest \nof nine people for trafficking in forged documents. I hope that is the \nbeginning of a crackdown. If that is the case, I thank the Foreign \nMinister of Venezuela for taking my comments to heart.\n  You can see that the whole picture adds up to a very disturbing \nconclusion. If things do not improve soon, I worry that we may \neventually reach the point where we have to treat this Venezuelan \nGovernment as an unfriendly government that is hostile to U.S. \ninterests. That is not what I want. And I do not think that is what the \nU.S. Government wants. In the interest of fostering free and fair \nelections and democracy in all of Latin America, that certainly is not \nwhat we want, that is not what the Organization of American States \nwants, but that seams the direction in which we are headed. That is one \nof the reasons for me making this statement to my colleagues in the \nSenate.\n  If those deteriorating relations between our governments continue, \nthat would be a tragedy for a longtime ally, and it would represent a \nreversal of the longstanding good relationship the United States and \nVenezuela have had.\n  At this stage we cannot be anything but clear with the Venezuelan \nGovernment about the direction this relationship is headed. If \nVenezuela's democracy continues to be undermined by its Government, if \nPresident Chavez continues to side with those who are trying to be \nadversaries to the United States, and if Venezuela does not prove \nitself to be a reliable ally in the war on terrorism, if Venezuela does \nnot continue to abide by its own constitution, then we will scarcely be \nable to draw any other conclusion from these actions.\n  For this reason, I commend Senator Kerry for making crystal clear, in \nhis statement of March 19 of this year, what the stakes are. He has \nmade certain that no Venezuelan official can doubt that if the present \ncourse continues, things will get no easier for them in a future Kerry \nadministration.\n  My hope is this knowledge will cause the current American \nadministration to make clear to President Chavez that our Government \nplaces a high priority on democracy, the rule of law, and responsible \nconduct in international relations, and that the Government of the \nUnited States will come down hard on the words and the deeds of the \nChavez government and that Chavez' failure in these areas--it will be \nmade clear--will have consequences, not only in his relations with us \nbut in his relations around the world.\n  This is a matter of grave importance when you consider how dependent \nwe are on foreign oil. That is one reason. We have always relied on \nthat oil coming out of Venezuela. So many of our refineries on the gulf \ncoast of the United States are established to handle the kind of oil \nwith its content to be able to refine it into American fuel. Many other \nrefineries in the world don't have that capability. So it is clearly in \nVenezuela's interest that they continue that commerce and continue good \nrelations with the United States.\n  I hope and pray our relations will improve and that we will get back \ninto the longstanding friendship we have had for years and years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to claim an hour under the \nmotion to proceed to speak on the bill.\n  Before I do, I compliment the Senator from Florida on his comments on \nVenezuela. He may not know this, but I had the pleasure of spending \nsome time in Venezuela when I was mayor, leading a delegation. We had a \nsister city relationship with Caracas. I saw the vibrancy of that \ndemocracy at that time. This was in the mid-1980s. All the progress \nthat had been made in the Bolivar nations and the closeness that \nexisted between Venezuela and our country, it was something very \nspecial to see. You could say, I think, that Venezuela led all the \nnations in terms of its relationship to us. So the deterioration of \nthat relationship is very much regretted by me. I associate myself with \nthe comments of the Senator from Florida and thank him very much for \nmaking them.\n  I wish to speak about a bill that I am not sure everybody understands \nvery well, let alone exactly what it is. There are essentially three \nbills floating around. One of them is S. 150. This is a permanent \nmeasure. It includes a 3-year grandfather on Internet access if the \ntaxes existed in 1998. That is the Allen-Wyden bill.\n  There is a McCain proposal that may be brought forward. And, as I \nunderstand it, in would last for 4 years. It includes a 3-year \ngrandfather on Internet access taxes that existed in 1998 and a 2-year \ngrandfather on Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL) taxes.\n  And there is the Alexander-Carper bill, of which I am a cosponsor. \nThis is a 2 year temporary moratorium that includes a 2-year \ngrandfather on Internet access taxes that were in place in 1998 and a \n2-year grandfather on DSL service.\n  What all that means is very difficult. The last time this bill was on \nthe floor was November 6 and 7 of last year. I remember coming to the \nfloor and saying I had been approached by more than a hundred \nCalifornia cities to oppose the bill. It was a deluge. I had never had \nthat kind of opposition from California cities before in my 12 years in \nthe Senate. That deluge has only increased.\n  Interestingly enough, I have not received a single letter from a \ntelephone company in support of any of these bills, which is very \ninteresting.\n  The most dominant voice has been the League of California Cities, \nfirefighters, labor. The League in particular represents over 470 \nCalifornia cities. These cities believe this bill, S. 150, will cost \nbillions of dollars nationwide, and in California it will cost local \njurisdictions as much as $836 million once it really gets started.\n  Cities and counties across the Nation are facing budget crises. These \ncuts only make the situation worse. There would be less money to pay \nfor police officers, firefighters, libraries, and parks. Passing this \nbill, which essentially would end revenue streams which cities have \ncounted on for years to fund vital services, is something I can't do. \nThat is why you have Senator Carper, a Governor, Senator\n\n[[Page S4364]]\n\nVoinovich, a former mayor and Governor, Senator Alexander, a Governor, \nand myself, a mayor, all saying, please don't do this.\n  I support legislation sponsored by Senators Alexander and Carper \nwhich would extend the recently expired moratorium on Internet access \nby 2 years, and make the moratorium technology neutral.\n  The Allen-Wyden bill changes the definition of Internet access \nsignificantly. That is the problem. Simply put, the definition included \nin the bill before us is far too broad. The bill says that \ntelecommunications are taxable, and then it adds this:\n\n     . . . except to the extent such services are used to provide \n     Internet access.\n\n  But what does the phrase ``to provide Internet access'' actually \nmean? Cities, counties, and States believe it means they won't be able \nto tax telecommunications services, which they currently can, to the \ntune of $2 to $9 billion annually all across the United States. So that \nis really what is at stake.\n  Let me read what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says \nabout the definition contained in Allen-Wyden:\n\n       The ban on State and local taxation of telecommunications \n     services used to provide Internet access would effectively \n     eliminate billions of dollars' worth of taxes on voice \n     telephone service as the provision of that service is \n     migrated to the Internet, a process that is well underway.\n\n  Then it goes on and it says there will be substantial revenue losses \nfor State and local governments. It points out that 11 States would \nlose between $80 million to $120 million: Colorado, Hawaii, New \nHampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Ohio, Tennessee, \nTexas, Washington, and Wisconsin. It says 28 States and the District of \nColumbia would lose $70 million annually. Let me quickly mention which \nones they are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, DC, \nFlorida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, \nMinnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New \nMexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, \nTennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n  A lot of States stand to lose. It goes on to say many more State and \nlocal governments would lose their ability to tax telecommunications \nservices purchased by Internet access providers, such as the high-speed \nlines providers use to link to the backbone of the Internet.\n  A lot of States stand to lose. Now, you can talk to authors of the \nbill and they will say, oh, no, that really is not true. But the fact \nis that even CBO cannot give you a real estimate because companies \ndon't maintain records; but cities, interestingly enough, have retained \nspecialists to estimate for them.\n  Let me read from one of those specialists. His name is William T. \nFujioka. He is the administrative officer for the city of Los Angeles. \nHe points out that:\n\n       In California, the utility user tax has been applied to \n     telecommunications services on a technology-neutral basis for \n     over 30 years. With 150 cities receiving over $830 million--I \n     have been over that.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       For the city of Los Angeles, our telecommunication's \n     utility user tax covers local exchange service, long \n     distance, and wireless, which total $260 million. S. 150 \n     places all of these revenues in jeopardy. The loss would come \n     from: 1, the migration of traditional telephone services to \n     Internet-based telephone services, or Voice over Internet \n     Protocol; and 2, the application of S. 150 to local exchange \n     and wireless services that also provide voice and Internet \n     access (in the same manner as DSL and cable modem), which \n     would prevent the city of Los Angeles from taxing these \n     services.\n\n  He then goes on to point out:\n\n       The migration of telecommunication services to the Internet \n     is not just speculation. AT, SBC, Verizon, and Time-Warner \n     have all announced their intent to introduce Internet \n     telephone service in California this year.\n\n  It is important to note that currently, DSL and cable modem are not \nsubject to the Federal excise tax, or UUT, utility user tax, because \nuntil recently these broadband communication services were not used for \nvoice and were properly deemed private communication services.\n  Now, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has changed even that and is \nessentially saying that both cable and DSL can be taxed. That just came \nout. I am told that it will take another 18 months to 2 years just to \nstraighten that out and to see if there is an appeal on a writ of \ncertiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  So this whole area is in flux and it could change dramatically. It \nmakes no sense to do a permanent piece of legislation at this point in \ntime, in my view, particularly with this Ninth Circuit case recently \ncoming down.\n  If Allen-Wyden is approved, phone services, which are currently \ntaxable, will become tax exempt. This means local jurisdictions will \nlose revenues they can collect today. In turn, this means less revenue \nto pay for local priorities.\n  I support making business and residential access to the Internet tax \nfree. There are primarily three ways to access the Internet today: \ndial-up service; cable modem; and DSL, digital subscriber lines. Under \nthe recently expired moratorium, two of these methods--dial-up service \nproviders and cable modem--were exempted from taxation. The third, DSL, \ncould be taxed, though many jurisdictions, including California, didn't \ntax that. But, as I have just told you the Ninth Circuit has just made \na change by saying that you can now tax cable modem.\n\n  Alexander-Carper--the bill I support--would level the playing field \nand make DSL tax exempt, except in those jurisdictions which already \ntaxed it. This grandfather would last for 2 years. And, it would \ngrandfather access taxes in place in 1998--again for 2 years. It is \nhoped that this will ensure that the Internet could continue to mature.\n  I must say, also, it is my understanding that Senator Enzi is going \nto introduce a bill that will be a simple extension of the 2-year \nmoratorium, which expired a few months ago. If the Alexander-Carper \nbill isn't successful, I will support this solution.\n  I really believe that is the solution--that we should simply extend \nit, let the Ninth Circuit case go up to the Supreme Court, and let the \nSupreme Court speak. Or we should add an amendment to S. 150 that says \nthat all present taxes remain unaffected, so that cities, counties, and \nStates, through your State, Madam President, and my State, as well as \nevery other State, can know with certainty that the revenues they have \ncounted on they can continue to count on.\n  If you ask people whether they want police and fire, the answer is \nyes. If you ask them whether they want local services, the answer is \nclearly yes. To pass a bill that ends the method of revenue collection \nand funds up to 15 percent of these local services in many \njurisdictions, I think, is an unconscionable thing to do.\n  Much like the tax cuts, they explode in outer years. So while Members \nthat vote for that may be popular for a short period of time, to be \nable to go home and say they are assuring their local jurisdiction that \nthey are protecting their revenue sources, they cannot do that by \nvoting for S. 150. Just too much is unknown.\n  Fifteen percent means layoffs, and it could mean major cuts in \nservice. It could mean higher local taxes.\n  The cities that have contacted me, large and small, are like San \nFrancisco, Los Angeles, Sacramento, LaVerne, San Leandro, and Santo \nRosa.\n  Let me quote from the comptroller of the city of San Francisco, Ed \nHarrington. Again, this is a technical person writing:\n\n       For the city of San Francisco, our telecommunications UUT--\n     utility users tax--covers local exchange service, long \n     distance, and wireless, which totals $32 million a year. S. \n     150--that is Allen-Wyden--places all of these revenues in \n     jeopardy.\n       The loss would come, again, from the migration of \n     traditional telephone services to the Internet-based \n     telephone services or Voice Over Internet Protocol; and, 2, \n     the application of S. 150 to local exchange and wireless \n     services that also provide voice and Internet access, which \n     would prevent the city of San Francisco from taxing these \n     services.\n\n  That is the same as Los Angeles.\n  So you have two of the major cities in the State and their technical \nand financial people both saying the same thing.\n  The League of Cities, which represents all of California's 478 \ncities, its county administrators, its police officer associations, its \nfirefighter associations, all oppose this bill.\n  In the city I served as mayor for 9 years, the current definition of \ntelecom\n\n[[Page S4365]]\n\nservices could lead to a loss of $32 million annually. This translates \ninto 300 police and firefighters.\n  I want to also cite the city of Pasadena. Mayor Bill Bogarrd wrote my \noffice to protest that his city would lose $11.4 million under Allen-\nWyden, and he writes:\n\n       By using vague language to include broadband Internet under \n     the moratorium, we fear that the bill will allow telephone \n     and cable companies to use that protection to avoid paying \n     local franchise or utility fees.\n\n  Which is exactly what is going to happen.\n  He goes on to state:\n\n       It is our understanding that it was not the intent of the \n     bill sponsors to endanger local franchising authority, but \n     the legislation has yet to be changed to correct these \n     unintended consequences.\n\n  Virtually every technical person who looks at this bill--the Center \nfor Budget and Policy Priorities, as well as every controller, \ntechnical professional employee of cities and counties--says the same \nthing: The definition is flawed, it is vague, and under that \ndefinition, any number of things can happen.\n  Madam President, 150 cities in my State levy a utility user tax. That \nincludes telephone and cable television services. These taxes provide \nthe contribution that I mentioned of approximately 15 percent in \ngeneral purpose revenues. So they make a utility user's tax vital in \nhelping fund critical city services.\n  I know why telephone companies do not want this. They do not want to \nbe bothered by local taxes. But on the other hand, why not say that \npresent taxes are excepted, present taxes would not be covered? Cities \ncan continue those taxes where they are.\n  I believe that because of the determination that this bill is an \nunfunded mandate and other reasons, S. 150 is subject to a point of \norder when it is under consideration, and I fully expect that this \npoint of order will be raised. For this Senate to pass a bill that \nfurther ties the hands of local government I think will be unfortunate \njust at a time when so many States face budget deficits and so many \ncities have the same situation.\n  In short, the problem with Allen-Wyden is that it changes the \ndefinition of Internet access in the recently expired Internet tax \nmoratorium in such a way that cities lose billions nationally, that \nthis escalates over time, and that this will lead to reduced \npreparedness of our cities, to fewer firefighters, and to fewer police \nofficers.\n  Anyone who has ever done a city budget knows you cannot lose up to 15 \npercent of your revenue and keep services at the same level.\n  I am hopeful that as the days go on and as we consider amendments to \nthe bill, there will be a straight amendment that will just simply \nextend a 2-year moratorium to give the Supreme Court case Brand X \nInternet Services v. the FCC the opportunity to go up on appeal, \nhopefully for the Supreme Court to take it up, or else to leave in \nplace the appellate court opinion which makes very clear that States \nwill be able to tax cable modem service since the 1996 act allows \nStates to tax telecommunications services.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects about the bill is some people \nthink that it imposes Internet sales taxes when this is not true at \nall. These taxes are all at the point where the Internet comes in to \nthe home, and yet they reach back in the chain as various services come \ntogether substantially before the Internet reaches the house. I think \nif that currently taxable aspect of the service is made unavailable to \nlocal communities that have very few revenue sources, it is going to \npresent a substantial hardship for the quality of life of the people we \ncare about in our cities and in our States.\n  I will oppose S. 150. I will vote for the Alexander-Carper bill and \nwill also vote for Senator Enzi's bill should he make that available.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from \nCalifornia. She represents a State that has 12 to 13 percent of all the \npeople in our country with lots of cities and counties. She has been a \nleader as a mayor, as I have been a Governor. Once you get to the \nSenate, you are not supposed to forget what you learned as a mayor or a \nGovernor, and what you know for sure is that if Congress comes along \nand says, You can't tax property in San Francisco, for example, then \nyou are going to have to raise taxes on something else. Or, on the \nother hand, if they said, You can't tax automobiles in California, then \nyou will have to raise taxes on something else.\n  When Congress comes along and says to California, to 118, 122, or \nhowever many, we are going to take $260 million potentially from Los \nAngeles, $32 million potentially from San Francisco, that is not \nlowering anybody's taxes. You just raise other taxes. If you say, \nSenator Alexander, we think you are special, you don't have to pay \ntaxes, the Senator from California is going to have to make up what I \nhave not paid, or someone is. If you say, We will just cut Government, \nwe will cut services, good, maybe we should do that, but still I would \nbe paying lower taxes and you would be paying higher taxes.\n  What we are talking about is a very simple idea: Should the Congress, \nin its wisdom, decide to give yet one more subsidy to the high-speed \nInternet access industry and then send the bill to mayors and \nGovernors? I can see us having a big debate and getting all excited \nabout high-speed Internet access. When the internal combustion engine \nwas invented, somebody in the Senate got excited about it, or when the \ntelephone was invented, somebody got excited about it, or when the \nrailroad was invented, somebody got excited about it, but we did not \nsay in order to encourage them, there may be no taxes by State and \nlocal governments on these great new inventions. Whenever we decide \nsomething is worth a subsidy, we do it ourselves, or we should do it \nourselves. That is the great irony here.\n  Here we have one of the most subsidized technologies in America and \nthe fastest growing technology in America. There is nothing to indicate \nanything is stopping it from growing. Yet we are piling on more \nsubsidies and giving the bill to State and local governments.\n  I thank the Senator from California for her leadership, her \ndirectness, and her consistency. I look forward to working with her \ntomorrow.\n  I think we have achieved tonight some of what we had hoped. The \nSenate has rules that permit a small group of Senators to make a point. \nI think the point we made tonight by insisting on a cloture vote on a \nprocedural motion, on the motion to proceed, was to speed along some \nnew compromises.\n  I am glad to see the Senator from Arizona with a new compromise \nproposal. I have been working on one for 6 months with the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  We even made some progress, but not enough. Perhaps the proposal of \nthe Senator from Arizona is even a step further. We received it this \nafternoon and I have not had a chance to analyze it, which is why we \nneed time to do that. We will move toward that objective the leadership \nwants and we all want, which is to create a consensus in this body \nabout what we should do for the time being about State and local \ntaxation of Internet access.\n  What I believe and the Senator from California believes and many \nother Senators believe is these should be our principles: No. 1, we \nshould take the time to give the Senate Commerce Committee and the \nHouse of Representatives time to think carefully about this new \ntechnology, high-speed Internet access, which has the potential to \ndeliver to our homes and our offices so many services. We should think \ncarefully about that and not deal with it in any piecemeal fashion. \nThat is why a short-term extension of the ban on State and local \ntaxation of Internet access is much wiser than anything permanent, and \nI am glad to see us moving away--not far enough yet, but away from the \nnotion of permanent confusion, which is what would happen.\n  Why in the world, when the Commerce Committee, when Senator Stevens, \nSenator McCain, and others have said they want to look into this, would \nwe short-circuit that by making a decision about a little bit of the \ngrowth of high-speed Internet access?\n  We ought to carefully look at whether there is a need for an \nadditional subsidy to high-speed Internet access. I\n\n[[Page S4366]]\n\nwill be talking about that some tomorrow. There is $4 billion of \nFederal subsidy already. I have a study by the Alliance for Public \nTechnology about all of the State and local subsidies to high-speed \nInternet access. They may all be good things, but we should know they \nare there. I mentioned this earlier, that in 1995 the Texas \ntelecommunications infrastructure fund put in motion raising taxes to \ngenerate $1.5 billion over 10 years, to basically put in high-speed \nInternet access everywhere. That is true in virtually every State.\n  I mentioned earlier today, in LaGrange, GA, they are giving it away \nfor free and still only about half the people want it. We cannot force-\nfeed it to people, and giving a big new subsidy to the high-speed \nInternet access companies is not going to make people who can get it \nfor free in LaGrange, GA, use it if they do not want it.\n  While my distinguished colleagues, who have a different point of \nview, say it does not cost much, well, the House bill costs a lot. Up \nto $10 billion in State and local taxes on telephones are at risk. Up \nto $7 billion in business taxes the States collect today are at risk. \nHalf a billion dollars in business taxes collected on the Internet \nbackbone would be wiped out. Sales taxes on Internet access being \ncollected now in 27 States, gone. Universal service fund fees and 9-1-1 \nservice fees threatened. Now people may be listening to that and \nsaying, great, no more taxes. That is the big trick. Do not let \nyourself be tricked by that, because if I run for the Senate and \npromise to abolish local property tax, do not people know the mayor and \nthe Governor are going to have to raise sales tax on food to make up \nfor it? Or if I run for the Senate and say I have this great idea, I am \ngoing to abolish the car tax in California, Virginia, Tennessee, and \nall around the country, hooray, that sounds good, does it not? But they \nare going to come up with another tax. They will raise sales tax on \nfood or on business.\n  So this is real money we are talking about, and that is the second \npoint we should be discussing in this compromise, that we do not need \nany more subsidy.\n  The third point is we should not break our promise to do no harm to \nState and local governments. That simply means this: If Congress in its \nwisdom concludes high-speed Internet access needs one more subsidy, \nthen we ought to be big enough men and women to stand up and say, okay, \nwe will pay for it. But what are we doing? We are sending the bill to \nState and local governments. At least that is the way the Governors, \nthe mayors, and everyone I have talked to, who has carefully read the \nbill from that perspective, reads it.\n\n  Maybe the compromise of the Senator from Arizona moves in that \ndirection. I hope it does. I am studying it tonight, and I will study \nit in the morning.\n  It is a great surprise to me to come to the Senate and find one of \nthe first things we do in my first 2 years is break the promise the \nRepublican Congress made in 1995, ``No money, no mandate. If we break \nour promise, throw us out.''\n  I would rather not be thrown out. I would rather we keep our promise. \nEveryone knows this is an unfunded mandate. To say we passed some \nunfunded mandates is like asking, why are you arresting me for this \none? I robbed some other stores last week and you did not catch me.\n  We do enact unfunded mandates on occasion, but the Congress has done \nit a lot less since 1995, and it has had to stand up and be counted.\n  I want to make sure everyone knows what we are talking about this \nweek is an unfunded Federal mandate and that every Democrat or \nRepublican Senator who made a speech on the floor in 1995--and I have \nthose speeches--or who goes back to a Lincoln Day dinner or a \nJefferson-Jackson Day dinner and starts off by making a great big \nspeech about local control is overlooking support for S. 150 because it \nis about adding a new cost on State and local governments and not \npaying the bill.\n  The Senator from California says it is 5 to 15 percent of the revenue \nbase of many of her cities. The Governor of Tennessee told me it is up \nto 5 percent of the revenue base of Tennessee. In our State, if we take \nout 5 percent of the sales tax base, there will be an income tax. We do \nnot have a State income tax because the people of Tennessee make a \nchoice. We thought the Governor and the legislature were elected to \ndecide what taxes we could impose.\n  Then finally, if we insist on this additional subsidy to encourage \nhigh-speed Internet access, why do we not follow President George W. \nBush's example? Let's put in the Texas plan. It is very simple. It \navoids all of this discussion we are having about definitions, all this \nargument we are having about whether it costs anything. What they did \nin Texas from 1999 when President Bush was Governor Bush was the \nfollowing: They said you do not have to pay any State tax on the first \n$25 of your monthly bill for high-speed Internet access.\n  Twenty-five dollars is all one has to pay for high-speed Internet \naccess in Manassas, VA, where they deliver it through the power \ncompany, and people can also get it through the phone company, the \ncable company, and from the sky through the satellite. It can be gotten \nfrom everywhere. One cannot walk down the street without somebody \nselling people high-speed Internet access. It is the fastest growing \ntechnology in America. The Congressional Budget Office and the \nDepartment of Commerce have told us we do not need to intervene. It \ndoes not need a subsidy. There is no economic benefit to paying more \ntaxpayers' money for this one industry.\n  So why is it? Why are we suddenly running a railroad train through \nthe Congress saying we are going to pick out this one industry? This is \na country where we have had many great inventions before. This is not \nthe first invention we have ever had, high-speed Internet access. It is \na great thing. But so was the telephone. So was the railroad. So was \nthe internal combustion engine. Now we are saying more subsidies--4 \nbillion in Federal dollars is not enough. A whole book full of State \nand local subsidies is not enough. The fact that it is the fastest \ngrowing technology in America, that is not fast enough. We want to pour \nmore money in here, and it is not really going to the consumers; it is \ngoing to the companies; it is going to the industries.\n\n  My friend from Virginia will say that is passed on to the consumer. \nMaybe it is. But if we are going to pass corporate taxes on to \nconsumers, why not do it for all corporations? We have a lot of \nmanufacturing companies getting ready to move jobs overseas. Let's \nlower their taxes. Let's lower everybody's taxes.\n  I am disappointed, to tell you the truth, that this bill is even \nbeing considered in this way. I am surprised. If I were still the \nGovernor of Tennessee--which maybe some in the Senate wish I still \nwere--I would be roaring and screaming about this. I would be calling \nmy Governors on the telephone saying, What are these men and women in \nWashington, DC doing? If they want to decide what the taxes ought to be \nin Tennessee and California and Iowa, let them come home and run for \nGovernor or mayor. If they want to give a subsidy to some company, let \nthem pay for it; don't send the bill to us. Let them come down and \nfigure how to keep State university tuitions from going up and how we \nkeep from raising State and local property taxes to deal with a Federal \nlaw that requires more State aid to children with disabilities but \ndoesn't fund it. That is what I would be doing.\n  I would have them on the phone tonight on a conference call and \nasking them to call every single Senator saying, What are you doing up \nthere? We have a war in Iraq. We have a national economy. We have \nplenty of national issues without you trying to be the Governor of the \nhome State at the same time, and if you want to be the mayor of \nKnoxville or Nashville or Memphis, come on home. We will share all our \nproblems with you and you can decide what to spend and how high the \nproperty taxes ought to be.\n  When we take hundreds of millions and potentially billions of dollars \nout of State and local governments, we are raising local taxes, not \ncutting local taxes. We are creating permanent confusion, and we are \nbreaking our promise.\n  So I am glad we had this vote tonight. I hope by coming in here and \nvoting we encouraged some work over the weekend, and late last week. I\n\n[[Page S4367]]\n\nknow Senator McCain was working, Senator Allen was working, Senators \nCarper and Feinstein and I were working, and I hope we have made some \nprogress.\n  Tomorrow when we come in here after our lunch and begin to move to \nthe bill at hand, I think we will have on our side--I mean those of us \nwho oppose S. 150--that we will have upheld our part of the \nresponsibility of keeping this Senate moving toward a conclusion. We \nwant a result, but we want a good result.\n  May I say one more time what I believe a good result is. A good \nresult is a 2-year ban on State and local taxation of Internet access \nso the U.S. Congress can think carefully about the migration of digital \nservices to the Internet because of high-speed Internet access. So that \nis No. 1--2 years or less.\n  No. 2, no big subsidy to a heavily subsidized industry already.\n  No. 3, let's keep our promise and do no harm to State and local \ngovernments. Let's show the people of this country that when we make a \npromise, as we did in 1995 when we said no more unfunded Federal \nmandates, when 300 Republicans stood on the Capitol steps and said, If \nwe break our promise throw us out, let's show that we mean that and not \nengage in rhetoric that tries to confuse the issue.\n  If we meet those three tests, then we can have a result. We can have \none quickly tomorrow, or Wednesday, or Thursday. But if we insist on \nlegislation here like the legislation that passed the House, that \ncreates permanent confusion instead of careful study, an unwarranted \nexpensive subsidy to a heavily subsidized fast-growing technology, and \nthat does harm to State and local governments, which breaks our \npromises, then I am going to continue to oppose that and so are a great \nmany of the Democrats and Republicans who joined us in the Alexander-\nCarper legislation.\n  I think this has been a successful day. I appreciate the time we have \nbeen given to debate the issue. I know Senator Enzi and others will be \nhere tomorrow morning to continue that discussion, and I look forward \nto moving in an orderly way to the legislation at hand, S. 150, \nsometime tomorrow afternoon, based upon the decision of the leadership.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that when the Senate resumes the motion to proceed to \nS. 150, the Internet tax access bill, there be 2 hours and 40 minutes \nfor debate remaining with 2 hours under the control of Senator \nAlexander or his designee, with 20 minutes under the control of the \nchairman of the committee and 20 minutes under the control of Senator \nDorgan; provided further that at the use or yielding back of that time \nthe motion to proceed be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of \nthis victims' rights legislation, which has special significance for my \nState and my hometown. On December 6, 1993, Mary Byron was murdered in \nLouisville on her 21st birthday as she left her place of work. Mary was \nkilled by her ex-boyfriend who, unknown to Mary, had recently been \nreleased from the county jail where he had been held since being \narrested for stalking, assaulting, and raping Mary. The Byron family \nhad been assured that they would be notified when Mary's attacker was \nreleased from custody. But unfortunately, they were not.\n  Following this tragedy, the Louisville metro criminal justice \ncommunity quickly realized that victims of violent crime needed a \nbetter system of notification when offenders are arrested, released, or \nscheduled to appear in court. The community committed itself to solving \nthis critical problem and ensuring victims' safety. In December 1994, \none year after Mary Byron's death, Jefferson County, KY introduced the \nNation's first automated victim notification service.\n  That system is called VINE, which stands for Victim Information and \nNotification Everyday. This program assures crime victims access to \nrapid, automated notification by telephone, pager, or e-mail when an \noffender's status changes. The system also allows victims to call 24-\nhours a day to obtain the current status of an offender--giving victims \npeace of mind and a sense of control over their lives.\n  What began in Louisville 9 years ago has now spread to more than \n1,400 communities in 36 States. In fact, in 19 States every county jail \nand State prison is connected to the VINE network. Each of these \nfacilities and communities are connected through the VINE \nCommunications Center located in Louisville. This central hub collects \ndata from and manages automated interfaces among 57 percent of the \nNation's county and State correctional facilities, and monitors 14 \nmillion offender transactions each month. Within moments of an \noffender's status change, such as escape, transfer, or release, high-\nspeed notification is activated to reach out and provide information to \nvictims.\n  The VINE Communications Center provides a staff of live operators 24-\nhours a day to assist victims in using the service. This national \nvictim notification center has made over 22 million calls, resulting in \nmore than one million notification events and saving countless lives.\n  VINE technology is also being used in Federal correctional \nfacilities. In 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice launched its \nFederal Victim Notification Service with the core VINE software. I am \nproud to note that DOJ's Federal Victim Notification Service also \nutilizes the Louisville-based communications center that provides \nvictim notification services for the county jails and State prisons in \n36 States.\n  It is now time to make this life-saving service available to every \ncrime victim in America. And this legislation helps make that a \nreality. The lack of victims' rights, including notification about the \nstatus of an offender, is a national criminal justice problem that \nrequires national leadership to solve. This legislation recognizes the \nnational problem, and I am proud to say this bill includes a component \nto help complete the job of providing safety to victims of domestic \nviolence and other violent crimes.\n  I commend the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California \nfor their tireless work on this issue.\n  This legislation not only states that each victim of violent crime \nhas a right to be notified of the release or the escape of the accused, \nbut it also authorizes adequate funding to see that the crime victim \nnotification network that currently protects many of the Nation's crime \nvictims is extended to cover all of the Nation's crime victims.\n  In an effort to prevent any family from having to suffer the tragedy \nthat befell hers, Mary Byron's mother, Pat, has dedicated the last ten \nyears of her life to raising awareness and support for innovative \nprograms, such as VINE, that help to break the cycle of violence. The \nMary Byron Foundation, along with the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, are strong supporters of completing the VINE \nNetwork, and I ask my colleagues to join with us in supporting this \ncritical piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4367-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4367-S4368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         corporal michael speer\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Corporal Speer was killed when his unit came under enemy \nfire in the Al Anbar province of Iraq on Friday, April 9, 2004.\n  Corporal Speer was a rifleman assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 2nd \nMarines, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, based in \nCamp Lejeune, NC. He performed his duty to his country admirably and I \nknow his loss will be deeply felt by all those who knew him.\n  Michael Speer enlisted in the Marines in Davenport, IA, on January \n16, 2001. He died a true patriot and it is fitting that we recognize \nhis sacrifice here today.\n\n\n                       staff sergeant cory brooks\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Staff \nSergeant Cory W. Brooks, a member of the South Dakota National Guard, \nwho died on April 24, 2004, while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Staff Sergeant Brooks was a member of the 153rd Engineer Batallion, \nwhich is based in Winner, SD. He died in a noncombat incident on \nSaturday.\n  Answering America's call to the military, Staff Sergeant Brooks \njoined the National Guard in May of 1989 and served as a combat \nengineer throughout his 15 years of service.\n  Born and raised in Phillip, SD, he was remembered as a dedicated \nathlete and student. Staff Sergeant Brooks' former football coach in \nhigh school, Jerry Rhodes said, ``He was just like family. He was one \nof those kids you love to work with. He always did good work. He was a \nvery happy-go-lucky kid.'' Jerry Rhodes son, Wade, picked his good \nfriend to be the best man at his wedding in 1995. Wade said of Brooks \ngrowing up, ``I spent more time at their house then I did my own. He \nwas just like a brother to me.''\n  Staff Sergeant Brooks was a very dedicated student and well educated. \nAfter excelling at Phillip High School and the University of South \nDakota for his undergraduate studies, he went on to obtain his Juris \nDoctorate from the University of South Dakota.\n  Staff Sergeant Brooks is the second member of the South Dakota \nNational Guard to be killed in combat since the war in Iraq began. \nCompany A, which includes members from Wagner and Winner, was assigned \nto the 1st Marine Expedition Headquarters. Their company is responsible \nfor defusing roadside explosives.\n  Staff Sergeant Brooks served our country and was a model of loyalty \nand dedication in the preservation of freedom. The thoughts and prayers \nof my family, as well as our country's, are with his family during this \ntime of mourning. Our thoughts continue to be with all those families \nwho have children, spouses, and other loved ones serving overseas.\n  Staff Sergeant Brooks led a full life, committed to his family, his \nNation, and his community. It was his incredible dedication to helping \nothers that will serve as his greatest legacy. Our Nation is a far \nbetter place because of Staff Sergeant Brooks' contributions, and, \nwhile his family, friends, and Nation will miss him very much, the best \nway to honor his life is to remember his commitment to service and his \nfamily.\n  I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my sympathies to the \nfriends and family of Staff Sergeant Brooks. I know that he will always \nbe missed, but his service to our Nation will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4368-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to warn my \ncolleagues about the potential low-income housing crisis that could \njeopardize hundreds, if not thousands of people in their States as a \nresult of an irresponsible, punitive, and unnecessarily harsh action \ntaken last week by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  For the first time in the 30-year history of the Section 8 Voucher \nChoice Program, there is the very real possibility that tens of \nthousands of low-income Americans will lose their housing vouchers this \nsummer and fall and be left with nowhere to turn but homeless shelters \nand the streets. The mere possibility of this is shocking and it's \nsomething my colleagues need to be aware of immediately.\n  Congress did not intend for this to happen, and the appropriators \npushed HUD to make sure it would not happen, but that is the course we \nare on. And it's all because of HUD's callous indifference to the \nplight of the most vulnerable and this administration's unrelenting \ndrive to destroy the safety net.\n  Using the most narrow possible interpretation of the appropriations \nbill, HUD issued a notification on Thursday that would retroactively \nabandon the long-standing practice of reimbursing public housing \nagencies for the actual costs of assisting the poor, the disabled, and \nthe elderly through the section 8 voucher program. Instead, the new HUD \npolicy will reimburse them on an inflation factor concocted by HUD's \nbudgeteers that has absolutely no bearing on the actual operating costs \nof the Section 8 housing voucher program.\n  As a result, public housing agencies across the country are about to \nbe blindsided by a rule change they did not anticipate and could not \nhave prepared for.\n  The National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials--\nNAHRO--is conducting a complete national survey of the potential \neffects of this change, which should be available later this week. But \nearly analysis is already available, and it is not reassuring. As a \nresult of this change, the association thinks that maybe 60,000 \nfamilies may be at risk of losing their vouchers in the coming year. \n60,000.\n  The notification does inform public housing agencies that they can \nappeal the decision by July 15, but offers no information about just \nhow to do that. The notification also points out that HUD may not have \nany funds by then to adjust reimbursements that were appealed. So, go \nahead and send the appeal letter, but just don't expect HUD to do \nanything about it.\n  If my colleagues harbor any doubts that this HUD notification will \nhave severe consequences, they need only look at what is happening in \nMassachusetts now. The State has directed public housing agencies to \nnotify 600 families that their vouchers will be terminated effective \nJune 1 as a result of HUD's abrupt funding change. Barring an 11 hour \ntemporary reprieve, those notices go out tomorrow. And that is just the \ntip of the iceberg in Massachusetts, some thousands more may be in \njeopardy.\n\n  The State is being hit now because it must reconcile HUD's funding \ncuts within its existing fiscal year, which ends June 30, and there is \nno other way to do that other than withholding assistance from those \ncurrency receiving it.\n  Who are these 600 families? More than 60 percent of them are \ndisabled, a significant portion are elderly, and all are low-income.\n  They are people like Mr. Milton Servis II. At the age of 15, he was \nhit by a speeding car while he walked. As a result of the collision, he \nsustained a serious head injury that has left himself disabled, with \nimpairments of his vision, balance, and ability to walk.\n  Then, just last year, Mr. Servis II, sustained third degree burns on \nhis hands in the Station Nightclub fire in\n\n[[Page S4369]]\n\nRhode Island. He lost his two best friends there as well, on that \nhorrific and tragic night.\n  Despite these hardships, he continues to work to lead an independent \nand dignified life. His only source of income is his monthly $698 SSI \ncheck, but he is able to make ends meet because of his section 8 \nvoucher, which covers $394 of his $550 rent.\n  Because of HUD's abrupt change, he may have to stretch his Social \nSecurity check all the more, because he is currently scheduled to \nreceive a termination notice tomorrow, informing him he has 1 month \nbefore he is tossed out on the street.\n  This doesn't have to be this way. People like Milton Servis II, who \nhave struggled hard to overcome misfortunes that few others can relate \nto, don't need to be terrified by the prospect of homelessness.\n  It should never have come to this. Last year, when the administration \nsent its budget to Congress, we didn't believe they were being accurate \nwith the numbers.\n  As our colleague, Senator Mikulski, the ranking member of the VA-HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee, wrote last week to HUD Secretary Alphonso \nJackson, ``. . . the fiscal year 2004 appropriations bill provides \n$17.6 billion to renew expiring section 8 contracts. This amount was \n$1.4 billion above the amount requested by the Administration to renew \nexisting vouchers.''\n  Congress went out of its way to make sure that adequate funding was \navailable to renew all vouchers, even adding an additional $1.4 billion \nin these difficult budget times to make sure no one would lose their \nsection 8 voucher. What is HUD done with this money?\n  But the administration doesn't care what Congress intended with \nregard to this program. They remain committed to their ideological goal \nof ending the section 8 voucher program, and shredding the safety net.\n  Last year, the administration proposed block granting the section 8 \nprogram so they could shift more of the responsibility for housing the \nelderly, the disabled, and the poor onto the State and local \ngovernments and reduce Federal spending on this critically important \nprogram.\n  On a bipartisan basis, Congress rejected that radical proposal, \nbecause it would have provided fewer resources and contained perverse \nincentives.\n  It would have actually rewarded housing agencies for terminating \nassistance for the poorest citizens and replacing it with assistance to \npeople in less need. These ``compassionate conservatives'' described \nthis new ability to ignore the truly neediest as a type of \n``flexibility.''\n  The flexibility to abandon people, I guess.\n  But despite Congress's complete rejection of the proposal, the \nadministration is not about to concede defeat.\n  If Congress will not accede to its demand to dismantle the 30-year-\nold section 8 program, HUD will do its best to ruin it \nadministratively. And with this notification, HUD is attempting to do \njust that.\n  They can't win the battle of ideas in an open and full debate. So \nthey are trying to win it deviously by simply undermining the program's \nintegrity.\n  We know a Trojan Horse when we see it.\n  Here is how they are using it on section 8 vouchers.\n  First, HUD changes the rules in the middle of the fiscal year so that \npublic housing agencies have to take drastic and truly brutal measures \nto comply, such as throwing people off public housing.\n  Then HUD blames the public housing agencies for being mismanaged.\n  In other words, HUD claims that public housing agencies are at fault \nfor not having budgeted the resources to comply with HUD's unexpected \npolicy change.\n  HUD has already begun condemning the public housing agencies for not \nmaintaining adequate reserves to offset this most recent HUD-\nmanufactured financial crisis. HUD does this event though it knows that \nover 800 public housing agencies serving 690,000 people have already \ndepleted their reserves to address other HUD policy changes or funding \nshortfalls in the past 2 years.\n\n  HUD intends to use this funding crisis to claim that public housing \nagencies can't manage their programs effectively, compassionately, and \nefficiently.\n  Once the horror stories start about people losing their vouchers and \nlandlords leaving the program, HUD can then declare the existing \nprogram a failure and revive its block grant proposal that Congress has \nalready flatly rejected before.\n  This is not an academic issue.\n  Real people are about to suffer for HUD's actions. Many are elderly, \nmany are disabled. They deserve to be treated with respect and \ncompassion, which is in short supply in this administration.\n  HUD is about to impose these immense hardships on those of our \nconstituents who need our help the most.\n  The administration may not care that low-income, elderly, and \ndisabled Americans are being needlessly hurt, but this Senate does, and \nwe need to join together to fight these changes before this crisis gets \nany worse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4369-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4369-S4370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN RECOGNITION OF THE BIRTHDAY OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute today to one of \nthe world's greatest poets, whose immortal words have universal appeal. \nThis month marks the 440th anniversary of William Shakespeare's birth \non April 23, 1564. His influence has been so great in our country's \ncultural tradition that from our earliest days as a Nation the two \nbooks most often found in American homes were the Bible and the \nComplete Works of William Shakespeare. Throughout our history up to the \npresent day, Shakespeare plays have delighted audiences and inspired \nmany.\n  I do not have the time to detail all of the universal works and \ncontributions to our culture and language provided by this great writer \nand poet. I do however, want to highlight today two groups among \nhundreds across the country that are devoting their time and energy in \npraise of William Shakespeare.\n  The first group, I am proud to say is in my home state of Utah--the \nUtah Shakespearean Festival. This festival is held each year in Cedar \nCity, UT; and is one of the premier festivals of its kind in America. \nThe ideals and dreams that were the embodiment of William Shakespeare \nare recaptured for audiences who have the privilege of attending. It \nbegan as a dream of Fred C. Adams, a young actor with a love of \nShakespeare and a desire to produce great theater. It has grown \ntremendously from its inception in 1959 in which 3,276 spectators were \nentertained watching The Taming of the Shrew, Hamlet and The Merchant \nof Venice to its present-day success in 2003 in which 150,000 ticket-\nholders viewed 185 performances in 2 landmark theaters.\n  The economic impact of the festival on Cedar City and the surrounding \narea is immense. It stands as a monument of success to the traditions \nof Shakespeare and his plays. In fact, in 2000 the festival was awarded \nthe coveted Tony Award for America's Outstanding Regional Theater, an \nhonor truly deserving and treasured.\n  The second group I have recently become acquainted with is the \nAmerican Friends of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust which supports \nprograms to preserve the heritage and properties of Shakespeare in \nStratford-Upon-Avon, UK. Many U.S. institutions focus on the theater, \nbut this group, headed by John Chwat in Washington, DC, works with the \ntrustees in Stratford keeping the homes of Shakespeare's birth, Ann \nHathaway's Cottage, Mary Arden's house and Hall's croft preserved. With \nthe support of the Newington-Cropsey Foundation, Hastings-on Hudson, \nthey have placed four of eight bronze monuments by Greg Wyatt depicting \nthe text and imagery of Shakespeare's plays--King Lear, Hamlet, Julius \nCaesar and The Tempest--in the ``Great Garden'' at New Place where \nShakespeare spent his last days and wrote The Tempest. They also \nsponsor summer sessions at Stratford for Columbia, Georgetown, and \nother American universities.\n  Thank you for this opportunity to salute both the Utah Shakespearean \nFestival and its officials, sponsors, workers, and visitors as well as \nthe board of directors of the American Friends of the Shakespeare \nBirthplace Trust and the distinguished trustees in Stratford-Upon-Avon \npassionately working to\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\npreserve Shakespeare's heritage. I want to end with a passage I \nparticularly like from Hamlet, which is displayed in bronze text in one \nof Greg Wyatt's sculptures. It reads:\n\n     What a piece of work is a man! How noble in\n     Reason, how infinite in faculty, in form, and\n     moving, how express and admirable, in action\n     how like an angel, in apprehension and how like a\n     god the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a truly singular \nfigure in history, an individual whose very name has become synonymous \nwith poetry and theater, William Shakespeare. This past week marked the \n440th anniversary of William Shakespeare's birth in 1564.\n  Nearly four centuries after his death, William Shakespeare's impact \nremains a resounding one, here in America and around the world. His \nworks range from uproarious comedies to tragedies that move audiences \nand readers to tears. He continues to remind us both of the greatness \nof which man is capable, and the frailties which too often prevent us \nfrom realizing our potential.\n  Shakespeare's prolific and outstanding career is virtually unmatched \nin the history of Western literature and drama. Perhaps the most \ntelling illustration of the magnitude of Shakespeare's work is that the \ntwo books most often found in American homes are the Bible and the \nComplete Works of William Shakespeare.\n  I am pleased to note that my home State of Connecticut is home to a \nnumber of Shakespeare theaters and festivals. Shakespeare on the Sound \nin Norwalk will entertain 10,000 people over the course of this summer. \nThe Elm Shakespeare Company in New Haven now draws about 30,000 people \nper production. And Stratford, named after the town where Shakespeare \nwas born, is currently in the process of renovating its landmark \nShakespeare theater, which will hopefully reopen this coming summer.\n  I would also like to recognize the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, an \norganization that works to perpetuate Shakespeare's legacy and to \npreserve his estates in Stratford-upon-Avon in the United Kingdom. Here \nin the United States, the American Friends of the Shakespeare \nBirthplace Trust work to support the Trust's goals. Together with the \nNewington-Cropsey Foundation, located in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY, they \nhave placed four of what will ultimately be eight bronze monuments by \nthe sculptor Greg Wyatt in the ``Great Garden'' at New Place, where \nShakespeare spent his last days and wrote The Tempest. Replicas of \nthose sculptures, each of which represents a particular Shakespeare \nwork, have been presented to the Folger Shakespeare Library here in \nWashington. The American Friends of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust \nalso sponsor student summer sessions at Stratford for Columbia, \nGeorgetown, and other American universities.\n  I applaud the American Friends of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust \nfor all the work they do. And I salute all those in Connecticut and \naround the world who strive to keep the name and works of William \nShakespeare alive and well today. With their help, Shakespeare's words, \nboth in print and on stage, will continue to inspire millions for many, \nmany years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4370-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PRESIDENT DOS SANTOS'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on May 12, Angolan President Jose Eduardo \ndos Santos is planning to visit Washington for meetings with President \nBush and other top administration officials. I mention this because \nwelcoming President dos Santos to the United States is contrary to \nPresident Bush's January 12, 2004, proclamation barring corrupt foreign \nofficials from entering the United States.\n  President Bush's proclamation suspends entry into the United States \nof public officials, and their spouses, children, and dependents, if \ntheir ``solicitation or acceptance of any article of monetary value, or \nother benefit, in exchange for any act or omission in the performance \nof their public functions has or had serious adverse effects on the \nnational interests of the United States.'' It also bars officials \n``whose misappropriation of public funds or interference with the \njudicial, electoral, or other public processes'' has harmed the \nnational interest.\n  If this standard does not apply to President dos Santos, it is hard \nto imagine to whom it could apply. He presides over one of the world's \nmost corrupt governments. The IMF has concluded that between 1997 and \n2002, Angola could not account for the expenditure of $4.2 billion in \npublic funds, attributing this loss--equivalent to 10 percent of \nAngola's GDP--in substantial part to high-level corruption.\n  In a corruption trial in France in 2003, the former head of the oil \ncompany Elf Aquitaine testified that President dos Santos had received \nlarge bribes from the company. According to the Intelligence Unit of \n``The Economist'' magazine, President dos Santos tops the list of the \nrichest men in Angola, one of Africa's poorest countries.\n  President Bush's proclamation states that corruption is a threat to \nU.S. national interests when it has serious adverse effects on, among \nother things, ``U.S. foreign assistance goals . . .  or the stability \nof democratic institutions and nations.'' I could not agree more. \nMassive corruption has clearly had these effects in Angola. To protect \ntheir ability to misappropriate public funds, Angolan leaders have \nlimited press freedom, intimidated the judiciary, and resisted \ndemocratic and economic reforms. Moreover, they have refused to spend \nthe country's oil revenues to lift their people from poverty. Half of \nAngola's children are malnourished even as government officials amass \nfortunes.\n  President Bush's proclamation states that persons to be barred entry \nfor corruption, as well as those whose entry would not be contrary to \nthe national interest, ``shall be identified by the Secretary of State \nor the Secretary's designee, in his or her sole discretion, pursuant to \nsuch standards and procedures as the Secretary may establish.'' If the \nSecretary has not yet acted to establish clear and consistent standards \nand procedures for making these determinations, he needs to act \npromptly. And whether he has or not, the policy behind President Bush's \nproclamation should be applied to the visit of President dos Santos and \nother Angolan officials.\n  I strongly agree with President Bush that the corruption of public \ninstitutions threatens United States ``efforts to promote security and \nto strengthen democratic institutions and free market systems.'' As I \nhave said before, corruption is like a cancer. It is the biggest \nobstacle to development--from Indonesia to Guatemala, from Nigeria to \nPakistan. It undermines virtually everything we are trying to do \nthrough the Foreign Operations budget.\n  Fortunately, some leaders are trying to stop it, such as President \nBolanos of Nicaragua, and we should do everything possible to support \nhim and people like him, by prosecuting corrupt officials for money \nlaundering or other violations of U.S. law, and by denying them visas \nto the United States.\n  Again, I commend President Bush for his proclamation and urge the \nSecretary of State to implement it vigorously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4370-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4370-S4371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CELEBRATION OF LIFE DONOR MONUMENT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have the privilege today of honoring a \nunique and extraordinary group of people organ donors. In Utah this \nweek a very special monument is being dedicated to the memories and \nsacrifices of many Utah families who have given others a new chance at \nlife. The Celebration of Life Monument at Salt Lake City's new Library \nSquare will stand as a testament to the many heroes whose organs have \nbeen donated. The monument will also serve as a beautiful, peaceful, \nand serene place for people to visit and hopefully feel inspired by the \ngift of organ donation.\n  Visitors to the monument will be surrounded by three glass serpentine \nWalls of Honor inscribed with the names of organ, eye, and tissue \ndonors; super blood donors; and body research donors. Five life-sized \nbronze statues of recipients will also grace the grounds of the \nmonument which were sculpted by the very talented Utah artist, Gary \nPrice. These statues represent the impact organ donation has on people \nof every culture and age who are given a second chance for life by the \nsacrifice of others. In addition, guests will also be able to enjoy a \nbeautiful water fountain in the center of the monument\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\nsymbolizing the renewal of life and the ripple effects of donation.\n  It is important to note that one organ donor can save the lives of \nnine people. In addition, a single eye and tissue donor can restore \nsight to two people and enhance the lives of up to 50 more. What a \nwonderful legacy to leave behind. To actually save and enhance the \nlives of so many others is almost beyond compare.\n  Someone once said, ``If today brings even one choice your way, choose \nto be a bringer of the light.'' Thousands of families each year across \nAmerica choose to be ``bringers of the light.'' To the loved ones and \nfamily members who are faced with the agonizing decision to share the \ngift of organ donation at the very same time they are faced with the \ndeath of someone they love and cherish, I want to say a very simple and \nheart-felt ``thank you.'' Thank you for your choice, for your \nsacrifice, and for your precious gift. Your gift has helped thousands \nof people live another day to experience the joys of life, people who \ncan now see the face of their child, and people who can now experience \nthe ultimate blessing of good health and strength. Your precious gift \nis sacred and inspiring.\n  I sincerely hope that the presence of this new monument in Salt Lake \nCity will motivate and educate people across our State and Nation to \nregister as an organ donor and prepare themselves and their loved ones \nfor what may be the ultimate gift of life. Utahns can do this by \nvisiting the web site www.yesutah.org and register; or by call (866)--\nYES-UTAH. I truly believe that out of the tears of tragedy; comfort can \nbe found in organ donation. Our lives can be extended through the eyes, \nskin, blood, and organs of others.\n  I want to sincerely congratulate all of those who have shared their \ntears and joy through building this wonderful monument. Many people and \norganizations in Utah have toiled for several years to make this dream \na reality. May the people who visit be stirred by the names and \nmemories of those who are named there, and may the peace of this \nmonument inspire many to register to become an organ donor. I have \nalways been touched by the quote, ``To the world you may be one person, \nbut to one person . . . you may be the world.'' Any of us can be ``the \nworld'' for someone special through organ donation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4371-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A MARCH FOR WOMEN'S LIVES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, at the ``March for Women's Lives'' \nyesterday, I joined the hundreds of thousands of women from across the \nUnited States and the world to show support for a woman's right to \nchoose and for access to reproductive health services.\n  This demonstration comes at a time when women's reproductive rights \nare in immediate danger. Not only has President Bush done more to roll \nback women's reproductive health than any president in history, \nopponents of abortion in Congress have made advances in the assault on \nthe right to choose.\n  In the past decade, Congress has voted on choice related issues 168 \ntimes. Women lost in 136 of those votes.\n  As if these attacks themselves were not disturbing enough, the fact \nthat they have gone largely unnoticed and unchallenged is even more \nalarming.\n  That is why, now, more than ever since Roe v. Wade, it is vital to \nshow President Bush and his friends in Congress that we will fight to \nmaintain women's reproductive rights and access to health care in \nAmerica.\n  Since the day George W. Bush took office, his administration has been \nsystematically chipping away at women's reproductive rights.\n  One of his first acts as President was to reinstate the global gag \nrule, which prevents U.S. foreign aid from funding any overseas clinic \nthat performs or counsels women on abortion.\n  The Bush Administration has announced at international conferences \nthat the United States believes that life begins at conception.\n  They have canceled the United States' contribution to the United \nNations' family planning program.\n  Instead, they have promoted abstinence-only sex education for young \npeople both here and abroad, even though their success at preventing \npregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases has been \nquestioned.\n  George W. Bush has also consistently nominated judicial candidates \nwho oppose a woman's right to choose to lifetime appointments on the \nFederal bench.\n  Just this month, he signed the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which, \nfor the first time, puts into Federal law the concept that life begins \nat conception. This will, in effect, grant a fetus or even a fertilized \negg separate rights as a person and can now be used legally to further \nchip away at a woman's constitutional right to choose.\n  I offered an alternative to this bill that would have provided the \nsame effect and punishment for offenders in criminal law, but did not \naddress the profound and deeply divisive question of when life begins.\n  The President also approved a ban on so-called partial birth \nabortions, which is the first law outlawing abortion since the Roe v. \nWade decision. It is also the first time that a medical procedure has \never been criminalized.\n  This unconstitutional law has not yet been enforced because of \nlawsuits pending against it in Federal courts in San Francisco, New \nYork and Lincoln, NE.\n  In disregard for people's privacy, U.S. Justice Department attorneys \ndefending the law have attempted to compel two doctors to turn over \nprivate patient abortion records.\n  Who knows where it will stop? We are on a slippery slope toward \ngranting fetuses greater rights than the mothers who carry them. It may \nnot be long before common forms of contraception, in-vitro \nfertilization and stem-cell research are banned in the name of the \nunborn.\n  These Federal laws, along with more than 350 anti-choice measures \nenacted by States, are setting legal precedents that abortion opponents \nwill use to challenge Roe v. Wade, which is perilously close to being \noverturned.\n  The Supreme Court appears to be only one vote away from reversing Roe \nv. Wade and taking the decision to have an abortion away from a woman \nand her doctor and putting it in the hands of politicians.\n  It is entirely possible that abortion will once again be illegal in \nthis country.\n  For many women, it has been easy to take the right to choose for \ngranted, because it is all they have ever known.\n  I remember a time, however, when an estimated 1.2 million women each \nyear resorted to illegal, back alley abortions despite the possibility \nof death and infection.\n  I remember that time very vividly. In college during the 1950s, I \nknew young women who found themselves pregnant with no options. I even \nknew a woman who committed suicide because she was pregnant and \nabortion was illegal in the United States.\n  I also remember the passing of a collection plate in my college \ndormitory so that another friend could go to Mexico for an abortion.\n  That is why it is so important to show President Bush that we will \nNOT just stand back and do nothing while women's rights are taken away.\n  Women have a fundamental right to determine when and whether to \nbecome a mother. The Government should not be able to take that right \naway.\n  We cannot go back to a time without choice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4371-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4371-S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PAUL OFFNER\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to mark the passing of an \noutstanding public servant, former member of the Senate community, \nformer staffer to Senators, and former staffer for the Senate Finance \nCommittee--Paul Offner.\n  Born in Bennington, VT, Paul spent part of his childhood in Florence, \nItaly. He earned a bachelor's degree from Amherst College, a master's \ndegree from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and \nInternational Affairs, and a doctorate in economics from Princeton.\n  After this outstanding education, Paul began his career in public \nservice with the U.S. Senate, serving as a legislative assistant to \nSenator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin.\n  Paul had caught the political bug. He decided to run for office \nhimself, seeking to represent the people of La Crosse, Wisconsin, in \nthe State legislature. That showed that Paul didn't\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\nshrink from tough odds, as he ran as a Democrat in La Crosse, a city \nthat had not elected a Democrat for quite some time. Paul proved a \nnatural campaigner. He had a great slogan: ``Vote once. Vote Offner.''\n  Winning that election, Paul served in the Wisconsin State \nlegislature, and then in the Wisconsin Senate. He established himself \nas an expert on the challenging area of health care and health \ninsurance.\n  In the early 1980s, Paul ran for Lieutenant Governor and for \nCongress, but those elections did not work out for him. Fortunately for \nus, he stuck to his career in public service nonetheless.\n  In 1990, Paul returned to work for the U.S. Senate, serving as senior \nlegislative assistant for health and human services for Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan of New York. Staff for Senator Moynihan recall that \nfrom their very first meeting, Senator Moynihan regarded the staffer \nwith the Princeton doctorate as a colleague.\n  Paul became one of the leading national voices in welfare and health \npolicy. After President Clinton won the 1992 Presidential election, \nPaul coordinated the Clinton transition team's welfare reform policies.\n  When Senator Moynihan became chairman of the Finance Committee, Paul \nbecame the committee's chief health and welfare counselor. Having \nserved as chairman and ranking minority member of the Finance \nCommittee, I know that Paul's position was a demanding one. Paul \nhandled it well during the important year when Congress enacted \nPresident Clinton's first budget, in 1993. That budget set the pattern \nthat led to 8 years of economic growth and the creation of more than 20 \nmillion new jobs.\n  Paul served with the Clinton White House Health Care Task Force, \nwhich tried to extend health benefits to millions of uninsured \nAmericans. The task force did not succeed then, but they fought an \nimportant fight. We will need to revisit that important task again, \nbefore long.\n  During the debate on welfare reform in the mid-1990s, Paul \ncontributed a series of prominent articles. He influenced the national \ndebate.\n  When the Republicans took control of the Senate with the 1994 \nelection, Mayor Marion Barry asked him to become the commissioner of \nhealth care finance for Washington, DC. One need not be a critic of \nWashington to know that when Paul took on the job of running Medicaid \nfor the District of Columbia, he took on as thankless and difficult a \ntask as there is. And he did it well.\n  He went on to work at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute. \nIn recent years, he focused on the situation of young Black men in \nAmerica, arguing that society needs to make a greater effort to improve \ntheir chances of making it.\n  It tells you something about Paul that while he was working hard at \nhigh-powered Capitol Hill jobs, he also served as a dedicated tutor to \nschool kids in the District. He was a volunteer tutor for the Friends \nof Tyler School, a public elementary school not far from the Capitol \nbuilding in Southeast Washington, DC.\n  People will tell you that Paul had a tremendous intellect, a caring \nheart, and a quick wit. He was the kind of person who went through the \npolicy wars enough to be a skeptic, but was still in there pitching, \ntrying to make things better.\n  ``He believed in public service,'' said Molly Collins Offner, his \nwife of 8 years. ``Accomplishing good and making the world better was \nkey for him,'' she said.\n  The noblest human endeavor is to serve our fellow man. It can be \nservice to church, to community, to family, to spouse, to children. \nPaul Offner served.\n  Members of the House and the Senate who serve also get the benefit \nand gratification of seeing their names in newspapers and their faces \non TV. But dedicated professionals such as Paul work very hard behind \nthe scenes, often with little or no recognition. I recognize the \ncentral role that Paul Offner played.\n  Paul passed away last week, and was remembered this past weekend at a \nMass of Christian Burial not far from here on Capitol Hill. He will be \nremembered by his wife Molly Collins Offner, daughter Mary Shu Yu \nOffner, and sister Antoinette Gerry. But he will also be remembered by \na thankful U.S. Senate community. And for years to come, he will be \nthanked by millions of Americans whose lives will have been made better \nfor his having lived, but who never knew his name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4372-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SALK POLIO VACCINE FIELD TRIALS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this coming Monday is the 50th anniversary \nof the Salk polio vaccine field trials.\n  On April 26, in conjunction with National Immunization Week, the \nMarch of Dimes will commemorate the development of the Salk polio \nvaccine.\n  This day holds great significance for our Nation. Fifty years ago, \nthe first dose of the Salk vaccine was distributed to children at \nFranklin Sherman Elementary school in McLean, VA as part of the \nNational Field Trial program. In the following months, more than 1 \nmillion school children participated in these trials, making this the \nlargest peacetime volunteer mobilization in United States history.\n  National Immunization week, which was established by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, is an opportune time to emphasize the \nimportance of immunizations. In April of every year since 1993, \ndedicated people across the country have joined forces with State and \nlocal health departments, health care providers, and other partners to \ndeliver this immunization message.\n  Immunization against vaccine-preventable disease is one of the most \neffective health care and public health tools developed in the 20th \ncentury. Advances in technology and widespread immunization efforts \nhave led to an all-time record low in the infection rate for diseases \nthat once devastated entire communities. Smallpox has been eradicated; \npolio has been eliminated from the Western Hemisphere; and the number \nof cases of other infectious diseases has been reduced to record lows.\n  We have learned a vast amount about the importance of immunizing \nchildren and adults in this country since the creation of the Salk \nvaccine. However, there is still work to be done. Though overall \nimmunization levels in the United States have been improving, levels in \nmany parts of the country remain dangerously low. According to a 2001 \nNational Immunization Survey Conducted by the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, only 77 percent of our Nation's children are \nfully immunized by age 2. Tragically, levels in some areas of the \ncountry are as low as 55 percent.\n  The Salk vaccine could not have ended the scourge of polio in \nAmerican without a concerted Federal effort to provide it to all of our \ncitizens. I hope that my colleagues will join me in continuing and \nexpanding Federal support for immunization efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4372-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4372-S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA SCHOOL OF LAW\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nUniversity of Alabama School of Law for their outstanding ranking among \nthe country's law schools. U.S. News and World Report recently released \nits annual list of the Top 100 Law Schools, and ranked the University \nof Alabama School of Law fortieth in the Nation. This ranking places \nthe Law School in the top tier of law schools nationwide, which is \nphenomenal considering the institution was ranked in the third tier \njust 8 years ago in 1996. As a graduate of the law school myself, I am \nproud to see their elevation to one of the premier law schools in the \nNation.\n  I believe that much of the school's success must be attributed to the \ndean of the Law School, Kenneth Randall. Dean Randall holds four law \ndegrees, including a doctorate from the Columbia University School of \nLaw, 1988; a master's from Columbia, 1985; a master's from Yale \nUniversity, 1982; and a juris doctor degree from Hofstra University, \n1981. Additionally, Dean Randall received a bachelor of arts degree in \nEnglish literature from Aldelphi University on Long Island. Indeed, his \neducational background is outstanding, and he has demonstrated a true \nenthusiasm for the law.\n  Since taking the reins as dean in 1993, Dean Randall has provided a \nclear\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\nvision for the institution. He takes great pride in the success of the \nlaw school, and has done so since joining the faculty in 1985. I am \nhopeful that his career path keeps him here in Tuscaloosa for many \nyears to come.\n  The education of our young people is critical to the success of our \nNation, and the University of Alabama School of Law is committed to \nproviding students with the tools necessary to succeed. I believe the \ndedication of Dean Randall, the administration, faculty, and alumni has \ncreated an environment that allows students to achieve their goals and \nexceed their own expectations.\n  I extend my sincerest congratulations to the University of Alabama \nSchool of Law for its remarkable success and look forward to \ncelebrating more achievements in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4373-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL MINORITY CANCER AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. In my State of Louisiana, 23,540 new cancer \ncases will be diagnosed this year and 9,700 members of my community \nwill die from cancer. Children will lose mothers to breast cancer. \nWives will lose husbands to prostate cancer. These tremendous losses \nare devastating to both families and communities. Despite all of the \nprogress that has been made in the battle against cancer, some \npopulations are disproportionately affected by the burden of this \ndisease.\n  African Americans have the highest death rate for all cancers. Cancer \nis also the leading cause of death for Asian-American women. African-\nAmerican, American-Indian, Alaska Native, Asian-American, and Pacific \nIslander men all have a lower 5-year survival rate than non-Hispanic \nwhite males. This disparity is partially attributed to the fact that \npreventive services are not as easily accessible for these populations. \nThe consequences of inadequate access to preventive services and early \ndetection are that diseases like cancer are more often diagnosed at \nlater stages when the severity is likely to be greater and options for \ntreatment and the odds of survival are decreased. The demographic \nchanges expected over the next decade will only magnify the urgency of \naddressing these health disparities.\n  The future health of America as a whole will be influenced \nsubstantially by our success in improving the health of minority and \nother medically underserved populations. To address these disparities, \nCongress must provide adequate funding for screening, prevention, and \ntreatment services for minority and underserved populations. We must \ncontinue to fund research through the National Cancer Institute that \nwill help to provide better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of \ncancer in all populations.\n  There are many organizations and individuals in my State of Louisiana \nworking tirelessly to address these health disparities and to improve \nthe quality of life for all Americans. Because last week was National \nMinority Cancer Awareness Week, I would like to take this opportunity \nto commend these organizations and individuals for all of their \nefforts. Together with my colleagues in Congress, I am confident that \none day we can reduce and ultimately eliminate the disparate burden of \ncancer and all other diseases on minority and medically underserved \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4373-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4373-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  An in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/26/senate-section/article/S4373-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 2844.

A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to ensure that all \ndogs and cats used by research facilities are obtained legally; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pet Safety \nand Protection Act. My legislation amends the Animal Welfare Act to \nensure that all companion animals such as dogs and cats used by \nresearch facilities are obtained legally.\n  Over 30 years ago, Congress passed the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) \nauthorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to set and enforce standards \nprotecting animals used in biomedical research, bred for commercial \nsale, exhibited to the public, or commercially transported from \ninhumane treatment. Despite the well-meaning intentions of the AWA and \nthe enforcement efforts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), \nthe Act fails to provide reliable protection against the actions of \nsome unethical animal dealers.\n  Under the AWA, Class B animal dealers are defined as individuals \nwhose business includes the purchase, sale, or transport of animals in \ncommerce, including dogs and cats intended for use at research \nfacilities. To the dismay of animal welfare advocates and pet owners, \nsome Class B, or ``random source,'' dealers have resorted to theft and \ndeception to collect animals for resale. In many instances these \nanimals were found living under inhumane conditions.\n  As recently as August of 2003, USDA agents executed a warrant to \ninvestigate a Class B dealer from Arkansas suspected of violations of \nthe AWA for the second time in several years. Many claims have been \nlevied against this dealer, and approximately 125 dogs were seized by \nFederal agents during this week-long search. The investigation of this \nfacility is ongoing, and an indictment is pending.\n  The complaint being investigated by the USDA against the dealer \nalleges that the respondents' veterinarian provided for them falsified \nofficial health certificates for cats and dogs, and also provided them \nwith blank, undated, and signed health certificates. It is also alleged \nthat the dealer failed to provide the barest standards of care, \nhusbandry, and housing for the animals on the premises. The undercover \ninvestigation of this facility has revealed that its proprietors were \naware that some of the companion animals brought to the facility were \nstolen, and also revealed a list of over 50 ``bunchers,'' individuals \nwho obtain animals and sell them to ``random source'' animal dealers. \nBunchers have a variety of methods of obtaining companion animals, \nincluding responding to newspaper ads offering free animals, \ntrespassing on private property to abduct the animals from yards, and \nhouse burglaries.\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\n  Inadequate veterinary care is one of the worst violations of the AWA \ncommitted against these animals. The expense for quality veterinary \ncare is one that irresponsible Class B dealers do not wish to incur, \nand animals often die as a result of their untreated injuries or \ndiseases. This was one of the violations uncovered by the \ninvestigation, and often resulted from another violation of the AWA \nthat requires compatible grouping of animals. Vicious or diseased \nanimals were not separated from the general population and posed a risk \nto all of the animals housed with them. In addition, this particular \ndealer also provided inadequate housing facilities that exposed the \nanimals to injury from sharp wires. Fecal waste was allowed to \naccumulate in the housing facility, and often dead dogs were left where \nthey fell in cages with other living animals. Food receptacles were \nfound to be contaminated with moldy and rotten food, and potable water \nwas not readily available to the animals. All of these are direct \nviolations of the Animal Welfare Act. In addition to neglect, these \nanimals often suffer abuse at the hands of dealers. Evidence of gross \ncruelty is being uncovered while the USDA continues to investigate this \ncase.\n  The Pet Safety and Protection Act strengthens the AWA by prohibiting \nthe use of Class B dealers as suppliers of dogs and cats to research \nlaboratories. My legislation would not be a burden on research \nfacilities because only two percent of the approximately 2,051 Class B \ndealers in the United States currently sell cats and dogs to research \nfacilities. I am not here to argue whether animals should or should not \nbe used in research. Medical research is an invaluable weapon in the \nbattle against disease. New drugs and surgical techniques offer promise \nin the fight against cancer, Alzheimer's, tuberculosis, AIDS, and a \nhost of other life-threatening diseases. Animal research has been, and \ncontinues to be, fundamental to advancements in medicine. However, I am \nconcerned with the sale of stolen pets and stray animals to research \nfacilities and the poor treatment of these animals by some Class B \ndealers.\n  My legislation preserves the integrity of animal research by \nencouraging research laboratories to obtain animals from legitimate \nsources that comply with the AWA. Legitimate sources for animals \ninclude USDA-licensed Class A dealers, breeders, and research \nfacilities, municipal pounds and shelters, and legitimate pet owners \nwho want to donate their animals to research. These sources are capable \nof meeting the demand for research animals. The National Institutes of \nHealth, in an effort to curb abuse and deception, have already adopted \npolicies against the acquisition of dogs and cats from Class B dealers.\n  The Pet Safety and Protection Act also reduces the Department of \nAgriculture's regulatory burden by allowing the Department to use its \nresources more efficiently and effectively. Each year, thousands of \ndollars are spent on regulating dealers. To discourage any future \nviolations of the AWA, my bill increases the penalties to a minimum of \n$1,000 per violation.\n  I reiterate that this bill in no way impairs or impedes research, but \nwill end the fraudulent practices of some Class B dealers, as well as \nthe unnecessary suffering of these animals in their care. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2346\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the District of Columbia Access Act of 1999 \nto permanently authorize the public school and private school tuition \nassistance programs established under the Act; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, leveling the playing field for high \nschool graduates in the District of Columbia continues to be a top \npriority of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the \nFederal Workforce, and the District of Columbia which I chair. Today I \nwould like to highlight the tremendous impact the District of Columbia \nTuition Assistance Program--D.C. TAG--has had on promoting higher \neducation for high school graduates in the Nation's Capital and \nintroduce legislation that would permanently authorize the District of \nColumbia College Access Act of 1999.\n  In 1999, I worked with the House and fellow Senators Jeffords and \nDurbin to craft the District of Columbia College Access Act which was \nsigned into law on November 12, 1999. Soon after, under the direction \nof Mayor Anthony Williams, the D.C. TAG Program was created to \nimplement this important legislation. The first grants were awarded in \n2000.\n  The aim of the Program was to afford D.C. high school graduates the \nsame opportunity that high school seniors in each of the 50 States \nhave, the ability to attend public universities and colleges at in-\nState tuition rates in all 50 States and participating private \nschools--Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) nationwide \nor private colleges or universities in Virginia or Maryland. The \nprogram has made it possible for D.C. residents to attend college who \ndid not have access to similar State-supported systems.\n  The D.C. TAG scholarships are used by D.C. residents to pay the \ndifference between in-State and out-of-State tuition, up to $10,000 per \nstudent per\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\nschool year with a cumulative cap of $50,000 per student. In addition, \nas of March 2002, D.C. residents attending participating private \ninstitutions started receiving tuition grants under the program of \n$2,500 per student per school year with a cumulative cap of $12,500 per \nstudent.\n  To date, D.C. TAG has dispersed more than $63 million to a total of \n6,527 students, many of whom are the first in their family to attend \ncollege. All current high school students who are D.C. residents are \neligible for these scholarships and participation is increasing.\n  The powerful impact of the program on high school graduates \ncontinuing on to college is hard to deny. Data from the Department of \nEducation's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System show that \nthe number of D.C. high school graduates continuing on to college \nincreased from 1,750 in 1998 to 2,230 in 2002. That's a 28 percent \nincrease since the program was created. This is the highest level of \ncollege attendance of District students and exceeds the national \naverage, over the same period, of a 5-percent increase.\n  Mayor Williams stated that `'No State in the Union can make that \nclaim. This unprecedented figure is due in large part, if not almost \nexclusively, I believe, to D.C. TAG.''\n  According to a survey conducted by the D.C. TAG Office, the grants \nhave become an essential part of higher education planning for D.C. \nresidents. The majority of students who have received assistance \nthrough the program have indicated that the existence of the grants \nmade a difference in their decision to attend college, and also played \na role in deciding which college to attend.\n  It is important for my colleagues to know that thousands of D.C. \nstudents have taken advantage of this program. It can help to turn \naround years of economic and educational despair in the District.\n  We are now coming to the end of the 5-year authorization for the \nprogram which expires in November 2005. Because of this and the success \nof the program, Senators Durbin, Jeffords, Lieberman, and I are \nintroducing this bill to permanently reauthorize the D.C. College \nAccess Act.\n  In closing I would like to quote two D.C. Residents. La Rue Purry, \ncurrently a freshman at the University of Alabama states that ``This \nprogram gave me the opportunity to get the education I always wanted, \nthe education my family couldn't have provided for me.''\n  Brian Ford, a former D.C. TAG recipient, who testified at the House \ncommittee on Government Reform Hearing on March 25, 2004, stated that \n``The D.C. Tuition Assistance Program is a necessity for the city of \nWashington, DC, and for its residents. I urge Congress to please \ncontinue to provide financial support to the D.C. TAG program so one \nday students like myself can have a college diploma hanging on the wall \nfor the world to see.''\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and I'm \nconfident that it can be enacted this year. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2347\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT AUTHORIZATION OF TUITION ASSISTANCE \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Public School Program.--Section 3(i) of the District of \n     Columbia College Access Act of 1999 (sec. 38--2702(i), D.C. \n     Official Code) is amended by striking ``each of the five \n     succeeding fiscal years'' and inserting ``each succeeding \n     fiscal year''.\n       (b) Private School Program.--Section 5(f) of such Act (sec. \n     38--2704(f), D.C. Official Code) is amended by striking \n     ``each of the five succeeding fiscal years'' and inserting \n     ``each succeeding fiscal year''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2349. A bill to modify the application of the antitrust laws to \npermit collective development and implementation of a standard contract \nform for playwrights for the licensing of their plays; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 2349, ``The \nPlaywrights Licensing Antitrust Initiative'' or ``PLAI [play] Act.''\n  This legislation is designed to ensure the continued vitality of \nAmerican theater. When the theater is crowded and the curtain rises, it \nis easy to forget that the entire show began with one person: the lone \nplaywright who put pen to paper. While this artistic independence--and \nthe individual expression it fosters--are absolutely central to the \ncontinuing vitality of quality live theater in America, it has resulted \nin individual playwrights being increasingly forced into a situation \nwhere they bargain alone against corporate behemoths and organized \nlabor groups over terms of compensation and artistic control when their \nworks are performed on Broadway.\n  Due to the interaction of Federal labor law, the antitrust laws, and \nthe Copyright Act, playwrights and their voluntary peer membership \norganization, the Dramatists Guild of America, operate under the shadow \nof possible antitrust litigation, which has substantially and \ndetrimentally decreased their ability to coordinate their actions in \nprotecting their artistic and financial interests. This has impeded the \nability of playwrights to act collectively in dealing with highly-\norganized and unionized groups--such as actors, directors, and \nchoreographers on the one hand--and the increasingly consolidated \nproducers and investors on the other.\n  Playwrights contribute enduring, thoughtful entertainment and \ncultural enrichment to our lives. I know that many of my colleagues \nhere in the Senate share my appreciation for the creative work they do. \nDespite the importance of their work, our current antitrust laws \nprevent them from negotiating a standard form contract for the \nproduction of their works. As a result, playwrights--who are frequently \nat a substantial bargaining disadvantage--are forced to accept \ncontracts on a take it or leave it basis.\n  If we truly want the American stage to flourish, we must remedy this \nsituation. The PLAI Act is a narrow measure that allows playwrights, \ncomposers and lyricists--through either the Dramatists Guild or any \nother voluntary peer organization--to act collectively in dealing with \nother industry groups that operate both under and behind the bright \nlights of the American stage.\n  The PLAI Act enables playwrights to act collectively without \nviolating the antitrust laws. It allows these men and women to sit down \nwith their creative colleagues in the industry to negotiate, adopt and \nimplement a standard form contract for the production of their works. \nActors, stagehands, directors, producers and venue owners of live \ntheater--nearly all other theater workers and artists--already have \nthis right. Importantly, this extends only to the adoption and \nimplementation--but not any collective enforcement--of an updated \nstandard form contract. Thus, it would merely allow dramatists to \nreplace the terms of the current standard contract--which I am given to \nunderstand has remained virtually unchanged for several decades--with \namended terms that reflect the changing business and artistic landscape \non Broadway.\n  My hope is that the basic ability to develop a standard form contract \nas well as provisions ensuring that certain artists' rights are \nrespected in the production of their plays will encourage young, \nstruggling playwrights to continue working in the field. Too often, \nplaywrights with great potential abandon their writing--or choose to \nwrite for a different audience or venue--because they are powerless to \nnegotiate even minimum levels of compensation or artistic copyright \nprotection for their work. William Shakespeare himself was paid no more \nthan eight pounds apiece for his plays, and was not able to make his \nliving from writing. This was, of course, back in the late 16th \ncentury.\n  We should not allow today's antitrust laws to be used to discourage \nsome of our most creative citizens from pursuing careers in live \ntheater. When talented individuals are pushed away from their craft \nbecause of the unintended consequences of legislation, it is incumbent \nupon those of us in Congress to set things right.\n  As a long time enthusiast of live theater, and a lyricist myself, I \nam proud to co-sponsor this bill. It is my belief that the PLAI Act \nwill help foster the next Arthur Miller, the next Andrew\n\n[[Page S4378]]\n\nLloyd Webber, or the next Wendy Wasserstein. By helping playwrights in \nthis way we encourage the continued vibrancy of American live theater \nand artistic and literary culture.\n  I commend my co-sponsor Senator Kennedy for his efforts on this bill. \nHis leadership and support represent a significant step forward in \npreserving the future of live theater in America. I urge my colleagues \nto join Senator Kennedy and me in supporting the PLAI Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2349\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Playwrights Licensing \n     Antitrust Initiative Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NONAPPLICATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (c), the antitrust \n     laws shall not apply to any joint discussion, consideration, \n     review, action, or agreement for the express purpose of, and \n     limited to, the development of a standard form contract \n     containing minimum terms of artistic protection and levels of \n     compensation for playwrights by means of--\n       (1) meetings, discussions, and negotiations between or \n     among playwrights or their representatives and producers or \n     their representatives; or\n       (2) joint or collective voluntary actions for the limited \n     purposes of developing a standard form contract by \n     playwrights or their representatives.\n       (b) Adoption and Implementation.--Subject to subsection \n     (c), the antitrust laws shall not apply to any joint \n     discussion, consideration, review, or action for the express \n     purpose of, and limited to, reaching a collective agreement \n     among playwrights adopting a standard form contract developed \n     pursuant to subsection (a) as the participating playwrights \n     sole and exclusive means by which participating playwrights \n     shall license their plays to producers.\n       (c) Amendment of Contract.--A standard form of contract \n     developed and implemented under subsections (a) and (b) shall \n     be subject to amendment by individual playwrights and \n     producers consistent with the terms of the standard form \n     contract.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Antitrust laws.--The term ``antitrust laws'' has the \n     meaning given it in section (a) of the first section of the \n     Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12) except that such term includes \n     section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) \n     to the extent that such section applies to unfair methods of \n     competition.\n       (2) Playwright.--The term ``playwright'' means the author, \n     composer, or lyricist of a dramatic or musical work intended \n     to be performed on the speaking stage and shall include, \n     where appropriate, the adapter of a work from another medium.\n       (3) Producer.--The term ``producer''--\n       (A) means any person who obtains the rights to present live \n     stage productions of a play; and\n       (B) includes any person who presents a play as first class \n     performances in major cities, as well as those who present \n     plays in regional and not-for-profit theaters.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join in cosponsoring \nthe Playwrights Licensing Antitrust Initiative Act, to permit the \ndevelopment of a standard, minimum contract for playwrights for the \nlicensing and production of their work.\n  The bill will provide needed protection for playwrights whose work is \nthe creative force behind so many memorable successes in the Nation's \nperforming arts. The stunning creations that millions of Americans \nenjoy on Broadway, Off Broadway, and in local communities across the \ncountry reflect the special genius of our creative artists. They \nexpress our Nation's hopes, disappointments, achievements and its \nchallenges for the years ahead.\n  If you travel to New York this week, you can attend any one of dozens \nof shows to entertain or enlighten us. There are classic musical \nproductions--shows that we have loved all our lives such as Gypsy and \n42nd Street and Fiddler on the Roof, and more recently, The Producers. \nThere are other dramatic works on issues that are important to each of \nus--about personal struggles and individual achievement and growth, \nabout immigration and race relations--Bridge and Tunnel, The Tricky \nPart and Caroline, or Change. They are the new classics from the \nemerging voices of theater.\n  The men and women who write these shows should be fairly compensated \nfor their creative achievements. The bill that Senator Hatch and I \nintroduce today will provide a measure of greater fairness for them. \nCurrently, they are prohibited from entering into any collective \nnegotiation for compensation or control of their work. Because they are \nnot members of a union, they must negotiate individually with producers \nof their work.\n  For well-known authors, the negotiation can be challenging. For \nemerging authors, it can be impossible.\n  The bill we are proposing will grant a very limited modification of \nthe antitrust laws, so that playwrights will be able to negotiate a \nminimum compensation package as fair reimbursement for their work. It \nwill give playwrights similar rights to actors, actresses, dancers, \ncomposers, musicians and others who bring theater to life on America's \nstages.\n  Currently, writers who work in the film industry enjoy greater \nprotection for their work than their counterparts in the theater. We \nneed to do more to see that our talented playwrights are able to \ncontinue their work in our theaters, and end the alarming current trend \naway from writing for live theater.\n  As President Kennedy once said, ``I am certain that after the dust of \ncenturies has passed over our cities, we, too, will be remembered not \nfor victories or defeats in battle or politics, but for our \ncontribution to the human spirit.''\n  I hope that we can take this opportunity to expand the creative arts \nin our country and contribute to the vital spirit of our citizens in \ncommunities across America with their performances in drama, comedy and \nmusic.\n  American theater is as lively, diverse, and exciting as any in the \nworld. We must do all we can to protect this unique legacy and ensure a \nhealthy theater community in the years ahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S.J. Res. 34. A joint resolution designating May 29, 2004, on the \noccasion of the dedication of the National World War II Memorial, as \nRemembrance of World War II Veterans Day; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, after 17 years of hard work on the part of \nmany individuals, especially World War II veterans, the World War II \nmemorial will become a reality on Saturday, May 29, 2004 with a \ndedication ceremony in Washington, D.C. Hundreds of thousands of World \nWar II veterans and their families are expected to attend. In \nrecognition of this important occasion, I am introducing a Senate Joint \nResolution along with my distinguished colleague, Senator Byron Dorgan, \nto honor our World War II veterans, their families and this dedication \nnext month.\n  The idea for the National World War II Memorial was first presented \nto Congresswomen Marcy Kaptur during a conversation with a constituent \nand World War II veteran, Roger Durbin in 1987. Shortly after that \nconversation, Congresswoman Kaptur introduced legislation to create a \nmemorial, and Congress passed legislation authorizing the national \nmemorial in 1993.\n  The National World War II Memorial will pay tribute to the more than \n16,112,000 veterans of all military services--Army, Army Air Corps, \nMarine Corps, Navy, Coast Guard and Merchant Marine--who served in \nWorld War II between the invasion of Poland in 1939 and the surrender \nof Japan in 1945. Approximately 69,000 of these servicemen were from \nNorth Dakota. The memorial will acknowledge the supreme sacrifice of \nmore than 400,000 military personnel, including 1,569 North Dakotans, \nwho lost their lives between 1939 and 1945.\n  As veterans and their families visit Washington over the coming \nweeks, many will recall the heroism and sacrifices from some of the \nremarkable campaigns and famous battles of World War II, including the \nattack on Pearl Harbor, December, 1941; the Battle of Midway, June, \n1942; the Allied campaign across North Africa, November, 1942; \nOperation Overlord (D-Day), June 1944; the capture of Iwo Jima, \nFebruary, 1945; and the Tokyo bombing raids of March, 1945.\n  The Memorial will also have special meaning for North Dakotans as \nthey remember the heroic efforts of the 164th Infantry Regiment of the \nAmerican Division, a unit of the North Dakota Army National Guard and \nthe\n\n[[Page S4379]]\n\nfirst unit of the United States Army to land on Guadalcanal in October, \n1942. Some of the fiercest fighting of World War II took place in the \neffort to recapture the island.\n  The Memorial will also hold special meaning for Senators and Members \nof Congress of the 108th Congress as we recognize and honor current \nmembers including Senator Daniel K. Akaka, Senator Ernest F. Hollings, \nSenator Daniel K. Inouye, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Senator Ted \nStevens, Senator John W. Warner, Congressman Cass Ballenger, \nCongressman John D. Dingell, Congressman Ralph M. Hall, Congressman Amo \nHoughton, Congressman Henry J. Hyde, and Congressman Ralph Regula.\n  As we pause during the Memorial Day weekend to remember World War II \nveterans who served and sacrificed so much more than 59 years ago, it \nis my hope that Americans will honor and remember this ``Greatest \nGeneration'' for the contributions that have enabled millions of \nAmericans, for more than 50 years, to enjoy unparalled prosperity and \nthe blessings of freedom. Let us also remember the ongoing sacrifices \nof our active duty military personnel who are currently serving in all \nparts of the world, but especially in Iraq and the conflict against \nterrorism in Afghanistan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 34\n\n       Whereas on May 29, 2004, thousands of veterans, their \n     families, and friends will gather on the Mall in Washington, \n     District of Columbia, to dedicate the National World War II \n     Memorial;\n       Whereas on that day, Americans will pay tribute to the more \n     than 16,112,000 veterans of all military services who served \n     in World War II between the German invasion of Poland in 1939 \n     and the surrender by Japan on V-J Day in 1945;\n       Whereas on that day, Americans will be reminded of the \n     heroism and sacrifice of members of the Armed Forces who were \n     on duty during some of the critical conflicts of World War \n     II, including the attack on Pearl Harbor of December 7, 1941, \n     the Battle of Midway of June 6, 1942, the invasion of \n     Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942, the Allied campaign in North \n     Africa in November 1942, Operation Overlord (D-Day) on June \n     6, 1944, the capture of Iwo Jima on February 23, 1945, and \n     the Tokyo bombing raids of March 1945;\n       Whereas on that day, veterans and their families from North \n     Dakota will honor the heroism and sacrifice of the \n     approximately 69,000 North Dakota veterans who served in \n     World War II, including 1,569 who made the ultimate \n     sacrifice, and recognize the hardships and sacrifices of the \n     164th Regiment of the American Division, a unit of the North \n     Dakota Army National Guard, who were the first unit of the \n     United States Army to land on Guadalcanal on October 13, \n     1942, in the campaign to recapture that island;\n       Whereas on that day, America will acknowledge the supreme \n     sacrifice of the more than 400,000 Army, Army Air Corps, \n     Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine \n     personnel who were killed in action in World War II;\n       Whereas 12 distinguished Senators and Members of Congress \n     serving in the 108th Congress, including Senator Daniel K. \n     Akaka, Senator Ernest F.
