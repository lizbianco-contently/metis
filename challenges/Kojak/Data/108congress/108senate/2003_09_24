Mr. President, this morning the Senate will conduct a \nperiod of morning business to allow Senators to speak. Following \nmorning business, at approximately 10:35, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the DC appropriations bill. I know there is one issue \nthat will require some debate and a vote, but it is my hope we can \ncomplete this bill in a relatively short period of time. Typically, \nthis is an appropriations measure that has not consumed a great deal of \nfloor time. Senator DeWine will be ready at a little after 10:30 this \nmorning, and we will monitor progress on this legislation, with the \nhope of finishing soon.\n  I also add that we hope again to be receiving from the House some of \nthe completed appropriations conference reports. Once those reports are \nreceived, I will be speaking to the Democratic leader about scheduling \nthose measures for floor action. Again, I hope we can move quickly on \nthose items and get them to the President's desk for his signature as \nsoon as possible.\n  Finally, I also want to remind Members that we will continue to \nschedule votes on available nominations throughout the week. We have \neight judicial nominations pending on the Executive Calendar. Four of \nthese nominations should be ready for Senate action, and we will \nschedule them over the course of the next day or so. As always, we will \nkeep Members apprised of the voting schedule and as to when the first \nvote is ordered today.\n  Some people have asked about next week. I have already told people \nthat we will be voting on Monday of next week. I mention that because a \nnumber of people have asked me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11877-7", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11877-S11878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION REQUEST\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly, I want to make a comment on \nthe President's comments yesterday before the United Nations.\n  The President of the United States and leaders from across the globe \ngathered yesterday at the United Nations headquarters in Manhattan to \nreceive the President's address. It is worth pausing to consider just \nwhere that was. The address yesterday was in New York City, in the \nheart of Manhattan, a few dozen blocks from Ground Zero. The world's \nleaders were able to safely assemble and freely debate their proposals \nin a city that had borne the tragedy of September 11. Many were able to \nexercise more freedom yesterday in New York than is allowed in their \nown countries.\n  President Bush, in his address, boldly challenged the assembly to \nsupport the cause of liberty in Iraq. His case was powerful, and his \ncase was powerful in part because the cause of freedom itself is so \npowerful. Some of my colleagues have basically questioned again and \nagain the overall war on terror. There is this magnification of each \nsetback along the way, and many people dismiss the many advances that \nare being made each and every day. There seems to be this attempt to \ndiscredit the war on terror.\n  Some people say we have acted unilaterally. We know that is false. \nThe truth is we were joined by 49 countries to depose Saddam Hussein \nand remove his regime. Now we hear increasingly that there was a lack \nof broad international support on the ground. That is\n\n[[Page S11878]]\n\nnot true. We know there are 31 nations that currently have troops \ndeployed to Iraq. British troops are leading a multinational division, \nas are the Polish troops; and the President hopes to have at least one \nmore international division helping to bring stability and security.\n  I think those people claiming the President has lost opportunities to \nmake his case before the American people ignore the many times the \nPresident has spelled out his case and argued his case before the \nAmerican people, to this Congress, and, indeed, multiple times now to \nthe United Nations.\n  The President's opponents continually move the goalposts further and \nfurther, so that never is there enough detail or never are there enough \nspecifics. But we have these claims. These claims are specious; they \ncan be rebutted one by one.\n  I think the most powerful rebuttal is what the Iraqi people feel and \nwhat they say. Finally free to speak their own minds in a remarkable \npoll--the first of its kind--conducted in August and published by the \nWall Street Journal, the Iraqi people themselves say loudly and clearly \nthat they want us to stay and they want us to finish the job.\n  They are optimistic about the future. Seven out of ten say they \nexpect that their country and their personal lives will be better 5 \nyears from now. A third say much better. When asked about which country \nthey would prefer as a political model out of five--Syria, Saudi \nArabia, Iran, Egypt, or the United States--the most popular by far is \nthe United States.\n  A majority of those who hold an opinion have a negative view of \nterror leader Osama bin Laden, and 74 percent of respondents want to \nsee Saddam's henchmen punished. They want us--not Saddam or Osama bin \nLaden--to stay and help make their country whole.\n  The President has submitted a reconstruction plan to us with three \nclear objectives: to improve security by aggressively hunting down the \nterrorists; to expand international participation; and, finally, to \nhelp Iraq and Afghanistan become free, democratic, and stable nations.\n  This week, there are a number of hearings being conducted on both the \nSenate side and the House side to closely examine the President's \nproposal and to assess what is needed in a thoughtful way. These \nproceedings give us all the opportunity to ask questions and allow the \nadministration to demonstrate how, when presented accurately, \ncarefully, and clearly, we can achieve the objectives we have set out \nin the war on terror.\n  The debate, I hope, will continue to be dignified and serious, and in \ngood faith I believe we can complete consideration of this emergency \nrequest by the end of next week. There are a lot of questions being \nasked. I encourage that. Ultimately, I am confident we will \noverwhelmingly support the President's request.\n  Mr. President, we will stand by the Iraqis. We will help them build a \nfree, prosperous, and democratic country. Their future security--\nindeed, our security--and the security of civilized people everywhere \ndepends on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11878-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning in support of President \nBush and our troops as this Nation continues to fight and win the war \non terrorism in Afghanistan, Iraq, and around the globe.\n  We all know there are many great attributes in our United States of \nAmerica. The people of America will rise to any occasion and will do \nwhat is necessary to protect freedom and opportunities for themselves \nand future generations. But there are some attributes on which \nsometimes we fail a little bit. One of those is we are a bit short \nsometimes in our memory, remembering back to what happened a few years \nago. Sometimes our patience is a little short and we want immediate \naction. We will rise to any occasion, fight off any chaos, but then we \nwant to deal with that situation and move on to something else.\n  I think that is a little of what we are seeing now as we listen to \nwhat I consider to be sometimes overheated rhetoric in questioning \nmotives and resisting doing what is necessary to complete the job: a \nlittle patience, a little commitment to support freedom and democracy \nwhich we are trying to assist in Iraq and in the war on terrorism.\n  I said we seem to have forgotten. What happened to that era of the \ngreat Senator Vandenberg who stood up and said, when it comes to \nforeign policy and war, partisanship ends at the shoreline, or \nsomething to that effect; that when we are dealing with an \ninternational problem, a conflict, a war, we are all together. Or even \nmore recently, Lyndon Johnson aggressively supported the policies of \nPresident Eisenhower even though the leader of the Republicans at the \ntime, Senator Taft, did not necessarily go along with it. But there was \na bipartisan policy.\n  We have had that in our efforts to deal with these very difficult \nissues in Iraq and Afghanistan and homeland security, but it seems to \nbe a little frayed right now. I think that is dangerous. I don't think \nit is good for America. I don't think it is good for what we are trying \nto achieve in fighting terrorism around the world. I don't think it is \ngood for our troops.\n  Also, how short is our memory that we don't even remember the debate \nthat was going on 1 year ago? We were discussing what to do about Iraq. \nThe President was then going to the United Nations, and Secretary \nPowell had been to the United Nations. We were demanding more \ninformation. We were saying the President needed to go to the United \nNations. And in each incident, he actually did what people were asking \nhim to do. He did it. He went to the United Nations. He made the plea. \nUnfortunately, the United Nations didn't support what they said for 10 \nyears in a dozen resolutions. They said: We can continue to negotiate; \nmore inspections, more inspections. They would not step up and take \naction against this brutal tyrant, Saddam Hussein. But we did. America \ndid. The President did. The Congress did. That is the point I am trying \nto make.\n  We had this debate. We knew what we were going into. We had looked at \nthe intelligence. Was the intelligence perfect? No. Is it ever? It is \nalways subjective. But we voted in this body 77 to 23 for the Iraq \nresolution. The House of Representatives voted almost 300--296--to 133. \nSo we should not forget that vote. We should not forget the tremendous \nsuccesses that have been enjoyed in terms of getting Saddam Hussein out \nof his position where he was spending money on palaces and allowing the \npeople to suffer. He was murdering his own people and his neighbors. \nThe infrastructure was just decaying beyond repair. We stepped up, and \nwe did the same in Afghanistan. Our troops did a great job. Now are we \ngoing to say, It's your problem? Do we really expect the French to do \nthe job? I don't think so. We are going to have to stay the course. We \nare going to have to do this job, and there is nobody else going to do \nit for us.\n\n  Oh, when the problem is in their immediate neighborhood, such as \nBosnia or Kosovo, the Europeans say: You must lead; you have to come \nin. We supported that operation. Almost every action that was requested \nby President Clinton we supported, sometimes very reluctantly. I \nremember thinking: OK,\n\n[[Page S11879]]\n\nI support the bombing of the site in Afghanistan and the Sudan, because \nwe thought they had chemical precursors. They didn't have them. But \ngenerally we came together and we provided leadership.\n  I saw a lady from England on TV this morning. Somebody asked her: Why \ndo the Europeans and other people in the world not feel good about \nAmericans right now? She said: It is because you are leaders; the world \nexpects you to do the job. You do the job, and they are jealous of you. \nThey want it, but they don't like it. It is human nature. We should not \nbe too hard on them. I called on cooling the overheated rhetoric, and I \nwant to remember that myself. We all overspeak and overstate our \npositions sometimes, but this is serious stuff with which we are \ndealing.\n  We called on the President a month ago: Mr. President, you have to \nstep up and remind us what the vision is. He did. He went on TV. He \nrocked us back on our heels. He didn't ask for $55 billion or $65 \nbillion to do the job as we thought he would. It was $87 billion. Oh, \nyes, I was a little stunned. I don't like the deficits we are beginning \nto have. They were caused by the economy, 9/11, by the stock market \nproblems--all kinds of situations. Still, that kind of money deserves \nsome close examination.\n  I have been saying for several days now I want some answers. As \nrepresentatives of the people, we should ask for answers. We deserve \nthat. Exactly how is this money going to be broken out? Fifty-one \nbillion dollars will go for the Iraqi campaign; $11 billion for the \nAfghanistan campaign. It is not over. Are we are going to follow the \nexample of generations of failure in Afghanistan or are we going to \nfinish the job there? Of course, Noble Eagle, $4 billion for homeland \ndefense. The job goes on.\n  We have the list of where the money would go for reconstruction, and \nI have asked questions. Mr. President, there is $5 billion for border \nenhancement. We need that because terrorists are coming into that \ncountry from all over the region to attack our coalition troops--the \nAmericans, the British, the Poles, and the United Nations. We need to \ndo more--basic electricity services, water and sanitation services, \ntransportation, oil infrastructure.\n  Some people have said and I have said: Why don't the Iraqis do more \non their own? They are going to have this oil coming in; they are going \nto have oil. They don't have it. They are broke. The infrastructure is \nmore decimated than we ever dreamed. So I have questioned this money, \nbut I have looked at it. I have thought about it. I listened very \ncarefully to Ambassador Bremer yesterday, and I am convinced we have to \ndo this. We have to have the money for our troops to do the job, for \nhomeland security, for the reconstruction, and we have to do it now. It \nis a critical part of restoring security right now.\n\n  Leaders who are working with us are being intimidated, assaulted, and \nmurdered. People from whom we had been getting information, who were \nhelping us get people into the police and developing a force for the \nfuture, have withdrawn because they are a little concerned whether we \nwill stay the course.\n  A lot of it is affected by the people's attitude. Right here, in the \nDC area, we have people without power. It weakens defenses. So we need \nto move in there quickly without going through an international \norganization, without trying to hassle through a loan arrangement, and \nprovide the money so we can get the power back on, so we can get the \nwater flowing.\n  There should be a process that others join in. Surely, countries of \nthe United Nations, if it is worth anything, will help the Iraqis with \ntheir humanitarian needs as they continue to rebuild the \ninfrastructure, as they try to develop their own government. Can the \nUnited Nations help with that? I hope so. I would like to give them a \nchance. I have not seen a lot yet, but they could.\n  After we get over this initial phase, I think the reconstruction \nmoney right now is every bit as important as the security money. It is \na part of the security. We want to stop the assault on our troops. We \nwant to begin to get the border under control. We have to do it and we \nhave to do it now. A year from now it will be worse, maybe impossible.\n  So I came this morning to say I did not just leap to accept this \namount of money. I did question how it could be done, but I am \nconvinced if we do not do this, others will not follow suit. We are \ngoing to be going to other countries around the world that should be of \nassistance, Japan and countries such as Turkey that can hopefully \nprovide some troops. We are going to ask them to ante up and kick in. \nBut we are going to have to set an example. If we haggle over the \ndetails of this arrangement, they will not do their job. Then we are \ngoing to have to go to countries such as Russia, France, and Germany \nand say they have to forgive the debt that they have accumulated over a \nperiod of years because they were working with Saddam Hussein. We have \nto lead. We have to set an example, but it is tough.\n  I am going to support the whole package. We should do it quickly \nbecause if we do not, this moment could get away from us, and we could \njust walk away, leave that country and those people, that region, in \nchaos. In the end, if we do not stop it here, over there it will be \nhere. So I urge my colleagues to stand up; let us do what we did last \nyear. Let us do the right thing; let us finish the job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from the great State of Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation for the \ncomments of the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott. He \nhas been in this body a long time. He has wrestled with a lot of \ndifficult issues. He knows that a lot of times, one just has to lead. \nThey have to stand up and be counted and do the right thing. Once a \nnation commits itself, a Congress commits itself, there is no way we \ncan turn around and waffle around next week based on some polling data \nor some comment from France or the U.N. That is not the way great \nnations behave.\n  I am proud of the United States of America. We have stood up. We have \nbeen counted. We have been on the side of right in the world. When \nshould look at the wars and decimation that has occurred in \nAfghanistan. I was there a few weeks ago and they are rebuilding \nhouses, using the same procedure of straw, mud, and brick covered with \na mud stucco, that they have used for 2,000 years. They are building \neverywhere in Afghanistan after 20 years of oppression, war, and \ndestruction, to a degree that few nations in the world have ever seen.\n  These are good and decent people, but Afghanistan was used as a base \nfrom which to attack the people of the United States of America. The \nGovernment of Afghanistan would not renounce that, would not say they \nwere going to stop it, so the United States of America led. We have \nchanged that Government. Anybody who has seen President Karzai, as I \nhad the opportunity to do--and we have seen him on television--knows \nthat he is a man of vision, talent, and decency. He loves the people of \nAfghanistan. He wants to see them succeed and do better.\n  The same is true of Iraq. I was there also, and I saw the oppression, \nthe total devastation of a country that had every opportunity to be so \nmuch better. The people should have had a better life than they did, \nbut Saddam Hussein took his people into war after war. He developed \nweapons of mass destruction. His megalomania led him to believe that he \ncould be the next Nebuchadnezzar and take over the Middle East, then \nrule the world. Do not think his goals did not include developing the \nmost dangerous weapons the world has ever known. He was prepared to do \nthat, and he did that.\n  When he would not renounce these weapons or demonstrate that he did \nnot have those weapons, so we moved against him and his sinister aims. \nWe have liberated that country.\n  There have been a lot of complaints, and we debated this on the \nSenate floor many times. Those who complain have expressed concerns of \nall kinds. They said there were going to be problems in the Arab \nstreets, the Arab nations would all turn against us, there would be \nstreet-to-street fighting in Iraq, we would lose thousands of soldiers, \nit would take months and months to succeed, the weapons of mass \ndestruction would be used against our troops, we would bog down, there \nwould be a humanitarian disaster, there would be\n\n[[Page S11880]]\n\nstarvation and refugees everywhere by the millions, and we did not have \nenough troops to win the battle.\n  All of those things and more were raised. We talked about them. We \ndebated them, and everybody had their say. We had open hearings and \nclosed hearings. We read, we talked, we debated for months on end. \nThere was not any secret about it. It was not any plan hatched in \nTexas. It was a plan voted on and debated in this body. We voted 77 to \n23 to commit the United States of America to this action. Our military \nperformed better than anybody could ever have imagined. Decisively and \nswiftly they defeated the Iraqi army, ousted them from power \ncompletely, put Saddam Hussein on the run, put an end to his evil sons, \nand have set about to establish a good government there.\n\n  I was in Mosul and was introduced to the city council. They have an \nArab, a Turk, a Christian, and others on that council. They were men of \nability and wisdom. We talked. They love the city of Mosul and the \ncountry of Iraq, and they want an open, free society where people with \nwhatever beliefs can be able to function. They want to renounce and \nturn away from the past of Saddam Hussein. That is true all over this \ncountry, but it is difficult. It has proven to be a challenge for us, \nno doubt about it, to completely have peace and order in that large \ncountry.\n  I am pleased when I go and see soldiers from my State of Alabama, \nmany of them National Guardsmen--I had dinner with them and talked with \nthem. They believe they are making a difference in this area of the \nMiddle East, where there has been so much disorder, so much oppression, \nso much killing, particularly in Iraq. Millions have died as a result \nof Saddam Hussein's wars and oppression at home. One can go there and \nsee the graves. With the energy and dedication of these fine soldiers, \nI think we are going to be successful.\n  I am glad President Bush went to the United Nations. It is an \norganization that deserves our respect. It is entitled to courtesy, and \nPresident Bush has given it that. The Christian Science Monitor today \nsaid President Bush went to the U.N. yesterday with a message of both \nreconciliation and resolve, and that is exactly what he ought to do. \nReconciliation, we want to talk to them and deal with their concerns, \nbut we are resolved.\n  What then is our difficulty with the U.N.? I will share a couple of \nthoughts. The first is, the U.N. is incapable of taking decisive \naction. It has not done so in Iraq. It has never done so in its \nhistory. Why? Well, the Security Council requires unanimity in order to \nact. Russia is on the Security Council, as well as France, Germany, and \nothers. Some rotate on each year or two, and they serve a period of \ntime. The idea that they can get a unanimous vote is almost \nimpossible. So decisive action is not possible. It has never happened, \nand it is not going to happen with the U.N. But President Bush did get \na resolution that Secretary Colin Powell worked so hard on, which in my \nview--authorized us to take military action.\n\n  Then they said they wanted another resolution, and we sought that. \nThen France flipped on us, and Germany said no. France even lobbied \nother countries around the world and blocked a further vote.\n  What were our options then? Do we just stop and not defend our \nlegitimate national interests? Do we not carry out the foreign policy \nwe believe is in our interests? Should we make it our policy to cede \nthe decisionmaking authority the American people have vested in us, our \nelected President, our elected Congress, to some world body that has \nproven incapable of decisive action? I don't think so.\n  I believe we are on the right track in with the U.N. The President is \nshowing respect to this group, but we are not going to allow the \ndecision making power of our country to be shifted to the U.N. We are \nnot going to turn over our military that the American people have \nsupported, funded, and created, the finest military the world has ever \nknown--we are not going to turn it over to them. In Kosovo, that is \nbasically what we did. The NATO nations met to deploy our Air Force. We \ndid that, and they kind of liked that. Maybe they think that is what \nthe world is going to be like from now on, but it is not. We have a \nresponsibility to lead.\n  As Tony Blair asked the question: Why America? Why now?\n  He said: My answer to you is that it is your destiny, it is your \ntime. Who else can do it?\n  I believe in the values of this country. I trust our wisdom. I trust \nour good judgment. I believe in what we are doing, and I believe it is \ngood for not only America but the world. I don't apologize for that, \nand I don't believe some socialist leftover Marxist veto in the U.N. \nshould stop us from doing what is necessary for the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we all watched with great interest the \nPresident's remarks at the U.N. yesterday. When one looks at the U.N., \nit is impossible not to have kind of a mixed view. Certainly the U.N. \nhas, on many occasions over the years, done worthwhile work. But \nrarely, if ever, has it taken the lead on anything of significance.\n  The reason for that, obviously, is that the membership is so diverse. \nMany of the governments that are represented there of course are not \ndemocracies; they are not particularly interested in what America \nstands for, so it is not entirely surprising that the President's \ndecision--and the support of Congress for that decision was 77 out of \n100 votes to change the regime in Iraq--was viewed with mixed reactions \nat the U.N.\n  Had the United States waited on the U.N., Saddam Hussein would still \nbe in power. But that is not what the President decided to do. The \nPresident led a coalition of 19 willing governments to liberate the \npeople of Iraq. Although many in the U.N. actively opposed and many \nothers were just completely ambivalent about that effort, there is no \nquestion that the world is better off with Saddam Hussein gone.\n  Make no mistake about it, that regime is no more. The only Iraqis who \nare not immensely better off are those who perpetrated crimes against \nhumanity on a massive scale and abetted in the murder of 300,000 \ninnocent Iraqi civilians. Not since Saddam Hussein was in power have \ninnocent Iraqis been hauled off in the middle of the night to rape \nrooms and torture chambers. Not since Saddam Hussein was in power have \ninnocent Iraqis been summarily executed. Not since Saddam Hussein was \nin power have ethnic and religious minorities been gassed or murdered \nat will by a tyrannical regime. And, yes, Saddam Hussein no longer \nprovides succor and support to international terrorists who plot the \nmurder of Israelis, Americans, and everyone who opposes their radical \ninterpretation of Islam.\n  There are no more terrorist training camps in Iraq, and Saddam \nHussein no longer cuts checks to support suicide bombings in Israel. \nThe Iraqi regime is no longer pursuing weapons of mass destruction, and \nit will never be able to use them against its own people, not ever.\n  Are there problems in finishing the job in Iraq? You bet. But free \nIraq remains hostile to terrorists and to tyranny. President Bush noted \nyesterday that there are still challenges in Iraq and they are \nchallenges that confront all free nations. The terrorists are making a \ndesperate last stand in Iraq and, frankly, I would rather be fighting \nthem there than fighting them here.\n  The world's challenge now is to secure Iraq. We know nobody else is \ngoing to do that job for us. That is an American responsibility. We \nwould like to have help from others, and we are going to get help from \nothers, whether the U.N. officially endorses some kind of American \neffort here or not. But we are going to lead this effort and we are \ngoing to finish the job.\n  We are going to have a great debate here next week about providing \nthe funds to finish the job. There will be a lot of amendments offered, \na lot of amendments voted on, a lot of speeches made. But at the end of \nthe day, with a bipartisan, overwhelming majority, the Senate is going \nto give the President the money to finish the job. We are helping \nthe Iraqis round up terrorists and the Baathist thugs who oppose \nliberty for the Iraqi people. We are helping the Iraqis to rebuild \nroads and schools and hospitals. We are helping the Iraqis to build for \nthemselves a multiethnic moderate democracy in the very heart of the \nMiddle East.\n\n[[Page S11881]]\n\n  This is a great cause. We ought to be rallying behind it. This is \neverything for which America has stood for several hundred years. \nEverything we believe in, we are promoting in Iraq. The Iraqis will be \nbetter off. The world will be better off when we finish this job.\n  Failure is not an option. Waffling around here just because the going \nis a little tougher than some had expected--and others had \nanticipated--is not what is called for at this particular time. Going \nhome early is surely the way to reinvigorate al-Qaida and to make it \npossible for some other kind of thuggish regime to come to power there \nin Iraq.\n  Given the magnitude of the threat the proliferation of Islamic \nradicals and terrorism pose, not only to us but to the entire world, I \nam a little mystified that this seems to have become so controversial. \nAs Senator Lott was pointing out just a few moments ago, we have very \nshort memories. Just 2 years ago, 3,000 of our people were killed in \nNew York and in Washington. That is what this is all about: Taking the \nwar to the terrorists where they are rather than here on the streets of \nthe United States.\n  So, yes, we will have our debate. It will be vigorous. But at the end \nof the day, I am confident that the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, is \ngoing to do what is right for the Iraqis, for the United States, and \nfor the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I heard and appreciate Senators Lott, \nSessions, and McConnell speaking this morning about the importance of \nwhat we are doing in Iraq. We are preparing in the Senate to take up a \nsupplemental appropriations bill at the request of the President to try \nto make sure we do two things:\n  First and foremost, to give support to our troops in the field. I \nvisited them in the middle of August. I have seen how they live, and I \nhave seen what they are doing. They deserve to have the troop support \nwhich allows them to do the job--the equipment, the living conditions, \nand troop protection. Everything we can do to allow them to do their \njobs more effectively we are going to do. That is what the major part \nof this supplemental appropriations will do. We are going to support \nour troops in the field.\n  The second thing the President is asking for is money to rebuild \nIraq. We will not be able to rebuild Iraq if we continue to have the \nongoing terrorist attacks that tear down everything we have built. So \nwe want to go in there with a full plan to get the electricity grid \ngoing, to get the water supply going, and to try to start building the \neconomy by rebuilding the oil infrastructure.\n  We are going to support the President in his request. I have no doubt \nabout it. We must win this war, and we must win the peace. We must \nstabilize Iraq if we are going to keep the terrorists out of our \ncountry and stop them where they are.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11881-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11881-S11885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REBUILDING IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Thank you, Mr. President. I will use my leader time this \nmorning so as not to take away from the allocated time in morning \nbusiness for the Democratic caucus.\n  I wanted to come to the floor this morning to respond perhaps in part \nto the comments made by our distinguished colleagues.\n  I will start by emphasizing that there are many areas for which there \nis absolutely no disagreement. I don't think you will find any \ndisagreement in the Senate today that it was a good thing that Saddam \nHussein was removed from power. We acknowledge that it was a good \nthing. Saddam Hussein posed serious threat to the region, to his \ncountry, and to the United States. His absence is a positive \ndevelopment.\n  There is also broad recognition that we owe a deep debt of gratitude \nto our troops and to the military overall for the extraordinary \nchallenge they face and the success with which they face it.\n  Let us also recognize that there is little disagreement that it is \nimportant to Iraq and this country that we allow for the reconstruction \nof Iraq. I think many of us are very concerned. This is where some of \nthe disagreement and differences may begin to arise about the \nextraordinary lack of planning that went into the reconstruction \neffort. Some have suggested that we planned for months--maybe years--\nfor the military effort, and it shows. It was a great success.\n  I have been told--and I will not say that this is confirmed, but I \nhave been told--that we planned for less than a month on efforts to \nreconstruct Iraq. That also shows, if that is true. I think it is a \nfact that reconstruction has certainly not met with the same success \nand with the same degree of support within our own country that the \nmilitary effort itself has.\n\n  That is where we come to our point of disagreement. I regret that the \nPresident lost the opportunity that he had yesterday in making his \npresentation to the United Nations. He lost an opportunity to make the \ncase for broader involvement in the world community. He didn't ask for \nmore troops. For whatever reason, he didn't ask for more resources. He \nfailed to build the broad coalition that will be required if ever we \nare successful in the future reconstruction of Iraq. There is no \ndisagreement whatsoever that it is in our interest to find ways to \nengage the world community more effectively and to make a better effort \nat public relations required to do it successfully in Iraq.\n  There is a front-page story in the Sioux Falls Argus Leader this \nmorning about an Iraqi businessman from Sioux Falls who, months ago, \nleft Sioux Falls to work in his hometown in Iraq as they began to \nrebuild. He became very involved in the creation of a new government. \nHe was an ardent opponent to Saddam Hussein. He commented this morning \nthat he comes back with grave regret about what he has seen. He said \nthat, unfortunately, more and more Iraqis are losing their confidence \nand trust in the reconstruction effort; that more and more we are \nlosing the public relations battle.\n  While we all want to find a way to ensure that we are successful, it \nwould be wrong for us to bury our heads in the sand, to plow forward, \nto salute the flag, and say: Look, everything is just great. All we \nneed is more money.\n  We can't do that. We have to make an honest assessment of our \ncircumstances, acknowledge that there is work to be done, and be honest \nwith ourselves and the world community on how we accomplish all that we \nhave set out to do. To do it successfully requires candor first and \nhonesty second. Unfortunately, we have not seen enough of that today.\n  We are being told that we are going to rush through this request for \nresources, $87 billion--a couple of days of hearings, a quick markup, a \ncouple of days of floor debate and, bang, it is done. I have to say \nthat isn't going to happen. We have to be deliberative.\n  As the Senator from Kentucky suggested, we have to consider \nalternatives, offer amendments, have a good debate, and make sure this \n$87 billion was committed appropriately.\n  I say that the President missed his chance to speak candidly \nyesterday. I would have hoped that he could have laid out a plan, and \nthat he could have been very specific with regard to how we more \neffectively put this coalition together. We hear so much discussion \nabout the involvement of other communities. We are told that we would \nexpect the world community to produce about $55 billion in resources to \nmatch the $87 billion requested by the President by the United States. \nYet, again, yesterday Ambassador Bremer had to acknowledge that out of \nthat $55 billion expectation, the world community has only provided \n$1.5 billion.\n  I would have hoped the President could have been more specific with \nregard to our plan for troops. What will they be doing? How long will \nthey be there? To what extent will we have to keep them there, and for \nhow long?\n  Over the course of the next couple of weeks, it would be my hope that \nthe President could come to the Congress with very specific requests \nwith regard to that $87 billion and with regard to the resources he \nsays he needs. I hope he could lay out with some specificity what his \nplan is for the reconstruction of Iraq. We were told by Ambassador \nBremer yesterday that the $20 billion\n\n[[Page S11882]]\n\nover and above the $65 billion request for our troops is the last, \nfinal installment. There will be no more additional requests for Iraq \nfrom here on out.\n  I wish I could believe that. I wish I knew they had that level of \nconfidence that not one dollar more would be requested.\n  I wish I could better understand their opposition to a proposal made \nby the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, and others \nwho have suggested we collateralize the oil revenues in Iraq for the \nnext 20 years. We are told that could be upwards of $160 billion. \nCollateralized through an IMF loan may not necessitate the need for $20 \nbillion or $30 billion on the part of the United States. They may have \nthe second most formidable oil supply in the world. Why we would not \ncollateralize and find ways with which to utilize the resources \navailable to them is something the administration needs to more \nthoroughly explain.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Is it true that the request of the President, if granted, \nwill cause the United States sometime next summer to increase the debt \nceiling of this country?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Unfortunately, I have to acknowledge to the Senator from \nNevada, that is what we are now being told. I was going to address that \nin a moment, but the Senator is absolutely right. We have been forced \nto address the debt ceiling this year for the second time. We will be \ncalled upon within this Congress now to address it the third time. We \nare told by CBO that we could see in excess of $6,000 billion of debt \nby the end of this decade. Some have suggested that if all of the tax \ncuts that are now scheduled to be implemented go into effect, that \nnumber would reach $10,000 billion by the end of this decade.\n  The CBO, in a very rare moment, in my view--we do not often hear them \neditorializing on things of this matter; they usually give us the fact \nand leave it at that--used the word ``unsustainable.'' That $10,000 \nbillion, even $6,000 billion, of debt is unsustainable.\n  The American people have said, if we are going to be mired in \nunsustainable debt, somebody better start asking questions about \nwhether this $87 billion or the $22 billion for reconstruction, or \nwhatever other additional expenditures, will not so seriously undermine \nthe investments in our own country--education, health, and social \nsecurity--it could be one of the most damaging things to our own \nsecurity, ironically, that we could be considering.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator again yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask, through the Presiding Officer to the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, this question. It is true, is it not, in the first \ngulf war there were 200,000 troops supplied by other countries? It is \nalso true, is it not, that 90 percent of the cost of the war was borne \nby other countries? It is also true in this war that 90 percent of the \ncosts or more are being borne by the United States, 90 percent of the \ncasualties, 90 percent of the troops on the ground is the United \nStates.\n  There is a tremendous difference between the first gulf war and the \nsecond gulf war; is that true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Unfortunately, the Senator in his question makes a very \nimportant point. We talked about international involvement. I call it \nmore cosmetic than real. As he has noted, there has been minimal \ninvolvement in a broad coalition of countries that oftentimes are \nconsidered Third World, countries that economically, militarily, do not \nhave the weight and the breadth and depth of power and potential that \ncountries that are traditional allies of the United States have always \nhad.\n\n  For whatever reason, we cannot involve Europe, we have not involved \nRussia, we have not involved China, we have not involved India, we have \nnot involved countries in a meaningful, substantive, and consequential \nway. As a result, as the Senator has noted, the lion's share--over 90 \npercent of the responsibility financially, militarily, \norganizationally--has fallen upon the United States.\n  I talked to a young woman in Brookings, SD, on Saturday. She told me \nshe is leaving for Iraq within the month, that she was going to be gone \nanywhere from 8 to 13 months. She has a family, a job, and she is \nprepared to do that as a member of the National Guard. She has the \nright to be very proud of the extraordinary contribution our members of \nthe Guard have made, but they and we have a right to ask, Where is the \nhelp from others? Where are the Europeans? Where are the Chinese? Where \nare the Russians? Where are the Japanese? Why is it that we are asking \nthat young woman to provide 90 percent of the sacrifice?\n  Where is the sacrifice even in this country among some? Those at the \ntop, the top 1 percent, who will be getting an average of $283,000 in a \ntax break this year, where is the sacrifice? Should they not be \nrequired to help share the burden of paying for the war, if nothing \nelse?\n  Every single dollar we will be considering next week, every single \ndollar, will be borrowed. We were told yesterday in the New York Times \nthat every dollar we borrow costs $3.60 to pay back--not over 10 years \nbut over 6 years. So one could say that this is not an $87 billion cost \nto the Treasury; it is more like $300 billion because that is what it \nwill take to pay back over a 6-year period of time alone.\n  That is why I say it is very important we ask these questions; that \nthe President come forth with greater clarity and far more substance \nwith regard to his specific plans on how this money is going to be used \nand with far more transparency.\n  Some generals recently noted that we have no appreciation, no real \nunderstanding of where this money is going now. We spend $1 billion a \nweek and no one can tell us on what with any clarity. We know some goes \nto troops; we know some goes for reconstruction. We do not know how \nfast it is being spent down or where the money is going with regard to \npayment for other countries for their involvement, nor do we know what \nkind of profiteering is going on.\n  There was a report in the New York Daily News yesterday that \nHalliburton could generate more than $7 billion in one contract right \nnow--that is billion, with a B, $7 billion. Should there be more \ncompetitive bidding and transparency with regard to the contracts? Of \ncourse there should.\n  We will continue to persist with our questions. We will offer \namendments. We look forward to the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask to be recognized in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for his \nstatement. It raises some critical issues.\n  I listened as my colleagues on the Republican side came to the floor \nthis morning when they had the opportunity to talk about the situation \nin Iraq. The premise of many of their statements is undeniable, and \nthat is the fact we cannot walk away from Iraq. As expensive as it may \nbe, as dangerous as it may be, as many lives as it may claim, the fact \nis, once the decision was made to invade Iraq and topple the \ngovernment, we have a responsibility there. For us to leave now and let \nIraq descend into chaos to become a training ground for more terrorism \nin the region and against the United States is totally unacceptable.\n  The fact is, for good or for ill, we are in a situation where we are \nfaced with this responsibility. It is a substantial responsibility. As \nwe look to the reasoning that led us into Iraq, there have been a lot \nof revelations over the last 3 or 4 weeks. You may recall initially the \nadministration said: We believe that Iraq is in a position where it can \nbuild nuclear weapons that could threaten the world; these nuclear \nweapons could be used for terrorist purposes. In fact, the President of \nthe United States in the State of the Union Address spoke of this \nfissile material coming into Iraq from Niger, an African nation.\n  Further investigation leads us to conclude that perhaps we were \nwrong. The President has conceded his statement in the State of the \nUnion Address was wrong. There was no evidence of fissile material \ncoming from Africa into Iraq.\n  Frankly, today, 5 months after the end of military operations, there \nhas been no evidence uncovered to suggest there were nuclear weapons in \nIraq when the administration told us. That was one of the reasons we \nhad to go to war.\n\n[[Page S11883]]\n\n  Of course, the other reason that was raised--with some frequency--was \nweapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological weapons that could \nthreaten the region and the world. In fact, at one point in time \nsomeone in the administration said--I believe it was the President--\nthat within 45 minutes the Iraqis could launch an attack on the United \nStates with chemical and biological weapons.\n  Well, we know where we are today. Five months after the military \nhostilities have ended, those overt hostilities, we have found no \nevidence of weapons of mass destruction. None. Our troops went in, in \nfull gear, prepared to confront chemical and biological warfare, and it \nnever happened. The administration has said that is really irrelevant; \nthe important consideration is the fact that many years ago Iraq had \nchemical and biological capability.\n  I have to remind them, that is not what they told us before we \ninvaded Iraq: It was a real threat, an imminent danger, and one that \nhad to be preempted, that we had to move on, even before the Iraqis \nshowed any hostilities directly toward the United States.\n  Today we are emptyhanded. Today we can find no evidence of weapons of \nmass destruction. Perhaps something will be found.\n  I always qualify my remarks thinking, How could we have missed it? \nHow could we have said that we identified 550 sites of weapons of mass \ndestruction before the invasion of Iraq and today, after thousands of \ninspectors on behalf of the United States have combed through Iraq, \nafter the end of the military operations, we find nothing. I still \nthink we are going to find something, but as the days go on and weeks \ngo on and months go on and nothing turns up, it becomes more and more \napparent that the weapons of mass destruction threat in Iraq was \ngrossly exaggerated--exaggerated far beyond reality. And it was one of \nthe real bases for our invasion of Iraq.\n  The third one was a miscalculation by some people in the \nadministration to associate Saddam Hussein with 9/11 and to suggest \nthat Saddam Hussein and Iraq had something to do with it.\n  Well, there is no evidence of that. Despite the fact that loose \nrhetoric by members of the administration led some to conclude there \nwas a linkage, that somehow Saddam Hussein was supporting the al-Qaida \nterrorists who attacked the United States, despite that loose rhetoric, \nthere is no evidence of it.\n  Last week or the week before, the President came out and publicly \nsaid that. He said his Vice President was wrong on ``Meet the Press.'' \nThey could find no linkage between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein.\n  So those three elements that led us to invade Iraq have all virtually \ndisappeared.\n  The one that remains, the one that the Democratic leader alluded to, \nI do not quarrel with. Saddam Hussein was a terrible man, a terrible \nleader, and a terrible threat to the people in his region. The fact \nthat he is gone is good for Iraq and good for the world. That is a \npositive thing.\n  But all of the other justification that led to such a substantial \nvote for use of force in Iraq, all of that justification has evaporated \nright before us. That is the reality. It appears that the facts have \nchanged pretty dramatically from what the administration told us we \nwould find in Iraq.\n  But when I listen to my Republican colleagues on the floor, their \narguments about the invasion of Iraq have not changed.\n\n  This much we do know. Our military did an outstanding job. Let me \nadd, parenthetically, that during the course of the Presidential \ncampaign, then-Governor Bush, now President Bush, alluded to the fact \nthat our military was so weak and so hollow and so unprepared because \nof deficiencies of the Clinton administration that they did not do a \ngood job in the Department of Defense, they did not prepare our \nmilitary.\n  Well, look what happened when that Clinton-prepared, Clinton-\nequipped, Clinton-financed military went to war in Iraq. They did a \nspectacular job. The bravest, most skilled men and women in uniform in \nthe world, with the best technology, rolled over Iraq in 3 weeks--an \namazing military victory, a tribute to their skill and their planning.\n  Let me underline that word ``planning'' because you have to say that \nat the end of these open hostilities, May 1--the conquest of Baghdad \nand the military victory in Iraq--we have to say, from that point \nforward we have not seen the same skill and we have not seen the same \nplanning. Exactly the opposite has been the case.\n  It is apparent to us, as we listen every single day to reports, \ntragic reports about the loss of American life and more American \ncasualties, that little planning took place to anticipate what we would \nfind in Iraq.\n  Do you remember the scenarios painted by the Bush administration \nabout what would happen after Saddam Hussein was gone--how the Iraqis \nwould cheer us in the street with open arms, putting flowers into our \nrifle barrels, and all the rest?\n  Unfortunately, that celebration was short-lived. In a very brief \nperiod of time, the Iraqis, who were glad to see Hussein gone--and I am \nsure that is the overwhelming majority--also asked that we leave. When \nwe did not, more tension was created, and that tension has led to a \nloss of American lives. More lives have been lost in Iraq since the \nPresident declared the end of military operations than occurred during \nthe course of the invasion and war in Iraq. That is a sad reality.\n  It is clear the Bush administration did not have a plan to deal with \nIraq after the war was over. That is so obvious and so evident. \nFrankly, I think the President's speech of 9 days ago told that whole \nstory. The President came to the American people--and Presidents rarely \ndo this--on a Sunday evening and announced we needed $87 billion in an \nemergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq.\n  The American people were stunned, stunned by the size of that number. \nNow, when you break out that number, you see that some $67 billion is \ngoing to go for our troops. I think I can say without fear of \ncontradiction that there will not be a single Senator--Democrat or \nRepublican--voting against that. We are going to give our troops in the \nfield every dollar they need to be successful, to be safe, and to come \nhome. That money will be appropriated by this Senate with very little \ndebate. There will be some questions about how it will be spent, but I \nbelieve, when it is all said and done, the $67 billion will come racing \nthrough the Senate, as it should. We should never shortchange our sons \nand daughters and relatives and friends and family who are serving in \nthe military of the United States.\n  But it is the rest of the appropriation that has raised so many \nquestions and so much concern--$20 billion for the construction and \nreconstruction of Iraq. Five billion dollars goes for a police force. I \nam for that. The sooner we can get American soldiers out of the jobs of \ndirecting traffic, keeping order and law in place in marketplaces, \nguarding banks and guarding universities, the sooner we can get \nAmerican combat soldiers out of that role the better. Iraqi policemen \nshould do that job. But that is $5 billion.\n\n  The remainder is $15 billion for the construction and reconstruction \nof Iraq for a variety of things--the draining of the wetlands in Iraq, \nthe refurbishing and construction of 1,000 new schools in Iraq, the \nbuilding of new hospitals, railroads, telecommunications, electric \nsupply, water and sewer--a massive infrastructure investment.\n  Yesterday, the man who is responsible for that, Ambassador Paul \nBremer, came to speak to us just a few yards away from this Chamber. He \naddressed our senatorial luncheon on the Democratic side. I asked him a \nfew direct questions.\n  First, I asked him: We gave you some $79 billion for the troops and \nreconstruction just a few months back. How long will that money be \nthere for you to use? When will you run out of the $79 billion we have \nalready appropriated?\n  Ambassador Bremer said: December the 1st.\n  Now, that is an important date to remember because you are going to \nhear from the Republican side of the aisle that we need to pass this \nsupplemental emergency appropriations bill by the end of next week, at \nthe latest by the end of next week. Well, that would be by October 3.\n  By my calculation, that is 2 months away from when the money is \nactually\n\n[[Page S11884]]\n\nneeded. So if we take another week to ask some questions about how this \nmoney is being spent, it certainly is not going to be at the expense of \neither our troops or our efforts in the reconstruction of Iraq today. I \nthink we owe that to the American people.\n  I then asked Ambassador Bremer: What is the total cost for \nconstruction and reconstruction in Iraq?\n  He said: The World Bank estimate is $60 billion.\n  We are pledging, with the new $87 billion appropriation, $20 billion \nof the $60 billion, so that leaves some $40 billion that needs to be \nfound.\n  I said to him: Where will we find the additional $40 billion?\n  He said: From donors around the world.\n  I am very skeptical of that. I think the American people should be. \nThe President found yesterday that his visit to the United Nations did \nnot result in countries around the world standing in line queuing up to \nsend their troops and their treasure to help us in Iraq.\n  They have their own concerns and their own problems and their own \nfinancial priorities. In fact, we asked Ambassador Bremer, the total \namount pledged by the world to help us in Iraq for reconstruction to \nthis point does not even reach $2 billion, so we have a shortfall of \nsome $38 billion in the planned reconstruction of Iraq. I said to the \nAmbassador: I assume then that the $20 billion you are asking for now \nfrom the American people is just a downpayment. You are going to be \nback for more?\n  Oh, no, he said. This is it. This is all we are going to ask for, $20 \nbillion.\n  I doubt it. I am skeptical of that. What are we going to do if the \nother countries around the world don't put their money into the \nreconstruction of Iraq? Are we going to give up on that and walk away? \nI started this statement by saying that is unacceptable. We can't do \nthat. It is our responsibility. Once the President and this country \nmade a decision to invade, we had a special responsibility, as painful \nand expensive as it may be, to Iraq. That was the administration's \ndecision. That is where we find ourselves today.\n  This, incidentally, is the plan of the administration, ``The \nCoalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, Achieving the Vision to \nRestore Full Sovereignty to the Iraqi People, an Overview.'' I first \nsaw it yesterday. It is dated July 21--2 months ago. We asked \nAmbassador Bremer: Why is this plan for the future of Iraq just \nsurfacing now?\n  He said: I thought we had sent that out to every Senator and \nCongressman.\n  Well, none of my colleagues with whom I have talked saw it until just \nwithin the last day or two.\n  When you look through this plan, you start asking a lot of questions. \nLet me go to an early part of the plan, on page 7: ``Resources to \nRebuild Iraq.'' Let me quote from the plan:\n\n       It is difficult at this point to quantify the external \n     assistance needed to support Iraq's transition to \n     representative government in a market economy. Eastern \n     European experience suggests that a substantial international \n     commitment will be needed.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Only a coordinated international effort can bring \n     prosperity and stability to the Iraqi people and contribute \n     to a lasting peace in the Middle East.\n\n  I don't quarrel with that conclusion, but the facts today say this \nso-called plan by the Bush administration isn't going to work. If we \ncould only raise some $2 billion from around the world to deal with the \nreconstruction of Iraq out of a total cost of $60 billion, where is the \nsignificant commitment that is needed from countries around the world? \nIt isn't there. Once again, it is going to fall on the shoulders of \nAmerica's taxpayers. It is going to fall on the shoulders of American \nfamilies to deal with.\n  It couldn't come at a worse time, when we are dealing with America's \neconomy today. We have lost more jobs under this President than any \nPresident in the last 70 years. More jobs have been lost under \nPresident George W. Bush, 3 million more jobs lost, than under any \nPresident since Herbert Hoover in the Great Depression.\n  I feel it in my State, where we have lost about 20 percent, and one \nout of every five are manufacturing jobs that have gone overseas, to \nChina and other places. Other States around the Nation are experiencing \nthe same.\n\n  We are also dealing with a failed effort by the Bush administration \nto revive the economy and get it moving. They initiated all of these \ntax cuts which are pushing America beyond the brink of bankruptcy, tax \ncuts that are driving us into a deficit hole the likes of which we have \nnever seen in the history of the United States, tax cuts that go \nprimarily to the highest income individuals. What have they achieved? \nThey have created record deficits.\n  Think of this: When this President took office, he was dealing with a \nrecord surplus left over from the Clinton administration. Now, in just \n3 short years, he has taken that surplus and turned it into a record \ndeficit, aggravated by the cost of sustaining what is inevitable in \nIraq.\n  What does it mean when that deficit comes down to our own budget here \nat home? It means cutbacks in education and health care. If you \nfollowed the Senate debate 2 weeks ago about the appropriation for \neducation, you would have found us day after day, hour after hour, \nvoting down amendments--supported by Democrats, opposed by \nRepublicans--to put more money into education. We offered one amendment \nthat said we want to take the President's promise for No Child Left \nBehind and make it a reality. Senator Robert Byrd offered an amendment \nthat we would take the $6 billion shortfall in the President's promise \nto school districts around America and we were going to appropriate it. \nIt was voted down by the Republican side of the aisle. Why? They said \nwe couldn't afford $6 billion for American schools.\n  Think about that for a second: $20 billion for Iraq reconstruction. \nYes, the Bush administration says we must. But $6 billion as promised \nfor American schools? The answer was: No, we can't do it.\n  As a matter of fact, the $87 billion requested by the President for \nIraq is more than the total we will spend next year on education and \nhomeland security in the United States. Think about that for a second.\n  There is another element, too. We are financing the war in Iraq with \ndeficits. We are borrowing money to pay for that war. We are not \ncutting spending. We are not raising taxes. We are borrowing the money \nfrom the Social Security trust fund. We are endangering Social \nSecurity. We are limiting the reserves and resources of Social Security \nat a time when millions of baby boomers are just years away from \nshowing up for their Social Security checks. It is the height of \nirresponsibility.\n  The President's tax cuts have pushed us to this point of bankruptcy \nand deficits, the deepest deficits in the history of the United States, \nat the expense of health care, education, and the solvency of the \nSocial Security trust fund. All of those things are part of the Bush \npackage over the last 3 years. Yet this President came to us 9 days ago \nand said: We need to dig deeper; we need $87 billion more to pay for \nthe war in Iraq.\n  When you ask the American people what is a good way to pay for the \nwar in Iraq, they say: Why don't you eliminate or at least postpone \nsome of the tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America that the Bush \nadministration has pushed for?\n  That certainly seems reasonable to me. If someone happens to be \nmaking $1 million a year and are receiving $38,000 or more in tax cuts, \nis it too much to ask that person making $1 million a year to give up \nthat tax cut to deal with our deficit, to pay for our war in Iraq? I \ndon't think it is unreasonable. But, frankly, the administration says \nthat is totally unacceptable. They want even bigger tax cuts, more \npermanent tax cuts for people in higher income categories. It is the \nheight of irresponsibility.\n\n  The American people understand this. Our economy is weak. We have \nlost a record number of jobs. Our deficit is growing at a pace \nunrivaled in American history. We find health care and education being \ncut back, Social Security endangered, and the President wants $87 \nbillion for Iraq, a pricetag without a plan.\n  This is no plan. What we have been handed by the administration is, \nfrankly, a wish list of ideas that isn't backed up in reality. There is \nno explanation here of what we will do in Iraq if other countries \naround the world don't join\n\n[[Page S11885]]\n\nus, don't come to our side and our alliance in terms of the future of \nIraq. There is no plan whatsoever. Without that plan, there are a lot \nof questions that need to be asked here in the Senate.\n  I sincerely hope my Republican colleagues who fashion themselves as \nfiscal conservatives will come to understand what we are faced with. \nThey have voted for tax cuts which have bankrupted America. We now find \nourselves in a position where the bankruptcy hole is getting deeper and \ndeeper. We need to ask the hard questions. Some of them are painful.\n  We will never scrimp when it comes to paying for the support of our \ntroops, nor should we; we will give them all the money they need. But \nwhen it comes to rebuilding Iraq, we need to ask some hard questions.\n  One question that needs to be asked, front and center, is the \nquestion of profiteering in Iraq. It is unconscionable, it is \nunexplainable, it is indefensible that Halliburton, Vice President \nCheney's former corporation, stands to gain up to $7 billion in no-bid \ncontracts for Iraq where they, in fact, are the single bidder on \ncontracts. When we asked the Department of Defense, Why in the world \nare you giving Halliburton so much work to the exclusion of all the \nother companies in America, they said: We would like to tell you, but \nit is top-secret classified information.\n  Excuse me. I don't believe that. I think, frankly, having competitive \nbidding for work to be done in Iraq is only reasonable. It should be a \nsupreme embarrassment to this administration that the company that \ncontinues to pay the Vice President, a company which had a close, \npersonal, financial tie to him for so many years, is the company that \ncontinues to profiteer in Iraq.\n  There have to be other companies in America capable of doing this \nwork that should at least be allowed to bid on the contract. But that \nhas not taken place. Unless and until it does, I am afraid a lot of \npeople will be skeptical about this plan to rebuild Iraq.\n  There is one last point I wish to make. The President basically \nannounced on May 1 that military operations in Iraq were over. \nRecently, the American people were asked if they believe the war is \nover. By a margin of 89 to 10, the American people said, no, the war in \nIraq is not over. When you wake up every morning, turn on your radio or \ntelevision, and the lead story is another American soldier being \nkilled, you realize the war is not over. When you reflect on the \npricetag of $1 billion a week to sustain the military operation in \nIraq, you know the war is not over. When the President asks for $87 \nbillion in a deficit-ridden economy for a plan that doesn't exist to \nrebuild Iraq, you know, sadly, that the war is not over.\n  We can do better as a nation. We need to come together as a nation. \nWe need to plan to find a way to bring security to Iraq in a \nresponsible fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back the remainder of \nhis time in morning business?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11885-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11885-S11889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2765, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2765) making appropriations for the government \n     of the District of Columbia and other activities chargeable \n     in whole or in part against the revenues of said District for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1783.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as chairman of the District of Columbia \nSubcommittee, it is my pleasure to present to the Members of the Senate \nthis morning a bill that has been approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Let me first thank the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Mary Landrieu, my \ncolleague, for her excellent work on this bill. She has worked very \nhard with me. I thank her for her efforts in drafting this \nappropriations bill that is before us this morning.\n  This bill provides $545 million in Federal funds for the District of \nColumbia, and it also includes the city's own local budget of $5.7 \nbillion. The funds in this bill focus on a number of key priorities for \nthe District of Columbia. I wish to highlight four of those priorities.\n  First is improving the lives and opportunities for children in foster \ncare.\n  Second is enhancing educational opportunities for inner-city \nstudents.\n  Third is reducing and preventing crime in the District of Columbia.\n  Fourth is increasing the security in our Nation's Capital.\n  Mr. President, I wish to discuss the first priority at some length--\nimproving foster care in the District of Columbia. No one who is \nfamiliar with our Nation's Capital needs to be reminded about the sorry \nstate of the foster care system in the District of Columbia. No one who \nreads the Washington Post, no one who lives in the District of \nColumbia, no one who listens to the radio needs to be reminded of this. \nThe foster care system in the District of Columbia is a scandal; it is \na crime; it is a tragedy. The fact that it exists in our Nation's \nCapital makes it even worse. We have an obligation as Members of the \nSenate and this Congress to do something about it.\n  Senator Landrieu and I started well over a year ago to focus on the \nfoster care system. We decided to have a series of hearings, where we \nwould bring in experts from the District and from across the country to \nlook at the foster care system in the District of Columbia. Our goal \nwas to try to find out as much as we could about the foster care system \nin the District of Columbia, try to find out what was wrong with it, \nand try to find out what we could do as Members of the Senate, what the \nFederal Government could do to try to be of assistance.\n  This bill represents the first attempt by the Federal Government to \ndirectly impact this foster care system in a very meaningful way. What \nwe did was listen to the testimony, listen to the foster parents, \nlisten to the experts, and take their suggestions. What you will find \nin this bill are the ideas that came from these parents, from the \nexperts, from the people who see this system day after day. We have \nprovided some money, which we believe will help with these ideas and \nbegin to change this system. It is the right thing to do.\n  As Members know, over the years, the District of Columbia has had an \nabysmal record in protecting the lives and well-being of the children \nin the District's care. Children in foster care have died, been abused, \nor they have languished for years in foster care, often bouncing from \nfoster home to foster home without ever finding permanent placement \nwith a loving family.\n  The statistics are shocking. Children in foster care in the District \nspend an average of 5 years in foster care before they achieve a \npermanent placement. I will repeat that. The children in the District \nof Columbia spend an average of 5 years before they ever find a \npermanent home. Obviously, that means some children languish in foster \ncare much longer than 5 years. That is wrong, and we must do something \nabout it.\n\n  During our subcommittee hearings, we found that the District of \nColumbia is unable to track its children in foster care. They cannot \neven keep track of them. We have this very sophisticated--supposedly--\ncomputer system, yet inputs are not being made, the tracking is not \ntaking place, and complete data is not even available in the child and \nfamily services computer system for over 70 percent of children in \nfoster care today. How can we keep track of these poor kids and \ndetermine their well-being when much of their personal information is \nnot ever entered into this automated computer system? This simply must \nchange.\n  While putting together this bill, Senator Landrieu and I learned a \nlot. We\n\n[[Page S11886]]\n\nlearned that only about one-third of the children in foster care who \nneed mental health services are actually receiving the services. \nMoreover, many children who come into care wait for weeks and weeks, or \nmonths and months, before they even receive that first mental health \nassessment.\n  Let's understand that these are not just your average children. These \nare children who, many times, have been neglected, abandoned, \nphysically or sexually abused, or they have witnessed, many times, \nterrifying domestic violence. These are obviously children who need \nsome initial, at least, assessment in regard to their mental health \nproblems. For them to wait months before an assessment is just wrong. \nIt makes no sense. It is just asking for trouble.\n  Clearly, we all understand that these kids, after experiencing trauma \nand abuse and neglect, are in desperate need of mental health services. \nWe need to provide those services quickly to these children.\n  Furthermore, during our committee hearings on foster care, Senator \nLandrieu and I learned that there is a severe shortage of social \nworkers in the District. That should not have been a revelation to \nanybody. We know that from articles we have read in the newspapers. But \nit was brought home even more starkly in the hearings we held--the \nshortage of well-trained social workers in the District of \nColumbia. Many of these workers are carrying extremely high caseloads, \nmaking it very difficult for them to do their job. Also, many of these \ncaseworkers simply are not being provided the tools they need to get \ntheir jobs done.\n\n  We found there are several critical needs that, if addressed, could \ncertainly go a long way in improving the lives of thousands of children \nin the District's foster care system, and it would expedite their \nplacement in stable, loving homes. Therefore, this bill does contain \n$14 million in new money to address these needs.\n  Let me explain what these new programs and ideas are.\n  No. 1, we provide for intensive early intervention. This means when a \nchild comes into care, the case will be treated as an emergency \nsituation. Just as hospitals triage medical trauma, the District's \nchild and family service agency triage the emotional trauma facing \nchildren who are brought into their care. The earlier a child is \nstabilized, the better his or her chances of avoiding long-term damage. \nIf a child can remain with an appropriate or qualified family member, \nhe or she will face much less emotional trauma.\n  Some of the funds provided in this bill will allow the agency to \nstaff such an early intervention program and will establish a flexible \nfund for the purchase of beds, clothing, and other items to ensure that \na relative can bring a child into his or her home immediately without \nforcing the child to stay in a group home or foster home.\n  Second, early mental health evaluations and timely mental health \nservices for all children in foster care. What does this mean? The bill \nprovides $3 million for the District's Department of Mental Health to \nensure all children receive mental health assessments within 15 days of \ncoming into foster care; further, that all mental health assessment \nreports are provided to the court within 5 days of assessment and that \nall children receive mental health services immediately after the court \norders those services. This will help alleviate the current intolerable \nsituation.\n  According to the District of Columbia Family Court, in most child \nabuse and neglect cases where mental health services have been ordered, \nthere are long delays in providing these services to the child or to \nthe family. It can often take up to 6 to 8 weeks, or longer, to \ncomplete an evaluation and up to 60 days after the evaluation before \nthe mental health services are actually provided, even in very serious \nand dangerous situations. Under this bill, that would change.\n  The third provision of this bill will provide for the recruitment and \nretention of qualified social workers and will begin to deal with this \nproblem. How do we do this? The bill will provide $3 million in new \nmoney for the repayment of student loans to encourage social workers to \nenter or to stay in the field. It will allow this money to be provided \nas an incentive to pay back student loans if the young social workers \nagree to continue to stay and work. It will take that burden away from \nthat social worker.\n  One of the problems, of course, is a person wants to be a social \nworker, they want to do good, they want to stay in the field, but \nbecause of this low rate of pay and they have this big burden, this big \ndebt, they cannot stay in the field very long. They have to do \nsomething elsewhere where they can make more money to pay back the \ndebt.\n  This bill will help them ease that burden. It is no surprise that the \nhigher the caseload per social worker, the lower the quality of service \nto each of the children.\n\n  The District, like many cities, suffers from a high turnover of \nsocial workers. That is not good for the kids. In fact, the national \ncurrent turnover rate has doubled since 1991. Clearly, the relatively \nlow pay and difficult working conditions of social workers have \nresulted in a child welfare workforce crisis in the District. Without \ndoubt, steps must be taken to encourage more social workers to enter \nthe child welfare workforce and we must improve the salaries, we must \nimprove the working conditions and the training of workers, and we want \nto retain more of the qualified and experienced social workers. The \nreality is, the longer a social worker is there, the more experience \nthey get, and we want to retain the experienced social workers.\n  The fourth provision of this new program is recruitment and retention \nof foster parents. The bill provides $1.1 million to recruit and retain \nfoster parents. CFSA has experienced difficulties with recruiting and \nretaining an adequate number of appropriate foster care parents. One \nreason for this is lack of availability of respite care for foster \nparents. This is one of the items Senator Landrieu and I heard foster \nparents tell us--good people who were very much overburdened. One mom \nwho came in was taking care of many children. She said: If we just had \nthe opportunity for a few hours to have a break, this would be of great \nhelp.\n  Foster parents do not have the same opportunities for respite as \nbiological parents many times do. The funds in this bill would provide \nemergency respite, planned respite, and ongoing regularly scheduled \nrespite care. This is critical to provide foster parents the rest they \nneed to continue to stay on as foster parents.\n  The fifth provision is to improve computer tracking of all children \nin foster care. I talked earlier about the situation of the computer \nsystem and how bad it is. The bill provides $3 million to move the \nagency's current client-server system to a Web-based architecture and \nto provide laptop computers to all CFSA social workers.\n  The subcommittee heard testimony from the General Accounting Office \nthat CFSA's database lacks many active foster care cases and the system \nis often down. In addition, social workers do not have access to the \ndatabase via laptop computers when they are with children, foster \nfamilies, or while waiting in court. This would be a great opportunity \nto better utilize the precious time of social workers so they can use \nthat time sitting in court or, when they are out in the field, to put \nthe data directly, immediately into that computer. This is to better \nutilize the precious time social workers have.\n  Social workers now must return to the office late at night and enter \nthe data of children in care. With laptop computers and Web-based \naccess to information, social workers would then be able to enter key \ndata from off-site locations. We want social workers to use that \nprecious time hands on, dealing with kids, dealing with families. That \nis most important. Using technology better will enable them to spend \nmore time with these families. We want them to spend time on case plans \nand working with the families. This will enable them to do that.\n  I spoke at length about the foster care initiative in this bill \nbecause it is so very important. It breaks new ground. It does \nsomething about which Senator Landrieu and I feel very passionately. We \nfeel passionately about it because we learned so much about it in the \nhearings we held. This subject deserves this Congress's time. It \ndeserves our attention. It deserves our money.\n  As chairman of this subcommittee, I and the ranking member, Senator\n\n[[Page S11887]]\n\nLandrieu, have listened to far too many horror stories about children \ndying or being abused in the District's foster care system. As a \nFederal partner with this city, I believe it is imperative we provide \nfunds and seek ways to protect the lives of these very precious \nchildren. It is our duty and it is our moral responsibility to do so.\n  The second priority which this bill funds is enhancing educational \nopportunities for inner-city kids. This bill provides a total of $40 \nmillion new money--I emphasize ``new money''--for three interrelated \ncomponents: $13 million to promote excellence in traditional public \nschools in the District of Columbia; $13 million to expand choice \nthrough high-quality charter schools; and $13 million for opportunity \nscholarships for low-income students in failing schools to attend \nprivate schools; and $1 million for administrative fees. That is $40 \nmillion in new money for the District of Columbia's children to help \neducate them.\n\n  This is a balanced approach. It is balanced because, as I said, it is \n$13 million, $13 million, and $13 million. It is evenly divided. The \ncharter schools, $13 million; public schools, $13 million; and $13 \nmillion for the new scholarships.\n  Let us make no mistake about it. This is new money. It is not taking \nit from the public schools. It is not taking it anywhere else from \npublic education. This is money that Senator Gregg has worked long and \nhard to come up with, other Members have worked long and hard to come \nup with, to put together in a package that is balanced, that is \nreasonable, and that we will be talking about more on the Senate floor \nlater.\n  It is for the kids in the District of Columbia and it makes sense. \nThis is a plus-up in funding. This is new money. It is for the kids in \nthe District of Columbia.\n  Turning to the bill itself, I will read directly from the language of \nthe bill. We will be discussing this later. I think the bill says it \nvery well on page 21, when we talk about these scholarships. It \nprovides students and their families with the widest range of \neducational options, because that is really what we are talking about: \npublic schools, charter schools, and, with this additional $13 million \nto scholarships, options for the parents, options for the students.\n  I am pleased to report that this three-sector approach to improving \nDC schools is wholeheartedly supported by Mayor Anthony Williams. He \nhas been out front in leading the charge for this plan. He was on \nCapitol Hill yesterday very eloquently describing why this is needed \nfor the District of Columbia.\n  The plan for the District has wide support, but the most important \nsupporters for this program are the thousands of low-income parents of \nschoolchildren in this city whose children are languishing in failing \nschools. Under this bill, the priority for children to be able to get \nthese scholarships is children who are in what are described as the \nfailing schools. These parents want an opportunity to try a new \napproach. I believe they deserve that opportunity. Their hope is for a \nbrighter future for their children.\n  The third priority funded by this bill is reducing and preventing \ncrime in the District of Columbia. The Federal Government entirely \nfunds the DC courts and the Court Services and Supervision Agency. This \nbill provides a total of $377 million for these agencies, which is $18 \nmillion more than the President's budget request. Most of these \nadditional resources are to integrate the 18 different computer systems \nthat track offender and litigation information.\n  In addition, the bill provides additional resources to allow the \nCourt Services and Supervision Agency to enhance its supervision of \nhigh-risk sex offenders, as well as offenders with mental health \nproblems and offenders with a history of domestic violence. I submit \nthat these are the most dangerous offenders. These are offenders who \nare the most likely to cause harm and damage to the citizens of the \nDistrict of Columbia, and to the tourists and visitors who come here \nevery single day.\n\n  Senator Landrieu and I held a hearing. We heard from the people in \nthe Government of the District of Columbia and the Federal officials \nwho are charged by law with supervising these individuals who are out \non parole and probation. What they told us was these are the most high-\nrisk offenders. They are out on the streets. Right or wrong, they are \nout on the streets. They told us these are the most dangerous \nindividuals.\n  I must say from my experience years ago as a county prosecutor that \nthere is no doubt these are the most dangerous offenders. What we \nlearned is that the ratio of the supervisors to these offenders today \nis only 42 to 1, many times. In other words, 42 offenders to 1 \nsupervisor. What our bill would do is to take that ratio down to 25 to \n1. It is the right thing to do, and we are going to do it with this \nbill. We are targeting those dangerous offenders. This is a boost to \nsafety in the District of Columbia.\n  Additional resources also will expand the Agency's use of GPS-based \nelectronic monitoring equipment to ensure that offenders are not near \nlocations such as schools or specific residences.\n  The fourth priority in this bill is increasing security in the \nNation's Capital. Since September 11, we all understand the importance \nof security in the District of Columbia. Therefore, the bill includes \nsecurity funding, including resources to complete a Unified \nCommunications Center which will be the center for coordinated \nmultiagency responses in the event of regional and national \nemergencies.\n  Funds also are included to continue to prepare the District's largest \nhospital, Washington Hospital Center, and its only dedicated children's \nhospital, Children's National Medical Center, for bioterrorist and \nchemical attacks. We began this process last year and further funding \nis in this year's budget.\n  The bill also continues to provide funds to reimburse the District \nfor increased police, fire, and emergency personnel costs associated \nwith the presence of the Federal Government.\n  Let me again thank Senator Landrieu, who is the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee. It is always a pleasure to work with her. She has done a \ngreat job on this bill. She and I share the same concerns for the \nchildren and the residents who live in our Nation's Capital. We have \nworked very closely together on this bill. I believe we have put \ntogether a bill that is within budget. It is a bill that focuses on \nimproving the well-being of the District's children and protecting the \nsafety of all those who live and work here.\n  So I thank Senator Landrieu, I thank the Chair, and I will at this \npoint yield to Senator Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the chairman for the \nbreadth and depth of those excellent opening remarks, which demonstrate \nbeyond any doubt his commitment to the budget before us and to the \nplans that it supports.\n  I also acknowledge our strong working relationship and commend him \nfor his leadership on so many important issues for the District and \nalso for the Nation at large. He has gone into great detail about the \nchild welfare issues, which is one of the issues that he has led on not \njust in the District but in his home State and around the Nation.\n  We have been working together now for almost 3 years, sharing the \nchairmanship, depending on the majority of this Senate. It has been a \njoy to work with someone who shares so many of the same goals and \nobjectives.\n  As Senator DeWine has outlined, our bill is small in size but it \noften carries a powerful punch, because it is a bill that supports a \ncity but also a symbol. It is a city of 500,000 residents but it is a \nsymbol in many ways of this great Nation and home to the Federal \nGovernment. Because of that, oftentimes on this bill--and we will \nexperience that over the next couple of days--there will be some \nrigorous debates about issues surrounding this bill, which is \nunderstandable because this is a budget for a city but also a symbol.\n  I hope, as we move through the debate on this bill, that we can \nprovide more light than heat, and I hope colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle will come to the floor with that in mind.\n  I want to begin my brief opening remarks saying that Senator DeWine \nand I in many instances share not only the same views about the \nDistrict, but we also share the same priorities, which makes for a \ngreat working relationship and very smooth operations. One of the \nsubjects he and I feel very strongly about is committing to the \nfinancial stability of the city. We both recognize\n\n[[Page S11888]]\n\nthe great work the Mayor, the City Council, and Congresswoman Eleanor \nHolmes Norton have contributed, as have other officials who have the \nhands-on responsibility for the financial support and operations of the \ncity. I commend them for their work.\n  This is particularly important because this city in just recent \nhistory was under the direction of a Control Board, established by this \nCongress because the city was in a huge deficit position. Mismanagement \nwas rampant and that became necessary. Senator DeWine and I served at \nthe time when that Control Board has been moving out, so it has been an \nimperative, and our first priority, that the safeguards and guidelines \nand parameters that keep this city moving in the direction of surplus \nand strength continue. I am proud to say that we have accomplished that \ngoal in partnership with the city leaders, who get the most credit for \nkeeping their city in a strong financial position. That is so, even \nwith the very difficult times the city has faced, in terms of being a \ntarget, in some cases the No. 1 target, of terrorism in the whole \nNation.\n  Along those lines, one of my priorities, shared with the leadership \nas well as the other Members--Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Senator \nDick Durbin from Illinois--we have put into this bill a $25 million \ninfrastructure investment because we want to be a strong, reliable \npartner for the financial security of the city. That is on top of the \n$50 million that was put in last year, which helps one of the major \ninfrastructure challenges of the city, which is to clean up the \nAnacostia River. We have to remember this region is a region of two \nrivers, not one. We hear a lot about the Potomac but not a lot about \nthe Anacostia. Both are great and contribute a lot to the health and \nvitality of the region, and the cleaner these are, for esthetics, for \nhealth and recreation, is important.\n  The city cannot do this on its own. It is a regional effort, and we \nare proud to step up, in the place of a State because there is no \nState, to serve in that role on the budget, to help them with these \ngreat infrastructure needs. I am thankful for the allocation of funds \nfor that effort to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the \nranking member, Senator Byrd, who has been strongly in favor of this \nparticular undertaking, which will cost hundreds of millions of \ndollars, to be done over the course of the next couple of years.\n  The next issue on infrastructure, briefly, is one on which we are \nmaking some progress. We have budget constraints and we do not have, as \nmuch as we would like, unlimited money. We have budget constraints \nbecause there is not much money, but wisely the chairman has allocated \nfunds to infrastructure initiatives--parks, recreation, and some help \nwith transportation. Again, transportation is not just a challenge for \nthe District residents, but it is a real challenge for the region. We \nhave at least begun to lay down a small mark for help with \ntransportation. I will get back to why that is so important at the end \nof these brief remarks.\n\n  Helping with the financial strength of the city, continuing to \nimprove it, making sure the CFO is supported and his office is \nindependent, streamline the management, and helping keep the city on a \nstrong financial course is something I am proud of and is reflected in \nthis bill.\n  The second important focus--and these are not in terms of priorities \nbecause they are all sort of equal, but I wanted to reflect, maybe, \nperhaps this is one we would agree is the top priority--is security for \nthe Nation's Capital. Again, our bill reflects an ongoing commitment \nfor investments in bioterrorism and investments, last year \nparticularly, in the bill for interoperability for police officers in \nthe District and the Federal agencies, as the District remains the No. \n1 target in the Nation. That commitment is also found in this bill. It \nis an ongoing commitment I share with the chairman.\n  Senator DeWine did a beautiful and thorough job describing the child \nwelfare initiatives in this bill. I will not repeat what he said. I \nwill only say thank you to the Washington Post, particularly, for \ncontinuing to bring to light the deficiencies in the child welfare \nsystem, to thank my own staff and all the Members who contribute, and \nto say the District of Columbia is not alone in its struggle with \nreforming its child welfare system and improving foster care and \nincreasing adoptions and establishing a family court. All cities, all \ncommunities, and all States are struggling with those same challenges.\n  Because budgets are tight, when budgets are cut, the first things, of \ncourse, that are cut, in many instances, are the services for children \nand courts and judicial systems that help to support excellent child \nwelfare services in the Nation.\n  We are trying to fight against those budget reductions, adding money \nto this bill, with accountability, with mandates for new management, \nand with a new system to try to increase reunifications where possible, \nso children are not separated endlessly from their families and to give \nthose families support. If that is not possible--and in many instances, \nas the chairman knows, it is not possible--then to move those children \nquickly through a caring and loving system that enables those children \nto get safely into a new family who will raise and nurture and love \nthem, and to minimize the time in foster care.\n  That is not done by waving a magic wand or by rhetoric or by bumper \nstickers or by slogans. There is no substitute for that kind of work \nother than just tough slogging in terms of new policies and new \ninvestments. No one has done that better than this chairman. I thank \nhim for that. This bill reflects a significant increase, in partnership \nwith the District, working with them, to create a new court system, to \ncreate new opportunities in the child welfare system.\n  The fourth area the chairman and I focused a lot of time on, and I \nthink we are making some progress, although it will be the subject of \nmuch of the debate on this bill, is in the area of education. I want to \nsay what is in the underlying bill is a significant improvement over \nthe shortsighted and very problematic education initiative that was \nplaced in the House bill on the District of Columbia. What the chairman \nhas laid down is a significant improvement over that shortsighted and \nproblematic initiative which was basically a vouchers-only, take-it-or-\nleave-it approach by the House, which is going to be rejected pretty \nunanimously here in the Senate.\n  In its stead, there is a three-sector improvement approach offered by \nthis bill which, in my opinion, still needs some significant work. But, \nas I said, it is a major improvement over the take-it-or-leave-it, \nvouchers-or-nothing approach by the House. The three-sector approach, \nas the chairman has outlined, is an equal amount of money distributed \nto charter schools, to public schools, and then to private scholarships \nfor low-income children who are struggling.\n  Let me talk about charter schools for a minute and say something on \nthe record. I will get back to this at a later time, when the debate \ngets underway.\n  There is not a district in this country, not one, not in Ohio, not in \nLouisiana, not California, not New York, that has made a stronger and \nbetter effort for charter schools than the District of Columbia, and \nthat needs to go on the record as this debate starts.\n  There are more children per capita in charter schools in this \nDistrict than any place in the Nation. With limited resources and with \na relatively small jurisdiction, this community is making a superior \neffort in charter schools. Every one of them is excellent. We know they \nare trying new things that are important. They don't get enough credit \nfor that. I want the Mayor and Eleanor Holmes Norton, who has been a \nstrong supporter of charter schools and public choice, and Mr. Chavez, \nmembers of the DC Council, and members of the school board who have \nsupported this charter school initiative to feel proud of what they \nhave done. They do not get as much credit as they should. Those charter \nschools provide a real choice and real opportunities.\n  I am proud that in the bill last year Senator DeWine and I helped \nfund, at the request of many of our colleagues, the first urban \nboarding school for low-income children in the Nation--the first low-\nincome boarding school for children in the Nation--so they can stay in \nschool Monday through Friday and have an opportunity to go home on \nweekends, if they choose. Sometimes their home life is not conducive to \nacademic excellence and achievement.\n\n[[Page S11889]]\n\nWith accountability and oversight, we created that school. I am proud \nto say those children are extremely happy. And some of them were able \nto go to Greece because of the generosity of the Greek Ambassador. \nNothing could thrill me more than to see real progress being made in \nopening up new educational opportunities for children.\n  The charter school movement is healthy and underway, and it doesn't \nneed our criticism and it doesn't need our undermining; it needs our \nsupport.\n  The other leg of that is the investment in public schools. The \nprogress is slower but it is still substantial, as is true of all major \ncities struggling with this issue throughout the country. But any \nnumber of improvements have been made. Later on in the debate, that \ninformation will be spread on the Record. But those two legs of the \ninvestment are universally supported.\n  There are additional investments. Leave No Child Behind does not meet \nthe full requirements to which the District is entitled, but at least \nit is a $13 million increase to help the public school system meet the \nnew accountability requirements and excellence that we seek in all of \nour schools when we are using public funds, and to help support charter \nschools.\n  The piece on the scholarship program sector, as I said, needs \nimprovement. But because it is a three-sector approach and not just \nvouchers and take it or leave it, it is far superior to the House \nprovision. With some adjustment, it could potentially receive votes of \nsome Members on the Democratic side and have universal support on the \nRepublican side. We will get to that later in the day.\n  Let me say in closing that the last 2 years have been unprecedented \nin the amount of discretionary Federal dollars that have gone to this \ncity. Just this year alone, this budget reflects $124 million over the \nPresident's request for the District of Columbia. That is a substantial \namount. That reflects the confidence that is being built in this \nCongress in the leadership of this city and the willingness to step out \non issues that can help this city be the great city it was intended to \nbe, and it is well on its way to being--across the board, whether it is \nin health care, transportation, public services, education, et cetera.\n  Nobody deserves more credit as a group than the city leadership \ncollectively. They have done a very good job working together in that \nregard.\n  I close, however, with a challenge that Senator DeWine and I are \nfaced with this year; that is, the landmark report that this city faces \na structural deficit of $400 billion to $401 billion between their \nrevenue capacity and their cost of providing services. This report was \ndone by an objective agency. It was conducted by the GAO at the request \nof Congresswoman Norton and myself and others to really look at the \nstructural deficit, if there were such a thing as a structural deficit, \neven though the city is in surplus, even though they are moving in the \nright direction by streamlining their operations. If you look at the \npath for the next year or two, there are dark clouds on the horizon. We \nwant to basically know what the reason is for those dark clouds. Is it \nsomething that is under the control of the city or the Congress to fix?\n  I will paraphrase the study and will submit it for the Record.\n  While the city could continue to adjust and streamline its practices \nand make sure that fraud and abuse are taken out of the system, there \nis in fact a structural imbalance. Even if they did that perfectly--and \nno city does--they still would have a structural imbalance because \ntheir tax base is strained to almost a breaking point. That means their \nsales taxes are high, their property taxes are high, their fees are \nhigh. To continue to go back to the residents of the District and ask \nthem to contribute more would be detrimental to the economic growth and \nvitality of this city.\n  We have in this bill a marker--basically a $3 million Federal share \nto contribute to the infrastructure, which is a small but I think \nsubstantial marker that the chairman and I are willing to lay down to \nsay we understand there is a structural deficit, that we don't have the \nmoney right now to fix it, and that we are not even sure how to fix it \nnor have the answer but recognize there is one. Hopefully, that will be \nthe subject of future hearings to help the city of Washington be the \nbest city and the symbol for the Nation.\n  Finally, let me summarize. As the chairman said, this bill also \nincludes $172 million for the operation of the DC courts, an $8 million \nincrease over the President's request. We talked about that. There are \ncertain things for which we are directly responsible. One of them is \nthe Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency. I am very proud \nthat the chairman has gotten that ratio down from 40 to 1 to 25 to 1, \nwhich will help. I again commend the Washington Post for their \nexcellent series that helped to call our attention to this glaring and \nterrible problem. It is a tragedy that exists in the District. More \nwork needs to be done.\n  But this bill and what it represents I think is a significant \ncompliment to the city and its leadership. The considerable investment \nin the future for the residents of the District is something of which \nour people around the Nation can be proud.\n  I urge our colleagues as we move into the afternoon and the debate \nregarding education that we attempt to fill this Chamber with light and \nheat because this issue, the children who depend on our deliberations, \ntheir families, and the taxpayers deserve no less.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Mr. President, as we proceed with the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill, I again thank Senator Landrieu for her \ngreat work on this bill. We will be proceeding later on today on the \nissue of the District of Columbia vouchers. I thank Senator Landrieu \nfor her contribution to this discussion.\n  We are working on some possible amendments, but I wish to take this \nmoment, if I can, to also thank Senator Feinstein for her contribution \nto that section of the bill. As I have stated publicly in the past--I \nsaid it yesterday in a press conference--that section of the bill which \nhas to do with vouchers, the scholarship section was significantly \nimproved because of what my colleague from California, Senator \nFeinstein, contributed to the bill.\n  She came to me and Senator Gregg and said: I have some suggestions; I \nhave some changes; I have some ideas that I think need to be in this \nbill to improve the bill, to bring more accountability; to ensure the \nbill's constitutionality; and also to make sure that the Mayor of the \ncity of Washington is much more directly involved in running this \nscholarship program.\n  We took those suggestions from Senator Feinstein. She drafted \nsections of the bill, and we incorporated them in the bill. Those \nchanges are now in the bill that is now before the Senate. I appreciate \nvery much her work.\n  I yield, without losing my right to the floor, for a question from \nSenator Landrieu.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments. He \nis correct that there have been some improvements made to this section \nof the bill, but it remains a work still in progress. There are many \nMembers on the Democratic side and some Members on the Republican side \nwho are still not comfortable with the language. There are some who are \nabsolutely opposed to the underlying concept of private school vouchers \nor scholarships.\n  I thank the chairman for remaining open and working on some \namendments and language. That is taking\n\n[[Page S11890]]\n\nplace at this time. We will proceed with the debate later in the \nafternoon.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I take back my time. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Landrieu to try to accommodate the concerns she \nhas. I know she is well intentioned, certainly dedicated to the \nchildren of the District of Columbia, as I talked about earlier today.\n  I believe the bill before us is a good bill. I believe the \nscholarship program before us is a good scholarship program. I believe \nit is clearly constitutional. I believe it is a good program in the \nsense, as I discussed earlier this morning, that it is value-added. It \nis a balanced program. It is a program that provides a third of the \nmoney for scholarships for the children, $13 million. This is all new \nmoney, $13 million new money for the District of Columbia schools, and \n$13 million additional money for charter schools. It is a three-pronged \napproach, a very balanced program. I think the language is good \nlanguage. The bill before us is a good bill.\n  In deference to my colleague, with whom I have worked so very closely \non this bill over the last few years, certainly we can take some more \ntime to see if it is possible to reach any kind of compromise or \naccommodation with regard to any additional language that would satisfy \nher. I am more than happy to take some time to try to do that. I do \nbelieve we have a good bill right now. It is a bill that I think is \ngood for the children of the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the limited \nprivate school choice provisions in the District of Columbia \nAppropriations bill.\n  As you know, private school choice, also commonly known as a voucher, \nrefers to the use of public money to allow a limited number of students \nto attend a K-12 private school.\n  As a strong supporter of our Nation's public schools, I certainly \nappreciate the views of those who believe that public money should be \nused to improve only public schools.\n  However, as a member of the Senate's Education Committee, I also \nstrongly believe that if our educational system is to improve, as \nneeded, we cannot remain stuck in the status-quo. We must look for \ninnovative ways to improve our schools. While providing additional \nmoney into an educational system can help--money alone is never enough.\n  I commend the Mayor of Washington, DC--Mayor Anthony Williams--who \nalong with others have all come together in support of an innovative \nidea to improve the educational system in the District of Columbia: an \ninfusion of money into the public school system along with a limited \nprivate school choice option for the District of Columbia.\n  How fortunate we are to have the leadership of Mayor Williams in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  The legislation before us does just what Mayor Williams has \nrequested. It adds an additional $40 million in education spending in \nthe District. $27 million of that $40 million will go to the District's \npublic schools and charter schools. The remaining $13 million will be \nused for the limited private school choice option provided in this \nbill.\n  And while some may be critical of spending $13 million on private \nschool choice, I believe it is important to view this money in the \ncontext of other education spending.\n  In comparison to the $13 million we will spend in this bill on \nprivate school choice, the Federal Government currently spends about \n$12.5 billion on the Pell Grant program. And as we all know, the Pell \nGrant Program provides grants to students to help them afford the cost \nof tuition at an institution of higher learning, regardless of whether \nthe institution is a public or private one.\n  Similarly, the proposal before us today will allow certain low-income \nstudents in the District to attend private K-12 school.\n  More specifically, the school choice provisions in this legislation \nwill provide scholarships of up to $7,500 to allow 2,000 low-income \nstudents the opportunity to attend private school.\n  These scholarships will be sufficient in dollar amount to cover the \ncost of tuition at approximately two-thirds of the private schools in \nthe District. It is my hope that the remaining one-third of private \nschools in the District, whose tuition is more expensive than $7,500 a \nyear, will consider making special exceptions to also open their doors \nto the low-income students in the District who are scholarship \nrecipients.\n  In my view, the proposal supported by Mayor Williams and put forth in \nthis legislation is a win-win situation. The school system gets more \nmoney and low-income students are given a unique educational \nopportunity.\n  Over 50 years ago, I was given a similarly unique opportunity to \nobtain a quality education as I was a recipient of the GI bill. The \neducation that I was fortunate enough to receive as a result of the GI \nbill has allowed me to achieve most of the dreams to which I have \naspired. Without the GI bill, I certainly would not be standing here \ntoday.\n  Similarly, the private school choice proposal before the Senate today \nwill provide certain students in the District with an opportunity to \nreceive a strong education. And, along with that education, these \nscholarships will provide these students the same opportunity I had to \nachieve my goals in life.\n  I commend the work and leadership of the chairman, Senator DeWine, my \ncolleague in the Virginia congressional delegation, Tom Davis, Mayor \nAnthony Williams, the local media, and other philanthropists and \ncommunity leaders who have worked closely together in support of this \nprivate school choice initiative.\n  It is my intention to support this limited private school choice \ninitiative, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor because I have \njust learned of a decision made by an Oklahoma district judge that the \nNational Do-Not-Call registry is invalid. This is amazing to me.\n  This is the result, apparently, of a lawsuit filed by the Direct \nMarketing Association, U.S. Security, Chartered Benefit Services, \nGlobal Contact Services, and in InfoCision Management Corporation \nchallenging the Federal Trade Commission's authority to implement the \nwishes of millions of\n\n[[Page S11891]]\n\nAmericans who have gone on the Federal Trade Commission's web site and \nsigned up to say to telemarketers they don't want to be called.\n  I would like to read into the Record a statement of FTC Chairman \nTimothy Muris. He said:\n\n       Late last year, the Federal Commission issued rules \n     creating the National Do Not Call Registry under the \n     Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act. On \n     February 13, 2003 the Congress passed the Do Not Call \n     Implementation Act, which authorized the FTC to collect fees \n     from sellers and telmarketers to ``implement and enforce the \n     provisions relating to the `do-not-call' registry.'' The \n     President signed this bill on March 11, 2003. Moreover, on \n     February 20, 2003, the President signed the Omnibus \n     Appropriations Act, which authorizes the FTC to ``implement \n     and enforce the do-not-call provisions of the Telemarketing \n     Sales Rule.''\n       Despite this clear legislative direction, the U.S. District \n     Court for the Western District of Oklahoma has ruled that the \n     FTC exceeded its authority in creating the National Do Not \n     Call Registry.\n       This decision is clearly incorrect. We will seek every \n     recourse to give American consumers a choice to stop unwanted \n     telemarketing calls.\n\n  This registry is due to go into effect in a week. A Federal judge has \nessentially prevented it from going into effect. In a week, tens of \nmillions of Americans who have registered their names not to be called \nby telemarketers are going to find out that it is all a myth. They are \ngoing to get called in any event. I think they are going to be very \nangry.\n  I also believe this decision strikes a blow against the basic privacy \ninterests of millions of Americans. Presently, these people are \nsubjected to unwanted marketing calls to their homes at all times of \nthe day, including the dinner hour. The FTC's Registry will give \nAmericans who want to avoid these unsolicited sales pitches an option \nto stop their telephone from ringing.\n  As I mentioned, tens of millions of Americans have registered more \nthan 50 million phone numbers for this program. Ultimately, the Federal \nTrade Commission expects 60 percent of the Nation's households with \napproximately 60 million home phone lines to sign on to the registry. \nThis registry is crucial because it puts consumers in charge of the \nnumber of telemarketing calls they receive. Telemarketers who disregard \nthe Registry could be fined up to $11,000 per call.\n  The district court today ruled that the Do Not Call Registry is \n``invalid''--that is the word the judge used in his decision--because \nit was created without congressional authority.\n  This conclusion I find surprising since Congress passed H.R. 395, the \nDo-Not-Call Implementation Act on February 13th of this year. The \nlegislation clearly authorizes the Federal Trade Commission and the \nFederal Communications Commission to collect fees sufficient to \nimplement the Registry. And the Appropriations Committee granted $18 \nmillion for the program.\n  I also note that the FTC's rule came after the most extensive \ndeliberations. The FTC announced its plan to proceed with the Registry \non December 18, 2002, after receiving 64,000 comments. The overwhelming \nmajority of these comments favored the creation of the Registry. \nMillions of Americans were promised protection from annoying, unwanted \ntelemarketing calls starting October 1. They are truly going to be \noutraged by this.\n  There are two ways of going about this. The first is to let the FTC \nappeal the case, which they have just said they are going to be in the \nprocess of doing. The other is to perhaps unanimously adopt and pass \nlegislation which clearly authorizes, specifically authorizes--and in \nbold letters authorizes so that no Federal judge can misunderstand it--\nand get this done as quickly as we can. I have asked my Judiciary \ncounsel to prepare this legislation. We will be submitting it before \nthe end of the day.\n  I would like to invite all of my colleagues to join as cosponsors. \nThen, hopefully, we will be able to move this through very quickly, \nparticularly in view of the fact that we believed we did authorize it \nearlier, the President did sign it earlier this year, and we believed \nit was a concluded issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the judgment of \nthe Western District Court of Oklahoma which finds that the portion of \nthe final amended rule that pertains to the National Do Not Call \nRegistry is invalid.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    In The United States District Court for the Western District of \n                                Oklahoma\n\n\n   u.s. security, et al., Plaintiffs, vs. federal trade commission, \n                               defendant\n\n                       no. civ-03-122-w--judgment\n\n       Pursuant to the Order filed this date, the Court finds that \n     judgment should be and is hereby entered as a matter of law \n     in favor of the plaintiffs, U.S. Security, Chartered Benefit \n     Services, Inc., Global Contact Services, Inc., InfoCision \n     Management Corporation and Direct Marketing Association, \n     Incorporated, on the plaintiffs' claims that that portion of \n     the Final Amended Rule that pertains to the national do-not-\n     call registry is invalid.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 2555.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we have \nbeen in touch with Senator Byrd, who is comanager of this bill, and he \nhas no objection to proceeding to this conference report. He simply \nwants to be able to be heard prior to our scheduling a vote on adoption \nof the conference report.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The report will be stated by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2555), making appropriations for the Department of Homeland \n     Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and \n     for other purposes, having met, have agreed that the House \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate \n     and agree to the same, with an amendment, and the Senate \n     agree to the same, signed by a majority of the conferees on \n     the part of both Houses.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 23, 2003.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, it is my honor and pleasure to present \nfor the Senate's approval today the conference report on H.R. 2555, the \nfiscal year 2004 Homeland Security Appropriations Act. As all Senators \nknow, this is an historic occasion. Not only is this the first \nappropriations bill for the new Department of Homeland Security, but it \nis also the first of the 13 fiscal year 2004 appropriations bill \nconference reports to be presented to the Senate.\n  The conference agreement provides total new budget authority for the \nnew Department of $34.9 billion, including $4.7 billion in advance \nappropriations for future fiscal years. Of the amount provided for \nfiscal year 2004, $29.4 billion is for discretionary programs. This is \napproximately $1 billion more than the level requested by the \nPresident. It is also $890 million more than the Senate-passed bill \nlevel, due to inclusion in the conference report of $890 million in \nfiscal year 2004 funding for biodefense countermeasures, so-called \nBioShield, as recommended in the House bill and the President's \nrecently submitted revised budget request.\n  To further strengthen the capacity of the Nation's first responders \nto prepare for and respond to possible terrorist\n\n[[Page S11892]]\n\nthreats and other emergencies, this conference report provides a total \nof $4.037 billion for the Office of Domestic Preparedness. This \nincludes $1.7 billion for the State and local formula-based grant \nprograms; $500 million for law enforcement terrorism prevention grants; \n$725 million for high-threat, high-density urban area grants; and $750 \nmillion for the firefighter assistance grant program which will remain \na stand-alone program.\n\n  The conference report also includes $180 million for emergency \nmanagement performance grants which will be managed by the Emergency \nPreparedness and Response Directorate.\n  The conference report includes a total of $4.5 billion for the \nTransportation Security Administration. Air cargo security was a \npriority of the conference committee, as evidenced by the fact that the \nconference report provides $85 million for air cargo security, which is \n$55 million higher than the President's request. This funding will \nallow the Department to enhance its efforts to identify and prohibit \nthe transportation of high-risk cargo on passenger aircraft as well as \nto advance efforts to research, develop, and procure the most effective \nand efficient air cargo inspection and screening systems.\n  Additionally, $8.6 billion is provided for the defense of our \nborders; $9.1 billion for emergency preparedness and response; $6.8 \nbillion for the Coast Guard; and $1.5 billion for research, analysis, \nand infrastructure protection.\n  The conference committee met and completed action on Wednesday of \nlast week, and the conference report was filed yesterday, September 23. \nIt was adopted by the House of Representatives earlier this afternoon \nby a vote of 417 yeas to 8 nays. Senate passage of this conference \nreport today is the final step necessary to send this fiscal year 2004 \nappropriations bill to the President for his signature into law before \nOctober 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year.\n  I must acknowledge the assistance and important work by the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd; also the chairman of the House committee, Mr. \nRogers, and the ranking member of the House subcommittee, Mr. Sabo, for \ntheir substantial contributions to the development and writing of this \nbill throughout the year.\n  We began the year with extensive hearings, reviewing the proposals \nfor the budget of all of the directorates and the individual agencies \nthat are funded in this bill, which includes the Secret Service, the \nCoast Guard and others. A lot of time has been devoted to understanding \nthe missions and responsibilities of the 22 Federal agencies that were \nbrought under the jurisdiction of the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  We have also worked closely and consulted with the distinguished \nSecretary of the Department, Tom Ridge. In my judgment, Secretary Ridge \nis doing an excellent job of starting up this new Department, \nunderstanding the importance of the mission, and helping our country \nprepare for and prevent terrorist attacks, and prepare for and respond \nto natural disasters.\n  The chairmen and ranking members of the full committees have also \nbeen very helpful in the development of this legislation. We want to \nexpress our appreciation for their good work and their important \nassistance.\n  It is with pleasure and honor that I recommend to the Senate the \nadoption of this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I understand other Senators, including \nSenator Byrd, may be speaking on this and will be here in a few \nminutes. I thought I would take the opportunity to make some comments \non a specific provision in this conference report.\n  First, I am pleased that the Senate is considering this very \nimportant appropriations conference report for the new Department of \nHomeland Security, and I am pleased that the chairman of this \nsubcommittee is my colleague from Mississippi. He has shown real \nleadership and stamina in getting this done, bringing it to the floor \nof the Senate, and holding the line on making sure that what we spend \nis what we need, a reasonable amount, and not allowing it to spiral out \nof control, which it could have very easily.\n  He deserves a lot of credit. It went right into conference and \nsecured an agreement. This is going to be one of the appropriations \nbills that gets to the President for his signature early. That is the \nway this process should be done, because it is going to be finished \nbefore the beginning of the next fiscal year. There are not many \nappropriations bills that are going to do that this year or in most \nyears.\n  I do have a concern and am disappointed with a particular provision \nin this conference report that affects the FAA reauthorization \nconference report. As chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, we had \nextensive hearings, as I know this appropriations subcommittee did as \nwell, in developing the legislation that led to the FAA reauthorization \nbill. It became very clear early on that one of the major issues that \nwe had to confront was how to pay for security capital costs at \nairports. We have additional needs. There are additional costs. Many of \nthe airports' lobbies are crowded because they have the new equipment \nthat has been installed there to scan our luggage. A lot of additional \ncosts have been heaped on the airports, local authorities, and, as a \nmatter of fact, the TSA, the Transportation Security Administration.\n  The majority of the costs they are dealing with in the airports \nthemselves are associated with modifying the airports to install \nexplosive detection systems so that the baggage can be fully screened. \nEventually, we will have to move them out of the lobbies because we \nhave lines in airports now outside the buildings. That equipment is \ngoing to have to be moved.\n  The estimated cost associated with these modifications ran up to as \nmuch as $5 billion. I must say I gulped when I heard that. I have asked \na lot of questions about just how much is needed and how are we going \nto fund it. That was the natural question to come up.\n  In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, as we worked aggressively to deal \nwith tighter security at airports, the TSA was allowed to take $500 \nmillion out of the Airport Improvement Program. Those funds are \nsupposed to go for improving the airports, for aprons, runways, \nsecurity fences. But that money was diverted, $500 million of it, out \nof the normal AIP program into the security area.\n  The Transportation Security Administration came before the committee \nand said: We are going to need another $500 million, and we are going \nto need more and more and more. We made it clear that they could not \ntake another $500 million bite out of the airport improvement program, \nwhich is what they intend to do. But we do see that we need probably at \nleast $250 million a year to help airports fund these important \nsecurity projects. So we had to also come up with a way to provide that \nmoney.\n  The way that has been done is a $2.50 security fee that has been \nassessed on all airline passengers. The airlines will tell you that the \npassengers are not paying that fee. They are just having to absorb it. \nBecause if they raised ticket prices even a little bit, that would \naffect decisions that passengers make to go a different way or go on \nsome other airline. So they maintain they are having to eat that fee. \nRegardless, the actual fee is supposed to be on the passengers.\n  I have some problems with that, particularly when you look at how \nthat money is really being paid. It is a tremendous cost that is one of \nthe issues affecting our airline industry and the ability of airlines \nto make a profit and to stay in business.\n  So I actually considered the idea of eliminating this fee. The other \nside of the coin is that we have to come up with some way, if we are \ngoing to provide for these security changes, to pay for them. While I \nthink everybody has a responsibility to assume some of the cost--the \nFederal Government and local governments, perhaps, and airport \nauthorities--the people themselves are getting additional security. So \nwe decided to leave the fee in place.\n  Now, in my view, that is kind of like the highway trust fund. It is a \nfee charged for a specific purpose: aviation security. It should be \nused for that purpose, and that purpose should include airport \nsecurity. For years, the highway trust fund money was held in the trust \nto make the deficit look lower than it really was. It was also quite\n\n[[Page S11893]]\n\noften used in ways other than highways and bridges, and it has \ncontinued to change. On the last highway bill, we had a big discussion \nabout that. The budget people wanted to keep some of that money in the \ntrust fund to help with the budget numbers; the appropriators didn't \nwant to mandate that that money be spent, even though we needed \nhighways and bridges. We came up with a compromise that the Budget \nCommittee and appropriators could live with, and we spent more money \nand built more roads and bridges.\n  This is how I view a fee being paid for security at the airports. We \nsaid it would go into a fund where it would be earmarked for that \npurpose. The Appropriations Committee indicated that that was a problem \nfor them because they don't like, understandably, that this money is \nearmarked in a particular area. They say the Appropriations Committee \nwill look at that and make those decisions. Therefore, in the Homeland \nSecurity conference report, even though I thought we had worked our \ndisagreement out, we originally had a fund of $500 million and we went \nto $250 million, leaving money that could be used for discretionary \npurposes, the appropriators chose to override the authorizing \ncommittee. That is the way it went through the Senate, with Senator \nCochran raising concerns at the time the FAA Reauthorization was on the \nfloor, but I thought it was with an understanding to allow the process \nto move forward.\n  Now the conference report knocks that provision out--it is kind of \nnovel because the appropriations conference report knocks out a section \nin a bill that has not yet been passed. That was a little unusual, I \nthought. But I do think money that is paid by the passengers as a \nsecurity fee for purposes such as airport security should be spent for \nthat purpose, at a level designated by the authorizing committee. It \nshould not be left to the discretion of the appropriators or anybody \nelse to spend it at a level they see fit, although they may be spending \nthe money on justified programs in other aviation areas of the \nTransportation Security Administration.\n  So I am concerned about this. This bill is too important for our \ncountry, it affects too many people, and there are too many things to \nbe delayed. I would not do that. I wanted to go on record expressing my \ndisappointment particularly in this section--how it was done--and say \nthat if we are not going to mandate spending this money for airport \nsecurity, it would be my desire to eliminate the fees. That may be \nwhere we will have to go next year. For now, this is a small part of a \nvery large bill, although I think it is an important one. I had to \nraise my concerns and my objections, while not being prepared, of \ncourse, to delay this important legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments made by my \ngood friend and State colleague, who is chairman of the Aviation \nSubcommittee.\n  When the FAA bill was on the floor, I offered an amendment to strike \nthat language, which would have reduced resources available to meet the \nDepartment of Homeland Security requirements for aviation security. \nThat amendment was adopted without an objection.\n  Madam President, I would like to briefly explain the order in which \nthese events occurred and the reason for providing the funding \nprohibition that was included in this conference report.\n  On June 12 the Senate considered H.R. 2115, the Vision 100-Century of \nAviation Reauthorization Act reauthorizing Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA) activities. The FAA reauthorization bill contained \nlanguage that established a new entitlement for the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, an Aviation Security Capital Fund, by \nearmarking the first $500 million derived from the aviation security \nservice fees which are currently available and relied on as an offset \nto funding appropriated by Congress for aviation security.\n  This provision would have directed $500 million used by the \nTransportation Security Administration to offset the funds appropriated \nby Congress for aviation security. During consideration of the bill, I \noffered an amendment with Senator Byrd that would instead ``authorize \nto be appropriated to the Fund up to $500 million for each of the \nfiscal years 2004 through 2007'' for security improvements at our \nNation's airports.\n  This amendment was adopted by the Senate without objection. However, \nwhen the FAA reauthorization bill was reported from conference, the \nlanguage of that amendment was reversed. The conference agreement \nincluded $250 million in direct spending, not subject to appropriation, \nto be taken from the offsetting fee collections. The concerns raised \nthat the Department of Homeland Security would have to take a cut in \nits budget for aviation security to offset this new entitlement were \nnot taken into consideration.\n  There is no argument that our nation's airports need the resources to \nmake structural changes for the safety and security of the traveling \npublic. We have provided funding to address these needs in this \nconference report. We would not have been able to do this without the \ninclusion of the provision prohibiting the reduction of offsetting \ncollections.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this point that a letter to me from the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security on this subject, dated \nJune 11, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of the \n           Secretary,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2003.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Administration appreciates the \n     continued support of Congress for improvements in the \n     security of the Nation's civil aviation system and supports \n     Senate passage of S. 824, the Aviation Investment and \n     Revitalization Vision Act (Air-V). However, the \n     Administration opposes a provision in S. 824 that would \n     divert fees collected for security activities for purposes \n     other than the provision of direct security services.\n       With the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Congress identified \n     the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the focal point \n     of the federal government's homeland security efforts, with \n     the mission of preventing terrorist attacks and reducing the \n     nation's vulnerability to terrorism. While the Department \n     welcomes and appreciates the assistance of other agencies in \n     improving security, any diversion of security fees, such as \n     that proposed in S. 824, would directly undermine the \n     Department's ability to fulfill its mission. Air-V would \n     establish an Aviation Security Capital Fund that is both \n     outside the control of the Department and funded by diverting \n     $500 million per year of passenger and air carrier security \n     fees collected by the Transportation Security Administration \n     (TSA). This would diminish the Department's funding capacity. \n     As you know, the direct annual costs of operating the \n     aviation security system are not fully offset by these fees, \n     and diverting fee revenue for other purposes clearly weakens \n     the intended financing structure of TSA set forth in the \n     Aviation and Transportation Security Act. Diversion of the \n     fees into a fund outside of DHS undermines the ability of the \n     Administration to apply these resources to the most pressing \n     security needs.\n       The Administration looks forward to working with Congress \n     to ensure that the version of the bill presented to the \n     President eliminates this objectionable provision.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection, from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program, to the submission of these views for the \n     consideration of the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Tom Ridge.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I think it is important for us to continue to discuss \nand consider the appropriate way to deal with these fees and funds that \nare used for airport security. I assure my friend from Mississippi that \nI want to consider his suggestions and thoughts, and those of his \ncommittee, as we proceed in the administration of these programs. I \nwant to see that the fees are fair for the airlines, fair for \npassengers, that they achieve the results we all want, which are \nimproved airport security and the security and safety of the traveling \npublic. I hope we can do that and work out an appropriate way of \nhandling this issue in the future.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S11894]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it seems to be the ill fortune--the ill \nfortune--of the present occupant of the chair to have to find himself \nin the chair when I make speeches. It seems that every time I make a \nspeech, the Senator from Texas is in the chair.\n  Well, I am glad to see him there. He is a good Presiding Officer. He \nis alert to what is going on on the floor. He listens, and he is always \nvery pleasant, congenial, and I congratulate him, because sitting in \nthe chair while I speak makes it very difficult for any Senator to \ncarry on his other necessary activities--the work in his office and \nmeeting with constituents and so on. So I not only congratulate him, I \nalso thank him.\n  Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate finds itself with the first \nHomeland Security appropriations conference report before it. I thank \nSenate Chairman Thad Cochran, House Chairman Harold Rogers, and the \nranking member on the House Homeland Security Subcommittee, \nRepresentative Martin Sabo, and all of the House and Senate conferees \nfor their hard work on this important legislation. We all share the \ngoal of ensuring that the new Homeland Security Department has the \nresources it needs to secure the homeland.\n  The conference report that is before the Senate provides $29.4 \nbillion for discretionary programs for fiscal year 2004 for the new \nDepartment. With the limited resources that were made available under \nthe budget resolution, the conference agreement is fair and balanced. \nAnd so much of that is due to the fair and balanced approach that the \ndistinguished chairman here, Senator Thad Cochran, always displays. It \ncomes as a habit to him. It is just second nature.\n  This bill provides a $1 billion increase over the President's \nrequest, and it makes a number of significant improvements in the \norganization of the Department.\n  In particular, I am pleased that the conference agreement includes \nlanguage that will ensure that the new airline passenger screening \nsystem, known as CAPS II, will not be deployed before February 15, \n2004, until the General Accounting Office has had the ability to review \nand report on the personal privacy protections, including an appeal \nprocess for individuals who are prevented from flying because the \nsystem has identified them as a security risk.\n  Funds are included, consistent with the Senate bill, to enhance \nborder security--none of which were requested by the President--\nincluding funds for an additional 570 Border Patrol agents and funds to \nestablish a northern border air wing.\n\n  Mr. President, $60 million is included to begin the development of an \nantimissile device for commercial aircraft.\n  The conference agreement restates both House and Senate language \nregarding full funding of antidumping enforcement provisions as well as \ncalling on the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection to rigorously \nenforce trade laws pertaining to steel imports.\n  The conference agreement is good for disaster-prone States. The bill \ncontains $200 million for flood map modernization, which is the largest \namount ever appropriated for this account. Further, the bill strikes a \nbalance between premitigation and postmitigation grants. The bill \ncontains $150 million for predisaster mitigation grants, so that States \nhave access to funds that help them to plan for and prevent damage from \ndisasters.\n  The bill also continues to fund postdisaster mitigation, which is \nmade available to States as a percentage of disaster relief money \nreceived from FEMA. The President had proposed to eliminate funding for \npostdisaster mitigation.\n  The conference agreement provides $180 million for emergency \nmanagement performance grants. These grants allow States and localities \nto develop basic emergency preparedness and response capabilities. This \nprogram is the only Department of Homeland Security grant program that \nis focused on all hazards, such as terrorist attacks, floods, and \nbuilding collapses. The administration had recommended rolling this \nprogram into the ODP State grants program.\n  As Hurricane Isabel confirmed, we must make sure that this new \nDepartment of Homeland Security maintains its ability to respond to \nnatural disasters, while preventing and responding to terrorist \nattacks. These are all significant improvements over the program \nproposed by the President.\n  Regrettably, even with these improvements, the conference agreement \nleaves significant gaps in the security of our homeland. After 9/11, \nCongress passed the PATRIOT Act, the Maritime Transportation Security \nAct, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, and the Enhanced \nBorder Security Act. The President signed these measures with great \nfanfare, but the President has done little to fulfill the promise of \nthose laws.\n  The inadequate allocation given to the subcommittee has forced the \nconferees to underfund a number of these critical new authorities.\n  Last Wednesday, I offered an amendment in conference to add $1.25 \nbillion of emergency funding to the bill to secure the homeland by \nfunding some of the authorities that the President had signed into law \nafter 9/11 but failed to fund. The amendment included funding for port \nsecurity, aviation security, chemical security, first responder grants, \nand for the Coast Guard Deepwater Program. The White House opposed and \nthe Republicans rejected the amendment.\n  On the same day, last Wednesday, the President sent to Congress a \nsupplemental request for his war in Iraq that totals $87 billion. No \nfunding was requested to help secure our homeland. Yet included in his \nrequest was $20.3 billion for the reconstruction of Iraq, of which $5.1 \nbillion is for homeland security in Iraq.\n  If my amendment had been approved, the conference report that is \nbefore the Senate would have included $125 million more to hire 1,300 \nmore Customs inspectors on our U.S. borders, $200 million more for \nfirst responder grants to equip and train police and firefighters here \nat home, and $100 million for the U.S. Coast Guard to secure our ports.\n  Instead, next week, the Senate will be considering the President's \nrequest for reconstructing Iraq, including $290 million for Iraqi fire \ndepartments; $150 million for Iraqi border enforcement, including 2,500 \ncustoms inspectors; $150 million for an Iraqi ``911'' emergency system; \n$499 million for Iraqi prisons; and $82 million for an Iraqi coast \nguard.\n  I continue to maintain that the Senate should take some time to \nreview the President's supplemental request for the cost of the war in \nIraq. We should hold further hearings in the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. We should hear from outside witnesses, not just \nadministration witnesses. The Senate should not act as a rubberstamp \nfor any President. I find it more than ironic that the Bush \nadministration would oppose homeland security protections for American \ncitizens but ask Congress to express dollars to Iraq for security \nefforts there.\n  With regard to the Homeland Security conference report that is before \nus, I again thank Chairman Cochran and his staff for their hard work in \nproducing the first Homeland Security appropriations conference report. \nI also thank my own staff in this regard, and I thank all of the \nsubcommittee members on both sides of the aisle and their staffs as \nwell. While this conference report does not include sufficient \nresources to fund many of the new homeland security programs that this \nCongress authorized in response to the attacks of 9/11, it is a \nsignificant improvement over the President's request. I support its \nadoption.\n  The chairman would have done more if he had had more funds with which \nto do it. I again thank him for his many courtesies. I thank the floor \nstaff and the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia for his kind words, his compliments to me and the members \nof our staff. He also devoted a great deal of personal attention and \neffort to the development of this legislation, and his experience and \ngood judgment have been invaluable in the presentation of this \nconference report to the Senate today.\n\n[[Page S11895]]\n\n  I know of no other Senators who are seeking to speak on the \nconference report at this time. Not wanting to leave anyone out of the \ndebate who wants to join in, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support the Homeland Security \nappropriations conference report today because this funding is vital to \nour first responders and all of those responsible for protecting us. I \nam disappointed that the conference committee rejected additional \nfunding for first responders, port security grants, aviation security, \nadditional Customs inspectors at our borders and other protective \nmeasures. At a time when homeland security should be a top priority, we \nshould not be underfunding these programs.\n  In addition to inadequate funding, the grant formula that is used to \ndistribute funding under the Office of Domestic Preparedness State \nHomeland Security Grant Program is inequitable and needs to be changed. \nThis program distributes funds using a minimum State funding formula \nthat arbitrarily sets aside a large portion of the funds to be divided \nequally among the States, regardless of need. Many Federal grant \nprograms provide a minimum State funding level to ensure funds reach \nall areas of the country. But the State minimum formula in this \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which is taken \nfrom the USA Patriot Act and sets aside 0.75 percent of the total funds \nas a base for each State, is unusually high and therefore inequitable. \nI will continue to work to change this formula so that funding is \nallocated in an equitable and reasonable manner.\n  I am also disappointed that this bill does not sufficiently address a \nproblem known as ``corporate inversions.'' As young men and women are \nputting their lives on the line for us and our country, some \ncorporations have put profits before patriotism by pretending to \nreincorporate in Bermuda or some other offshore tax haven to avoid \npaying their fair share of U.S. taxes. This process is called corporate \ninversion. It is unfair, it is founded on a deception, it mistreats the \naverage American taxpayer, and it undercuts U.S. corporations that do \npay their taxes. A company simply set up a shell headquarters in a tax \nhaven, while all the benefits of living in America remain, all the \nbenefits we would hope to provide in this bill--for instance, \nprotection, homeland security, police, fire, port security. They take \nadvantage of all the other services which are provided to these \nparticular corporations. But because a shell headquarters has been \nopened up for a few of these corporations in Bermuda, they have avoided \npaying taxes.\n  I am disappointed that the conferees chose to allow a special benefit \nto these unpatriotic companies to continue to exist. Back in July, when \nthis body debated the bill before us, the Senate adopted the amendment \nI offered with Senator Reid that disqualified these unpatriotic \ncompanies from competing for homeland security contracts. \nUnfortunately, the conference committee dropped this amendment from the \nbill, so those who have engaged in these so-called inversion \ntransactions in past years can still enter into homeland security \ncontracts.\n  They continue to use our roads and our law enforcement, our education \nsystem. They use our free-trade laws. But then they avoid paying taxes \nby opening up a post office box and a computer in a tax haven.\n  Inversions are unfair to the taxpayers who are left holding the bag \nand unfair to the U.S. companies that are doing the right thing by not \ninverting but who nevertheless are at a competitive disadvantage \nbecause of these sham moves. Those that engaged in these specious \ninversion transaction in past years can still enter into homeland \nsecurity contracts--the current prohibition in the law only applies to \nfuture inverters, not those that did so previously. The competitive \nadvantage these inverters enjoy vis-a-vis every other U.S. company, \ntherefore remains undisturbed.\n  Senator Reid and I, along with other of our colleagues, have \nintroduced a bill that would deny tax benefits to U.S. companies that \ninvert by continuing to treat them as U.S. companies for tax purposes. \nThis bill would not only level the playing field between these \ncompanies and their U.S. competitors, it would also save other U.S. \ntaxpayers from having to make up an estimated $4.9 billion in lost tax \nrevenues over the next 10 years.\n  I hope that we will soon have an opportunity to act on this \nlegislation in order to address this problem.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today we are considering the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 2555, the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 2004.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member. They and \ntheir staffs need to be congratulated on successfully reporting and \nconferencing the very first Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  The pending bill provides $30.2 billion in total budget authority and \n$31.0 billion in total outlays for fiscal year 2004. The Senate bill is \n$1.4 billion in BA and outlays above the President's budget request.\n  The pending bill funds the program of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, including the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, the \nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Coast Guard, \nthe Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Secret Service, \nthe Office for Domestic Preparedness, and several other offices and \nactivities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  H.R. 2555, DEPT.

Totals adjusted for\n  consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\nPrepared by SBC Majority Staff, 9/24/2003.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the conference agreement on the fiscal \nyear 2004 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security \nincludes funding for the Project Bioshield proposal, a $5.6-billion \ninitiative proposed in the President's 2004 budget to develop and \npurchase countermeasures to combat public health threats.\n  The appropriation itself is very unusual, providing 10 years' worth \nof discretionary program funding all at once, with $890 million for \n2004 and essentially a gigantic $4.7 billion ``advance'' appropriation \nto cover the next 9 years. Further, this funding is being provided \nwithout authorization, since that bill, S. 15, has been blocked from \nconsideration in the Senate by a small minority of Senators.\n  I am very concerned about appropriating this much money for any \npurpose without a proper authorization. I am equally concerned about \nprotecting the integrity of the budget due to the proposal's \nunconventional use of advance appropriations authority. It is rare to \nprovide 10 years' worth of appropriations to a program in one fell \nswoop, and it opens the door to future ``piggy-banking'' or redirection \nof those funds.\n\n[[Page S11896]]\n\n  My colleagues may remember that Congress decided in the 2001 budget \nresolution to begin limiting the use of advance appropriations since \nthey had become a way to avoid annual spending limits. The potential to \nabuse advance appropriations for scoring purposes was never more \nclearly illustrated that with the recent consideration of the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill in the Senate, as amendment after amendment altered \nthe timing of advance appropriations and claimed it as an ``offset.''\n  Since the potential for redirecting, rescinding, delaying, or \naccelerating the $4.7 billion Bioshield advance appropriation presents \ntoo great a temptation, the HELP Committee Chairman Judd Gregg is \nworking with me to prevent these abuses by creating a new scorekeeping \nrule to protect the unique purpose of this funding. The rule would \nensure that any funding for Bioshield will be spent on that program, or \nnot spent at all, by providing that any legislation changing the \navailability of the funds will not be scored for purposes of budget \nenforcement. However, until the authorization bill including our \nprotections is enacted, the budget remains at risk.\n  Since the President originally requested that Bioshield be a \nmandatory spending program, the 2004 budget resolution did not provide \nfor its consideration as a discretionary spending program. Thus, my \ncolleagues should be aware that its inclusion in this bill subjects the \nentire bill to a 60-vote point of order.\n  I plan to take whatever steps are necessary this year, and in next \nyear's budget resolution, to ensure that this program is properly \nauthorized and that the integrity of the budget is protected. I look \nforward to working with our leader and my fellow committee chairmen in \nthis regard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the primary purposes of the Department of \nHomeland Security, DHS, are to prevent terrorist attacks within the \nUnited States; to reduce America's vulnerability to terrorism; and, to \nminimize the damage and recover from attacks that may occur. The \nfledgling agency has begun to address many of the challenges presented \nit, including the monumental restructuring of 22 domestic Federal \nagencies. The Appropriation Committee's role is to provide the DHS the \nfunds necessary to continue to carry out its important missions. I am \npleased that, in this first homeland security appropriations bill, the \nagency's priorities were, for the most part, placed above the special \ninterests'.\n  The conference report and the accompanying Statement of Managers is \nrelatively free of objectionable provisions. There are, however, a \ncouple of provisions that merit the attention of my colleagues.\n  One such provision would prohibit any funds from being used to \nimplement section 44922(h) of title 49. Interestingly, there is no such \nsection under existing law.\n  So why have the appropriators taken action to prohibit the \nimplementation of a provision of law that doesn't exist? Well, the FAA \nreauthorization conference report, which has yet to be voted on by the \nfull Senate, includes such a section that we expect will become law as \nsoon as we can take final action on the bill and send it to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  The FAA reauthorization conference report provision would provide \n$250 million per year to airports for capital costs associated with \nsecurity at our Nation's airports. We received testimony during our \nmany oversight hearings on aviation security that such costs could \ntotal almost $5 billion. Therefore, the FAA conference report \nappropriately provides funding for such costs.\n  Do the appropriators disagree that such funding is needed? Apparently \nnot, since the DHS conference report actually contains on appropriation \nof $250 million--exactly the same amount as the FAA bill--for such \ncosts. So what is behind the appropriators' actions?\n  Given that the DHS conference report doesn't provide an explanation, \none can only conclude they want to ensure complete and total control, \nas usual, even if it means taking action to nullify a provision not in \ntheir jurisdiction and that has not even been enacted.\n  The funding under the FAA conference report is taken from the revenue \ncollected by the $2.50 security fee imposed on all airline passengers. \nThat fee was first established by legislation originating in the \nCommerce Committee after the September 11 attacks. The legislation also \nspecified that the revenue could be used by the appropriators to help \npay for the costs of aviation security.\n  The FAA conference report simply expands the uses of the fee revenue \nto include capital security costs at airports. The report also makes \nthe money available directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security \nwithout further appropriation.\n  Our Nation's security, including the very important issue of aviation \nsecurity, which the Congress has spent considerable time and attention \naddressing, should not be jeopardized due to needless jurisdictional \nfights. It is unfortunate that such a provision was included in such an \nimportant funding bill without any consultation with the authorizing \ncommittee of jurisdiction. I would hope we could do better for the sake \nof our Nation's security interests.\n  In addition, I am concerned about a provision in the conference \nreport that would transfer funding for the Assistance to Firefighters \nGrant program from the Department of Homeland Security's Emergency \nPreparedness and Response Directorate to the Office for Domestic \nPreparedness.\n  The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program is a highly successful \nFederal program created to meet the basic day-to-day needs of our \nNation's firefighters. The program uses a competitive, merit-based \nreview process to distribute funds directly to fire departments \ndemonstrating the greatest need. Grants under this program are used for \nimproving local response to ``all-hazards,'' including wildfires, \nhazardous materials accidents, tornadoes, floods, and structural fires, \nand are not solely for antiterrorism efforts.\n  I am greatly concerned about the effects of this transfer on the \nprogram. ODP has little experience at running merit-based programs, \nsuch as the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program. ODP is focused on \ncounterterrorism, and may not have the experience necessary to \nunderstand the basic requirements of today's firefighter to deal with \nnon-terrorism related disasters.\n  I understand that the administration's fiscal year 2004 budget \nsubmission seeks to transfer this grant program to ODP. However, \nchanges to the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program should be made \nafter a thorough review and subsequent legislative changes by the \nappropriate authorizing committees, not as a provision in an \nappropriations bill.\n  Compared to other appropriations measures, the conference report and \nStatement of Managers contain fewer objectionable provisions and \nearmarks. I would hope future appropriations measures follow suit.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have no other Senators who wish to \nspeak on the adoption of the conference report on the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. We are prepared to proceed to a vote on the \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has acted \nfavorably on this conference report. Before we leave the subject, I \nhave to express my appreciation to the members of the staff of our \nsubcommittee in the Senate on our side of the aisle who worked so hard \nto make this conference report a reality. This was breaking new ground; \nthere is no precedent for this bill. This is a historic event and a lot \nof hard work went into writing the bill and guiding it to passage on \nthe floor of the Senate and then working out our differences with the \nother body.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has unanimously adopted the conference \nreport. I especially want to express my\n\n[[Page S11897]]\n\nappreciation to Rebecca Davies, chief clerk of the subcommittee, and to \nthe other staff members who assisted her in the hard work that was done \nin furtherance of our efforts to get a bill, including Les Spivey, \nRachelle Schroeder, Carol Cribbs, James Hayes, and Josh Manley. They \nall deserve our thanks and congratulations for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11897-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 572, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Larry Alan Burns, of \nCalifornia, to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we are about to have a vote on a judge. \nI wanted to take this time, 2 minutes, to offer my support for this \nnominee. I want to say this particular nominee for the Southern \nDistrict Court of California, Larry Burns, is very qualified for this \nposition. He is a native Californian. He is a graduate of Point Loma \nCollege and the University of San Diego Law School.\n  I want to emphasize the wide support Judge Burns has from law \nenforcement and civil rights organizations. His firm commitment to the \nlaw was well regarded while he was both a Federal and a State \nprosecutor. He has developed an equally respected reputation as a \njudge, due to his character and his legal expertise.\n  So I believe the Southern District will benefit greatly from the \nexemplary services of Judge Burns. I fully support confirmation of this \nnominee.\n  At a time when we have a lot of partisan discord, I think it is \nimportant to know that in California, Senator Feinstein and I, working \nwith the administration, have a wonderful process in place by which the \ntwo Democrat Senators get three people on a committee to pass judgment \non these nominees and the administration appoints three people. Each \nnominee for the district court goes through our process and they are \nthen recommended to the President on a majority vote.\n  What has happened is we have taken the politics, truly, out of this \njudicial selection process. We have come up with mainstream candidates. \nThat is very important because I believed the President when he came \nforward and said he was going to govern from the center. When he puts \nforward judicial nominees who are from the center, who are not radical, \nwho are not far to the right, I am the first one to support them, and I \nhave supported well over 90 percent of them.\n  When it comes to voting for nominees who are off the scales and not \nrepresentative of the values of America, I am the first one to say it \nis not right. We have a process in place for the district courts that I \nonly wish we had for the higher courts--the circuit courts--because it \nisn't working that well. But it is working very well in the district \ncourts.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on Larry Burns's nomination, \nand I hope it will be a unanimous vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased that we are now turning to \nthe nomination of Magistrate Judge Larry Alan Burns for the Southern \nDistrict of California. This well qualified nominee is the product of \nthe exemplary bipartisan commission that Senators Feinstein and Boxer \nhave worked so hard to maintain. It is a testament to their diligence \nthat we have such stellar nominees heading to California's federal \ncourts.\n  Judge Burns has been a United States Magistrate for the past six \nyears in San Diego. Prior to becoming a Magistrate, Mr. Burns gained \nsignificant trial experience as a State and federal criminal \nprosecutor. Judge Burns has also served as a mentor to disadvantaged \nstudents, assisting them in achieving their educational and career \ngoals. He was honored for his work in this area with a Faculty \nMentoring Award from San Diego State University in 1996. In addition, \nhe has taught legal courses at both the undergraduate and graduate \nschool levels at several San Diego universities. In light of his \nremarkable record of public service and trial experience, it is not \nsurprising that the American Bar Association was unanimous in its \ndetermination that Judge Burns is ``Well-Qualified'' to be a federal \ndistrict court judge.\n  The Southern District of California the busiest federal district in \nthe nation. Last Congress, in enacting the DOJ Reauthorization \nlegislation, we created the seat that Judge Burns is nominated to in an \neffort to alleviate their staffing shortage. In light of their \ndemanding caseload and corresponding staffing needs, the Judiciary \nCommittee expedited nominations to the Southern District. Judge Burns \nwas nominated on May 1, 2003 and was voted out of committee on \nSeptember 4, 2003. It is unfortunate that Judge Burns and another \nnominee for this court have been pending on the floor all month but I \nam pleased that we are voting on Judge Burns today. The path of his \nnomination demonstrates that the fact that the Senate can act \nexpeditiously when we receive well-qualified, consensus nominations on \ncourts that need additional judges.\n  Another consensus nominee for another vacancy in that district \nremains on the Senate executive calendar awaiting action. I implore the \nSenate Republican leadership to allow a prompt vote on the nomination \nof Dana Makoto Sabraw. I expect that\n\n[[Page S11898]]\n\nvote to be unanimously in support, as well.\n  Senator Feinstein also deserves much credit for working so hard to \ncreate these additional judgeships in the Department of Justice \nauthorization we passed in 2002. These judgeships are among those we \ncreated for border districts that have a massive caseload and that \nneeded more federal judges. We did what the Republican majority refused \nto do in the years 1995 through 2000 when there was a Democratic \nPresident, namely, create additional needed judgeships for the Southern \nDistrict of California. We did so under Senate Democratic leadership \nwith a Republican President. They have been available to be filled \nsince July 15.\n  The Judiciary Committee held hearings of Magistrate Judge Burns and \nothers just before the August recess and they were unanimously reported \nby the Judiciary Committee at our first meeting on September 4. That \nwas three weeks ago. In addition to the nomination of Dana Makoto \nSabraw, which is already favorably reported and on the Senate executive \ncalendar awaiting action, two more nominees to two additional vacancies \nrecently created for the Southern District of California should be \nconsidered and reported by the Judiciary Committee tomorrow.\n  I congratulate the California Senators on their outstanding work and \nthis nominee and his family on this confirmation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays on the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Larry Alan Burns, of California, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Southern District of California?

The clerk will report the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 2657.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2657) making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The Conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 18, 2003.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I am pleased to present the conference \nreport to accompany the legislative branch fiscal year 2004 \nappropriations.\n  I thank Senator Durbin and his staff for all their help and hard \nwork. He was certainly cooperative in this process. I also thank \nChairman Stevens, chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, who \nhas been extremely helpful in getting the conference report to the \nSenate.\n  The legislative branch bill totals $3.549 billion, just 2.5 percent \nof the fiscal year 2003 level. Highlights of the bill include funding \nof $220 million for the Capitol Police for a total of 1,592 police \nofficers. In addition, the police would have authority to hire 75 \ncivilian personnel to improve administrative operations and move about \n30 officers from desk jobs to field jobs.\n  Funding is included for a mounted horse unit which will provide \nenumerable benefits for the police department. I understand they are \nworking out an agreement with the Park Service to house the horses with \nthe Park Service horses.\n  The bill also includes language that will move forward the merger of \nthe Library of Congress police force with the U.S. Capitol Police to \nimprove the security of the entire Capitol complex.\n  The Architect of the Capitol: Funds total $405 million, which \nincludes $47.8 million for the Capitol Visitors Center so we can \nfinally move forward and fill up that big hole that is outside our \nfront door. The Visitors Center project funding is partially offset by \nusing unobligated prior year funds.\n  The Library of Congress: Funds total $528 million for the library \nwith funding going to such important programs as the veterans history \nproject and the audio-visual conservation center being built in \nCulpeper.\n  The Open World Program is funded at $13.5 million. This program has \nbeen very successful in showing firsthand democracy and how we lead a \ncountry in democratic institutions to emerging Russian leaders and has \nbeen expanded to include certain countries of the former Soviet Union.\n  Funds are also included for the General Accounting Office, the \nCongressional Budget Office, and the Government Printing Office, as \nwell as the House and Senate.\n  The supplemental appropriations portion totals $937.6 million in \ntitle III of this bill for the emergency supplemental items, such as \nadditional funding for FEMA, which has been doing such a terrific job \nfacing the number of natural catastrophes we have had in America this \nlast year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to have worked with Senator \nCampbell of Colorado on this fiscal year 2004 legislative branch \nappropriations bill. It is a good and fair bill. Considering our \nlimited resources, I think it accomplishes many objectives.\n\n[[Page S11899]]\n\nThe bill totals $3.547 billion, which is $27 million below the Senate \nand $36 million above the House. The Senate portion totals $717 \nmillion.\n  The Capitol Police funding totals $220 million. The Architect of the \nCapitol funding is $405 million, including $47.8 million for the \nCapitol Visitors Center. The funding for the tunnel from the new \nCapitol Visitors Center to the Library of Congress is capped at $10 \nmillion. This is pursuant to an amendment offered by a conferee, \nCongressman David Obey of Wisconsin.\n  The Library of Congress total funding is $528 million. The Open World \nLeadership Center is funded at $13.5 million. I am especially happy to \nsee the Visitors Center fully funded. This was quite a challenge for \nCongress but well worth the effort. Beyond everything else this center \nhas to offer, security remains the top benefit.\n  Many of us can still recall vividly September 11, 2001, when in the \nearly morning hours we were forced to evacuate the Capitol for fear \nthat this building, this symbol of our great country, was under attack. \nWe learned later from some of the sources available to us that the \nplane that was brought down by the heroic passengers in Pennsylvania \nwas destined to crash into the U.S. Capitol Building, undoubtedly \nresulting in a lot of innocent people dying. The heroism of the \npassengers and crew on that United Airlines plane saved our lives, and \nwe are forever grateful to them and their families for their \nextraordinary feats of bravery.\n  I can recall that day, going down the steps of the Senate onto the \nlawn, and standing there with thousands of people who didn't know which \nway to turn. Elderly tourists came up to me and said: ``Where are we \nsupposed to go, do you know?'' The obvious answer was that there was no \nplace to go. You could hardly direct those people or the visitors and \nstaff and Members working in this Capitol Building to a safe location.\n  At the time, it was my honor to serve as chairman of the Legislative \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and I felt at that moment that I had to do \nwhatever I could to accelerate the conversation leading to the \nconstruction of the Capitol Visitors Center--a place clearly to be \ndesigned for security and designed to accommodate the needs of the \ngrowing responsibilities of the U.S. Capitol.\n  I am happy to report that President Bush agreed and the leaders in \nCongress came to a similar agreement. And if anyone has visited \nWashington since then, they know we have a massive excavation taking \nplace outside the Capitol Building, which, over time--a reasonable \nperiod of time--will be filled with an extraordinary engineering feat, \na Capitol Visitors Center, which will give us security and a lot of the \nspace we dearly need to serve the people of the country.\n  I am glad that this appropriations bill, among others, appropriates \nsome $48 million for that purpose. It makes certain we are going to \nmaintain our responsibility in seeing this through to its completion. \nWe simply cannot afford to put the security of those who visit the \nCapitol and those who work here in jeopardy. Having been here on \nSeptember 11, 2001, seeing so many people at a loss as to where to turn \nfor safety, I understand we are going to give them the answer--the very \nbest answer--when it comes to security when they visit one of the most \nwell-known and important buildings in our entire Nation. This project \ndeserves to go forward as planned, and it will when this conference \nreport is adopted for this legislative branch appropriation.\n\n  I also wish to say a few words about the Capitol Police. After \nSeptember 11, we spent a lot of time acknowledging the overtime and \nextraordinary courage of these men and women who protect us every \nsingle day. They had to change their family lives, their personal \nlives, and make a career commitment to all of us who work here, and \nthey did it. We can never thank them enough for all they have done. \nSince then, we have tried to increase staffing as necessary and make \ncertain that those who were hired--men and women--met the highest \nstandards of all who have served before them. I am happy to say that \nfunding for the Capitol Police totals $220 million.\n  The key differences from the bill we passed include no additional \nhires of sworn officers until they have a final strategic plan. One of \nthe other things we do, though, is really take an important step \nforward in integrating the security force of the Library of Congress \nwith the Capitol Hill Police.\n  It is going to become, I hope, a seamless security force on Capitol \nHill, and this is an important step forward.\n  We also provide for Library of Congress police officers to be hired \nby the Capitol Police and allow for their training by police officers \nin the Capitol Police Department.\n  We also make certain that several important projects at the Library \nof Congress are well funded: $528 million for the Library of Congress. \nThere are funds for ``Adventures of the American Mind'' totaling over \n$8 million. From my personal experience, this has been a very \nsuccessful project engaging the universities and colleges around the \ncountry and in my State of Illinois to discover what we have to offer \nat the Library of Congress. I encourage all who are following this \ndebate to go to the Web site of the Library of Congress, and you will \nfind an amazing array of opportunities for knowledge and information.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to recommend to my colleagues when this \nconference report comes to the floor that they all vote favorably.\n  I thank Drew Willison, Nancy Olkewicz, and Pat Souders of my personal \nstaff for their very hard work in helping prepare this legislative \nbranch appropriations conference report. I think it is a product well \nworthy of the support of all Senators of both political parties.\n  I am prepared to yield the floor to my colleague from Colorado, if he \nis prepared to say a few words on behalf of the conference report. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to inform the \nmembers of this distinguished body about H.R. 2657, the legislative \nbranch appropriations bill for FY 2004, as reported by the Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations.\n  The pending bill provides $3.5 billion in new budget authority and \n$3.7 billion in new outlays for FY 2004 to fund the operations of the \nSenate and House of Representatives; the Architect of the Capitol; the \nU.S. Capitol Police; and the Library of Congress. With outlays from \nprior-years and other completed actions, the Senate bill totals $3.6 \nbillion in budget authority and $3.8 billion in outlays.\n  For discretionary spending, which represents the bulk of the funding \nin this bill, the Senate bill is $73 million below the subcommittee's \n302(b) allocation for budget authority, and is at its 302(b) allocation \nfor outlays. The Senate bill is $312 million in BA and $130 million in \noutlays below the President's budget request.\n  In addition to providing appropriations for FY 2004 for the \nlegislative branch, the committee-reported bill contains various \nsupplemental appropriations for FY 2003. The FY 2004 concurrent \nresolution on the budget, H. Con. Res. 95, established levels for FY \n2003 and provided an allocation, pursuant to section 302(a) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, to the Committee on Appropriations \nfor FY 2003 in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the \nresolution, see page 130 of H. Rept. 108-71.\n  As a point of information, I would like to call my colleagues' \nattention to section 302(c) of the Congressional Budget Act. Section \n302(c) provides that it is not in order to consider a bill making \nappropriations for a fiscal year until the Committee on Appropriations \nhas made the suballocations required by section 302. It appears that \nthe Committee on Appropriations has yet to file 302(b) allocations for \n2003. This point of order may be waived, or a ruling of the Chair \nappealed, with 60 votes.\n  With regard to the emergency 2003 supplemental funding, the conferees \ndid not fund all elements of the President's request, they did not \nexceed the total amount of his request, as adjusted for the \nsupplemental FEMA appropriations already enacted in July.\n\n[[Page S11900]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget Committee \nscoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      H.R. 2657, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPORPRIATIONS, 2004: SPENDING\n                     COMPARSIONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n               [Fiscal year 2004, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        General\n                                        purpose    Mandatory     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n  Budget authority..................      3,539         109       3,648\n  Outlays...........................      3,737         109       3,846\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority..................      3,612         109       3,721\n  Outlays...........................      3,737         109       3,846\n2003 level:\n  Budget authority..................      3,620         104       3,724\n  Outlays...........................      3,327         103       3,430\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority..................      3,851         109       3,960\n  Outlays...........................      3,867         109       3,976\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority..................      3,480         109       3,589\n  Outlays...........................      3,599         109       3,708\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority..................      3,575         109       3,648\n  Outlays...........................      3,689         109       3,798\n \n                     CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO--\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority..................

Mr. President, I rise today to support legislation that \nwould clearly allow the Federal Trade Commission to move forward with \nits national do-not-call registry. I have submitted an amendment to \nthat effect, amendment No. 1786 to the DC appropriations bill, as well \nas cosponsored S. 1652, a bill to ratify the do-not-call registry \nprovision of the telemarketing sales rule. As we have heard today, the \nU.S. District Court in Oklahoma issued a decision that the Federal \nTrade Commission lacked the authority to develop its national do-not-\ncall list. The court ruled that, although Congress appropriated the \nfunds to the FTC in order to have the program, it did not actually have \nthe language necessary to authorize the establishment of the program \nand the implementation of the program.\n  Today, I rise in support of my proposal that would basically give the \nFederal Trade Commission the clear authority and the statutory \nresponsibility to establish a national do-not-call program. In \naddition, it affirms the finding that the Federal Trade Commission was \nauthorized in the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention \nAct to implement and enforce the national do-not-call registry.\n  Last, it specifically ratifies the do-not-call registry provision of \nthe FTC's telemarketing sales rule.\n  Before I was elected to this august body, I had the great privilege \nof being the attorney general of my State. I remember back in 1998 when \nI ran for attorney general of Arkansas, everywhere I would go, every \nlittle town I would go into, and every time I would talk to a group, \nwhether it was veterans or whoever it happened to be, senior citizens \nor townspeople at large, they would tell me: Please, please, if you can \ndo anything about telemarketers calling us at home and bothering us and \ntrying to sell us something over the telephone, do it.\n\n  I was proud to do that. When I was elected to the office and began \nserving in January of 1999, the first thing I did was pull the staff \ntogether at the attorney general's office and write the State's do-not-\ncall program. It was very different from the one the Federal Trade \nCommission came up with but both are equally good. They both get to the \nproblem and I think can be very effective fighting against unwanted \ntelephone calls.\n  Listen, we have all been there. We have all received those calls. We \nhave all been eating dinner, trying to put our children down, trying to \ndo homework, or watching our favorite TV show, whatever the situation \nmight be, when we have been subjected to these unwanted calls. For most \npeople it is an inconvenience. They don't like to be bothered. They \nwant us to find a way to respect the integrity of the privacy of their \nown homes. After all, they are paying the phone bill; they are paying \nfor the service. They should be able to have some control on the amount \nof calls coming in and to put a stop to these unwanted calls. Some of \nthe phone companies actually offer a service that blocks calls from \npeople who block their caller ID. That is another subject. That can be \nfairly expensive for some consumers. It's not always expensive.\n  The Federal Trade Commission came up with an idea to do this \nnationwide, to do it free, and to do it by use of toll-free numbers and \nWeb sites allowing people to sign on. In fact, I signed on in the first \nweek because one thing I noticed in Virginia is they do not have do-\nnot-call laws, as far as I can tell, and we get bombarded in our home \nin Virginia. Unlike in Arkansas where we signed up for the AG's list \nand we may get one or two telemarketing calls a month, in Virginia we \nget 3 or 4 a day, and it seems they always try to call at an \ninopportune time.\n\n[[Page S11901]]\n\n  One thing I noticed, one fact that apparently is true, as I \nunderstand it, the Federal Trade Commission now has 50 million phone \nnumbers that have been registered under the Federal do-not-call \nprogram. Fifty million Americans can't be wrong. They want relief. They \nwant us, as their lawmakers, as their elected Representatives here in \nWashington, to do something to stop these calls.\n  The Federal Trade Commission, to its credit, and I appreciate them \ngreatly for doing this, tried to come to their aid, come to their \nassistance, to make a national do-not-call registry a reality.\n  I think this is something the Nation is ready for. Fifty million \npeople have already tried to sign up in the first few weeks after the \nannouncement of the national do-not-call program. It is something we as \nMembers of this body and as Members of the Congress, of the Federal \nGovernment, should try to do to ensure that the people of this country, \nif they want it, on a voluntary basis, can have some relief from \nunwanted telemarketing calls.\n  Congress mandated that this list be implemented on a national scale, \nand the President signed it into law. The legislation I am proposing \nnow clarifies our intentions, and I certainly ask my colleagues to \nsupport the legislation in any way they can. I hope we will have a vote \non this matter in very quick order.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The partnership ensures that the workforce has the skills needed \nto promote the region's growth.\n  Businesses that need educational services or a certain skill-set for \nits employees can contact METS, who will work with Northern Kentucky \nUniversity to design the appropriate curriculum. If Northern Kentucky \nUniversity does not offer a particular set of classes, METS arranges \nfor students to take classes at other institutions via the Internet or \nTele-conferencing.\n  The opening of this new state-of-the-art corporate training center is \nexciting for the region's business community and Northern Kentucky \nUniversity.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nDorgan's effort to overturn the Federal Communication Commission's \nmedia ownership rules. I commend Senator Dorgan on his resolve to work \nwith his colleagues in a bipartisan manner to bring forward a \ncommonsense solution to this pressing issue.\n  Every 2 years the FCC is required to review its media ownership \nrules. This most recent decision to roll back media ownership \nlimitations was the most sweeping in a generation. Was it in response \nto the American people asking for this reform? No, in fact over 2 \nmillion Americans contacted the FCC opposing the rule changes. In my \noffice, I received over 1,000 letters from Montanans opposing the \ndecision. It seems that the FCC turned a deaf ear to the will of the \nAmerican public. I hear them loud and clear.\n  I support Senator Dorgan's effort for three basic reasons: diversity, \nlocalism, and economics. First, if America is to have a vibrant \ndemocracy, one where our citizens are free to express their views and \nhave equal accessibility to the news, we as policymakers must protect \nthat right. The FCC's decision allows large corporations that already \nhave considerable clout over what we hear and see to further \nconsolidate. The decision allows TV networks to own more stations \nreaching more Americans. Even worse, these same stations could own the \nlocal newspaper in the same market.\n  We as Americans must have access to diverse news and information. The \nFCC's decision runs contrary to this axiom and would allow a few large \ntelevision stations to reach nearly one-half of the viewing public. If \nthe UHF discount is factored, nearly 90 percent of our Nation's \nhouseholds could be covered by one entity. Diversity is jeopardized \nwhen one company has this much leverage over what we see and hear.\n  Senator Dorgan has pointed out that localism is being lost to the \nbottom line. I can not agree more. A generation ago, Americans sat \naround the radio and listened to local news. We huddled around the TV \nto watch our local news anchor give us the latest information about our \ncommunities. Today, news and information is being portrayed as local, \nwhen, in reality, it is being broadcast to us from hundreds or even \nthousands of miles away. Instead of broadcasting news about our \ncommunities from our communities, media companies are broadcasting \nabout our communities even though they are nowhere near us. This is not \nlocalism and we should not stand idle to this emerging trend.\n  This decision has the potential to cause job loss in Montana. In \nMontana we have many ``mom-and-pop'' newspapers and television \nstations. Typically, these companies serve the rural areas of our State \nand do a tremendous job reporting about local activities and news. And \nthey are often owned and operated by local citizens living in the \ncommunities they serve. And very often they are run on a very tight \nbudget. The FCC's ruling jeopardizes our local stations and newspapers \nbecause these new larger companies will be able to squeeze these \ncompanies out of the market through advertising revenues with sheer \neconomic clout. With additional leverage over the media landscape, \nthese small, rural companies will find it harder and harder to compete \nand keep their doors open. As Montana's senior Senator, I will fight to \nprotect our small TV and newspaper owners.\n\n[[Page S11902]]\n\n  While I disagree with a majority of the FCC's decision, I would like \nto point out for small market broadcasters to survive, they may need \nthe chance to utilize duopolies and other means to stay in business. \nAnd while I am concerned about the broad sweeping changes the FCC made, \nI remain cognizant of the fact that small market broadcasters may \npotentially need to utilize the very changes we may revoke today, and I \nwill work with my colleagues to find market relief for these small \nbroadcasters when warranted.\n  Over the next several months we will continue to argue the merits of \nthis issue. However, I will only support any legislation that protects \ndiversity, localism, and Montana's small businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11902-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Berkeley, \nCA. On May 12, 2003, the victim, a 23-year-old male Sikh wearing a \nturban, was assaulted while on an evening walk at the University of \nCalifornia. The attacker, and his two male companions, started to walk \npast the victim, then yelled, ``Taliban, look out!'' The suspect \npunched the victim in the nose then pushed him to the ground. The \nsuspect later pulled the victim back to his feet and the men left the \nscene on foot.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11902-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11902-S11903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CMS' PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE 75 PERCENT RULE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I would like to express my \nconcern with a proposed rule by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, that would threaten the ability of rehabilitation \nhospitals to continue to provide critical care.\n  In my home State of Nebraska, Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital in \nLincoln is a nationally recognized premier rehabilitation facility that \noffers specialized programs and services for those who have suffered \nbrain injuries, strokes, spinal cord injuries, and other rehabilitating \ninjuries. If this proposed rule goes into effect, Madonna would not be \nable to offer the same critical care to its patients as it currently \ndoes.\n  When CMS first looked at whether facilities would qualify as an IRF, \na list of criteria was created to determine eligibility. They current \ncriteria, generally referred to as the 75 percent rule, were \nestablished in 1984 and have not been updated since then. To qualify as \nan IRF under the 75 percent rule, 75 percent of a facility's patients \nmust be receiving treatment for one of 10 specified conditions. Because \nthe rule has not been updated in almost 20 years, newer rehabilitation \nspecialties are not reflected and, therefore, are not counted in \ndetermining facility compliance with the 75 percent rule.\n  Since the 75 percent rule was implemented, IRFs have argued that the \nlist of conditions should be expanded to reflect advances in modern \nrehabilitation medicine. The need for new rehabilitation specialties to \ntreat cardiac, pulmonary, cancer, and other conditions was not even \nforeseeable when the 75 percent rule was implemented. Yet CMS has \nrepeatedly refused to update the rule--even after implementing a \npayment system that specifically recognizes many more conditions than \nthe 10 listed in the 75 percent rule.\n  On September 9, 2003, CMS published proposed modifications to the \noutdated 75 percent rule. I commend CMS for recognizing the need to \nupdate the regulation. Unfortunately, I believe that the proposed \nchanges do not go far enough and may have serious consequences for \nMedicare beneficiaries and other patients who need inpatient \nrehabilitative care.\n  On its face, it appears that CMS expanded the rule by increasing the \nnumber of conditions from 10 to 12 and by lowering the percentage \nthreshold from 75 percent to 65 percent. However, this ``expansion'' is \nillusory. The proposed rule will, by CMS's own estimate, reduce \nMedicare payments to IRFs by $223 million annually and shift hundreds \nof thousands of patients--both Medicare and non-Medicare--into \nalternative care settings that may be inappropriate.\n  It is worth noting that Congress gave CMS a directive to implement \nthe rehabilitation prospective payment system in a budget-neutral \nmanner. Yet this rule--without any congressional directive--seriously \ncuts rehabilitation hospital funding.\n  Although CMS expanded the number of conditions from 10 to 12, it did \nso by replacing one of the existing conditions--polyarthritis--with \nthree new conditions that collectively are much more narrow than the \noriginal condition. CMS acknowledges that the industry historically has \nunderstood hip and knee replacement cases to fall within the definition \nof ``polyarthritis.'' Unfortunately, CMS now proposes to count joint \nreplacement cases only if the patient has made no improvement after an \n``aggressive and sustained course of outpatient therapy.''\n  This means that, instead of being directly transferred from an acute \ncare hospital to an IRF, the patient will be forced into a skilled \nnursing facility, SNF, and/or outpatient therapy before being eligible \nfor inpatient rehabilitation. IRFs would become a setting of last \nresort, and patients who might have returned to function after a brief \nIRF stay will be forced to endure weeks if not months, of therapy in \nother settings that may be inappropriate before being admitted to an \nIRF.\n  CMS also proposes to lower the threshold from 75 percent to 65 \npercent for a three-year period to give facilities time to come into \ncompliance with the new criteria. Although this change is an \nimprovement, it simply does not go far enough to prevent a significant \nnegative impact on rehabilitation patients and providers.\n  RAND data indicate that only about 25 percent of IRFs, at most, could \nmeet a 65-percent threshold under the current list of 10 conditions. \nSince the proposed rule actually narrows the agency's interpretation of \narthritis-related conditions, the percentage of facilities that could \ncomply with the revised list of conditions is probably lower. This \nmeans that, even under a 65 percent standard, at least 75 percent of \nfacilities will be deemed out of compliance if CMS finalizes the \nproposed rule.\n  The proposed rule glosses over the negative impact that this dramatic \nshift will have on patients by assuming that all sites of care are \nequally effective and equally available. But I am very concerned about \nthe impact that the proposed rule would have on patients living in \nrural areas, where alternative sites of rehabilitative care may be \nunavailable or highly inconvenient. Where SNF beds are scarce and few \nhome health providers offer physical therapy services, these patients \ncould be forced to travel long distances for daily outpatient care in a \nweakened state, risking reinjury and rehospitalization.\n  Because compliance with the proposed rule will hinge on an IRF's \ntotal patient population, not just its Medicare population, CMS \nestimates that the proposed rule ``may have an effect'' on \napproximately 200,000 non-Medicare patients. CMS was not able to \nquantify or describe this effect because of inadequate information. In \nmy opinion, it would be irresponsible to implement this rule without \nfurther studying its likely impact on Medicare beneficiaries, non-\nMedicare patients, rehabilitation providers, and the Medicare Program.\n  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, agrees that the \nrule needs to be updated. In a July 7, 2003, letter to CMS \nAdministration Tom Scully, MedPAC Chair Glenn Hackburth proposed that \nCMS lower the threshold to 50 percent for at least a year to enable an \nexpert panel of clinicians to reach a consensus on the diagnoses to be \nincluded in the 75 percent rule.\n\n[[Page S11903]]\n\n  I agree with MedPAC and worked with Senator Jim Jeffords to file an \namendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nAppropriations bill that would have implemented MedPAC's \nrecommendations.\n  I decided against offering my amendment for a vote, but I leave open \nthe possibility of offering the amendment on another vehicle if CMS \ndoes not take appropriate action. I hope that the 75 percent rule can \nbe updated to ensure that my constituents and all Americans continue to \nhave access to necessary medical rehabilitation services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11903-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONTRACTING OUT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, to prohibit the \nuse of fiscal year 2004 Interior funds to initiate public private \ncompetitions at the Department of the Interior, including the National \nPark Service. This amendment takes an important step to ensure that \nvital public services at Interior are not put at risk by the \nadministration's aggressive plans to contract out Federal jobs.\n  As the ranking member of the National Parks Subcommittee, I view the \nadministration's outsourcing policies as especially harmful to the \nNational Park Service. I am particularly concerned that the outsourcing \nof Park Service jobs could target biologists, anthropologists and \narchaeologists.\n  During a Parks Subcommittee hearing this summer, Scot McElveen, the \npresident of the Association of National Park Rangers testified that \ncurrent outsourcing policies seriously threaten reliable, effective, \nand efficient service to the public.\n  Mr. McElveen said the administration's outsourcing plan is \nincompatible with the Parks Service's decentralized workforce. \nFurthermore, he noted that it would only worsen National Parks' current \nstaffing and budgetary shortfalls by diverting funds for operations and \nmaintenance to contract out jobs.\n  I agree with Mr. McElveen. I fail to see how outsourcing functions \nwithin the Parks Service will improve their mission to protect our \nnational parks, historic sites, monuments, and other treasured places. \nPark Service employees have a strong sense of public service which \ncannot be replicated by the private sector.\n  I believe this amendment takes the measures needed to ensure that \ncontracting out at the Department of the Interior does not come at the \nexpense of our National Parks.\n  The Reid amendment is identical to language included in H.R. 2691, \nthe House Interior Appropriations bill. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11903-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was recently informed of the passing of \nMSG Al Bland, USAF Ret. This distinguished veteran of the United States \nAir Force served his country admirably for 20 years. His military \ncareer included service during World War II, where Master Sergeant \nBland was ordered to beach defense on the Bataan perimeter. Captured at \nBataan in April of 1942, Master Sergeant Bland survived the Bataan \nDeath March, carrying another soldier for most of the journey. As a \nPOW, Bland was imprisoned at Camp O'Donnell in the Philippines, later \non a Japanese Hell Ship and finally in Manchuria. He was finally \nreleased from prison camp in 1945, after three torturous years. As a \nresult of his combat, he was 100 percent service related disabled.\n  The list of awards Master Sergeant Bland received for his valiant \nservice include the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. Upon completing \nhis service, Master Sergeant Bland became a leader on POW related \nissues for many years. He was instrumental in establishing the \nAndersonville National Park and was awarded the POW Medal by President \nReagan in 1988. I was fortunate enough to work with Master Sergeant \nBland and more importantly call him a friend. Master Sergeant Bland was \na true patriot and he will be sorely missed and by a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11903-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DO NOT CALL REGISTRY\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, regrettably, a Federal judge in Oklahoma has \nvoided the Federal Trade Commission's national ``do not call'' list \nthat was set to go into effect on October 1. This action frustrates the \nwishes of more than 48 million Americans who have signed up for the \n``do not call'' list. Though a judge ruled that the FTC lacked \nCongressional authority to create the national list, I strongly \ndisagree and believe that Congress explicitly granted the Commission \nboth the authority and the funding earlier this year to create a ``do \nnot call'' list.\n  Indeed, absent Congressional action, the FTC's ``do not call'' list \nwould have failed to have become a reality this year. I recall \ndiscussing the matter with FTC Chairman Tim Muris at a hearing before \nthe Antitrust Subcommittee last September. He asked me for help in \ngetting Congressional authority in order to raise fees necessary to \nimplement the ``do not call'' list. We were able to grant the \nCommission this authority in the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution \nwhich passed in February of this year. We further authorized the FTC's \ninitiative in the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act on March 11, 2003.\n  These actions more than authorized the FTC's ``do not call'' list, in \nmy view. That said, this bill will make it crystal clear that Congress \nendorses, supports, and authorizes the FTC to create a national ``do \nnot call'' registry.\n  I commend the FTC's hard work to create a national ``do not call'' \nlist. Such action was long overdue. The deluge of telemarketing sales \ncalls is the number one consumer complaint in this country. It is a \nproblem that has gotten out of control. The average American receives \ntwo to three telemarketing calls per day. I often receive even more \nthan that. Some estimate that the telemarketing industry is able to \nmake 560 calls per second or roughly 24 million calls per day. No \nwonder people feel like they are under siege in their own home. \nTherefore, we in Congress acted to ensure that the FTC's ``do not \ncall'' list became a reality. Should we need to do more to overcome a \ncourt's objections, we can and shall do it.\n  Given the enormous response of nearly 50 million Americans who have \nsigned up in less than 3 months, the ``do not call'' list is clearly \nneeded.

I urge quick passage of \nthis legislation, so that the ``do not call'' list can start up as \nscheduled on October 1, 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11903-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 3087, the \nSurface Transportation Extension Act of 2003. This bill, which was \ncrafted in a bi-partisan, bicameral fashion will extend the Federal \ntransportation programs for an additional 5 months to February 29, \n2004.\n  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century expires on \nSeptember 30 of this year. Legislation is necessary to carry on the \nessential functions of the highway, highway safety, motor carrier \nsafety, transit and other programs that are recipients of highway trust \nfund money. This bill accomplishes just that. It funds the programs at \nfive-twelfths of the fiscal year 2004 budget conference report level.\n  H.R. 3087 is a clean reauthorization of these programs. This bill \ncontains no new projects and no new programmatic changes. It simply \nextends TEA-21 and current provisions of transportation law. As the \nchairman of the Banking Committee whose jurisdiction includes the \nreauthorization of the transit title of TEA-21, I was hopeful that, \nworking with the chairman of the relevant committee, we would have \nachieved passage of a multiyear bill. As funding levels and an \nappropriate source for those funds have yet to be identified, that \nproved to be impossible.\n  While I am not overly confident that 5 months of negotiating will \nresolve this problem, I support this piece of legislation. I believe it \nis essential that we continue to authorize our Nation's highway and \ntransit infrastructure. I think this necessary stop-gap measure is the \nway to achieve that. I recommend the bill to my colleagues and ask for \ntheir support.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11904-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11904]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  HONORING JUDY HADLEY OF LINCOLN, RI\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues a story demonstrating one person's ability to protect the \nenvironment from the threat of pollution, for the benefit of wildlife \nand human enjoyment, alike.\n  Thirty years after the passage of the Clean Water act, the Blackstone \nriver has shaken off a legacy of neglect and re-emerged as a vital \ncommunity asset. The water quality has improved, a bikeway is under \nconstruction, and mill buildings are being restored as apartments and \ncondominiums. The National Park Service is promoting a new appreciation \nfor the work and culture of the families who have made the Blackstone \nValley their home. And just last week, I joined the Army Corps of \nEngineers in celebrating the restoration of wetlands in a floodplain \nthat had been paved over for 50 years. So there is a great deal of \nactivity on the banks of the Blackstone.\n  While the federal government has been a major player in the river's \nrebirth, none of these exciting developments would have been possible \nwithout the personal commitment of Blackstone Valley residents. It is \ntheir hard work and, more importantly, their heightened vigilance and \nrenewed sense of ownership of the river, that have helped it to thrive.\n  Once such resident is Judy Hadley of Lincoln, RI--a town of about \n21,000 people, located on the Blackstone River. As the chair of the \nLincoln Land Trust, Judy is a staunch defender of her town's remaining \nopen spaces and a passionate advocate on behalf of the Blackstone. She \nis active a number of other local organizations, including the Friends \nof the Blackstone River, the Blackstone River Watershed Council, and \nthe Lincoln Tree and trail Commission. She has organized river cleanups \nand educated her fellow residents about the impact that stormwater has \non the Blackstone and its wildlife population.\n  For many years, a 60-ton excavator sat abandoned on a manmade island \nin the river--a relic of an old gravel mining operation. It was an \neyesore and a potential environment hazard. Two years ago, Judy Hadley \nwent to work: canvassing State and Federal authorities, trying to find \nthe best solution for this problem. No agency seemed to have the right \nequipment or the resources to handle such an unusual request, but Judy \npersisted. If she could have dismantled it herself and taken it away \npiece by piece, I think she would have.\n  Fortunately, Mr. President, it did not come to that. Last year, the \nRhode Island Department of Environmental Management removed more than \n300 gallons of diesel fuel and other fluids from the machinery. The \nexcavator itself was finally taken away this summer by the Army Corps \nvia a temporary land bridge, as part of the wetland restoration project \nthat I mentioned earlier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11904-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11904-S11905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN TRIBUTE TO JOHN CARL WEST\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, John Carl West was the smartest \nin our class of 1942 at The Citadel. I will never forget in the \npolitical science course COL Carl Coleman would pass around Time \nmagazine's current accounts test. John was the only one who knew all \nthe answers each time and he was long on common sense to go along with \nhis brilliance.\n  At a later time I want to detail his contributions to our State and \nNation, but the article in The State newspaper in Columbia, SC, \nappearing on September 21, has a pretty good summary of it. I that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                    [From the State, Sept. 21, 2003]\n\n                         Way Ahead of His Time\n\n                        (By Aaron Gould Sheinin)\n\n       Hilton Head Island.--At 81, former Gov. John West is no \n     lion in winter, no aged warrior. He is, as he's always been, \n     a dove.\n       Battling cancer, West goes to his Hilton Head Island law \n     office each morning. He still wears a tie and his trademark \n     horn-rimmed glasses.\n       Nearly 33 years after South Carolinians answered his \n     campaign call to ``elect a good man governor,'' several \n     projects are under way to ensure that West's legacy endures. \n     That legacy will center on his progressive stands on race.\n       ``My whole ambition and my whole thrust was to first get \n     the state's racial relationship in better order,'' West says \n     from his law office conference room, an expanse of salt-water \n     marsh visible beyond a wall of windows.\n       A biography is in the works, and, at USC, an oral history \n     and archive are complete. Also, a new program, called the \n     West Forum, will perpetuate the Kershaw County native's \n     interest in state government and policy.\n       As state senator, lieutenant governor and governor, West \n     was out front on improving race relations when doing so meant \n     you and your family got death threats from the Ku Klux Klan \n     leader who lived less than a mile from your home. He also was \n     out front on race relations in South Carolina when that meant \n     you did not win elections.\n       And yet West did.\n       West, who once carried a pistol for protection, helped \n     carry the state out of segregation. He created the state \n     Human Affairs Commission and appointed Jim Clyburn to be the \n     first black senior gubernatorial aide. He fought for better \n     health care for all, for increasing teacher pay and \n     stabilizing the education system.\n       West vetoed a capital punishment bill because, he said \n     then, ``I do not believe man has the right to take a life \n     that only God can create.'' For a state still escaping the \n     scourge of lynchings, West's actions spoke volumes to blacks, \n     African-American leaders say. The Legislature, however, \n     overrode the veto.\n       Later, West was U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia under \n     President Jimmy Carter, choosing the posting over more \n     pleasant locales.\n\n\n                    saw enormous potential in blacks\n\n       Now, West has a new fight, against cancer. Kind and polite, \n     he declines to talk about his illness. But he's being treated \n     at MUSC in Charleston, where, he says, the Hollings Oncology \n     Center is a terrific asset for the state.\n       A self-described ``old politician,'' West is pleased to \n     remember the days when his beliefs were considered shocking \n     by some. ``In the election of 1970, I probably wouldn't have \n     been elected without the black vote,'' West says. ``The fact \n     that we had relegated a large percentage of our people to \n     service jobs, to limited education, limited opportunity, was \n     just not smart. I felt that if we could unleash that \n     potential, it would be a great boon for South Carolina. I \n     like to think I was right about that.''\n       For today's Democratic candidates, attracting the black \n     vote is necessity and norm. In West's heyday, it was ``almost \n     revolutionary,'' he says.\n       Former President Carter and West became friends when both \n     were governors, Carter in Georgia. Carter calls West a \n     trailblazer in race relations. ``He was and has always \n     remained way ahead of his time, not only in race relations, \n     but also in a deep commitment to make sure that every citizen \n     of South Carolina was given an opportunity for good education \n     and health care,'' Carter says. ``His heart was in the right \n     place and still is.''\n\n\n                   west ``believed strongly in good''\n\n       In his 1971 inaugural address, West said South Carolina \n     must ``in the next four years eliminate from our Government \n     any vestige of discrimination.'' Sitting in the crowd at the \n     State House was newly minted state Rep. I.S. Leevy Johnson of \n     Columbia, one of three African Americans elected that \n     November to the House, the first blacks to serve since \n     Reconstruction. West ``changed the course of South Carolina \n     history'' when it came to relations between blacks and \n     whites, Johnson says. ``People recognized him as a person who \n     believed strongly in good.''\n       Clyburn believes he should have been in the crowd that day, \n     too, as the fourth black House member. But the future \n     congressman went to bed on election night believing he had \n     won by 5,000 votes, only to wake up the next morning and be \n     told that a counting error had been discovered. He'd lost by \n     5,000 votes.\n       When West asked him a week after the election to come to \n     Columbia and work for him, Clyburn was reluctant. ``I told \n     him,'' Clyburn remembers, ``that I didn't think it would be a \n     good fit. I thought my politics and his may not have been \n     suited for each other.'' But West ``looked at me and said \n     something I've never forgotten. He said, `If I had your \n     talent and I was black, I'd be more militant than you are.' \n     And so I went to work for him.''\n       After two years on the governor's senior staff, West \n     appointed Clyburn to lead the Human Affairs Commission, the \n     first state agency charged with fighting discrimination in \n     employment, housing and public accommodations. Twenty years \n     later, Clyburn became the state's first black congressman \n     since Reconstruction.\n\n\n                  ``JUST A SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG''\n\n       Through the turbulent 1950s, '60s and early '70s, West was \n     the rare politician for whom race had not been anathema. ``I \n     had worked with blacks all my life,'' West says. ``I had \n     plowed fields with them, went through the Depression with \n     them. I had no hatred of blacks. I guess it was just a sense \n     of right and wrong.''\n       It was that sense that led him to cross paths with the \n     Klan. In the 1950s, when West was in the Senate, the doomed \n     segregationist mantra of ``separate but equal'' was still the \n     law in South Carolina.\n       The band at the white high school in Camden was \n     accomplished and decorated. The\n\n[[Page S11905]]\n\n     band at the nearby black high school was not. So the white \n     band teacher offered to help the black band improve. He was \n     beaten nearly to death by the Klan, West says. When the \n     Kershaw County sheriff didn't seem too concerned, West \n     approached J.P. ``Pete'' Strom, legendary director of the \n     State Law Enforcement Division.\n       Strom's agents bugged a Klan hideout and within a week had \n     made arrests. When a grand jury refused to indict the Klan \n     leaders, West eventually worked against the Klan in a related \n     civil suit. ``The Ku Klux Klan threatened my life, ran my \n     wife off the road,'' West said. ``There were some questions \n     there for a while of who was going to win, between me and the \n     Klan.''\n       West's wife, Lois, also was not one to be intimidated. \n     ``She was known as a crack shot,'' West says, emotion choking \n     his words as he remembers his wife's brave actions at the \n     time. ``She sent word to the grand dragon that if anything \n     happened to me, don't worry about the grand jury--she was \n     going to kill him.''\n\n\n                      helped ease racial tensions\n\n       In 1966, West was elected lieutenant governor.\n       In 1970, he ran for governor against Albert Watson, the \n     state's first Republican congressman since Reconstruction. \n     Watson had the backing of two top Republicans--U.S. Sen. \n     Strom Thurmond and President Richard Nixon, who ``campaigned \n     harder for my opponent than my opponent did,'' West says.\n       Watson spoke against forced integration of schools. Days \n     before the vote, he rallied a group in Darlington County \n     upset over court-ordered busing. Soon after, a group of \n     whites overturned two buses of black children in what became \n     known as the Lamar riot. Several children were injured and \n     more than two dozen arrests were made.\n       In the 1970 election, West won nearly 54 percent of the \n     vote as African-Americans went to the polls in record \n     numbers. Just days later, Thurmond hired Tom Moss, the first \n     black aide to work for a Southern U.S. senator. The \n     segregationist Thurmond began his conversion then into a \n     racial moderate, West says, and ``saw the light with that \n     election.''\n       One biographer wrote ``when John West entered office, \n     racial tensions had never been higher. By the end of his \n     term, relations between blacks and whites had never been \n     better.''\n\n\n                           IT'S A PEOPLE GAME\n\n       About the time West was leaving office in 1975, Carter was \n     running for president. ``There were 49 other governors,'' \n     Carter says, ``and John West was my favorite of all.''\n       Carter thought so highly of West that he offered him an \n     ambassadorship. He was told to pick a country where ``the \n     living was nice,'' West remembers. Instead, he chose Saudi \n     Arabia. The Middle East was just three years removed from the \n     bloody war between Israel and its Arab neighbors. West wanted \n     to be of use.\n       ``People ask me how did I get along as well as I seemed \n     to'' in Saudi Arabia, West says. ``I told them that the \n     Saudis' religion was different, government was different, \n     language, of course, was different.\n       ``Politics was amazingly like South Carolina. It's a people \n     game.'' Whatever it was, Carter says, West had it down. \n     ``That was the most challenging place in the world then,'' \n     says Carter, who negotiated peace between Israel and Egypt. \n     ``The Saudis were a great potential problem for us,'' he \n     says, ``but because of John's unprecedented good relations \n     with the Saudi leaders, it was not.''\n\n\n                          A GOOD MAN GOVERNOR\n\n       When West was still on the 1970 gubernational campaign \n     trail, one of his closest advisers was Crawford Cook, a local \n     Democratic activist still on the state's political scene. \n     They needed a slogan, Cook remembers.\n       They tried several.\n       Then someone suggested ``probably the most appropriate \n     slogan we ever put together,'' Cook said: ``Elect a Good Man \n     Governor.'' Former Gov. Dick Riley, a West friend and \n     supporter, says history books undoubtedly will say South \n     Carolina did just that in 1970.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11905-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING DR.

This is the fifth time I \nstand to do so, and on each occasion I am reminded of the remarkable \ncharacter and quality of this generation of Americans; I would hope \nthat their supreme sacrifice is noticed and remembered by their fellow \ncitizens. But all too often the din of daily life in the 21st century \nthreatens to drown out the news of the steady stream of allied \ncasualties in Iraq. It is our duty to make sure that the rolls of the \ndead and wounded are read aloud: read, heard, and honored.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I wish today to fulfill a sacred \nobligation, and to honor United States Army Sergeant David Travis \nFriedrich, of the 325th Military Intelligence Battalion out of \nWaterbury, CT.\n  Sergeant Friedrich was killed when mortar fire struck the base he was \nstationed at near the Abu Ghraid prison to the west of Baghdad. He died \na true soldier; he died at his post.\n  Sergeant Friedrich was raised in upstate New York, he attended \nBrockport State University, and he was accepted into the forensics \nstudies program at the University of New Haven in the Spring 2000. But \nwhile the Sergeant was a New Yorker by birth, his studies and work in \nConnecticut and his role in a Connecticut Battalion, the 325th to be \nprecise, makes him an honorary son of our State.\n  It is a sad thing indeed for parents to bury their child, and I \nimagine that few words of solace spoken in this Chamber by the \nrepresentatives of New York and Connecticut will penetrate the shroud \nof grief that must surround the Sergeant's family. With that in mind, \nhowever, I say this: know that as you grieve, a grateful Nation grieves \nwith you.

Karlene saw a need in her community and started Lakota \nExpress, Inc., the only direct marketing and telemarketing company in \nthe United States that is Indian-owned and operated. Lakota Express, \nInc., employs trained professionals that have exceptional marketing \nskills. Because the company has provided telemarketing and direct \nmailing services for various organizations, it has an impressive track \nrecord of success.\n  Lakota Express, Inc., has become a valued member of the Pine Ridge \ncommunity and is truly a South Dakota success story. For the past 5 \nyears, Karlene has worked as CEO of Lakota Express, and has followed \nher dream of building a small business run out of her basement into the \ncompany that has raised $10 million to fund the Oglala Lakota College's \nfirst public library, as well as 10 college centers across the Pine \nRidge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Karlene and Lakota Express \nhave also worked to build the first independent Indian-owned public \nradio station.\n  Lakota Express' mission is to operate a business that creates \neconomic opportunities for the Lakota Nation and participates in \nsocial, educational, and political issues that empower the people and \nprotect the earth.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Epsilon \nChapter of Zeta Tau Alpha Fraternity at the University of Arkansas at \nFayetteville. Zeta Tau Alpha Fraternity was founded on October 15, \n1898, by nine women at the State Female Normal School in Farmville, VA. \nThe Epsilon Chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha, founded on December 18, 1903, at \nthe University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, will celebrate 100 years of \nsisterhood from September 26-28 on the campus of the University of \nArkansas at Fayetteville. The Centennial Celebration is expected to \nbring many Epsilon alumnae back to the campus, including Amber Elbert, \na member of my staff and 1998 Epsilon initiate.\n  The Epsilon Chapter is unique in many ways. It is the first chapter \nin Zeta Tau Alpha history to reach a centennial mark and the first \nchapter founded west of the Mississippi River. Epsilon was also the \nvery first chapter to be announced through the fraternity's official \nmagazine, ``Themis.'' The first pictures ever used in ``Themis'' were \nthose of Epsilon, its chapter room and the University of Arkansas. The \nUniversity of Arkansas students who founded the chapter in 1903 were \nElizabeth Kell Rose, Hattie Williams, Margaret Hutcherson, Grace \nJordan, Bess Byrnes, Della McMillan and Mabel Sutton.\n  The mission of Zeta Tau Alpha is to make a difference in the lives of \nits membership by developing the potential of each individual through \nvisionary programming, which emphasizes leadership development, service \nto others, academic success and continued personal growth for women \nwith a commitment to friendship and the future based on the values and \ntraditions of our past. Having been actively involved with Chi Omega \nFraternity as both a collegiate member and an alumna, I have witnessed \nfirsthand the lifelong benefit that can come from membership in a Greek \norganization, such as Zeta Tau Alpha.\n  On behalf of all Arkansans, I would like to extend congratulations to \nthe Epsilon Chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha Fraternity for 100 years of \nexcellence and enriching the lives of its members from Arkansas and \nacross the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11906-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMENDING WORK TO AID VICTIMS OF TORTURE\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the \nimportant work that is being done to aid victims of torture, in \nparticular the work of the International Rehabilitation Council for \nTorture Victims, IRCT. IRCT will be honored in a ceremony today, in New \nYork City, where the Dalai Lama will present them with the Conrad N. \nHilton Humanitarian Prize.\n  Torture is a sophisticated form of social and political control \ndesigned to stifle dissent through terror. It violates the basic rights \nof human beings and is contrary to the principles of the U.S. \nConstitution and the fundamental nature of our republic.\n  Freedom from torture is a universal and fundamental human right. Yet \ntorture continues to take place in more than 120 countries. It is \nestimated that one-third of the world's 12 million refugees are victims \nof torture. Politicians, journalists, teachers, students, religious \nleaders, trade union and human rights activists are all targets. The \naim of torture is not to kill the victim, but to break down the \nvictim's personality. Crippled, traumatized, and humiliated, the \nvictims are returned to their communities as a warning to others.\n  That are an estimated 500,000 torture survivors in the United States \nalone--refugees and asylum-seekers who have fled repressive regimes. \nAnd in recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number \nof victims of torture seeking help at U.S. rehabilitation centers.\n  The IRCT has been a vital part of the global effort to aid torture \nvictims. The Council began with a group of four doctors in Denmark who \nresponded to a call by Amnesty International in 1973 to help diagnose \ntorture victims. Today the IRCT is a global network of 200 \nrehabilitation centers operating in 80 countries to meet the needs of \nsome 100,000 victims of torture each year. IRCT's mission is to support \nand promote the rehabilitation of victims of torture, to advocate for \nthe prevention and eradication of torture worldwide, and to provide \ndocumentation and research that will ultimately bring perpetrators to \njustice.\n  Minnesota is home to the Center for Victims of Torture, CVT, the \nfirst comprehensive torture treatment center in this country--and third \nsuch facility in the world. The CVT helped establish National \nConsortium of Torture Treatment Programs, under which the 34 torture \nrehabilitation centers and programs in the United States operate. As \nmayor of St. Paul I worked together with the CVT to build a torture \ntreatment center on the east side of the metro area.\n  The work of IRCT and the U.S. torture treatment programs is all the \nmore relevant given pending legislation. I am proud to be the chief \nSenate author of the Torture Victims Relief Act, TVRA, of 2003, which \nwill enable the U.S. to continue its leadership in caring for victims \nof torture. This reauthorization of the TVRA is included as an \namendment to the fiscal year 2004 Foreign Relations authorization bill, \nand I look forward to the passage of this bill.\n  Once again, I commend the IRCT for their tireless work on behalf of \ntorture victims in the U.S. and around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11906-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11906-S11907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL JOHN TOTUSHEK\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate VADM \nJohn B. Totushek upon the completion of his career of service in the \nUnited States Navy and Naval Reserve. Throughout his 36-year military \ncareer, Vice Admiral Totushek served with distinction and dedication, \nultimately becoming the first Naval Reservist Commander of the Naval \nReserve Force to wear three stars, achieving the rank of Vice Admiral.\n  Vice Admiral John B. Totushek is native of Minneapolis, MN. A 1966 \ngraduate of the University of Minnesota, he\n\n[[Page S11907]]\n\nearned his commission through a Navy ROTC scholarship and was \ndesignated a pilot upon completion of flight training in June 1968.\n  Vice Admiral Totushek began his Naval Aviation career in 1969 flying \nthe F-4 Phantom with Fighter Squadron 41 based at Naval Air Station \nOceana, VA. He continued his career as an F-4 instructor pilot and \nLanding Signal Officer with Fighter Squadron 101, also based at Naval \nAir Station Oceana. In November 1973, he resigned his regular \ncommission and accepted a commission in the Naval Reserve. During the \nnext 24 years, Vice Admiral Totushek served in numerous capacities with \nthe Naval Reserve and several civilian companies.\n  As a Reservist, he served as commanding officer of three Virginia-\nbased air-combat training squadrons, including Squadron Reinforcement \nUnit VC-1006, Squadron Reinforcement Unit VC-686, and Fighter Composite \nSquadron VC-12. He served as commanding officer of several Atlantic \nFleet air support commands, including Naval Air Atlantic 1086 and Naval \nAir Forces Eastern Atlantic.\n  As his Reserve career advanced, he served in several senior strategic \nand management positions within the Navy, including command of the \nAtlantic Fleet's Logistics Task Force and the Naval Reserve Readiness \nCommand Region Eight. Upon successful completion of these command \ntours, he served on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations as the \nDeputy Director for Naval Air Warfare, Reserve Programs,\n  In early 1997, Vice Admiral Totushek was asked to return to active \nduty to lead the Navy's environmental, safety and occupational health \nprograms. He then was selected as Commander, Naval Reserve Force on \nOctober 17, 1998. His duties include command of 88,000 Naval Reservists \nand 181 nationwide Reserve facilities. Vice Admiral Totushek also \nrepresents the Naval Reserve before Congress as Chief of Naval Reserve, \nand on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations as Director, Naval \nReserve. He was promoted to vice admiral on 24 May 2001, becoming the \nfirst Naval Reservist three-star admiral in history to lead the Naval \nReserve.\n  During his tenure, Naval Reserve Forces were mobilized three times: \nthe Kosovo Campaign in 1999, Operation Noble Eagle in 2001 and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. Under his leadership, Naval Reservists \nserved with great honor, dedication and sacrifice during the global war \non terrorism, in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, and here at home as \npart of the homeland defense network.\n  His family and fellow shipmates can be proud of his service. Vice \nAdmiral Totushek, his wife Jan, and children Courtney and Chris have \nmade many sacrifices during his Naval and civilian careers, and we \nappreciate their contributions of conscientious service to our country. \nAs he departs the Pentagon to start his third career, I call upon my \ncolleagues to wish John and his family every success, and the \ntraditional Navy ``fair winds and following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11907-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE DEATH OF MORRIS ``MOE'' BILLER\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it saddens me to note the recent \npassing of an old friend, Moe Biller. Moe was, until 2001, the long-\ntime president of the American Postal Workers Union, and a tireless \nadvocate for the postal employees he worked with and represented.\n  I met Moe through my first Senate chief of staff, Michael Lewan, who \nwas a long-time friend of Moe's from his days as a local union official \nin New York. Michael invited him to attend my Senate swearing-in \nceremony, and we hit it off immediately.\n  Moe was one of a kind--some would say the last of the breed of old \ntime labor leaders. He was passionate about the causes he believed in, \nbut always remained just a ``regular guy.'' It's fair to say that Moe \nwas a pioneer who created the modern labor movement for Federal and \npostal employees. Surely he paved the way for the establishment of \nthose employees' rights--postal workers, in particular, had little \nclout until Moe came along.\n  He began his career as a substitute postal clerk in 1937 on \nManhattan's Lower East Side, earning 65 cents an hour with no vacation \nbenefits or sick pay. His success in negotiating a sick leave benefit \nfor his fellow workers led to the beginning of his rise through the \nranks of the union hierarchy, which culminated in his election as \nPresident of the national union in 1980.\n  However, his national reputation as a fiery, but effective, leader \nwas solidified a decade earlier in 1970, when his efforts encouraged \nCongress to pass the landmark legislation that created today's United \nStates Postal Service, the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. Among the \nimportant changes instituted by this law was the right postal workers \nreceived to engage in collective bargaining over pay, benefits, and \nworking conditions.\n  In addition to his vital work to improve wages and working conditions \nfor postal workers, Moe was an active supporter of civil rights and \nwomen's rights. He also gave generously of his time, serving on \nnumerous trade, charitable, and civic organization boards, including \nthe Muscular Dystrophy Association and the United Way International.\n  Moe will be sorely missed by all of those who knew him, but I know \nthat his achievements and his work will live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11907-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11907-S11909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                75TH ANNIVERSARY OF MOTOROLA'S FOUNDING\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \n75th anniversary of the founding of Motorola, Inc., which has been a \nsignificant icon in the history of America's heritage of innovation, \nwhile continually finding new ways to make things simpler, smarter, \nsafer, synchronized, and fun.\n  On September 25, 1928, Paul V. Galvin and his brother, Joseph E. \nGalvin, opened the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation at 847 West \nHarrison Street, in Chicago, Illinois, with assets of $1,315. Galvin \nManufacturing Corporation entered the electronics industry as a \nmanufacturer of household battery eliminators and grew steadily \nthroughout the 1930s and 1940s, introducing a wide variety of devices \nto the electronics market.\n  In 1930, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation introduced the first \npractical, affordable and commercially successful car radio, and \nfounder Paul V. Galvin created the brand name ``Motorola,'' linking the \nideas of ``motion'' and ``sound.'' In 1936, the Police Cruiser radio \nreceiver was Galvin Manufacturing Corporation's first entry into the \nnew field of mobile radio communications, and in 1937, Galvin \nManufacturing Corporation entered the home entertainment business with \na line of phonographs and table and console radios.\n  Galvin Manufacturing Corporation also made significant contributions \nto our Nation's efforts during World War II. In 1940, Galvin \nManufacturing Corporation developed the Handie-Talkie SCR536 radio, a \nhandheld two-way radio, and provided more than 100,000 units of this \ncrucial communications tool to the Allied Forces. In 1941, company \nfounder Paul V. Galvin was elected president of the Radio Manufacturers \nAssociation, where he helped lead the radio industry's war efforts in \nthe United States. Also in 1941, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation \nintroduced its first commercial line of FM two-way radio systems and \nequipment, installing its first FM system in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania. In 1942, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation helped organize \nand lead the procurement and production of quartz radio crystals, \neventually subcontracting production to more than 50 crystal \nmanufacturers who, with Galvin Manufacturing Corporation, supplied more \nthan 35 million radio crystals to the U.S. War Department during World \nWar II. Later in 1942, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation received the \nfirst of five U.S. Army-Navy ``E'' Awards for excellence in production \nachievements during World War II, the first ever awarded to a radio \nmanufacturer.\n  In 1943, Galvin Manufacturing offered its first sale of public stock, \nand in 1947, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation changed its name to \nMotorola, Inc. Motorola continued to be an innovator, by introducing \ntechnologies which have significantly impacted Americans' lives. In \n1947, Motorola's first television, the Golden View model VT71, was \npriced to sell for under $200 and was so well-received that 100,000\n\n[[Page S11908]]\n\nmore units were sold in one year. In 1949, Motorola established a \nresearch and development operation in Phoenix, Arizona, to investigate \nthe new field of solid-state technology, and by anticipating the \nenormous potential of the transistor, helped create the semiconductor \nindustry and became one of the world's largest semiconductor \nmanufacturers. In 1955, Motorola's new Handie-Talkie radio pocket pager \nselectively delivered a radio message to a particular individual, and \npagers began to replace public announcement systems in hospitals and \nfactories.\n  In 1956, Robert W. Galvin, Paul V. Galvin's son, became president of \nMotorola, Inc., serving the company devotedly, until his 2001 \nretirement. Robert W. Galvin currently serves Motorola as Chairman \nEmeritus.\n  Following the 1958 introduction of Explorer I, a 31-pound, Earth-\norbiting satellite, Motorola provided radio equipment for most manned \nand unmanned U.S. space flights for the next 40 years. Also in 1958, \nMotorola introduced the Motrac radio, the first vehicular two-way radio \nto have a fully transistorized power supply and receiver, with such low \npower consumption that the radio could be used without running an \nautomobile engine.\n  In 1961, Motorola developed low-cost techniques to produce silicon \nrectifiers used in automotive alternators, making the alternator an \neconomical replacement for the less durable generator. In 1962, \nMotorola introduced the fully-transistorized Handie-Talkie HT200 \nportable two-way radio. In 1969, Astronaut Neil Armstrong's first words \nspoken from the moon were relayed to Earth by a Motorola radio \ntransponder aboard the Apollo 11 lunar module.\n  In 1971, NASA's lunar roving vehicle used a Motorola FM radio \nreceiver to provide a voice link over the 240,000 miles (386,000 km) \nbetween Earth and the moon, earning Motorola the credit for ``the first \ncar radio on the moon.'' In 1974, Motorola's first microprocessor, the \nMC6800, contained 4,000 transistors and was used in automotive, \ncomputing and video game applications. In 1975, Motorola transponders \nwere used aboard the historic Apollo-Soyuz ``Handshake in Space'' \ndocking mission. In 1978, Motorola introduced its first computer-\ncontrolled radio systems and equipment using trunking technology to \nhelp radio operators use crowded radio frequencies more efficiently. \nAlso in 1978, Dr. Daniel E. Noble, Motorola director emeritus and \nformer chief scientist, was awarded the Edison Medal by the Institute \nof Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which provided recognition \nfrom his peers for his role as a founder of the modern land mobile \nradio and semiconductor industries.\n  In 1980, Motorola was one of the first to develop computerized, \nelectronic engine control modules that reduced fuel consumption and \nemissions. In 1983, the world's first commercial handheld cellular \nphone, the Motorola DynaTAC phone, received approval from the U.S. \nFederal Communications Commission, culminating a 15-year, $100 million \ninvestment in the development of cellular technology. In 1984, Motorola \ndeveloped the MC68HC11 8-bit embedded controller for use in everyday \nconsumer, automotive and industrial products. In 1986, the historic \nVoyager airplane, the first aircraft to make a nonstop, non-refueled \nflight around the world, used a Motorola satellite radio. In 1987, \nMotorola initiated its Six Sigma Quality Initiative, which launched a \nglobal pursuit of manufacturing and other process-oriented quality \ninitiatives and established Motorola as a role model for global \ncorporations. In 1988, Motorola was a winner of the first Malcolm \nBaldrige National Quality Award, established by the U.S. Congress to \nrecognize and inspire the pursuit of quality in American business. In \n1989, Motorola introduced the MicroTAC personal cellular telephone, \nwhich was the smallest and lightest cellular phone on the market.\n\n  In 1990, General Instrument Corporation was the first to propose an \nall-digital high-definition television (HDTV) technical standard. In \n1991, Robert W. Galvin, former Motorola chairman and CEO, was awarded \nthe National Medal of Technology by President George Bush, the highest \nhonor bestowed by the President of the United States for technological \nachievement, ``for advancement of the American electronics industry \nthrough continuous technological innovation, establishing Motorola as a \nworld-class electronics manufacturer.'' In 1992, Motorola opened its \nfirst of more than 20 software centers. In 1995, Motorola developed the \nDragonBall MC68328 microprocessor that became widely used in consumer \nelectronics applications, including handheld video games and personal \ndigital assistants. In 1996, Motorola's 3.1-ounce (88 grams), StarTAC \nwearable cellular telephone was the world's smallest and lightest. Also \nin 1996, Motorola received the Albert F. Gore LifePage Achievement \nAward for donating 10,000 numeric pagers to patients waiting for organ \ntransplants. Also in 1996, Motorola created the PageWriter pager, the \nworld's first full-text two-way pager, which was selected for the \npermanent collections of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American \nHistory. Also in 1996, Christopher B. Galvin, grandson of Motorola \nfounder Paul V. Galvin, was elected chief executive officer of \nMotorola, in 1996, assuming his responsibilities in 1997. In 1998, \nMotorola telematics automotive technologies provided vehicle occupants \nwith location-specific security, information and entertainment \nservices. Also in 1998, Motorola introduced the iDEN i1000 portable \nradio handset that combined two-way radio, telephone, text messaging \nand data transmission in a single unit.\n  In 2000, Motorola and General Instrument Corporation merged their \nbusinesses; the largest acquisition in Motorola's history. Also in \n2000, Motorola implemented the world's first commercial General Packet \nRadio Service (GPRS) cellular systems in the United Kingdom and \nGermany, providing always-on access to the Internet. Also in 2000, \nMotorola conducted the world's first 700MHz wideband high-speed data \ntrial with public safety users, enabling advanced mission-critical \nsolutions.\n  In 2001, Motorola introduced the i.250 wireless chipset for GSM/GPRS \n(Global System for Mobile Communications/General Packet Radio Service) \ncellular handset manufacturers. Also in 2001, Motorola's Project 25 and \nTETRA-compliant IP-based wireless communications systems were designed \nto enable public safety and first response users to transfer pictures, \nfingerprints, video and Internet-based data using two-way radios. Also \nin 2001, Motorola introduced its first metal mobile phone, the V60 \nphone, which a year later became available in all three cellular \ntechnologies--GSM, TDMA and CDMA--and quickly became a worldwide best \nseller. Also in 2001, Motorola's Broadband Communications Sector \nreceived an Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and \nSciences (NATAS) for outstanding achievement in the development of \nconsumer digital set-top boxes, marking Motorola's seventh Emmy win.\n  In 2002, Motorola launched its first 3G nationwide voice and data \nnetwork using Code Division Multiple Access 1X (CDMA 1X) technology \nwith KDDI, one of Japan's largest wireless operators, enabling Internet \naccess at speeds more than double that of existing networks. Also in \n2002, the Motorola Instant GPS chip was the first single-chip Global \nPositioning System receiver solution, a breakthrough technology that \nenabled designers to add accurate location sensing features to portable \nconsumer electronics products. Also in 2002, Motorola's Commercial, \nGovernment and Industrial Solutions Sector was honored with the Malcolm \nBaldrige National Quality Award. In 2002, Motorola had achieved $27.3 \nbillion dollars in sales. On July 30, 2003, Motorola declared its 226th \nconsecutive quarterly dividend.\n  Since 1974, Motorola has received more than 90 awards for workplace \nhealth and safety, community service and environmental stewardship from \nthe United States Government and governments and non-government \norganizations worldwide. Motorola is today a global leader in wireless, \nautomotive and broadband communications. Motorola is also a global \ncorporate citizen dedicated to ethical business practices and \npioneering important technologies that make things smarter and life \nbetter, honored traditions that began when the company was founded 75 \nyears ago.\n  I would like to applaud the great impact that Motorola has had on the \nbusiness, social, and cultural landscape for Americans and, indeed, \ncitizens of all nations by virtue of its achievements throughout its \nremarkable 75-\n\n[[Page S11909]]\n\nyear tradition of delivering on the power of technology to improve the \nway we live. I would like to recognize that Motorola's essence as an \nAmerican icon has been and continues to be to link people's dreams with \ntechnology's promise.\n  I congratulate Motorola on finding new ways to make things simpler, \nsmarter, safer, synchronized and fun for people around the world. I \nrecognize that Motorola continues to demonstrate technological \nleadership, the highest standards of corporate responsibility and \nrespect for the individual, all while continuing to lead the nation and \nthe world into our technological future. I congratulate Motorola, on \nthe achievements of its employees, retirees, suppliers, and \ndistributors worldwide as they commemorate and celebrate the company's \n75th anniversary while the company looks to deliver an even greater \nimpact in the 21st century as a leading force in American technology \nsuperiority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11909-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n             THE IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today to congratulate the 17 \nrecipients of the Small Business Administration's Outstanding Women \nEntrepreneur Award.\n  These inventive and resourceful entrepreneurs are leaders in a \nnational community of women's businesses, which continue to outpace all \nother companies in overall growth--in number of firms, employment and \nsales. Women-owned firms are constantly breaking down the barriers of \nour past and proving that the business world is no longer a boys-only \nclub. As many in the small business community are aware, women-owned \ncompanies have become increasingly important to our Nation's jobs and \neconomy. Today there are over 10.1 million women-owned firms, employing \n18.2 million workers, and generating $2.32 trillion in sales.\n  With assistance from the SBA, these 17 women honored during last \nweek's Small Business Week have created businesses that serve as \nremarkable examples of successful entrepreneurship in a variety of \nindustries.\n  Patricia Miller, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, Rebecca Matthais, and Dr. \nTaryn Rose all started their own businesses in the fashion industry, \nrelying on the SBA for loans and counseling. Patricia and Barbara \ncreated Vera Bradley Designs, a company that produces a popular line of \nluggage and handbags. Rebecca's company, Mothers Work, is now one of \nthe leading providers of maternity clothes of women across the country. \nTaryn combined her medical knowledge as an orthopedic surgeon with her \nlove of fashion to create a footwear company that is projecting to \nreach over $20 million in sales this year.\n  The SBA has also helped several of these women break into male-\ndominated industries, like construction and defense. Donna Brinkmeyer-\nAsman of Clark Manufacturing, Lurita Doan of New Technology Management, \nand Carolyn Minerich of Carmin Industries have all created companies \nthat have grown to include major defense-industry clients. Tina Cordova \nlooked to the SBA's Small Business Development Center and SCORE \nprograms to help her company, Queston Construction, expand from 2 to 26 \nemployees.\n  Kathryn Freeland, Marilyn Melkonian, Patty DeDominici, Nikki Olyai, \nJeannette Lee White, and Julie Morgenstern all looked to the SBA to \nhelp them create their businesses. Now they are advising much larger \nbusinesses on potential employees, technology, and management issues.\n  These women and their employees are not only beneficiaries of their \ncompanies' successes. In addition to starting and growing successful \nbusinesses, these women have made significant contributions to their \ncommunities. Blue Crab Bay, started by award recipient Pamela Barefoot, \ncreates specialty food items for seafood lovers and uses its profits to \ngive back to the Chesapeake Bay community. The company has given back \nto its community through scholarships, charity events, and donations to \ngroups like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\n  I would also like to recognize the accomplishments of awardees \nHeather Howitt, Judy George, and Maria Welch. Heather, along with \ncofounders Tedde McMillen, Carla Powell, and Lori Woolfrey, recognized \na potential market for their traditional Chai drink, and now their \ncompany, Oregon Chai, sells its chai tea lattes at stores in all 50 \nStates. Maria's company, Respira Medical, is a leading respiratory and \ndurable home medical care equipment distributor in Maryland. Judy's \nDomain home furnishings company was recently featured on the popular \ntelevision makeover program ``Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.''\n  I commend these 17 women for their creativity in business, their \nleadership for women entrepreneurs, and their generous contributions to \ntheir local communities. As the number of women business owners \ncontinues to grow--currently the number of women-owned businesses is \ngrowing at double the rate of all U.S. firms--we must do everything we \ncan to ensure that these businesses have every opportunity to flourish. \nTo that end, we are working to pass the Small Business Administration \n50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003, legislation that will \nprotect the extremely effective and well-established Women's Business \nCenter network. With this bill we will also reestablish the Interagency \nCommittee on Women's Business Enterprise to give women in business a \ngreater voice in Federal policymaking. The 2003 SBA reauthorization \nlegislation also closes the loopholes in Federal procurement practice \nthat have allowed agencies to bundle contracts and limit Federal \ncontracting opportunities for small and women-owned businesses. In \naddition, this bill will strengthen all of the SBA's access to capital, \nentrepreneurial development, and contracting programs, including those \nthat helped bring success to the 17 recipients of the Outstanding Women \nEntrepreneur Award.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me and Senator Snowe in \nrecognizing the important contribution these women, and other women in \nbusiness across America, make to our Nation's economy by passing the \nSBA Reauthorization Act of 2003 and fully funding the SBA's \nprograms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/24/senate-section/article/S11909-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11909-S11910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 2658) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes.\n  The message further announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 111.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for direct access to audiologists for medicare beneficiaries, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwould give Medicare recipients the same hearing care options available \nto veterans and Senators. Specifically, it would give Medicare \nbeneficiaries direct access to qualified, licensed audiologists. I am \npleased to be joined in this effort by my colleague, Senator Tim \nJohnson.\n  Today, approximately 28 million Americans are hearing disabled. Many \nof them are older Americans--a statistic that is fast increasing with \nthe aging of the ``baby boomers.'' With 80 to 90 percent of hearing \nproblems not medically or surgically treatable, it seems only \nreasonable that Medicare patients be allowed to consult with an \naudiologist without first seeing another provider. It is part of \nregular audiological practice to refer patients for medical management \nwhen clinical indicators are present.\n  In the 1990's, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Office \nof Personnel Management changed their respective healthcare policies to \nallow for the option of direct access to a licensed audiologist. \nEarlier this year, I wrote the VA asking if veterans were satisfied \nwith that coverage for audiological services. According to the VA \nresponse, ``The policy has provided and continues to provide high \nquality, cost effective, and successful hearing health care to \nveterans.'' It is important to point out that this bill would not \ndiminish the important role of medical doctors, or expand the scope of \npractice for audiology.\n  This legislation is consumer friendly. It will help our elderly and \nrural citizens who often find it difficult to access health care \nservices. It will provide consistency of policy among Government \nagencies. That is why I urge my colleagues to act quickly on this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hearing Health Accessibility \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DIRECT ACCESS TO QUALIFIED AUDIOLOGISTS FOR MEDICARE \n                   BENEFICIARIES.\n\n       Section 1861(ll)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395x(ll)(2)) is amended by inserting before the period at \n     the end the following: ``, without regard to any requirement \n     that the individual receiving the audiology services be under \n     the care of (or referred by) a physician or other health care \n     practitioner or that such services are provided under the \n     supervision of a physician or other health care \n     practitioner''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

CONSTRUCTION; EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed \n     to expand the scope of audiology services for which payment \n     may be made under title XVIII of the Social Security Act as \n     of December 31, 2003.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act shall \n     take effect with respect to services furnished on or after \n     January 1, 2004.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am happy to join my colleague, \nSenator Campbell, in introducing legislation that will provide millions \nof seniors with direct access to important audiology services through \nthe Medicare Program.\n  Approximately 28 million people in the U.S. have some degree of \nreduced hearing sensitivity, and of this number, 80 percent have \nirreversible hearing loss. The majority of these individuals are 65 and \nolder, and as the baby boom generation ages, this number will \nskyrocket. Hearing loss is the 3rd most prevalent chronic condition in \nthe older population. One in three people older than 60 and half of \nthose older than 85 have a hearing loss problem and only about one-\nfourth of those who could benefit from a hearing aid actually use one.\n  Hearing problems can make it difficult to understand and follow a \ndoctor's advice, respond to warnings, and to hear doorbells and alarms. \nThey can also take away from the enjoyment of the simple things in \nlife, like talking to friends and family, or listening to the radio or \ntelevision. Additionally, the 21st century work environment requires \nintense use of communication and information skills and technologies. \nAs seniors continue to remain in the workforce for longer periods, \nwork-related hearing challenges will become increasingly evident and \nthe individual who has a communication disability, disorder, or \ndifference will be at a distinct disadvantage.\n  This legislation will help seniors challenged by hearing problems \nobtain direct access to licensed audiologists through the Medicare \nProgram. Because most of these hearing conditions are not medically or \nsurgically treatable, direct access to audiology services will allow \ncomprehensive and timely care through the diagnosis, treatment, and \nmanagement of hearing loss. Audiologists can conduct a variety of \nspecialized auditory assessments and based on such examinations, can \npresent numerous options to help patients cope with hearing problems. \nThis legislation will not diminish the important role of primary care \nphysicians, who closely with audiologists and will remain intimately \ninvolved in patient care as needed under this bill.\n  Direct access to such audiology services is supported by numerous \ngovernmental agencies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nhas recognized the importance of this issue by making access by persons \nwith hearing impairments to rehabilitative services a Health People \n2010 objective. Additionally, the Veteran's Administration and Office \nof Personnel Management have established policies to allow \nbeneficiaries such access. Seniors under the Medicare Program deserve \nsimilar benefits, and I urge my colleagues to support this important \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1648. A bill to modify the date as of which certain tribal land of \nthe Lytton Rancheria of California is deemed to be held in trust; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would partially repeal language from the Omnibus Indian \nAdvancement Act of 2000; language that circumvents the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act's common-sense protections and regulatory safeguards \nagainst the inappropriate siting of Nevada-style casinos.\n  In 2000, a one-paragraph provision was attached to the Omnibus Indian \nAdvancement Act taking land into trust for a single Indian tribe, the \nLytton, with the aim of allowing the tribe to expedite plans to \nestablish a large gaming complex in San Pablo, CA.\n  The site which is not part of, nor adjacent to, any land \ntraditionally held by the Lytton is, in fact, a 10-acre property which \nincludes a card club and parking lot, and is located in a major urban \narea just outside of San Francisco. The process to bring this land into \ntrust and sidestep gaming oversight was done without regard for Federal \nlaws currently in place to regulate the siting of such a casino.\n  Today California is home to 109 federally recognized tribes. 64 \ntribes have gaming compacts with the State and there are 54 tribal \ncasinos. With more than 50 tribes seeking Federal recognition and \napproximately 25 recognized\n\n[[Page S11915]]\n\ntribes seeking gaming compacts from the Governor, revenues from \nCalifornia's tribal gaming industry are expected to be the highest of \nany State's by the end of the decade.\n  I have serious reservations about the expansion of Nevada-style \ngaming--with its slot machines and in-house banking--into urban areas, \nand I am particularly concerned about off-reservation gambling and \n``reservation shopping''. Off-reservation casinos often cause counties \nadditional costs in public and local services, intrude on residential \nareas, and are responsible for an increase of traffic and crime within \nlocal communities.\n  That said, under proper regulation, gaming in California has the \npotential to yield much needed benefits for tribal members in terms of \nhealthcare, education and general welfare, as Congress and California \nvoters intended. However, the question is not whether gaming should be \npermitted, but rather how and where. Those questions have been \nappropriately addressed by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  Without this legislation, the Lytton will be able to take a former \ncard club and the adjacent parking lot as their reservation and turn it \ninto a large gambling complex outside the regulations set up by the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act. Allowing this to happen would set a \ndangerous precedent not only for California, but every State where \ntribal gaming is permitted.\n  The changes I seek today are extremely limited. This legislation \nwould not reverse restoration of the tribe. It would not infringe on \nNative American sovereignty. It does not even block the casino \nproposal. It only seeks to give the State and the local communities a \nvoice in the process and ensure that gaming continues to be organized \nwithin the framework of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  Circumventing the processes for Federal recognition of tribal \ngovernments and for granting land into trust presents a variety of \nserious and critical multi-jurisdictional issues--issues which can \nnegatively affect the lives of ordinary citizens and deprive local \ngovernments of their political power to protect their communities.\n  That is why I believe it is important to seek a remedy which would \nrestore the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act's oversight over the matter.\n  The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act has provided this Nation with a fair \nand balanced approach to Indian gaming by facilitating tribal plans for \neconomic recovery without compromising a multitude of factors that \nshould be taken into account when deciding on the siting of casinos. \nThis law works. It is a fair process that should continue to be \nfollowed.\n  It is simply not asking too much to require that Lytton be subject to \nthe regulatory and approval processes applicable to newly acquired \ntribal lands by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and I look forward \nto working with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee to pass this legislation quickly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1648\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LYTTON RANCHERIA OF CALIFORNIA.\n\n       Section 819 of the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act (114 \n     Stat. 2919) is amended by striking the last sentence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1649. A bill to designate the Ojito Wilderness Study Area as \nwilderness, to take certain land into trust for the Pueblo of Zia, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the ``Ojito \nWilderness Act'', a wilderness bill that has broad support in New \nMexico. This bill designates the State's fourth Bureau of Land \nManagement Wilderness area, and its first new wilderness area in more \nthan 15 years. Keeping in mind Theodore Roosevelt's statement that \n``there are no words that can tell the hidden spirit of the wilderness, \nthat can reveal its mystery, its melancholy, and its charm,'' the Ojito \ncan be described as nearly 11,000 acres of dramatic landforms and \nmulti-colored rock formations, with sculptured badlands, expansive \nplateaus and mesa tops, a high density of cultural and archaeological \nsites and paleontological resources, and a diverse array of plant and \nanimal species. It is an area that is big enough to get lost in, but \nsmall enough that it will not change the fact that only one percent of \nNew Mexico's BLM lands are designated as wilderness. The bill also \nprovides for the acquisition of some adjacent public lands by the \nPueblo of Zia for preservation as public open space. I am pleased that \nthe senior Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, is cosponsoring \nthis bill and that my distinguished colleague from the Third District \nof New Mexico, Representative Udall, is introducing a companion measure \nin the House of Representatives.\n  The support for this proposal truly is impressive. It has been \nformally endorsed by the Governor of New Mexico; the local Sandoval \nCounty Commission and the neighboring Bernalillo County Commission; the \nAlbuquerque City Council; New Mexico House of Representatives Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee Chairman James Roger Madalena; the \nGovernors of the Pueblos of Zia, Santa Ana, Santo Domingo, Cochiti, \nTesuque, San Ildefonso, Pojoaque, Nambe, Santa Clara, San Juan, Sandia, \nLaguna, Acoma, Isleta, Picuris, and Taos; the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians; the Hopi Tribe; The Wilderness Society; the New \nMexico Wilderness Alliance; the Coalition for New Mexico Wilderness, on \nbehalf of more than 375 businesses and organizations; the Rio Grande \nChapter of the Sierra Club; the National Parks and Conservation \nAssociation; the Albuquerque Convention and Visitors Bureau; 1000 \nFriends of New Mexico; and numerous individuals.\n  The designation of the Ojito Wilderness was recommended by Secretary \nof the Interior Manuel Lujan, Jr,.--a former New Mexico Congressman of \n20 years--in 1991. Secretary Lujan found the Ojito to have ``high \nquality wilderness values'' with ``outstanding opportunities for \nsolitude and primitive and unconfined recreation,'' as well as \n``outstanding photographic and sightseeing opportunities.'' The ``close \nproximity to the Albuquerque and Santa Fe population centers, cultural \nand paleontological special features, and the lack of resource \nconflicts'' made the recommendation particularly strong. President \nGeorge H.W. Bush concurred in the recommendation and forwarded it to \nCongress for designation. This bill adopts the boundaries recommended \nat that time, so there should be no question or dispute that all of the \nlands proposed for wilderness in this bill fully qualify for wilderness \nstatus under the Wilderness Act.\n  This bill also takes advantage of a unique opportunity to benefit \nboth the Pueblo and the public by authorizing the Pueblo to acquire \nsome public lands that are sandwiched between the Zia Reservation and \nthe Ojito Wilderness Study Area. The general public will benefit from \nthe assurance that these lands will be protected for the future, \nforming a protective buffer around the Ojito Wilderness and providing \nadditional opportunities for primitive public recreation. This bill \nsecures continued public access to this open space for recreational, \nscenic, paleontological, scientific, educational, and conservation \nuses.\n  While these lands are--and will remain--important to the public, they \nhave special importance to the Pueblo and its people. These lands are \npart of the Pueblo's aboriginal land base, and they harbor many \ncultural, religious, historical, and archaeological sites of great \nimport to the Pueblo. By acquiring these lands, the Pueblo will finally \nunite the two non-contiguous parts of its Reservation. The Pueblo may \ncontinue to graze its cattle on these lands, but it is prohibited from \nusing the lands for housing, gaming, mining, or other commercial \nenterprises.\n  The Pueblo will purchase these lands for fair market value, which \nwill, of course, take into consideration the restrictions and \nprohibitions on various uses, the requirement that the natural \ncharacteristics of the land be preserved in perpetuity, and the \nguarantee that public access be maintained. Existing rights are \nprotected, so, for example, the main access road will remain a county \nroad and the existing pipelines\n\n[[Page S11916]]\n\nand transmission line will be unaffected. The Pueblo also has agreed to \nrecognize the grazing privileges of a neighboring ranch that has the \nonly other outstanding grazing permit on the lands to be transferred, \nand it is working on memorializing that agreement.\n  The New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands, Patrick H. Lyons, \nsupports this transfer. In a letter endorsing the proposal, he told the \nPueblo that it ``makes sense from a management perspective, and I \napplaud your efforts to address this matter in a cooperative manner. \nOnce transferred, I am confident that the Pueblo of Zia will manage its \nacquisition with the same sensitivity with which it manages all its \nlands.'' I agree, and this bill authorizes the Pueblo to manage this \nland pursuant to regulations that are approved by the Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  I am particularly pleased to introduce this legislation in \ncelebration of the upcoming 40th anniversary of the Wilderness Act of \n1964 and the eightieth anniversary of the Nation's first \nadministratively-designated wilderness. This celebration is \nparticularly meaningful to my State of New Mexico, for it is both the \nproud birthplace of wilderness and the home to two of its fathers: Aldo \nLeopold, who worked from Albuquerque for 15 years to create in 1924 the \nGila wilderness near my home in southern New Mexico, and New Mexico \nSenator Clinton Anderson, who was instrumental in codifying Aldo \nLeopold's wilderness and ethic 40 years later.\n  Forty years later still, the Ojito provides a unique wilderness area \nthat is important not only to its local stewards, but also to the \nnearby residents of Albuquerque and Santa Fe, as well as visitors from \nacross the country. It is an outdoor geology laboratory, offering a \nspectacular and unique opportunity to view from a single location the \njuxtaposition of the southwestern margin of the Rocky Mountains, the \nColorado Plateau, and the Rio Grande Rift, along with the volcanic \nnecks of the Rio Puerco Fault. Its rugged terrain offers a rewarding \nchallenge to hikers, backpackers, and photographers. It shelters \nancient Puebloan ruins and an endemic endangered plant, solitude and \ninspiration.\n  The words of Aldo Leopold and Senator Clinton Anderson are fitting \nfor the Ojito, for it is ``what the land was, what it is, and what it \nought to be''; let this ``Ojito Wilderness Act'' be ``a demonstration \nby our people that we can put aside a portion of this which we have as \na tribute to the Maker and say this we will leave as we found it.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1649\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ojito Wilderness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Ojito Wilderness Study Area, located in Sandoval \n     County, New Mexico, contains dramatic landforms and rock \n     structures, multicolored badlands, expansive plateaus and \n     mesa tops, and a high density of cultural and archaeological \n     sites, paleontological resources, and diverse plant and \n     animal species;\n       (2) the Bureau of Land Management evaluated the Ojito area \n     and found that the area has sufficient land area and natural \n     characteristics to qualify for full wilderness status and \n     protection;\n       (3) in 1992, President George H.W. Bush concurred with the \n     recommendation of Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan, \n     Jr., that Congress designate the Ojito Wilderness based on \n     the high quality wilderness values, close proximity to the \n     Albuquerque and Santa Fe population centers, cultural and \n     paleontological special features, and the lack of resource \n     conflicts in the area;\n       (4) the Pueblo of Zia has worked in cooperation with other \n     interested parties to reach an agreement under which the \n     Pueblo would acquire public land adjacent to the Zia \n     Reservation and the Ojito Wilderness Study Area that would--\n       (A) enhance the protections for the land in the Ojito area; \n     and\n       (B) ensure that the land will remain open to the public for \n     recreational, scenic, scientific, educational, \n     paleontological, and conservation uses; and\n       (5) the transfer of certain parcels of public land to the \n     Pueblo of Zia and the designation of the Ojito Wilderness as \n     a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System--\n       (A) is in the best interest of people of the State of New \n     Mexico and people from other States;\n       (B) would preserve and maintain the Ojito as an enduring \n     resource of wilderness; and\n       (C) would provide for the management and promotion of the \n     wilderness character and various resources of the Ojito area \n     for wildlife habitat protection, scenic and historic \n     preservation, scientific research and education, primitive \n     recreation, solitude, and inspiration for present and future \n     generations of the people of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to ensure that recreational benefits are given the \nsame priority as hurricane and storm damage reduction benefits and \nenvironmental restoration benefits; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the National Beach \nRecreation and Economic Benefits Act. This measure would require the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Army Corps, to give recreational benefits \nthe same priority as hurricane and storm damage reduction benefits when \njustifying beach restoration projects.\n  The Army Corps performs a valuable service in protecting our nation's \nbeaches against erosion. They have effectively restored and repaired \ndamaged beaches for over the past 50 years. Unfortunately, under \ncurrent policy, the Army Corps only authorizes and funds beach \nrestoration projects that protect property against storm and hurricane \ndamage. The Army Corps does not recommend authorization or funding of \nbeach restoration projects that only provide recreational benefits.\n  Beaches help support tourism and serve as an important source of fun \nfor many Americans who seek inexpensive recreation. Many of these \nbeaches are not eligible for beach restoration because they lack \nsufficient structural development along coastlines to warrant a \nrestoration project solely on the basis of storm or hurricane damage \nreduction. While local governments and communities have taken proactive \nmeasures to avert flood damage, they are being denied the much needed \nbeach restoration assistance by the Army Corps.\n  In addition, by limiting beach restoration projects to storm and \nhurricane damage reduction, the Army Corps has established a policy \nthat inadvertently aids more developed shorelines than others. The \nmethod for determining storm and hurricane damage reduction benefits is \nbased on the assessed value of the private property and public \ninfrastructure immediately adjacent to the beach. Therefore, the \nbenefits will be much higher for densely developed shorelines than less \ndensely developed shorelines. For example, a high-rise residential \ncondominium or hotel would provide more storm reduction benefits than a \nsingle family home.\n  Accordingly, the National Beach Recreation and Economic Benefits Act \nwill ensure that recreation benefits are accorded the same \nconsiderations as storm and hurricane damage reduction benefits. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this measure. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Beach Recreation \n     and Economic Benefits Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GOALS TO BE ADDRESSED IN PLANNING OF WATER RESOURCE \n                   PROJECTS.\n\n       Section 904 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 \n     (33 U.S.C. 2281) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 904. GOALS TO BE ADDRESSED IN PLANNING OF WATER \n                   RESOURCE PROJECTS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Each of the goals of enhancing national \n     economic development, the quality of the total environment, \n     the well-being of the people of the United States, the \n     prevention of loss of life, and the preservation of cultural \n     and historical values shall be addressed in the formulation \n     and evaluation of water resources projects to be carried out \n     by the Secretary.\n       ``(b) Display of Associated Benefits and Costs.--The \n     quantifiable and unquantifiable costs and benefits associated \n     with the goals relating to water resources projects described \n     in subsection (a) shall be displayed in any analysis of the \n     costs and benefits of those projects.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``DC Student Opportunity \n     Scholarship Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Parents are best equipped to make decisions for their \n     children, including the educational setting that will best \n     serve the interests and educational needs of their child.\n       (2) For many parents in the District of Columbia, available \n     educational alternatives to the public schools are \n     inadequate, and more educational options are needed. In \n     particular, funds are needed to assist low-income parents to \n     exercise choice among enhanced public opportunities and \n     private educational environments, whether religious or \n     nonreligious.\n       (3) In the most recent mathematics assessment on the \n     National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), \n     administered in 2000, a lower percentage of 4th-grade \n     students in the District of Columbia demonstrated proficiency \n     than was the case for any State. Seventy-six percent of the \n     District of Columbia fourth-graders scored at the ``below \n     basic'' level and of the 8th-grade students in the District \n     of Columbia, only 6 percent of the students tested at the \n     proficient or advanced levels, and 77 percent were below \n     basic. In the most recent NAEP reading assessment, in 1998, \n     only 10 percent of the District of Columbia fourth-graders \n     could read proficiently, while 72 percent were below basic. \n     At the 8th-grade level, 12 percent were proficient or \n     advanced and 56 percent were below basic.\n       (4) A program enacted for the valid secular purpose of \n     providing educational assistance to low-income children in a \n     demonstrably failing public school system is constitutional \n     under Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639 (2002), if it is \n     neutral with respect to religion and provides assistance to a \n     broad class of citizens who direct government aid to \n     religious and secular schools solely as a result of their \n     genuine and independent private choices.\n       (5) The Mayor of the District of Columbia and the President \n     of the District of Columbia Board of Education support this \n     Act.\n       (6) This Act provides additional money for the District of \n     Columbia public schools and therefore money for vouchers is \n     not being taken out of money that would otherwise go to the \n     District of Columbia public schools.\n       (7) This Act creates a 5-year pilot program tailored to the \n     current needs and particular circumstances of low-income \n     children in District of Columbia schools. This Act does not \n     establish parameters or requirements for other school choice \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to provide low-income parents \n     residing in the District of Columbia, particularly parents of \n     students who attend elementary schools or secondary schools \n     identified for improvement, corrective action, or \n     restructuring under section 1116 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316), with \n     expanded opportunities for enrolling their children in \n     higher-performing schools in the District of Columbia.\n\n     SEC. 4. GENERAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Authority.--From funds appropriated to carry out this \n     Act, the Secretary shall award grants on a competitive basis \n     to eligible entities with approved applications under section \n     5 to carry out activities to provide eligible students with \n     expanded school choice opportunities. The Secretary may award \n     a single grant or multiple grants, depending on the quality \n     of applications submitted and the priorities of this Act.\n       (b) Duration of Grants.--The Secretary may make grants \n     under this section for a period of not more than 5 years.\n       (c) Memorandum of Understanding.--The Secretary and the \n     Mayor of the District of Columbia shall enter into a \n     memorandum of understanding regarding the design of, \n     selection of eligible entities to receive grants under, and \n     implementation of, a program assisted under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5.

PRIORITIES.\n\n       In awarding grants under this Act, the Secretary shall give \n     priority to applications from eligible entities who will most \n     effectively--\n       (1) give priority to eligible students who, in the school \n     year preceding the school year for which the eligible student \n     is seeking a scholarship, attended an elementary school or \n     secondary school identified for improvement, corrective \n     action, or restructuring under section 1116 of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316);\n       (2) target resources to students and families that lack the \n     financial resources to take advantage of available \n     educational options; and\n       (3) provide students and families with the widest range of \n     educational options.\n\n     SEC. 7. USE OF FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Scholarships.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a \n     grantee shall use the grant funds to provide eligible \n     students with scholarships to pay the tuition, fees, and \n     transportation expenses, if any, to enable them to attend the \n     District of Columbia private elementary school or secondary \n     school of their choice. Each grantee shall ensure that the \n     amount of any tuition or fees charged by a school \n     participating in the grantee's program under this Act to an \n     eligible student participating in the program does not exceed \n     the amount of tuition or fees that the school customarily \n     charges to students who do not participate in the program.\n       (2) Payments to parents.--A grantee shall make scholarship \n     payments under the program under this Act to the parent of \n     the eligible student participating in the program, in a \n     manner which ensures that such payments will be used for the \n     payment of tuition, fees, and transportation expenses (if \n     any), in accordance with this Act.\n       (3) Amount of assistance.--\n       (A) Varying amounts permitted.--Subject to the other \n     requirements of this section, a grantee may award \n     scholarships in larger amounts to those eligible students \n     with the greatest need.\n       (B) Annual limit on amount.--The amount of assistance \n     provided to any eligible student by a grantee under a program \n     under this Act may not exceed $7,500 for any academic year.\n       (4) Continuation of scholarships.--Notwithstanding section \n     12(3)(B), an eligible entity receiving a grant under this Act \n     may award a scholarship, for the second or any succeeding \n     year of an eligible student's participation in a program \n     under this Act, to a student who comes from a household whose \n     income does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line.\n       (b) Administrative Expenses.--A grantee may use not more \n     than 3 percent of the amount provided under the grant each \n     year for the administrative expenses of carrying out its \n     program under this Act during the year, including--\n       (1) determining the eligibility of students to participate;\n       (2) providing information about the program and the schools \n     involved to parents of eligible students;\n       (3) selecting students to receive scholarships;\n       (4) determining the amount of scholarships and issuing the \n     scholarships to eligible students;\n       (5) compiling and maintaining financial and programmatic \n     records; and\n       (6) providing funds to assist parents in meeting expenses \n     that might otherwise preclude the participation of their \n     child in the program.\n\n     SEC. 8.
