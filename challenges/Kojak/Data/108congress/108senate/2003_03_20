Mr. President, the Senate will resume consideration of S. \nCon. Res. 23, the concurrent budget resolution this morning, with a \ntotal of 14\\1/2\\ hours left for debate on the resolution, 6\\1/2\\ hours \nremaining under the control of the chairman of the Budget Committee and \n8 hours remaining under the control of the ranking member.\n  In view of the military action taking place in Iraq, the Senate will \nconsider today a resolution of support for President Bush and the \ntroops. The final wording on the resolution itself is being worked out \nby Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  I had an opportunity to talk to the majority leader a few minutes ago \nand we discussed the wording of the resolution. By late this morning or \nearly afternoon the specific wording will be worked out.\n  I envision sufficient time for Senators to speak. A number of \nSenators have expressed their desire to speak in support of our troops, \nand we will accommodate that. Senators will be advised as to the time \nfor this discussion and debate as well as when the vote on the \nresolution of support will take place later this morning or early \nafternoon after we have had a time for Members on both sides of the \naisle to discuss the appropriate timing for that.\n  Both today and tomorrow will be very busy. We will complete action on \nthe budget resolution this week. In order to provide adequate time for \npeople to both express their support and at the same time finish the \nbudget resolution this week, we will be in very late tonight, and I \nwould assume tomorrow, and late tomorrow night, and possibly go into \nSaturday. Again, we will finish the budget resolution this week.\n  There are currently three amendments pending: The Kyl amendment \nregarding the estate tax, the Durbin amendment regarding a prescription \ndrug benefit, and the Rockefeller and Collins amendment regarding aid \nto States. Under the previous order, the votes on these amendments will \nbe stacked to occur at 4 o'clock today. Those votes will be the first \nvotes today. There may be other votes stacked as well depending on what \namendments are offered over the course of the morning.\n  We were here late last tonight. Again, I make the appeal that people \nfile their amendments and talk to the chairman and ranking member, the \nmanagers of this important piece of legislation, so we can progress \nwithin the time elements that have been laid out, the 14\\1/2\\ hours \nremaining for debate on the resolution.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I concur with what the leader said and also with my \ncolleagues both from Nevada and North Dakota. I encourage colleagues if \nthey do have amendments to please share those with us. We have three \namendments in the queue. We are happy to look at amendments. We may be \nable\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\nto accept some amendments. We may want some modifications and may want \nto have some substitutes. However, I would like to avoid, if possible, \nthe vote-arama. I don't think it makes the Senate look very good. There \nare 14\\1/2\\ hours remaining on the resolution. I would like people to \nhave a chance to be able to debate their amendment. Even so, I \nencourage Senators, if they have amendments, let us look at them before \nthey send their amendments to the desk. We want to be able to look at \nthose amendments on both sides. I encourage colleagues on this side, if \nthey have amendments, the Senator from North Dakota is entitled to look \nat those amendments. But they can have a chance to debate those \namendments, have some debate time throughout the day. I expect we will \nhave a lot of votes today and a lot of votes tomorrow. Colleagues \nshould be aware. Also, they should be prepared, if necessary, to stay \non Saturday for a lot of votes. I hope and expect we could conclude \neither very late tonight or sometime tomorrow but, if necessary, on \nSaturday.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, I think it \nis inappropriate to proceed with business as usual when a war has \nbegun. That sends the wrong message to the country. It is not what the \nSenate should be doing.\n  I am the ranking member of the Budget Committee and I would very \nmuch, just as the chairman, like to complete work on the budget \nresolution quickly. But I have to say that I don't think that is the \npriority at this moment. At this moment, I think the Senate ought to be \ntalking about events that are unfolding half the world away that have \nour young men and women at risk and that have us engaged in a military \nconflict that is enormously consequential to the fight of this Nation.\n  I understand the resolution is not yet ready. So I think for some \ntime this morning we could be on the schedule we agreed to last night. \nBut I think after that time, to just proceed with debating the budget \nand talking about pay-go and talking about this amendment and that \namendment is going to look awfully strange to the American people when \nour troops are engaged in battle.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we do have a challenge but we have a \nchallenge to pay appropriate respect for our troops and that is the \npurpose of having a resolution, which is a joint resolution, for which \nI pray and hope we have 100-percent support.\n  During debate on that resolution, I want to give everyone the \nopportunity to express that support, although I will also say whatever \nhappens over the next several days, and it is likely to go on through \nnext week, there will be ample opportunity, I believe--and I will make \nample opportunity over the ensuing weeks--for people to express \nsupport.\n  We have a challenge now that we will finish the budget resolution \nthis week. So we have the budget resolution and we will have this \nresolution of support and we will be able to do both. I think the \nbudget is very important--how all taxpayer dollars are spent for \nmilitary, for defense, for homeland security, for education, for health \ncare. That is our responsibility. We have people listening right now, \npeople are at work, working in convenience stores, they are working in \nbanks, they are showing up for work, and there are reporters outside. \nThe Nation's business must keep going.\n  Our responsibility as Senators is to develop a budget that gives some \npriorities. We have done a good job to date. To walk away from that \nresponsibility at this point is simply irresponsible. That is why, as \nmajority leader, I say we are going to stay here and we are going to do \nthe Nation's business. That is our responsibility and you will see that \nfulfilled. We do have the challenge of being able to do both.\n  I look forward to working with the minority leader and the managers \nof this particular bill to be able to accomplish that. I am confident \nwe will be able to do that. We have been working on the resolution in \nsupport of our troops for several days with the minority leader's \nstaff. We have made real progress. It expresses strong support, I \nbelieve, and the sense of this body. We will look forward, hopefully \nthis afternoon, to bringing that to the floor and being able to give \nthat opportunity for people to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4044-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 23, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 23) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the U.S. Government for fiscal year \n     2004 and including the appropriate budgetary levels for \n     fiscal year 2003 and for fiscal years 2005 through 2013.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Kyl modified amendment No. 288, to provide financial \n     security to family farm and small business owners by ending \n     the unfair practice of taxing someone at death.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 294, to provide a meaningful \n     prescription drug benefit in Medicare that is available to \n     all beneficiaries.\n       Rockefeller amendment No. 275, to express the sense of the \n     Senate concerning State fiscal relief.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like the attention of the majority \nleader, if I could, before he leaves the floor, to say to him nobody is \nsuggesting we walk away from our responsibility to do the budget. But \nthe fact is, that does not have to be done today or tomorrow. We have \nplenty of time before the budget deadline is reached. That is not until \nthe middle of April.\n  When we talk about responsibility here, we have no higher \nresponsibility than the defense of this Nation. I tell you, the thing \nthat is on the minds of my constituents, the thing that is on the minds \nof virtually every American, is not the budget resolution. The thing \nthat is on the minds of the American people today is the fact that we \nhave a quarter of a million troops engaged in a battle that is \nincredibly consequential to this Nation. I wish to register my strong \ndisagreement with business as usual in the Senate when we are at war.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me respond and say there is a \ndifference, I believe, in that I believe we express strong support for \nour troops, for our Commander in Chief especially; that we can do that \nand at the same time carry on our responsibility. It is a difference in \napproach. I guess that is why the last Congress, under other \nleadership, failed to pass a budget. Look where it got us--where the \nfirst 40 days of this particular Congress, we had to clean up a process \nwhich was left because of that same prioritization, that a budget is \nnot important. We believe that a budget is important, that it \nprioritizes the needs of defense, of health care, of education. Thus, \nunder this leadership, we are going to proceed with the budget. We are \ngoing to pass that budget resolution. We are not going to delay. Now I \nam beginning to sense a little bit that we want to delay the budget, \nput it off a week, a month, a year, or maybe into the next Congress. It \nis simply not going to happen. We are going to proceed. We have 14\\1/2\\ \nhours on this budget. We are not going to pay respect to the fact that \nsome people say the budget is just not important now. We believe that \nbudget is important.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there is no suggestion from this Senator \nthat the budget is not important. I believe it is critically important. \nHarking back to last year has no relevance to this moment. We are at \nwar, and to spend time in the Senate today on something other than that \nstrikes me as wholly inappropriate.\n  We are not talking about not getting to the budget. Nobody wants a \nbudget resolution, I think, any more than this Senator. I have spent my \nentire career in the Senate on the Budget Committee. I want a budget \nresolution. We are at war and here we are talking about pay-go.\n  Virtually every American is rivetted on what is happening to this \nNation on\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\nthe brink of conflict. In fact, we are beyond the brink. It started \nlast night. Our President addressed the Nation at 10:15 last night.\n  I hope there is a reconsideration because this Senator is going to be \nextraordinarily disappointed in this Chamber if we are conducting \nbusiness as usual while this Nation is going to war.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield time to Senator Reid.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my concern is this: First, understand, I was \nthe first Democrat to break ranks with the majority at that time to \nsupport the first President Bush. I voted this time to support \nPresident Bush. I have said good things about the President. I have \ndone my very best to work this budget resolution through.\n  But I would say to my friend and anyone who is listening--the \nmajority leader has left--it appears to me--and I want the Senator from \nNorth Dakota to listen to this--it appears to me that maybe there is a \nrush to go through the budget because maybe people are going to start \nasking questions about how much this war is costing. There is not a \nsingle penny in this budget that deals with the war, not a penny. Do \nyou think that might be one reason for rushing through this budget? \nDon't you think we should know the cost of the war?\n  I will bet right now they have prepared, at the White House, a \nsupplemental emergency appropriations bill for tens of billions of \ndollars. I have heard it is $100 billion. Yet we are marching through \nwith the tax cuts to satisfy the wealthy of this country. That is what \nthis budget thing is all about. That is why we are going to work \nFridays and Saturdays. I am happy to work Friday and Saturday. I will \nput my credentials up against anyone as far as moving legislation, \nincluding this budget bill. But I ask a question to the ranking member \nof the Budget Committee: Is there one dollar in this budget that \nreflects the cost of the war that is going on as we speak?\n  Before I came here, I watched on television an aircraft carrier. \nPlanes were being catapulted off it, then dropping bombs. Do we know \nhow much that costs? Do we know how much the reconstruction of Iraq is \ngoing to cost? Is there a penny in this budget that reflects that?\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator asked the question. There is no money. As the \nSenator knows, there is no money in this budget for the conflict. There \nis no money in this budget for the occupation. There is no money in \nthis budget for the reconstruction. There is no money in this budget \nfor humanitarian assistance.\n  But I think there is a larger question. That is, our troops are now \nengaged. For us to conduct business as usual here just strikes me as \ntotally and wholly inappropriate.\n  I am the ranking member of the Budget Committee. I have been there my \nentire time in the Senate. I am in my 17th year. For us not to be \ndiscussing our Nation at war has the priorities all wrong. Yes, the \nbudget is important. Yes, we ought to do a budget resolution. But we \nhave lots of time to accomplish that. We can do that next week. We \ncompleted most of the debate on the budget already, but, unfortunately, \na big chunk is missing.\n  If we want to talk about supporting the troops in the field, we ought \nto do it tangibly by putting dollars in the budget. There aren't any.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator telling me and anyone within the sound of my \nvoice that in this huge budget that is now before the Senate, that has \ntax cuts over $1 trillion over the next 10 years, for the war in Iraq \nthat is now going on there is not a penny of money for the war in this \nbudget?\n  Mr. CONRAD. There is not a penny. We have been told the reason there \nis not a penny is that when the budget was done, operations had not \ncommenced. Well, operations have commenced. The President spoke to the \nNation last night and made clear that we are at war.\n  I hope cooler heads are going to prevail. We need to think very \ncarefully about what we do as an institution when we have a quarter of \na million Americans' lives on the line.\n  What should be the discussion in this Chamber? Should it be the pay-\ngo provisions of the budget? Should it be the reconciliation \ninstructions in the budget resolution? Or should it be the question of \nwar and peace? Should it be the question of supporting our troops in \nthe field? Should it be a question of sending a clear message that our \ncountry is united behind our forces, no matter what our positions were \non the wisdom of engaging in this conflict? That ought to be the \npriority we discuss.\n  I must say I think this is an extraordinary moment, that the \nsuggestion is we just have business as usual in the Senate. I find it \ntotally and wholly inappropriate.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask the ranking member of the committee another \nquestion? The Senator has stated on at least two occasions this morning \nthat there is not 5 cents in this budget to support the troops for the \nwar that is going on in Iraq. Now we have heard statements for months \nabout we are there to free the Iraqi people, and that we are going to \nsupply food and medicine and everything else necessary to take care of \nthe reconstruction of the country of Iraq. The Senator has heard those \nquestions, has he not?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Would it not seem to the Senator, as it does to me, that in \npreparation for reconstructing Iraq there must be some budget numbers \nfloating around down at the White House someplace? Would you think that \nis a fair statement?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We know there are. We know there are estimates of $65 to \n$95 billion.\n  Mr. REID. Is there one penny in this budget dealing with the \nreconstruction of Iraq?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, there is nothing for reconstruction. There is nothing \nfor the conflict. There is nothing for any part of it.\n  Let me say this for the Senator, if I could. We have been told a \nbudget request will come next week for that. That is fine. It just \nseems to me it ought to be part of the budget. It is an odd \ncircumstance to do a budget but leave a big part of the expenditures \nout of that budget. But what strikes me even more dramatically, much \nmore dramatically than that, is we are not discussing our troops in the \nfield. We are not discussing the fact we have gone to war.\n  Now, goodness, the budget is important, but it is not the thing that \nis on the minds of the American people this morning. What is on the \nminds of the American people this morning is this Chamber sending a \nsignal of support for our forces. They have been ordered to go into \nharm's way. We have an obligation to send a signal that we back them. \nWhatever our position is on the wisdom of this course, that is not the \npoint at the moment. The point at the moment ought to be we support our \nforces in the field. That ought to be the discussion that is going on \nin this Chamber, not a discussion of pay-go or reconciliation. That is \nnot to say we don't go to the budget quickly and in a timely way. \nAbsolutely. But goodness--\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Nevada has the largest military airplane \nfighter training facility for the Air Force in the world, Nellis Air \nForce Base, with 10,000 people stationed there. I have been there. I \nhave talked to the commanding general of this large force. Hundreds and \nhundreds of people have left Nellis for the Middle East. People have \ntrained there. They have families in Nevada. Their kids go to school in \nNevada. Fallon, 400 miles away, is a very large naval air training \ncenter, Fallon Naval Air Station. And there it is the same thing--Top \nGun is there. Hundreds and hundreds of people from Fallon are now in \nthe Middle East. That aircraft carrier I watched before I came in \nhere--I can almost guarantee you those people taking off in those \nairplanes were trained at Fallon. They also have children going to \nschool in Churchill County. They also have wives and husbands who are \nthere waiting for their return.\n  In addition to that, we have a very large ammunition depot at \nHawthorne and it has gotten real busy because they are bringing \nammunition out of\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\nthere, hauling it to the Middle East. In addition to that, we have \nlarge Guard and Reserve components. We have over 1,000 Guard and \nReserve people who have been called up and are gone. Their families are \ngone. Some of them don't know how they are going to make the rental \npayments, their house payments. What I hear from the Senator from North \nDakota is that maybe the Senator from Nevada sometime during the day \nshould give a speech talking about the people in Nevada who have \nsacrificed to protect my freedom, my family's freedom. Is that what the \nSenator is saying?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think if we would look back in the history of this \nChamber, when America goes to war, the Senate turns its attention to \nthat fact, that confrontation, and sends a signal of our support for \nthe troops in the field. That is just the most basic, I would say, of \nvalues, that that is what we should be talking about. That is what we \nshould be discussing, and the budget we can talk about later. We can \ntalk about it tomorrow or the next day. But today we ought to be \ntalking about what is going on, what is on the minds of the American \npeople.\n\n  I urge my colleagues--I know the leader indicated we would go to a \nresolution at some point today. That is fine. I would just hope we \nwould go to morning business so people could have a chance to discuss \ntheir feelings about our troops in the field.\n  The Senator has indicated he has large bases in his State. I have \nlarge bases in mine. Minot Air Force Base, home to our B-52s, one of \njust two B-52 bases in the country, Grand Forks Air Force Base, one of \nthe three core tanker bases for the United States, those are the places \nthat are providing the air bridge to Iraq half a world away. We have \nthousands of troops engaged from North Dakota. We have large components \nof our National Guard which have been called up as well.\n  I tell you, I just don't feel comfortable, honestly, talking about \nthe budget on this day at this moment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from New York is here. He has an amendment \nthat is relevant to the question, the matter of homeland security. I \nwill yield--how much time does the Senator seek?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would say 30 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 30 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized for 30 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 299\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending amendments be set aside and I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Chair hears \nnone, and it is so ordered. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself and \n     others, proposes an amendment numbered 299.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be considered as \nread.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, he has been told not to offer the \namendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I could not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. There was no one from the majority on the floor when the \nSenator offered his amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the information of my colleague from New York, we \nwould be happy to have----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleague, it \ntakes unanimous consent. We have amendments that are pending, so we \nhave to set those amendments aside. We wish to review amendments before \nwe do that. I am happy to have my colleague from New York begin \ndiscussing his amendment. We will review the amendment at some point. I \nam sure we will be happy to have the amendment sent to the desk--just \nnot yet.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Then I would imagine that we just--the chairman of the \nBudget Committee was off the floor. We had gotten unanimous consent to \nput this amendment forward. I take it we should just speak on the \namendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I do not believe the amendment should be \npending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment has been laid down.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be withdrawn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I say to my colleague from New York again, just to make \nsure we understand, we are trying to respect each other as far as \nmanagement of the bill. I will be happy to work with the Senator on the \namendment. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. This amendment is relevant, of \ncourse, to our new circumstances since last night, but I would just \nwant to address my colleagues in the Senate on the circumstances of \nlast night for a few minutes before getting to the amendment, because \nthe President spoke to the American people. He said hostilities are \ncommenced.\n  I would just leave three thoughts as we begin on the era of this war. \nFirst is a prayer.\n  First, Mr. President, as I listened to the chaplain from St. Joseph's \ngive the prayer and we said the pledge, I think every one of us who was \nhere felt a renewed depth and meaning to both the prayer and the \npledge, given the times we are in.\n  I would like to just add my prayer. My prayer is a simple one: It is \nthat our military action is swift and decisive, with a minimum of \ncasualties, both military and civilian. And my prayer, of course, goes \nto the soldiers, first and foremost, who are now in the Iraqi theater. \nThey are continuing a grand American tradition, a tradition where \ncivilians have laid down their jobs and then defended this country when \nthe Commander in Chief thought they should.\n  I have been to several of the debarkation ceremonies at Fort Drum and \nCanandaigua, on Long Island, as soldiers have boarded planes to go over \nto the Middle East. Because so many of our soldiers are now reservists \nand Army National Guard, they are a little older. They are every bit as \ntrained and seasoned as the enlisted men and women, and I know our \ngenerals have complete confidence in them, as I do.\n  But you see them with their families--not only with their parents, \nwhom we have always seen with our soldiers, but in much greater \nfrequency with their husbands and wives and their children. And we know \nthe butterflies that are in all the stomachs as they prepare to leave. \nI look in their faces as they leave, and I am humbled and proud of \nthem. My prayers are with them. We all pray for them.\n  Again, we pray that the military action is swift and decisive and \nthere be very few casualties, both military and civilian. The military, \nof course, I have spoken of. But I pray there are few civilian \ncasualties. The war we are waging is not a war against the Iraqi \npeople. It is a war aimed at the leadership of Iraq. The average Iraqi \ncitizens--a husband or a wife, a mother or a father, a child, a son or \na daughter--have the same loves and cares and worries in many ways that \nall the rest of the citizens of the world have. We pray that the number \nof casualties among the civilians is small.\n  So that is the prayer of which the guest Chaplain from St. Peter's \nreminded me.\n  Then we said the pledge to the flag. Our flag is a flag of unity. Now \nis the time for unity, for all of us to back our soldiers. There have \nbeen many different views held, with great passion, on what we should \ndo in Iraq; there is no question about that. Every one of us here, on \nboth sides of the aisle, might have scripted things differently. I, for \none, have said I hoped we could get more international support. But if \nevery one of us just said, ``Only our\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\nplan, or nothing,'' we would be paralyzed. I believe Saddam Hussein has \nto be disarmed and removed from power. That is why I supported the \nPresident in his resolution. Now I believe is a time for unity. Now is \na time for us to be backing up our troops. Now is a time that the \nPresident becomes Commander in Chief and that unity is called for.\n  I just add one caveat: Freedom is what we are fighting for. Not \neveryone will feel the call for unity that I think is incumbent upon \nall of us in this body as leaders of this country, and some will \ncontinue to dissent. I hope we respect that dissent. In my State, there \nare many people whose views are heartfelt. They are different from \nmine. They are different from yours. They are probably different from \nthe views of most of us in this Chamber. And the right to dissent is \nwhat we are fighting for. It is part of this tradition. I hope we are \nmindful of that, as well.\n  Then one other thought. As I said, I pray that the military action is \nswift and decisive and that our victory comes quickly. Let us hope we \ncan sow a wise peace in Iraq as well. Let us hope there can be a \ndemocratic Iraq despite the fact there are so many ethnic divisions. \nLet us hope we can bring democracy to the Middle East, a place starved \nfor freedom, a place starved for individual choice, a place starved for \nprosperity.\n\n  Let us hope the people of the Middle East, the Iraqi people, like \neveryone else, want to bring stability and a good life to them and \ntheir families. The beauty of a democracy is that you can strive to \nhelp your family and help yourself and at the same time you help the \nwhole country. Unfortunately, the peoples of the Middle East--many of \nthem--have not been fed a diet of food, clothing, and shelter but have \nbeen fed a diet of propaganda and hatred, which dictators often use to \nfeed their people when they cannot provide a system of freedom, \ndemocratically and economically, that provides food. Let's hope that \ncan change as well.\n  So, Mr. President, we are in a new era. I realized this in my city \nfrom the time 9/11 happened. I put this flag on, on 9/12, in memory of \nall those who were then missing and the thousands who proved to be \nlost, gone. I met their families. I just met with some yesterday. I \nknow the holes in their hearts, the sadness, frustration, and anger \nthey feel. But we cannot forget them. We cannot forget what happened.\n  I will wear this flag, God willing, this very one, every day for the \nrest of my life to think of them, to remind me that whatever our views \nhere are, we have to do something to stop the scourge of terrorism, \nwhich will grow and grow and grow if we do nothing.\n  Now, on to the amendment I would like to discuss, I realize it is not \npending before us, but it is a relevant amendment. I, like my colleague \nfrom North Dakota, like my colleague from Nevada, hope we will have a \nfull discussion about supporting our troops and the impending war. I \nhave had an opportunity to express some of my views. I have limited \nthem because I know the leadership wants to move forward, at least at \nthis point, with this amendment. But this amendment at least has some \nrelevance.\n  The amendment is one that deals with homeland security. It is an \namendment that deals, in my judgment at least, with an unfulfilled need \nin the budget, the need to protect our homeland.\n  The whole world has changed since 9/11. We know that. We all have \ndifferent views, again, as to how we ought to adapt to that change, but \nwe cannot just ignore it. I think that is clear. History teaches us \nthat.\n  One of the things we have to learn and adjust to do is protect our \nhomeland. You cannot win the war on terror, in my opinion, with just an \noffense; you need a defense. Like any good sports team, like, say, the \nSyracuse Orangemen, who are playing in the NCAA, you need a good \noffense and a good defense.\n  There has been a great deal of focus on the offense. I do not think \nthere has been enough focus on the defense because terrorists, \nunfortunately, are going to be with us for a while. The new technology \nthat has blessed our lives and changed our country, that has created a \nlot of the prosperity we have seen in the last few decades, has an evil \nunderside, and that is that small groups of bad people can use that \ntechnology to do huge damage in our homeland, damage we never imagined \ncould be done until 2 years ago. That fact is going to be with us not \njust for 2 or 3 years, it is going to be with us for decades. And even \nif, God willing, we were to get rid of al-Qaida, and get rid of Saddam \nand his cronies who lead Iraq right now, there will be new terrorists \nwho will come up.\n  We have to protect our homeland. The odds are we will not be able to \ncatch up to every new terrorist group that starts. The sad fact is, you \ncan be in a cave anywhere in this world and if you have a wireless \nconnection to the Internet, you can learn a whole lot about America. \nThen even a small group united together can do real damage here. So we \nhave to look at every one of our weak pressure points and tighten them \nup.\n  You can't just be content to fight a war overseas. To preserve and to \nprotect our country, we must protect it at home. We have to try to \nthink ahead of the terrorists. We have to try to think where they will \nhit us so that we can prevent that from happening. The list is a long \none. There are probably places that no one has even thought of that we \nare weak in and where we need protection. But we have to do it.\n  I make one other point. We can't delay. It is a huge undertaking. \nThat is true. The terrorists will look to our weaknesses. That is true. \nIf we strengthen air security, they will look to rail. If we strengthen \nrail security, they will look to ports. If we deal with bioterrorism, \nthey will look at cyber-terrorism. Because of the information \nrevolution, they have access to everything about America. It is all on \nthe Internet. We will not stop the Internet. So we have to tighten up, \nand tightening up costs money.\n  This budget does not acknowledge that reality. That is the \nfundamental problem. I am honored and privileged to introduce this \namendment with my colleague from New York, as well as the help of the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, our minority \nleader Senator Daschle, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Byrd. A large \nnumber of our Democratic caucus participated in crafting it.\n  This budget resolution is the first step, but we are going to \ncontinue to fight on the supplemental appropriation that comes up and \nthroughout the year because we believe homeland security is an \nimperative for America. We believe we have to do something about it, \nand we can't wait. The horrible feeling that so many of us had on \nSeptember 12, mostly for the loss and the danger and damage, but also \nit already came into our minds, what if we had done this, what if we \nhad done that? As we learned more, there were lots more what ifs that \nwere asked. We don't want a second terrorist incident to occur and we \nare saying ``what if'' again. This amendment is intended to make the \nlikelihood of those what ifs much lower. It is an attempt to diminish \nit.\n  Let me explain what the amendment does. It provides an additional $88 \nbillion for fiscal years 2003 to 2013 for homeland security over and \nabove the current proposed 2004 budget, including $5 billion in the \nimmediate 2003 funding for first responders, port, border, and \ntransportation security. That is a limited amount of money, but \nremember we only have half a year left. We don't want to waste money. \nWe want it spent wisely. We thought this was about the maximum amount \nin this fiscal year, where everything is just getting started up in \nhomeland security, that people could use.\n  For 2004, the proposed budget would spend about $380 billion on \ndefense--I support that, I support our troops--but we are only spending \n$37.7 billion on homeland security. We can do better than that. We \nshould do better. I hope this amendment will be a bipartisan one in \nthat regard. It is fully offset, and it provides a little deficit \nreduction as well.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to my colleague for the purpose of a \nquestion.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much of an increase did you have in 2004? I heard \n$88 billion over the life of the bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In 2003, it is $5 billion. In 2004, it is approximately \n6.5.\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have no objection to my colleague sending the \namendment to the desk.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be sent to the desk.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To further clarify for all of our colleagues, we wish to \nreview amendments. That was the problem. I appreciate the cooperation \nof my colleague.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend from Oklahoma. I know that is what he \nwanted to do. We had brought it to the desk, and I had asked unanimous \nconsent because I thought they had seen it and approved it. I \nappreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Bingaman, \n     Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 299.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide immediate assistance to meet pressing homeland \nsecurity needs by providing funding in 2003 for first responders, port \nsecurity, bioterrorism preparedness and prevention, border security and \ntransit security, the FBI; to restore the elimination of funding of the \nCOPS program, firefighter equipment grants, Byrne Grants and Local Law \nenforcement grants; to provide a sustained commitment of resources for \nhomeland security needs without reducing funding to other key domestic \n    law enforcement and public safety priorities; and to reduce the \n

Madam President, the first part of this amendment deals \nwith homeland security. The additional homeland security requirements \non every one of our localities are enormous. Just yesterday, the mayor \nof my city, Mayor Bloomberg, and Secretary Tom Ridge announced that the \nadministration would be seeking additional funding for homeland \nsecurity in the next supplemental budget. That is a great first step. I \nhope there are sufficient resources to deal with the problem, \nparticularly with the first responders who are definitely suffering.\n  Since September 11, the Congress has worked with the administration \nin a bipartisan fashion in many ways. I hope this homeland security \nissue can become a bipartisan one as well. But it does involve spending \nthe dollars necessary. Words alone will not bring the homeland security \nthat our people need.\n  Let's first go to first responders. I know in New York City, first \nresponders are stretched as far as they can be. Like most other places, \nwe have fiscal problems. So the number, for instance, of police \nofficers is 4,000 lower than it was before. Many other agencies have \nfewer people working. In all instances, our police, firefighters, being \nthe patriotic people they are, have a high proportion in the reserves, \nso we are losing people going overseas to fight for us. At the same \ntime, there are huge new responsibilities. For instance, the many \nbridges and tunnels of New York City, the many buildings, houses of \nworship have to be guarded more carefully. That takes a huge expense. \nThat is during normal times. In addition to all of those expenses, our \npolice chief, Commissioner Kelly, set up something, with Mayor \nBloomberg, called Operation Atlas to deal with wartime. It is another \n$5 million a week. The mayor wisely said that he was not going to cut \nback on security if we didn't get Federal help for it, but it is \nstretching the people of our city and the first responders of our \ncity. That is true with the brave firefighters. That is true with other \nfirst responders. It is true with the hospital staff who have to \nprepare for, God forbid, a bioterrorist attack. Everywhere we look, \nthere are new needs. It is not just in New York City.\n\n  I have an article from yesterday's Rochester Democratic Chronicle, \nthe leading paper in Rochester. It talks about Rochester. It is a \nmiddle-size city. It has about 230,000 people in the city, close to a \nmillion in the greater metropolitan area--800,000. The city has its own \nburdens, as does every city. It is on Lake Ontario, which is pretty \nmuch unguarded. It is near the Canadian border. It is a little bit east \nof Lackawanna, which is near Buffalo, where the cell was found.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Rochester Democratic Chronicle, Mar. 19, 2003]\n\n         Rochester Area Prepares for War by Tightening Security\n\n                          (By Michael Wentzel)\n\n       The approach of war and a new plan to protect the nation \n     from terrorist attacks means\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\n     increased surveillance and awareness in the Rochester area.\n       With tight security already in place, some said no \n     operational changes would occur following the launch Tuesday \n     of Operation Liberty Shield, the Department of Homeland \n     Security's new defense plan.\n       But there were additional patrols and checks at the Greater \n     Rochester International Airport. Monroe County will expand \n     water supply inspections. Department of Homeland Security \n     officials began asking more questions at Canadian border \n     crossings.\n       ``We're following the directive of the government to \n     elevate our awareness levels,'' said Mark Cavanaugh, \n     University of Rochester's director of environmental health \n     and safety. ``We're prepared, and we're telling our people to \n     be prepared.''\n\n\n                                airport\n\n       One of the few visible signs locally of tougher security--\n     roadblocks on the terminal access road at the Greater \n     Rochester International Airport--went up about 4:45 p.m. \n     Tuesday. Security guards will conduct spot checks of \n     vehicles, looking for signs of a terrorist threat, said David \n     Bassett, the federal security director at the airport.\n       Travelers may also notice more deputies and bomb-sniffing \n     dogs in the terminal and passenger screeners who are more \n     attentive.\n       Airport director Terrance Slaybaugh said air travelers \n     still need to arrive at least 75 minutes early to clear \n     security at the airport.\n       Slaybaugh said the county has opted to use Pinkerton \n     security guards, not sheriff's deputies, at the roadblocks \n     because of ``man-power, staffing availability, cost.'' A \n     deputy is to be stationed with the guards while roadblocks \n     are active, he said.\n\n\n                              water border\n\n       Dick Metzger, Monroe County Water Authority's director of \n     production, said security patrols, water supply inspections \n     and water quality sampling will increase.\n       ``We're taking all kinds of efforts to make sure the water \n     quality is proper and the quantity is always going to be \n     there,'' Metzger said.\n       The city has a plan to protect reservoirs if there is an \n     increased security threat, said Edward Doherty, city \n     commissioner of environmental sciences. Doherty declined to \n     reveal the details for security reasons.\n       ``Obviously it's something we have to be concerned about, \n     but we don't really see it as a high-level risk,'' Doherty \n     said.\n       Officials at City Hall reported no changes in security \n     measures. Monroe County officials also reported no obvious \n     changes in security at their facilities. The county emergency \n     operations center, which might be used to respond to a \n     terrorist threat, has not been activated.\n       The Department of Homeland Security increased surveillance \n     and monitoring of checkpoints along the New York-Canadian \n     border Tuesday.\n       As a result, customs and border protection officers will \n     ask more questions of travelers wishing to enter the country, \n     said Janet Rapaport, spokeswoman for Customs and Border \n     Protection, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security. \n     And more agents will patrol the border between major points \n     of entry, she said.\n\n\n                              ginna, kodak\n\n       No new measures were announced at the Ginna nuclear power \n     plant, where security forces have been on heightened alert \n     since Sept. 11, 2001.\n       ``If any changes are recommended by (federal) agencies, we \n     will take appropriate action,'' the plant's owner, Rochester \n     Gas and Electric Corp., said in a statement.\n       Eastman Kodak Co., manufactures chemicals at Kodak Park for \n     a variety of uses in photography, radiology and imaging-\n     related businesses. The company ``is not at liberty'' to \n     discuss security, spokesman Jim Blamphin said, but Kodak has \n     done a complete review and update of all crisis management \n     plans.\n\n\n                              food supply\n\n       Concerns about a terrorist attack on agriculture has been \n     around since Sept. 11, 2001.\n       Wyoming County Sheriff Ronald Ely said deputies are still \n     taking more care to patrol around dairy farms in the wake of \n     milk tampering problems over the past two years.\n       Wayne County Sheriff Richard Pisciotti said patrols are \n     also on alert after the theft of liquid fertilizer from \n     various New York state farms.\n       Francois Lachance, manager at Star of the West Milling Co. \n     in Churchville, said there is a greater awareness of \n     nonemployees on company property.\n       Trucks have always been specially sealed before they leave \n     the plant.\n       UR's researchers who use radioactive materials have been \n     reminded that security is more important now than ever, said \n     Andrew Karam, the university's radiation safety officer. UR \n     has locked more areas and restricted use of keys.\n\n\n                            federal building\n\n       U.S. Marshal Peter Lawrence, whose office is in charge of \n     safe-guarding the Kenneth B. Keating Federal Building on \n     State Street, said nothing new was planned as of Tuesday.\n       Lawrence said there was nothing in the new security \n     environment that would cause officials to impede lawful, \n     peaceful demonstrations at the federal building, scene of \n     anti-war protests.\n\n\n                              city schools\n\n       City school principals Tuesday will meet with school staff \n     to inform them of new security measures and let them know \n     what measures will be taken if the alert is bumped higher.\n       At the current level, all planned field trips must be \n     reapproved, surveillance is increased, security at after-\n     school activities is increased and principals are required to \n     stay on campus throughout the day.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. Madam President, this article talks \nabout what Rochester has to do. It talks about the airport and how they \nneed new security and are dealing with new security at the airport. It \ntalks about the border.\n  Again, Rochester is on the border. There is Lake Ontario, but like \nmany cities in the Northeast and Middle West, it shares a border or is \nclose to a border with Canada. It talks about some miles east of \nRochester is the Ginna Nuclear Power Plant. It has to be protected. We \ncannot leave it open the way it was before.\n  Kodak, the largest employer in Rochester, uses huge amounts of \nchemicals that are flammable. Rochester is doing what it can to protect \nKodak.\n  The food supply: We have a lot of farming areas in that part of our \nState, very prosperous, very fertile farms. People are worried, our \nauthorities are worried about the food supply and food tampering. So \nthey are looking at that area.\n  The Federal building, which houses some judges and other offices and \nlaw enforcement, has to be guarded. The State of my friend from \nOklahoma was hit several years ago. We cannot leave our Federal \nbuildings unguarded. We learned our lesson.\n  City schools: This is just the city government.\n  We then have the hospitals. We have everything the private sector is \ndoing. This scenario in Rochester is a typical city. It could be any \ncity repeated anywhere in our country.\n  What help is Rochester getting for all these extra burdens? Rochester \nis getting virtually no extra help. We know one of three things will \nhappen, none of them good. Either the city, because it does not have \nthe money, will not do everything it can for security--that is the \nleast good choice; security must come first--or other services will be \nundersupplied and no help.\n  If you are a citizen in New York City, Rochester, Buffalo, or any \nother place, you certainly do not want to be made safer from terrorists \nbut be made less safe from the criminals. If you are a citizen, you \nwant to make sure your firefighters know how to deal with terrorism--\nbiological or chemical, God forbid, if it should come--but you do not \nwant to be made less safe from the scourge of fire. That is the second \nchoice.\n  The third choice is the city does both and then has to raise the \nproperty tax, which God knows is high enough.\n  It seems to me if there were ever a Federal responsibility, it is \nhere for our first responders.\n  What do we propose to do in this amendment? We propose to support our \nfirst responders throughout the country in a measured but important \nway. The bill provides $35 billion over the proposed budget plan's \nfunding level for the fiscal years 2003 to 2013 to provide first \nresponder grants to States and localities to be used for hiring, for \nequipping, for training first responders, as well as covering related \novertime costs.\n  The amendment includes an additional $3.5 billion for first responder \ngrants for fiscal year 2003 to ensure that cities and States can get \nneeded funds immediately.\n  On September 11, 2001, we know these first responders in New York \nCity and elsewhere put their lives on the line to serve their country, \njust as our Armed Forces do. It is a different way, but they are brave \nand need help, and we should be backing them up just as we back up our \nsoldiers.\n  Next, in terms of first responders, we restore the cuts to law \nenforcement and to firefighters. The State and local law enforcement \nagencies deserve an increased commitment from the Federal Government, \nand this amendment restores $10 billion in cuts to State and local law \nenforcement and fire programs. The COPS Program, which is so important \nin bringing about security, is restored. The fire program--I see my \ncolleague from Connecticut on the floor. He was instrumental in \nbringing up the fire program. That is vital.\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\nByrne grants, that is part of this amendment. All of the Byrne grants \nare restored, and other areas.\n\n  I know there will be individual amendments on this issue. My \ncolleague from New York and I are offering individual amendments on \ndifferent parts of these issues that will be debated and voted on \nlater. But this amendment has it all in one package. If my colleagues \nare for helping first responders throughout the country, this amendment \nis important. We do not just deal with personnel. We deal with \nequipment. Our police, fire, and emergency workers need new equipment. \nThey have to guard, just as the soldiers do, against biological and \nchemical weaponry.\n  Again, the local cupboard is bare. The cities, the States do not have \nmoney to do this. Are we going to delay the safety of our citizens for \nseveral years, or is the Federal Government going to step up to the \nplate in terms of its responsibility?\n  Again, I am delighted that Secretary Ridge announced that the \nsupplemental appropriations will contain new dollars, but how many? Is \nit enough? Is it similar to this amendment which, as I said, will be \ndrawn tightly but mindful of real needs?\n  The amendment increases the much needed funding for firefighters, \nhiring, and equipment, including the FIRE and SAFER Acts, by providing \n$11 billion over 10 years. So on first responders, this bill is \ncarefully drawn but does the job. It is certainly adequate, and it is \nwhat we need. It is a very fine first start.\n  I hope we will not repeat the mistake of either not funding these \nprograms or funding them in a small way, mainly by taking money out of \nexisting programs which does not make it any easier for our police \ndepartments, our fire departments, or anybody else.\n  There are other areas that need help in terms of homeland security as \nwell. Our first responders are extremely important, and they get the \nmajority of the money that we have proposed here, but there are lots of \nFederal responsibilities as well.\n  Port security, for instance, is an issue that I have become very \nconcerned about and interested in. How could terrorists strike? As I \nmentioned earlier, they can strike in a myriad of ways, and they are \ngoing to look at our weak pressure points. One thing they could do is \nsmuggle something in a ship, in a container that comes by our ports: \nthe worst case scenario, a nuclear bomb.\n  I have talked long about that dreadful possibility and what we can do \nabout it. My friend from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, has been a \nleader on this issue in terms of making sure we know what is in the \ncontainers and that someone cannot sneak something in. I have been \nfighting for nuclear detection devices that could be attached to every \ncrane that loads or unloads a container. We need both.\n  Again, we are underfunding port security rather dramatically. The \namendment does these two things on port security, as well as several \nother things. As we know, in the Budget Act we cannot lay out the \nspecifics but we know it will go a long way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for an additional 10 minutes from my colleague.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield an additional 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend from North Dakota.\n  So we have an additional $500 million in 2003, an additional $625 \nmillion in 2004, and we total $7.8 billion over the 10-year period that \nwe are adding things on.\n  Right now, only 2 percent of the cargo containers are screened. Not \nevery container is going to be screened. We know some of them are more \nsuspicious than others. But most experts say it has to go up along with \nour ability to both track containers that come in and then secure them \nso nobody can come in after we know what is in the container, if it \nloads, say, in Rotterdam, and then someone sneaks something else in--to \nmake sure that does not happen.\n  Another issue is rail and transit security. Many of our cities have \nlarge tunnels in which terrorists could do some dastardly actions. Our \nown Penn Station in New York City is a classic example. It is almost a \nmile of tunnel with no egress, poor ventilation, thousands of people on \ncommuter trains during rush hour going in or going out, from the whole \nnortheast area, not just from New York. We have to do something about \nthat.\n  We have to do more to deal with truck security. Again, a method of \nchoice of terrorists has been to take hazardous material, place it on a \ntruck and then explode it. Of all places, Brazil has a good system \nusing GPS and assigned routes. They can tell immediately if a truck \ngoes off track, if it is a hazardous material truck. We do not do that. \nThe Brazilians, by the way, have saved money by implementing this \nbecause the number of stolen trucks has greatly decreased.\n  The bottom line is that there are many other places in transportation \nsecurity that is not air and that is not rail, where we have to be more \nsecure. This amendment proposes a $5 billion increase for the TSA's \nbudget to start doing these things.\n  Those of us from Washington State to Maine who share the border with \nCanada know how unguarded it is. We have been proud of our unguarded \nborder. The Canadian Government does its best to cooperate, but we do \nnot have close to the number of personnel and detection devices that \nare needed to make the northern border secure. The southern border \nneeds help as well, but not close to the amount that the northern \nborder does. The number of personnel in my State, which shares several \nhundred miles of border with Canada, is small and not enough.\n  We have to do more. The detection devices that have worked rather \nsuccessfully on the southern border are not installed. Then border \nsecurity needs other help because of commerce that cities such as \nBuffalo and Detroit and Seattle-Tacoma have with Canada. We need all \nkinds of new computer systems so we can check trucks quickly. We want \nto have both commerce and security, and we can if we provide the \ndollars.\n\n  If the dollars are not provided, you are either going to have weak \nsecurity or you are going to have to go the old route and try to \ninspect so many trucks that the traffic is backed up at the border for \nhours, the economy suffers, and the number of jobs decline. So we have \nto do that as well.\n  The amendment provides $8.2 billion over 10 years for border \nsecurity, $450 million in this remaining 6 months of the fiscal year.\n  The FBI, that is another place where homeland security matters. The \nFBI was in poor shape in terms of counterterrorism before 9/11. It is \ntrying to move quickly, but it needs more help.\n  The computer system is still almost laughable. I have had lengthy \ndiscussions with Director Mueller. They are trying their best, they are \nworking hard, but we should not have money be a barrier to them doing \nwhat they need to do.\n  Intelligence gathering, we are rearranging those agencies and \nrestructuring them to make the synapse between domestic and foreign \nintelligence less of a barrier. That is a great idea. It takes dollars. \nWhile the leadership says the FBI has all the money they need, go talk \nto the people in the ranks, they do not think so. So we add an \nadditional billion dollars in funding for the FBI to hire new \npersonnel, particularly analysts and translators, and upgrade critical \ninfrastructure.\n  Bioterrorism, this is a place where we have made some progress but \nnot enough. Aside from the money our first responders need in terms of \nlocal government, in terms of hospitals--we are asking so many \nhospitals to do the job in terms of bioterrorism. I do not have a \nproblem with that. I do not think there has to be a new Federal agency, \nbut it takes dollars to store the vaccines; to do the training about \nhow to administer the various programs; to do the training, how to spot \nthe illnesses. With bioterrorism, we know early detection is vital. The \namendment provides $5.7 billion for bioterrorism initiatives to improve \nthe public health sector's ability to prepare for disasters and local \ngovernments' ability to cover the cost.\n  Finally, threat assessment and critical infrastructure assessment, \nthe amendment provides a billion dollars so we can know what we are \ndoing and we can stay ahead of other potential\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\nweak pressure points that we do not know about now. Critical \ninfrastructure such as chemical plants and nuclear powerplants and \nwater infrastructure, they need to be protected. We are not sure even \nhow to do it. We have had no blueprint and it is being done differently \nin different States, with varying degrees of success. The Federal \nGovernment has to be more involved. So we provide a billion dollars to \nconduct an assessment of the relative threat levels in coordination \nwith intelligence and to begin to prepare to protect these areas.\n  Here, our first responder money will play in because it will not be \nFederal people who do this. It will be local people. But they need to \nknow what to do.\n  I will have more to say later, but this is a basic outline of our \nproposal. There is large help for first responders, $38 billion over 10 \nyears, an immediate shot in the arm in 2003 and then large funding \nlevels in 2004; help in the other areas where we need help.\n  We have not covered everything, but we have covered a lot. As we work \nthrough the appropriations process, we will hope to refine them.\n  In conclusion, I ask my colleagues to look at this amendment. I ask \nthem to ask themselves if we have done enough on homeland security. I \nask them to answer the infamous ``what if'' question. How many of us \nwant to be here the morning after, God forbid, another attack on our \nhomeland and say, what if? This amendment prevents that what if. It \ngoes a long way to preventing that what if. I hope it will receive \nbroad and bipartisan support.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York, Mrs. Clinton.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the ranking member on the Budget Committee, and \nI thank my colleague and partner from New York for the Herculean effort \nhe has undertaken on behalf of the cause of homeland security. Senator \nSchumer and I, of course, have been personally impacted by the need for \nenhanced security in a very horrific way because of the events of \nSeptember 11 and the ongoing threats posed to New York City and other \ncommunities throughout our State where terrorist cells are under \nsurveillance and finally discovered in Lackawanna, NY, where people are \narrested in Syracuse, NY, for their likely connections with the funding \nof organizations that support terrorism. I don't think it is a \ncoincidence or an accident that the two Senators from New York would be \nstanding here in the Senate advocating as strongly as we can for the \nSchumer-Clinton homeland security amendment to this budget.\n  Before my words of support to the specifics that the amendment \ncontains, I am somewhat concerned that as we meet here today, our men \nand women are in harm's way in the Persian Gulf. I believe we should be \nsuspending action on the budget. We should be focusing in this Chamber, \nas families and citizens across America are focusing on their \ntelevision sets, on the Internet, on what is by far the most important \nissue confronting us: the execution of this war. We hope it will be a \ndecisive and overwhelmingly successful effort accomplished as quickly \nas possible, with a minimum loss of life. I know the thoughts and \nprayers of all of us go out to those wearing the military uniform of \nour Nation and their families, their loved ones, who are praying for \nthem.\n  I certainly, like all my colleagues, have had the great and high \nprivilege of meeting and being with these young men and women. They are \nby far the best prepared, equipped, and motivated military in the \nhistory of the world. We are all very proud of their skill, their \ntraining, and their courage. We should not only continue to do \neverything possible to support them at this time, but it would be \nappropriate for us to suspend action on the budget, especially, I must \nadd, because I don't know that we are fully able to debate and pass a \nbudget at this moment in history.\n  It seems quite odd to me, while we are commenced upon a war, we have \nno funding for that war in this budget. We have no money for the \nproposed reconstruction of Iraq that has been discussed in the \nadministration. We have no money for whatever other consequences--\nintended or unintended--that might flow from the action begun last \nevening.\n  Unfortunately, history will judge us harshly, because we are moving \nforward on parallel tracks to debate and vote on a budget that does not \ntake account of the most overwhelming challenge we are facing. What is \nwrong with this picture? It makes absolutely no sense. I am stunned \nthat we are, on the one hand, holding our hearts and our breath while \nwe listen and see what is happening thousands of miles away that will \nhave a direct effect not just on the lives of our brave men and women \nin the military who are fighting this battle, but will have a direct \neffect on every single American--that we are making decisions without \nhaving the information. We are being asked to vote on a budget that \ndoes not even pay for this war.\n  I find this truly unbelievable. But that is the choice of this \nleadership, and therefore we have to go along as though this were \nbusiness as usual. Let's just get up and debate a budget that does not \neven pay for the war that is going on now. I am sorry, I find that hard \nto explain to myself, and I find it impossible to explain to my \nconstituents.\n\n  Then I pick up the Wall Street Journal, and there is an article, \napparently sourced from people within the administration, that \ncontracts are being let for the reconstruction of Iraq, and in it--I am \nsure Americans would be interested to hear--our Government is to \nguarantee health care to Iraqis. We are going to guarantee good schools \nto Iraqi schoolchildren. We are going to build highways. We are going \nto build powerplants. I don't know that any of us would argue with that \nnoble goal, but we are letting contracts, as we speak, for American \nbusinesses to undertake this contracting work.\n  When are we going to provide for every American? It is certainly not \nin this budget we are debating. When are we going to provide good \nschools and the facilities our children deserve? It is not in this \nbudget we are debating. When are we going to make sure we have our \ntransportation needs met in our country, in every part of our country? \nIt is not in this budget we are debating.\n  Madam President, there are a lot of unanswered questions that deserve \nan answer. But one of those has to do with this amendment that is \ncurrently before the Senate. If you look at this budget, not only are \nwe not even attempting to fund the war, but we do not adequately fund \nthe second front of the war; namely, the threat of terrorism right here \non our shores.\n  We have to cover the costs of this war, and we should be honest about \nit. There are choices to be made. Apparently this body, under its \ncurrent leadership, wants to avoid those choices. They do not want the \nAmerican people to know that coming down the road in a couple of days, \nor a week at most, there is going to be a supplemental to pay for the \nwar. Will it be $65 billion, $95 billion? We do not know. It is going \nto come to the Senate, and of course we will debate it, but why aren't \nwe being honest with ourselves and with the rest of America? Put the \ncosts of this war in this budget.\n  The choices we are asking Senators to make are going to have a direct \nimpact on the choices Americans can make. We already know this budget \nis hurtling us into deficits as far as the eye can see. I have never \nseen such fiscal irresponsibility passed on to the backs of our \nchildren. The young people, 18, 19, 20-year-old soldiers over there \nfighting for us, are the ones who will pay for this irresponsibility. I \nfind that absolutely unbelievable.\n  There are a lot of questions to be asked and answered, but certainly \namong our priorities, if we intend to go forward with this budget which \ndoes not account for the war, which does not make the hard choices that \nAmericans have to live with, then certainly we had better make sure we \nare funding homeland security because the one thing all of the security \nexperts agree on is that, yes, we will win, but we will also reap the \nwhirlwind. There will be additional terrorist activities here at home \nand on Americans around the world, and we have to be prepared.\n  These homeland security costs should be not only included but \nincreased because right now they are\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\nbeing borne by cities and counties and States that are in deficit \nthemselves. They do not have any revenues. The economy is flat. There \nis no money coming in. They are laying off firefighters. They are \nclosing police stations.\n  Our hospitals are wondering whether they are going to be able to \ncontinue to take in the ambulances that come to the emergency entrance \nor whether they are going to have to divert them because their funding \nis under so much pressure.\n  Yesterday my colleague and I, Senator Schumer, met with the mayor of \nNew York. Everybody knows there is not any better prepared city in the \nworld than New York and everybody knows there is not any city under \nmore stress and more potential for terrorism than New York. God bless \nour firefighters and our police officers and our emergency workers. \nThey are on 12-hour shifts on, 12-hour shifts off. Every time the \nthreat level increases in America as a whole, it goes up even higher in \nNew York.\n  The operation that New York City has put into effect to try to \nprevent terrorism, called Operation Atlas, is spending $5 million a \nweek. We are already cutting $2.5 billion out of the New York City \nbudget. We are going to have to cut even more, according to the mayor. \nBut what choice do we have? New York is a global city, not only an \nAmerican city. It is where the United Nations is. It is where so much \nelse happens. Our mayor and our police and fire and other emergency \nworkers are doing a tremendous job, but we cannot continue to shoulder \nthese costs on our own.\n  Our national security and our homeland security needs should be in \nthis budget. We should be putting into this budget the cost of the war \nin the Persian Gulf and the cost of defending ourselves in New York and \nacross America.\n  If we are going forward, business as usual, with a very unusual \nbudget that does not fairly lay out the costs and the choices before \nthe American people, then the very least we can do is, in a bipartisan \nway, resoundingly pass the Schumer-Clinton amendment. This amendment \nrestores cuts to important traditional first responder programs. It \nsets aside $8 billion for each of the next 10 years. And it does \nsomething that is desperately needed in this budget when it comes to \nhomeland security: It does not take money away from existing law \nenforcement and firefighting programs and move it over into another \ncategory and say, guess what, we have now provided homeland security. \nThat is the oldest shell game in the world.\n  This budget cuts the COPS Program, cuts the local law enforcement \nblock grant, cuts the Byrne memorial program, cuts the FIRE Act, cuts \nthe SAFER Act. I don't think we in good conscience can cut the programs \nthat keep the police on the street, the firefighters in the firehouse \nto do what they have to do every day, and then turn around and, with \ntheir additional responsibilities, claim we have given them the \nresources for these new burdens and challenges. These resources must \ncome in addition to and not at the expense of these other critically \nnecessary law enforcement and firefighting programs.\n  As we go through this and look at the specific programs, we have \ntried to increase the programs that keep the operations going day to \nday and to provide the additional funding that is necessary. Let me \ngive one example.\n  In fiscal year 2002, Congress appropriated $360 million for the FIRE \nAct. The FIRE Act is a program that assists fire departments in \nprotecting local communities. Those communities may use it for \ntraining, equipment, and additional staffing. It has been a Godsend to \nboth professional and volunteer fire departments across New York and \nacross America.\n  As to the $360 million appropriated, there are more than $2 billion \nin requests from fire departments for this funding--six times the \namount appropriated. Yet the proposed budget provides only $500 million \nfor the FIRE Act for fiscal year 2004. The Schumer-Clinton amendment \nwould add $250 million, so we could at least try a little harder to \nmeet the legitimate requests of fire departments.\n\n  Currently, two-thirds of our Nation's fire departments do not even \nmeet the standards for adequate staffing. I don't think this Congress \nwould ever allow our Army to engage in a war with two-thirds of its \ndivisions understaffed. Incredibly, that is exactly what we are asking \nour firefighters to do.\n  This amendment also provides additional funding for bioterrorism \npreparedness and prevention. The budget provides a mere $400 million \nfor these critical needs. Even with the funding that we offered last \nyear under the leadership of Senators Kennedy and Frist, that is not \nenough. Many local and State public health departments do not have the \nfacilities or the equipment to perform routine surveillance or \nepidemiological investigation, or do the lab work to identify any kind \nof foreign matter. At the same time, we have loaded the burden of the \nsmallpox vaccination effort on top of everything else public health \ndepartments are supposed to be doing, again without adequate funding.\n  I asked at several counties in my State, what are the tradeoffs? That \nis what happens at the local community. We can have this debate and \npretend there are no tradeoffs, that we are not going to pay for the \nlaw, that we are going to cut funding for local law enforcement and \nfirefighters and let somebody else worry about it. We will be the \nSenate that cuts taxes so they have to be raised at the local level or \nelse local communities have to do without essential services.\n  I asked about the tradeoffs in one county, Onondaga County, where \nSyracuse is. In order to deal with the smallpox vaccination challenge, \nthey have had to go out and cut all their other programs. They had to \ncut the Maternal and Child Health Program; they had to cut the women's \nhealth examination program; they had to cut the regular examinations \nand screenings for breast cancer and cervical cancer; they have had to \ncut pediatric dental visits and preschool and early intervention family \nservices.\n  Nobody is saying we do not want to be prepared in the horrific event \nof a smallpox terrorist attack, but don't we also want to take care of \nour maternal child and health needs? Our children's dental needs? Why \nare we putting ourselves into making these false choices?\n  I will tell you why. Because the other side is intent upon this huge \ntax cut no matter what the war costs, no matter what homeland security \nneeds are, no matter what the choices are. I have to say I am no great \nhistorian, but I think history will look back on this moment and will, \nif not shaking its head and scratching its chin, certainly wonder how \non Earth, at a time of an international crisis for America's \nleadership, we would unilaterally decide to drive our economy and this \nGovernment into the deficit ditch.\n  That is for my friends on the other side of the aisle to answer. I \ndon't have an answer. I find it unbelievable that it is even a question \nwe have to be addressing at this moment in time.\n  There is much to be done that would at least try to interject some \ncommon sense, some reality into this budget. But under any objective \nassessment of where we stand in the world right now, this budget should \nbe a nonstarter. It should be withdrawn from the floor. Every one of us \nshould be saying: My goodness, we have higher obligations. How can we \nkeep faith with those young men and women who are on the front lines \nfor us? How can we keep faith with those young men and women who are on \nthe front lines at home for us? How can we continue to provide the \nquality of life and economic opportunity that is expected in our \ncountry?\n\n  We are in danger of being the first generation of Americans to leave \nour children worse off than we were. Mark my words, no generation of \nAmericans has ever done that. We are about to do that. We are about to \nload onto the backs of our children and those lucky enough to have \ngrandchildren the unknowable costs of military actions that may be \nnecessary to protect our freedoms; the unknowable costs of ongoing \nsecurity to protect us here at home; and the very certain costs of \nproviding quality, affordable health care and quality education and \ndecent transportation--to say nothing of keeping faith with Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  This is a very solemn moment, and it is not only solemn because of \nwhat is happening in the Persian Gulf; it is solemn because of the \nextraordinary commitment of this Senate leadership to take action that \nwill not stand the test of time.\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\n  But, if we go forward on this budget, I hope we will, in a bipartisan \nway, not only increase our homeland security amount, but I will be \noffering a domestic defense fund based on nearly 18 months of work. It \nwould go into the Department of Homeland Security to get money directly \nto first responders, to put money directly to places of high threat \nsuch as New York and Washington, and money into a flexible fund that \ncan be drawn down by communities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield an additional 5 minutes to the \nSenator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, this domestic defense fund would lift the budget cap \nfor fiscal year 2003 when we finally do get the supplemental that I am \nsure will be presented to us in the very near future. And it would send \na clear message that we are not going to wait on this budget to get \nmoney out to our first responders to relieve the necessary costs of our \nlocal communities; we are going to try to get that money out when it is \nneeded. Operation Atlas is going on right now in New York City. \nOperation Liberty Shield is going on right now in America. We can't \nwait until the end of the year for the ordinary budget process to work \nto get money out, to make us safer, to give the tools to defend us to \nour firefighters and our police officers.\n  This is a solemn time. Not only are my heartfelt feelings and prayers \ngoing out to those brave young men and women, but in good conscience I \nwant to be sure we are doing what we should be doing. And with all \nrespect, I don't think we should be doing business as usual. I do not \nthink we should be considering a budget that is as devoid of reality as \nis this one. That sends a terrible message that here we are making \nflowery speeches, talking about our prayers and our best wishes for our \nmen and women in uniform, and decimating--decimating--our ability to \nrespond to the inevitable, unpredictable consequences of the action we \nhave commenced. We owe more to the next generation. I hope we will \ndecide to put aside previously existing ideological and partisan \npositions and come together in this Senate, as we are coming together \nin this country, on behalf of the military and on behalf of the country \nthey are fighting to defend.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to say that I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this vital amendment for more homeland \nsecurity funding being introduced by Senator Schumer. And I come to \ntalk about the necessity of making hard choices.\n  I know this administration can make hard choices. I know it because \nin taking military action against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, that \nis precisely what the President has done made a difficult but necessary \ndecision for the sake of America's security.\n  Unfortunately, I don't see the same willingness to make hard choices \nhere at home, particularly when it comes to our budget and our economy. \nOn Sunday, I saw Vice President Cheney on Meet the Press and he said \nsomething that stuck in my mind. The Vice President was asked why his \nadministration wouldn't reconsider the unaffordable, unfair, and \nunfocused tax cuts that it pushed through in 2001, not to mention the \nnew tax cuts called for this year, when we have so many other national \nneeds: the cost of military action against Iraq, the cost of rebuilding \nthe Nation after war, the cost of investing in homeland security, just \nto name three.\n  His response was telling. He said that Presidents don't have the \nluxury of doing only one thing at a time, that this administration has \nmany ``balls in the air,'' and that President Bush must tend to the \neconomy even as he works to defend our national security.\n  I agree with the Vice President on the premise--but could not \ndisagree more strongly on the implication. Yes, Presidents must do more \nthan one thing at a time, and our best Presidents always have. \nPresident Lincoln did. President Roosevelt did. President Kennedy did. \nBut by putting the tax cut, which is itself an ineffective prescription \nfor our economic woes, before every other priority, this administration \nisn't multitasking. It's unitasking. It's sacrificing every other \ncritical mission and priority to one ideological pet project--\nunfocused, unfair, and irresponsible tax cuts.\n  As a result, our national cupboard has been raided. We have no \nresources left to shore up Social Security, pay down the debt, provide \nour seniors with the prescription drug benefit they need, or invest in \nthe landmark education reform plan we promised our teachers and \nstudents. No money left to make smart investments and strategic tax \ncuts to spur growth. Not even enough money left to pay for homeland \nsecurity, even though right here at home we are under unprecedented \nattack from an aggressive, unpredictable, and undeterrable new enemy \nagainst which we remain dangerously vulnerable.\n  The casual question, which might not sound fit for the Senate floor, \nis: ``What gives?''\n  And the unacceptable answer is: ``Nothing gives.'' Tax cuts that help \na select few Americans, tax cuts designed before September 11th, before \nthe prospect of an expensive military action against Iraq and an \nexpensive peace to follow, before Americans started losing jobs in the \nhundreds of thousands, trump everything else. No, with all these needs \nand demands, the President will hold onto his tax cut, come hell or \nhigh water.\n  Mr. President, that is worse than a failure of arithmetic, as \nPresident Clinton called it. It is a failure of understanding. A \nfailure of principle. A failure of priorities.\n  Sadly, this administration has taken to believing that everything in \nits economic policy is absolute. Everything is extreme. There is no \nroom left for learning. No room for pragmatic adjustment. No room for \nthe critical needs of the American people. Today I want to discuss some \nof those needs--our urgent domestic defense priorities and how they can \nand must be paid for in this budget.\n  Mr. President, America has the greatest military in the world, and \nthat is because we have paid for it. Over the last half century, we \nhave worked together across party lines and every other division to \ninvest in our Armed Forces and the men and women who dedicate their \nlives to the common defense. We are truly, to recall President Kennedy, \nwilling to pay any price and bear any burden to deter and defeat \nforeign threats.\n  If we want the best domestic defenses, we will have to pay for them, \ntoo. But consider this. In its budget proposal for next year, the \nadministration recommended a $19 billion increase in defense spending--\nan increase I support. But in the very same budget proposal, the \nadministration only called for $300 million more than they expected \nspending this year on our homeland defenses, which are far less \nprepared to protect our people today than the Pentagon is.\n  This amendment would begin to correct that shortsighted shortfall. In \nthe fiscal year 2003 budget, it would provide $5 billion above current \nlevels in funding for our first responders, for port security, for \nbioterrorism preparedness, and for border security. I am supporting \nmore funding both as part of this resolution and in the supplemental \nwhen it comes before the Senate--particularly for our first responders.\n  In fiscal year 2004, Senator Schumer's amendment would provide $6.5 \nbillion over the President's proposal for police, firefighters, and \npublic health professionals, port security, bioterrorism preparedness, \nborder security, transportation security, critical infrastructure \nprotection, and more. All told, this amendment would invest $88 billion \nin the urgent domestic defense improvements we need to make between now \nand 2013--a long-term vision of rising to meet and beat these threats, \nnot shrink from them.\n  Independently, last month I called for an increased homeland security \ninvestment in next year's budget of $16 billion over the President's \nproposal, which is what I have concluded is necessary to begin doing \nall this vital work. So I see this amendment not as a complete number, \nbut as significant progress in the right direction.\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\n  Let me talk now about a few of the urgent needs that this amendment \nwill help address.\n  First, first responders. Just this Monday, I attended the legislative \nconference of the International Association of Firefighters, and I must \nsay that, though these brave men and women are always ready to take on \na challenge and rise to meet danger, our firefighters, police officers, \nand other first responders are tired. They are tired of lacking the \nresources to hire new people, get advanced training, and buy state-of-\nthe-art technology, all of which are urgently needed to fight \nterrorism.\n  Can't we come together now and get this done?\n  Mr. President, it is downright irresponsible that the President's \nbudget for next year would provide no new money for first responders. \nThe President's proposal would make the same total $3.5 billion \ninvestment next year as was made this year. And even that is deceptive, \nbecause at the same time the budget would slash other funding for local \nlaw enforcement and emergency preparedness.\n  This amendment would restore COPS and other local law enforcement \nprograms in fiscal year 2004. It would provide the money for training, \nequipment, and qualified personnel. And it would call for $5 billion in \nfunding this year--in an fiscal year 2003 supplemental the bulk of \nwhich would go to our first responders.\n  There is a real crisis out there. We need to help our police \nofficers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians and other first \nresponders meet it.\n  I believe the investment we make in our first responders needs to \nstart by passing the SAFER Act, sponsored by my dear friends Senators \nDodd and Warner which I am proud to cosponsor. That bill would provide \nmore than $7.5 billion over 7 years so our communities can hire the \nfirefighters they need. It is critical, it is bipartisan, and it should \npass. This budget amendment we are discussing today would provide a \ngood start in fiscal year 2004 for the bill.\n  But that is just a beginning. First responders need advanced \ntraining, specifically in detecting and protecting against chemical, \nbiological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. This amendment will \nprovide more of the resources they need to get them that training.\n  First responders need better equipment. On September 11th, the New \nJersey State Police grew so frustrated at their inability to contact \nNew York City authorities that they had to take a boat across the \nHudson River and find a police commander at Ground Zero. And as we \nknow, New York City firefighters tragically lost their lives because \ntheir communications equipment was not what it needed to be. This \namendment will provide the resources to start to get first responders \nall over the country the communications equipment they need to prevent \nsimilar problems from occurring when they face emergencies.\n  This amendment gives our local first responders--who are also our \nfirst preventers of terrorist attacks--more of the resources they \nurgently need to guard against terrorism.\n  As we work to strengthen our local first responders' capabilities, we \nneed to dramatically improve transportation security nationwide. The \ntype of attack we suffered on September 11th was, of course, of a very \nparticular and unexpected nature. In its wake, improving the security \nof air travel has received substantial attention and substantial \nfunding. And we have made serious progress in the skies.\n  But just as terrorists constantly change their means and mode of \nattack, the TSA must broaden its scope of defense--and rapidly. But \nunder the President's proposal and this budget resolution, TSA's \nappropriation is actually decreased for next year--which will make it \ndifficult to keep pace with their current responsibilities, much less \ntake on new ones. This amendment would give the agency critical \nresources so that TSA could begin expanding its focus to other critical \ntransportation security needs including roads, rails, bridges, tunnels, \nand subways.\n  Let me give you another example--port security. Homeland security \nexperts widely acknowledge that our ports are among the most vulnerable \npoints in our homeland defenses. About 7 million containers arrive at \nthese ports each year, but a tiny percentage are searched. Any one \ncould become a vehicle to smuggle in a dangerous weapon, or even \nterrorists themselves.\n  Again, this costs money to fix. The Coast Guard has estimated that it \nwill take $4.4 billion to improve basic physical security at the \nNation's ports, starting with close to $1 billion the first year.\n  Yet the administration's budget proposal provided no new money in \nport security grants--and this budget resolution largely ignores the \nphysical security of our ports. In an effort to jumpstart these vital \nimprovements, I have called for $1.2 billion in port security grants \nfor fiscal year 2004. This amendment will start moving us toward that \ngoal.\n  We must also invest more to permanently protect our critical \ninfrastructure--our financial, transportation and communications \nnetworks, our energy systems and water supplies, chemical plants and \nhazardous materials, emergency services and public health systems. \nEighty-five percent of these networks and facilities are under the \ncontrol of the private sector. Though plenty of lip service has been \ngiven to this priority by the Department of Homeland Security, actual \nprogress has been exceedingly slow. That's largely a question of \nleadership, but it's happened in part because the financial commitment \nhas not been forthcoming.\n  This can't wait. That is why this week I have sent a letter to \nHomeland Security Secretary Ridge outlining a series of urgent \nquestions I believe he and his Department must answer so that we can \nbegin seeing results, and better protecting our Nation's nervous \nsystem, its circulatory system, its respiratory system, and all its \nvital organs without delay.\n  Finally, let me address one other crucial area of investment which \nreceives vastly too little funding in this budget resolution--\nprotecting ourselves against biological attack.\n  Some of the most chilling scenarios posed by homeland security \nexperts are those that envision the use of diseases as weapons. We are \ndepending on our public health network to help prepare for, protect \nagainst, and if necessary respond to such assaults. Yet in this budget, \nour health providers aren't being provided anywhere near adequate \nresources to do the job as well as they must do it. This amendment will \nprovide a critical infusion to start improving these capabilities.\n  On the floor today I have only mentioned a discrete set of the gaps \nwe must close to protect the American people. There are many more, and \nstill more gaps we have yet to identify are likely to rear their heads \nin the months to come.\n  We are at war against terrorism. Let's not frustrate and condemn to \nfailure those whose job it is to protect us--many of whom risk their \nlives--by failing to provide them the resources they need to meet and \nbeat the threats.\n  Whether our protectors work for the Department of Homeland Security \nor for the local fire department, they deserve not only our gratitude \nand our respect. They deserve the ability to rise to this challenge, \nthe resources and the tools to do the job. We depend upon them for our \nsafety. Surely they should be able to depend upon us for support.\n  Let's put the safety of us all before the wallets of the few. Let's \ninvest in our homeland defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need.\n  I do feel the need to make comments that when I got up this morning I \nhad no idea I would need to make. I have listened to the debate in the \nChamber this morning, and I think there are some corrections that need \nto be made for my colleagues and the people of America. We have made it \nsound as if we are debating an emergency supplemental budget. We are \nnot. We are debating the regular budget of the United States of America \nfor the next year, the year that begins October 1, 2004--not yesterday, \nnot today, October 1, 2004. We have been working on this all year \nbecause it is the regular budget. It is not the emergency supplemental \nbudget. This is our regular work.\n  Why are we doing our regular work? We are doing our regular work \nbecause\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\nwe are expecting America to do its regular work today. Everyone would \nlike to be listening to the radio or the television or picking up the \nlatest news, however they possibly can, but for most of America that is \nnot possible because they are doing their job. They are making America \nwork. They are making sure that the planes are flying, the trains are \nmoving, the trucks are going, the manufacturing is happening.\n  Why is that important? Because those are the jobs that are providing \nthe materials to keep America safe. Those are the people doing the jobs \nthat help us live our everyday lives and to fight a war. America is not \nsupposed to stop working today. We are not supposed to stop working \ntoday. We will do an emergency supplemental budget. I have heard the \npeople here say we should be working on that this minute. How many \npeople here know how long that war is going to go on? By tomorrow we \nwill have a better idea. By Monday we will have an even better idea.\n  Now, somebody said there is not a penny in this budget for this war. \nMaybe there should have been a penny in the last budget for this war--\nthe budget that never got done on this floor. That budget should have \nconsidered this war.\n  Well, instead we went ahead and we did an appropriation. But we \ndidn't do the appropriation last October 1 when the statute says we are \nsupposed to have it done. We did not do that until the end of January. \nWe did not get the conference done until February. And the President \nwas not able to sign the bill until February 20. That is when we got \nlast year's work done because we did not do our regular work on the \ntime schedule that we are required--required by statute--to do. The \nstatute says we will finish this budget by April 15. That does not just \nmean the debate in this Chamber, that means the conference committee \nand the final approval by April 15. Who knows how long that will take. \nBut we need to do our regular work just as we expect everybody else in \nthis country to do their regular work. It is essential to the operation \nof this great country.\n  We will get an emergency supplemental budget. An emergency \nsupplemental budget is different from this budget. This budget is a 10-\nyear budget. We are trying to anticipate the needs of the country for \n10 years and put a little plan out there so that we can plan for 10 \nyears. An emergency supplemental bill is for an emergency that is \nhappening at the time of the debate of the emergency. It is supposed to \ncover it to the best of our ability at that time.\n  Now, we do not do very well in our budgeting process. We got to spend \na lot of time last year getting on corporations in this country for bad \naccounting. Well, I am the only accountant in the Senate, and I do not \nthink the corporations are the only ones that should have been \nembarrassed. When I look at this budgeting process, I am delighted I \ngot to be on the Budget Committee this year. I have had comments on the \nbudget before, and there are some changes that need to be made. They \ncan't be made until we do the regular work of passing this regular \nbudget, but there are things on which we need to be working.\n  Usually budgets are divided into categories. They are not just one \ntype of a budget. There is usually a capital budget, where you plan for \nthe buildings, the maintenance, and the replacement. We do not do that. \nWe do everything as though it were a one-time cost. But that is another \ntopic for another time.\n  I have talked a lot in this Chamber about the need to reduce the \nnational debt. We do have a national debt, a scary national debt that \nwas scarier before; it will be scarier yet to come. We can see that \nfrom what we know about the dollars. But it is important for us--and \nboth sides agree--that we need to balance the budget as soon as we can \nand we need to pay down the national debt as soon as we can to have \nbetter security in this country.\n  One of the difficulties when we debated the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment 6 years ago when I first got here--it was the \nfirst debate I was in. People will recall that we did not pass a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, that we lost that by \none vote. There were some provisions in there for emergencies. This \nwould be one of those emergencies.\n  But when we are paying down the national debt, it can be done in a \nrather simple manner if we start with a small amount, plan it into the \nbudget, and then when we reduce that national debt by that amount, just \nlike you make a house payment--and this needs to be done over a 30-year \nperiod just like a house payment--when you make that payment, you do \nnot spend the interest you saved.\n  You add that interest to the payment and make the payment bigger. \nThen you can start, as with a house payment, with a relatively small \namount, and wind up with making a big payment in the end. It is pretty \ndifficult. I would like to have some charts to show that.\n  But when I have talked about that, and the fact that we could pay off \nthe national debt in a 30-year period, I have also mentioned there are \nemergencies. Emergencies would work just like a house loan as well. \nEmergencies would be that second mortgage you have to take out every \nonce in a while. It would not be a 30-year loan plan; it would have to \nbe a short-loan plan, but it would have to be taken care of, too.\n  On our budgeting, I want to talk about emergencies because another \npet peeve of mine with emergencies is, we know in this country every \nyear there will be about $6 billion spent on emergencies. Some of them \nare drought, some of them are tornadoes. There are lots of different \nkinds of disasters that happen in this country.\n  We do not know where disasters will happen. We cannot prevent \ndisasters from happening. But we know those disasters are going to cost \nabout $6 billion. It is something we ought to build into the budget. I \nam hoping I can sell 51 people on doing that.\n  War is different. It isn't something we know will happen each and \nevery year. It is something that happens once in a while. We would \nprefer if it never happened.\n  There were comments that in this budget there isn't a dime for this \nwar. I have explained why there isn't. But I do want to point out to \nthe people of America, when we sent those troops over there, we sent \nthem with supplies, we sent them with ammunition, we sent them with \narms. That is the best equipped army we have ever had in the field in \nthe history of the United States. You cannot send them there without \npaying for it. So getting them there, having them equipped, having them \nin a war is included in what we have done.\n  Now, how long it lasts, and what happens afterwards, we are going to \nget a supplemental budget on that. But we are not going to get the \nsupplemental budget today. Hopefully, they will hold off a day or two, \nat least, to see what kind of a war we have over there. Daily, the \nability to predict will be better, the ability to predict the expense \nwill be better. That is why we do emergency supplemental budgets.\n  We just had an amendment that was offered that deals with homeland \nsecurity and some additional expenses on that. We started putting that \nin as a specific item this year. We have been doing homeland security \nfor the history of the country, but because of September 11, that \nbecame ever more critical and we needed to have a department for \nhomeland security. We escalated homeland security to the point of \nhaving its own department with its own security.\n  Now, for those of my colleagues, or anyone else who might be \nlistening, you will recall we spent an awful lot of time, last year, \ntalking about the need for homeland security. And it got delayed and it \ngot delayed and it got filibustered and it got delayed. And now the \nside that delayed it is trying to look as if they are the prime \nhomeland security folks. It is not fair.\n  We can try and outspend each other to try to show we are more \ndedicated to homeland security than the other side. I think the way the \ndebate has gone in the past shows how that works.\n  We do have a department for homeland security. The Department of \nHomeland Security has said what moneys they think are needed. That is \nin the package. As the alerts change, we may get supplementary requests \non homeland security. We will have to respond to those. Hopefully, they \nwill not get built into the budget as an every-year expense, just like \nwar.\n\n  One of the reasons we budget for war through an emergency \nsupplemental budget is because we do not want it built into the base. \nWe do not want the\n\n[[Page S4057]]\n\nAmerican people to anticipate we are going to have war every year, and \nit is going to be the same cost. That is not good budgeting. The \nregular budget has the regular items in it that you do on a regular \nbasis. It isn't a war budget. Wars are not done on a regular basis in a \nregular way for a regular expense, and hopefully they never will.\n  Now, on homeland security, there were some comments about the need to \ndo more for the cities and the counties and the States. I want to do \nmore for the cities and the counties and the States.\n  I used to be a mayor. I was the mayor of a boomtown in Wyoming that \njust about quadrupled in size while I was mayor. There were a lot of \nthings that had to be taken care of, additional sewer, water, streets, \nbasic things, increasing the fire department, increasing the police \ndepartment. I did not do that on my own. The community did not do it on \nits own. It had help. It had help from the bottom to the State.\n  The Feds did not get into it much. That is because every expense in \nthis country is not a Federal expense. Some of the expenses are a local \nexpense. The benefits go to the people at the local level. The people \nat the local level understand those benefits better. They provide for \nthem, for the most part, themselves. I kind of object to us giving \npeople the impression that we do that.\n  I know the cities and the counties and the States are hurting out \nthere. We want to work with them to make things as easy as possible. \nBut that should not make the budget the prime spot for bailing \neverything out. Yes, we have a responsibility. Yes, we need to take \ncare of it. But we talk about these things as though the Federal \nGovernment were the prime supplier of everything.\n  Education is the most important thing after defense. But education is \none of those areas where we try to make it look like we do a lot, and \nlike we could do a lot more. And we can. But we used to provide about 7 \npercent of the money. I think we are up to about 8.6 percent now of the \nmoney that is spent for schools. It is really the people paying the \ntaxes to their schools who get the schools. And we add a little bit to \nit. A lot of it is some new programs we think are pretty fancy and \nsound good, and we think they will help education.\n  But with that 8.6 percent that we provide for education, we force \nmore than 50 percent of the paperwork. We keep them so busy doing \npaperwork, they cannot do the job of working with the kids they ought \nto be doing.\n  Now, we tried to change that in the No Child Left Behind legislation. \nI think we made a good start on it. There is more that we can do. There \nis more that we will do at the Federal level. But I wish we would not \ngive everybody the impression that the Federal Government provides \neverything because it leads them to expecting the Federal Government to \nprovide everything, when, in fact, they ought to be giving themselves \nmore credit for the job they are doing. And looking around their \ncommunity--I don't care how big of a city you are in, I don't care if \nyou are in New York City--there is still a community, the people you \nknow around you.\n  I think one of the things that happened with September 11 is that \nsense of community increased. People suddenly became more interested in \ntheir neighbors and helping their neighbors.\n  There is a tremendous amount that can be done with community. That is \nwhere it starts. We are beginning to get the impression that the \nFederal Government prints the money so the Federal Government can \nprovide all of the money that is necessary. We could, if we wanted to, \ngo broke. So we have to solve the problems at all levels and not \nimmediately escalate every cost to a Federal cost.\n  The final thing that has been brought up a number of times over the \nlast day, and particularly today, is the economic package the President \nhas suggested. There have been comments that we should not be doing an \neconomic package. Of course, they don't like to call it an economic \npackage. There are no ideas for stimulus coming from the people calling \nit a tax cut. They don't want to talk about the economic package right \nnow.\n  Let me tell you what the budget process is. The budget process is \nwhere we say what the goals are for the next year for the regular \noperation of the country--not the emergency, not the war, the regular \noperation. One of the things we have said is that the economy is down. \nWe need to do whatever we can to boost that economy. It is one of the \nthings we have to worry about. It is one of the things we in Congress \nhave to worry about.\n  How do you go about doing that? Well, one of the things is to do a \nbudget. A budget is not a vote on the economic package. The budget is \nthe vote on the possibilities we have for the next year. It sets down \nrules that govern how we will pass legislation the rest of this year. I \ndon't want anybody to get the impression that we are passing an \neconomic package this week. We need to pass the budget so the \nconsideration of an economic package can go on. We need to pass that. \nBut the real debate on the economic package comes when the economic \npackage comes up.\n  If we chip away at it here and chip away at it there and put it into \nother things that we think are our priorities, then we have limited the \npossibilities for a solid economic plan for America. Most of that \ntactic is designed to get to the rhetoric that the tax cut will go to \nthe rich.\n  It is a plan to get jobs, and jobs will go to everybody--not just new \njobs, but keeping the job they have now. That is really the biggest \nconcern people have. Those who have a job want to make sure they keep \nit. Those who do not want to make sure they have one.\n  That is what we want to do with an economic plan. We are trying to \nfigure out the best possible economic plan we can put together. The \nPresident has said it needs to be $726 billion. I think we have $698 \nbillion in the package, but that is an upper limit, not an actual \npackage, not the final result. What we need to do is pass the regular \nbudget so we can do the regular authorization work and the regular \ndebate so we can get to appropriations by October 1. That is how long \nof a timeframe we are working on.\n  Why do we need to work on it now? Why should we, like the rest of \nAmerica, keep working today? Because we have a job to do that includes \nthis budget, a whole bunch of authorization bills, and then finally 13 \nappropriations bills. Now 13 appropriations bills normally take us 1 to \n2 weeks per bill. So you can see if we are going to have that done by \nwhat the statute says, October 1, what the administration is relying on \nof October 1, we need to be meeting a timeframe right now. Statutorily \nit says this has to be done by April 15. That is just the budget part. \nThat isn't where we even get to what the dollars per specific item are.\n  Last year we didn't have a budget. That kept us from getting the \nauthorizations done. That kept us from getting the appropriations done \ntimely. We didn't get them voted on until the end of July. We didn't \nget them conferenced until February, and we did not get them signed \nuntil February 20, which was very shortly after the conference was \ndone. That is the earliest the President could sign them, February 20. \nPeople are talking about how No Child Left Behind doesn't have enough \nmoney. Well, how would they know whether they have enough money or not? \nNone of it was released until February 20.\n  We cannot get in that position again. This Budget Committee is \ndetermined to make sure we will get it done in a timely manner and that \nas soon as there is a supplemental budget--and I do hope it is a couple \nof days into this so there is a better indication of how long it is \ngoing to take, what it is going to cost, how much damage has been done \nover there--then we will seriously look at that supplemental bill. But \nin the meantime, like the rest of America, I hope we will keep on doing \nour regular work while they do their regular work, so America and the \nwar can be successful.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, having been delegated authority by Senator \nConrad, I yield 20 minutes off the amendment to the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me respond to a few of the things said \nthis morning and also talk generally about\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\nthe budget resolution. This budget resolution has been called an \neconomic package, something focusing on jobs. In fact, this budget \nresolution doesn't add up. It cannot possibly be serious in its attempt \nto address what is happening and what is wrong in this country.\n  Let me use one chart to show what kind of a resolution we have before \nus. Skyrocketing deficits as far as the eye can see, a virtual ocean of \nred ink as far as the eye can see. I want to ask a question with \nrespect to a budget proposal that comes to the floor at this moment in \nour history that says our major priority is a long-term permanent tax \ncut, and the most significant part of that priority is to exempt \ndividends from taxation. The implication of that, of course, is to say, \nin terms of our values, let's decide to keep taxing work but exempt \ninvestment. So let's tax work but exempt investment. I don't understand \nthat.\n  But I especially don't understand it when there is a single U.S. \nsoldier in the mountains of Afghanistan or a single U.S. soldier in the \nsands in Iraq, that we in this country would not say we are prepared to \nspend whatever is necessary of our tax dollars to support those \nsoldiers. We must do our part.\n  Yesterday I was in a hearing in the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. The Chief of Staff of the Army was testifying, along with \nthe Secretary of the Army. I was asking the various questions my friend \nand colleague from Wyoming just discussed. What are some of these \nthings going to cost. I fully understand we don't know exactly what is \ngoing to happen with respect to Iraq and what that will cost. I don't \nunderstand why there are not in this budget provisions to pay for the \nwar on terrorism.\n  We know that is an ongoing war that began a couple years ago, and it \nis going to go on for a long while. And you know that the Defense \nDepartment is now taking money out of its other accounts in order to \ncover its costs for a war on terrorism. They know that war will \ncontinue in the next fiscal year. But they won't request money for it \nat this point in the budget before us.\n  We know that American presence will continue in Afghanistan in the \nnext fiscal year. But the request for money for that will not be in \nthis budget.\n  You can make a pretty decent case that we don't know what it is going \nto cost with respect to Iraq.\n  You cannot make a case that the war on terrorism and the efforts in \nAfghanistan should not be part of this budget. Of course they should. I \nunderstand that sometime--I think it is anticipated in the next 24 \nhours--we are going to receive a supplemental budget request--I am told \nit is somewhere in the neighborhood of between $70 billion and $100 \nbillion--asking for that amount of additional money. We are told, \nalthough that has been put together in the Department of Defense and \nelsewhere, they do not intend to show it to us in Congress until we \nfinish our discussions about the Federal budget.\n  I do not understand that. People keep saying this place should be run \nlike a business. Is this the way you run a business? If a board of \ndirectors is making critical financial decisions about the company and \nyou say, Oh, by the way, there is another very big piece out there, $60 \nbillion to $70 billion to $100 billion, but we are not going to tell \nyou what it is, we are not going to send it to you until you have \nactually completed your budget for next year, that is preposterous. \nEveryone knows that. It does not make any sense.\n  We have an economic plan in this country that is just not working. \nMr. President, 2.5 million people have lost their jobs in the last \ncouple of years. Our economy is sputtering. What used to be a strong, \nvibrant, growing economy is now an economy that is sputtering, not \ndoing well at all, with people losing their jobs and budget surpluses \nturned to budget deficits.\n  It does not matter that we should spend time here talking about who \ndid what. What matters is we should spend time talking about how do we \nfix what is wrong and how do we put our country back on track. And on \nthe edge of war with Iraq, we are told in this budget document today, \ntomorrow, and this weekend apparently, that the highest priority is for \nus to enact very large permanent tax cuts, the most significant part of \nwhich is an exemption for taxes on dividends.\n  I, for the life of me, do not understand that. Is that doing our part \nin a national emergency? Is that doing our part? Is that a message to \nthe American soldiers: You go risk your lives, but we will not support \nyou with our tax dollars? What we will do is spend money and charge it, \nand you come back, having risked your life, and you also inherit the \nburden of paying the taxes to support it because we would not do it. \nThat is not fair. That is not right. That is not doing our part.\n  Again, as long as there are soldiers in Afghanistan or soldiers going \ninto Iraq, we ought not be doing this. We ought to put together a \nbudget that adds up.\n  I just came from a hearing this morning, I say to my colleague from \nWyoming, on appropriations for the Forest Service. Does my colleague \nknow what they did to the Forest Service? We had massive problems with \nforest fires all around the country last year. They are deciding to cut \nthe number of firefighters by much more than one-half. Does anybody \nthink that is justifiable? Of course it is not justifiable. It is \ngimmicks and games. We do not have any intention of cutting the number \nof firefighters who fight forest fires in half.\n  When those fires rage across this country in America's forests, as \nthey have in the last several years, we have a proposal to cut the \nnumber of firefighters in the Forest Service in half? I do not \nunderstand that. Are Mr. Daniels and those at the OMB with these tiny \nlittle pencils and microscopic eyeglasses not able to think at all? Are \nthey the ones everyone says know the cost of everything and the value \nof nothing? Where on Earth is the value system in proposals such as \nthis? I just do not understand it.\n  This country, at this moment, owes it to the men and women who are \nprepared to wage war for America to be honest as we approach these \nbudgets. This budget is not an appropriate budget at all. We have an \neconomy that is in desperate trouble and soldiers about to fight, and \nwe are telling them: Oh, by the way, it is our intention to spend money \nwe do not have on things we do not need and charge you the balance, \nand, by the way, we have the biggest amount of expenditure that is \ncoming up, but we won't tell anybody what it is because we want to wait \nuntil we get the budget done, and then we will get a $100 billion bill \nand let you gnash your teeth over that. By the way, a fair amount of \nthat should have been in this budget for the next fiscal year, but we \ndo not want to tell you what that cost is either because in the next \nfiscal year we will give you another surprise and ask you to pass that \non an emergency basis.\n  That is no way to budget. It is no way to run a business and no way \nto run a Government, and everybody understands it.\n  Because my colleague mentioned the No Child Left Behind Act, I cannot \nhelp but respond to that issue with respect to budgeting, expenditures, \nand cost. The basic notion of the President's proposal of no child left \nbehind is accountability. Schools should be accountable for that which \nthey spend to educate America's children. I agree with that. But we \npassed legislation saying no child left behind with the implied \ncomments of everyone, including the President, that they would fund \nthat which was necessary to make it work. The No Child Left Behind Act \nwas enacted, but the President left the funding behind.\n  I introduced legislation in the Congress to say there ought to be a \nmoratorium on the deadlines in that legislation until two things \nhappen: One, we have the funding to make that work; and, two, until we \nsee the implementation of that with the flexibility that is necessary, \nso that we do not have the same template put over a rural school in a \nsmall town in Wyoming and North Dakota as is put over a school in an \ninner city that has different needs. I will give an example.\n  If you have a great teacher--I mean a great teacher--teaching in his \nor her minor, who has taught in it for 12 years, does a terrific job, \nteaches children very well, do we really believe we ought to tell that \nschool district that does not have the money, by the way, that it must \nhire a teacher in their major to replace a teacher who teaches very \nwell in that teacher's minor and is producing students who are well \neducated? Is that what we want? Or do we\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\nwant basic flexibility? I think we want basic flexibility.\n  I came from a school with 4 grades, 40 kids, and I graduated in a \nhigh school class of 9. If someone came to that high school and said \nevery class taught needs to be taught by the teacher in the teacher's \nmajor, that school district does not have anywhere near the capability \nto make that happen. So we need to make that work, but it will not work \nwith respect to this kind of budget dealing with education. The needs \nare not meeting the implied promises given when we passed that \nlegislation.\n  Let me mention a couple of other issues with respect to the economy. \nI wish, and all Americans wish, this economy were growing, and growing \nrapidly, expanding so jobs and opportunities would exist for all \nAmericans. That, regrettably, has not been the case.\n  About 2 years ago, the President proposed a $1.7 trillion tax cut, \nand some of us said: Things are good, times are good, we see big budget \nsurpluses in the Federal Government, but we ought to be a bit \nconservative. Maybe we ought not jump to have permanent tax cuts of \n$1.7 trillion over the 10-year period. Maybe what we ought to do is be \na bit more conservative and do it incrementally. They said: No, the \nPresident wants it this way and had the votes to make it happen. So we \ndid.\n\n  What happened after that vote was taken and we had this permanent \nlarge tax cut? The first thing that happened was we discovered we were \nin a recession and less revenue was coming into the Federal Government. \nSecond, on September 11, we had a devastating terrorist attack against \nour country. Then we had the most significant corporate scandals in a \nlong time. At the same time we were fighting a war against terrorism, \nthe stock market collapsed and the tech bubble burst. All of these came \nto the same intersection at the same time, dramatically affecting this \ncountry's economy.\n  What was intended to be large budget surpluses in our future became \nvery large budget deficits that are growing and growing worse. What is \nthe response to that, even as we have additional foreign policy \nchallenges, a war with Iraq, very serious problems in North Korea, and \na continued war with respect to terrorism and dramatic new needs with \nrespect to homeland security? What is the response? The response by the \nmajority party and the President is to bring the budget to the floor of \nthe Senate and say none of that matters; what matters is we have more \nlarge permanent tax cuts. That is not doing our part for national \nsecurity. It is not doing our part, in my judgment, to support our \nsoldiers.\n  We would be wise to put together a budget that adds up, one that \nworks, one that invests in the future, and one that says to the \nAmerican soldiers: You are not the only ones fighting this war. This \ncountry is behind you, and we are doing our part.\n  We are not going to send you off to battle and then bring you home to \npay the bill. That ought to be our responsibility. This budget \nresolution is wrong and everyone knows it.\n  We are going to have a whole series of votes on choices because, \nafter all, budgets are simply a series of choices. Let me describe, for \nexample, one other choice.\n  I am going to offer an amendment relating to our country's trade \ndeficit. We not only have the largest budget deficits in history at \nthis moment, we also have the largest trade deficit in history--$470 \nbillion in 2002.\n  Every single day, seven days a week, nearly $1.5 billion more in \ngoods are brought into this country than we ship out. Think of that.\n  One can make a case on the budget deficit that perhaps that is a \ndeficit we owe to ourselves. One cannot make that case with the trade \ndeficit. That is a deficit we owe to other countries and one that we \nwill inevitably repay with a lower standard of living unless we resolve \nthese trade issues.\n  We now have a $103 billion trade deficit with China. So you would \nthink that our government has a good number of people working to \naddress that huge deficit. Guess again. We have just 19 people in the \nMarket Access and Compliance Section at the Department of Commerce, \nwhose job it is to pry open these foreign markets in China that are \nclosed to U.S. producers. We have a $103 billion trade deficit with \nChina, and we have 19 people working on it. We have a $70 billion trade \ndeficit with Japan. It has been that way every year as long as we can \nremember. We have 10 people working down at Market Access and \nCompliance trying to pry open markets in Japan.\n  We have a thirteen billion dollar deficit with Korea. We have two and \nthree-fourths people--that is what they say, two and three-fourths, \nworking to deal with trade barriers to U.S. products in the Korean \nmarket. I do not know how one gets three-fourths of a person. I guess \nwhen you are dealing with trade, the laws of nature don't apply.\n  With Europe, we have an $82 billion trade deficit, and only 15 people \nworking on that.\n  Despite our debate about budgets and all of the mantra and chanting \nthat goes on about economic growth, our country is not going to do well \nunless we straighten out this trade mess. The manufacturing sector \ncannot be decimated in the strongest economy on Earth without serious \nconsequences in the long term. Jobs cannot be shipped overseas, as well \nas factories, and a dismantling of the manufacturing sector, which is \nexactly what is happening in our country, without having very \nsubstantial problems.\n  The reason I mention all this is I am going to offer an amendment \nthat adds money to Market Access and Compliance, which says: Let us \naddress the trade issues by demanding, by requiring, and by having the \npeople to fight for the open markets overseas for our producers. We do \nnot do that. We are weak-kneed in this country. We lack backbone and \nspine to deal with these trade issues.\n  I will give you a couple of examples. We had trade negotiators \nnegotiate with China. This is an example of a bad agreement. Our trade \nnegotiators negotiated with China and they agreed that after a phase-in \nof some years, China would be allowed to impose tariffs on U.S. \nautomobiles sold in China 10 times the amount of tariffs that we would \nimpose on any Chinese automobiles sold in the United States. Think of \nthat. Our negotiators agreed to that. I think that is nuts.\n  How about Korea? Anybody know how many cars we sent to Korea last \nyear? The United States of America shipped 2,800 cars to the country of \nKorea. How many Korean cars were shipped to the United States? Over \n600,000 cars came from Korea to the United States. We shipped 2,800 \nback. Want to know why? Is it because Koreans do not want to drive \nAmerican cars? Absolutely not. It is because the Korean Government does \nnot want American cars, so we have one-way trade and that means our \njobs are gone and there is this decimation of our manufacturing \ncapacity. It has to stop.\n\n  I am going to offer an amendment, and we are going to see if people \ncare about the issue of trade and supporting America's manufacturers. \nWe are going to see who wants to stop this nonsense of shipping jobs \noverseas so that 14-year-olds can work 14 hours a day and get paid 14 \ncents an hour so that U.S. workers are told you have to compete with \nthat, and if you cannot compete with it in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, \nLos Angeles, or Fargo, then those jobs are going to be gone \npermanently. That is not fair trade.\n  Any budget that we pass is going to be irrelevant in the context of \nthis country's economic problems if it does not address the basic trade \nimbalance of $470 billion in one year.\n  Thirty years ago, we had a $3 billion trade deficit in one quarter, \nand it was considered a crisis. These days we cannot get anybody to \nlook at this. But countless people are impacted by it; the people who \nwoke up this morning who did not have to dress for work because their \njobs are gone. They had to tell their family: I am a hard worker, I do \ngood work, but my manufacturing plant was moved overseas and I no \nlonger have a job.\n  Millions of people have experienced that, and they are told by too \nmany in this Congress and too many others who fight for bad trade \npolicies that they have to compete in circumstances where fair \ncompetition does not exist.\n  So I am going to offer an amendment with respect to market access and \ncompliance, saying if we have a $470 billion trade deficit, we ought to \nhave a lot of folks prying open these foreign markets, and dealing with \nunfair trade practices.\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\n  The fact is, we hardly have anybody working on it. There are a bunch \nof people going off making goofy agreements on behalf of this country, \nselling out American farmers and selling out manufacturers because they \ndo not care very much, and then when the agreement is done, even if it \nis a bad agreement, if there is some ability to enforce it, we do not \nhave anybody who wants to enforce it anyway.\n  I ask for 5 additional minutes by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. By the authority of the ranking member, Senator Lautenberg \nis to be recognized for up to 20 minutes, time off the resolution. \nSenator Nickles does not want the amendment offered. It takes unanimous \nconsent to just speak about the amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. That would be fine, but I would like the Senator from New \nJersey, who has waited some time to be recognized--Senator Enzi, the \nSenator is going to be recognized for 5 more minutes, followed by \nSenator Lautenberg to be recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will probably not use all the 5 minutes. \nI know my colleague wishes to speak.\n\n  There are so many other issues of choices, especially bad choices, \nwith respect to these budget resolutions we are discussing.\n  The budget resolution brought to us from the committee has large, \nbiting, permanent budget deficits. It includes very large tax cuts. At \na time when we are asking this country to sacrifice, especially with \nits sons and daughters, at a time when we are sending America's sons \nand daughters to war, this Congress is saying we will have our sons and \ndaughters make tough choices, but we will not make tough choices. It is \nnot the fair thing to do. I do not want those soldiers to come back to \nbear the burden of the costs of a war we would not cover.\n  A little over a year ago, I was in Afghanistan. I recall visiting on \nthe edge of Afghanistan an old Soviet airbase. I believe it was called \nKanabad. At that Soviet airbase, we had soldiers. At that point, there \nwere still a lot of activities in Afghanistan when we fought the \nTaliban and kicked the Taliban out of Afghanistan. We were then \nsearching for al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. When I visited that base \nand spoke to the soldiers, the men and women living in a tent city were \nwalking around in mud up to their ankles, snow, conditions that were \nnot good, but I could see the pride in their eyes. They understood why \nthey were there. They understood what they were doing for their \ncountry, and they were proud of it, and this country is proud of them.\n  They are still in Afghanistan. Fortunately, the fighting does not \npresent itself these days so much in Afghanistan. We have been \nremarkably successful in Afghanistan and hopefully we will restore the \nnew government under Mr. Karzai. The fact is, we still have troops in \nAfghanistan. We are prepared to move troops into Iraq. Some are perhaps \nthere, others perhaps in a day or so. It seems to me our obligation to \nthose, especially the mostly young men and women who have been taken \nfrom this country, away from their families, and who said, ``let me \nserve, I will go,'' who are risking their lives for this country, our \nobligation is to be talking about the realities of what this country \nfaces. To say to those soldiers the sacrifice is not only yours, it is \na national sacrifice.\n\n  When someone asks, What do you do for the war, you say I get a \ndividend tax exemption? We had Warren Buffett come to the Congress a \nweek and a half ago. He is the second richest man in the world. He \nsaid: If you provide a tax exemption for dividends, which is in this \nresolution, I will actually benefit to the tune of about $400 million a \nyear. He said: But it won't make any sense for the country. It will not \nhelp the economy and I don't support it.\n  Why on Earth would we be doing this when we ought to be supporting \nour troops? When the troops are doing their part, in my judgment, we \nmust do ours. We should support them with our tax dollars, even as they \nsupport us with their lives. That is what these discussions are about.\n  The reason I decided to speak about this, my colleague said we do not \nhave any idea what any of this costs. Nonsense. We all know better than \nthat. Of course we know what it will cost. We do not know the details. \nWe know what the war against terrorism has cost.\n  I was told yesterday by the Department of the Army in an open hearing \nthat amount of money to prosecute the war against terrorism has been \ntaken out of the regular accounts because they have not been provided \nfor and they will be in an emergency supplemental, but the war on \nterrorism is not a temporary event and it ought to be part of the \nregular budget. We know what is going to happen in Afghanistan. We will \nhave troops there. We know what that will cost. It ought to be part of \nthis budget and planning. We know it will cost some money; it already \nhas in Iraq. But the administration is deliberately at this point \ndeciding not to allow anyone to see those numbers and they will not \ndiscuss them until we pass this budget.\n  Why? I think we understand why. It will be a very big number. It is \nsomething we ought to be considering here, in my judgment.\n  I asked the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Shinseki, about it \nyesterday. I didn't press him because he got in very hot water a couple \nweeks ago. The published reports were that there were people in the \nPentagon who wanted heads to roll because General Shinseki answered the \nquestion, What is this going to cost? He got in real trouble.\n  It seems to me we ought to deal with all the facts and come up with a \nbudget that adds up and works.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nJersey is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment I \nplan to offer when the opportunity presents itself. My amendment \nestablishes a reserve fund for national and homeland security. My \namendment is cosponsored by Senators Conrad and Schumer as well.\n  This budget reminds me of a movie I saw some time ago, not intending \nto present any humor, but it is precise in what it says: ``Show Me The \nMoney.'' Everyone understood immediately what they were talking about. \nHere we are, searching for the money to pay for our defense needs and \nthe war with Iraq. It is nowhere to be found.\n  I was the ranking member of the Budget Committee for several years. \nThere is one thing you learned on that committee, simply wishing for \nmoney does not make it appear. This must come as a shock to people who \nin their regular lives try to set money aside for future expenses such \nas mortgages or tuition or rent or real estate taxes. We all have to \nbudget for our critical needs.\n  The war with Iraq has started. We see the pictures of our troops and \nyou wonder how they put up with the heat and the dust, the threat to \ntheir lives, the ominous presence, perhaps, of chemicals or biological \nweapons. There is plenty to think about. But for God's sake, we ought \nto think here about how we provide the money to prosecute that war. It \nhas to sound strange to people listening to what is said in the Senate \nthis morning.\n  We have an obligation to tell the American people how much and where \nthe money is going to come from to finance the war and to finance our \ndomestic security needs. At critical moments in history such as this, \nwe ought to be truthful with the American people about what it is we \nare doing.\n  The truth is, this budget does not provide the funding to prosecute \nour war with Iraq. It is a simple equation. We are shortchanging \nnational security spending and the costs of the war in order to protect \na tax break, largely for the wealthiest.\n  I want people to understand. We are going to prosecute the war, and \nwe are going to do it fully, but we ought to tell the truth to the \nAmerican people about how we are going to pay for it. The money to pay \nfor this war is not provided in any place we look. It is a tax cut that \npeople understand is going to the wealthiest among us. I want everyone \nto know the money that would be used to prosecute this war is going to \ngo to another priority; that is, a tax cut for the wealthiest. A tax \ncut that,\n\n[[Page S4061]]\n\nas we heard from the Senator from North Dakota, a tax cut people with \nwealth typically do not need, and I can tell you most of them do not \nwant it when they recognize it comes from the very foundation of our \nstrength in this country.\n  The Senate GOP plan ignores the cost of war. We are going to look at \na supplemental, which is in addition to the budget, that was not \nplanned for. But with less than a wink of an eye, everyone knows the \nwar otherwise will not be prosecuted out of the funds available for the \nDefense Department. That is what we are looking at. From $60 billion to \n$95 billion is expected to be requested in a supplemental plan. The \npresent Senate budget plan does not provide for any of it.\n  My friends in the business world are people who run big companies, \nsome of them little companies, but they run organizations and they know \nhow important it is to fund your critical needs.\n\n  My amendment corrects a major problem with this budget. My colleagues \nmay not realize that the Senate Republican budget resolution actually \ncuts defense spending by $103 billion below the President's request.\n  We have heard a great deal of talk about patriotism from the other \nside of the aisle. We have even seen it raised in the ugliest of \nfashions, in an election where a triple amputee who lost his limbs in \nVietnam was accused of lacking patriotism and lost the election. \nImagine, a triple amputee, a man left with one arm, the legs are gone, \none arm is gone, and he is accused of being unpatriotic. Language flows \nloosely around here at times.\n  We have heard a lot about putting national security and homeland \nfirst above all, and at times when the defense budget was being \nprepared it was suggested if you challenged it, if you voiced some \nconcern about it, if you questioned the tactic being used, there was an \nimplied criticism that you were not being loyal, that you might be like \nthe French. Talk is loose here.\n  I served in another war, a long time ago, and they used to have a \nslogan ``loose lips sink ships.'' Boy, we would not have a lot of ships \nafloat here.\n  When you examine the details of this budget, it is apparent that it \nis tax cuts for the rich that have the highest priority. In fact, this \nbudget cuts national security funding in order to provide those tax \ncuts to the wealthy.\n  I had a business career before I came here. Thank goodness for the \nAmerican opportunity, we succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. We were \nthree poor kids from working-class families in Patterson, NJ. The \ncompany did very well. Today a company that we started employs 40,000 \npeople.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious that a company with that kind of growth, \nthat kind of success, produced some wealth for the founders. It did. \nAnd I can tell you I do not want a tax cut for myself and I don't think \npeople in my position ought to have tax cuts right now. America has \nbeen good enough to us that we do not need the tax cut. We need a \nstrong country. We need a harmonious population where people know they \nare being treated fairly and that we are not putting everything else \naside so we can give a tax cut to people who neither need it and in \nmost cases don't want it.\n  There are sleight of hand maneuvers in this budget. If you look at \nthe years 2004 through 2008, the Republican budget projects defense \nspending at the level requested by the President. But in the last 5 \nyears of the budget window, from 2009 through 2013, the Republican \nbudget resolution actually cuts $103 billion below the levels CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, estimates would be required just to \nmaintain defense spending in real terms at the level the President \nproposed. During those latter 5 years, where is that missing $103 \nbillion going? The answer is--I don't want to be repetitive, but this \nis so hard to understand, so impossible to conceive that we have to say \nit a lot because it does not get through. But maybe, just maybe, the \nAmerican people will hear this clearly enough to say:\n\n       Hey, listen, I have heard some pretty good presentations \n     this morning.\n\n  I am discounting mine. I am talking about others here.\n\n       They keep talking about this tax cut for the wealthy.\n\n  That is what we are talking about, Mr. and Mrs. American citizen. \nThat is what we are talking about. The tax cut in this bill over 10 \nyears will cost this country $1.4 trillion.\n  Are we cutting defense for this tax cut? Whom does that help? Let's \nlook at the facts about the President's tax proposal. Almost half of \nall tax filers, 49 percent of them, would receive tax cuts of less than \n$100. That doesn't do much for people's standard of living.\n  The average tax cut for the bottom 80 percent of tax filers would be \n$226. That is the average tax cut. By contrast, the top 1 percent of \ntax filers would receive an average tax cut of $24,100. But those who \nare at the tippy top, with incomes of more than $1 million, would get \ntax cuts averaging $90,200. That could make a difference in one's \nstandard of living, but not for those folks, they are already living at \nthat scale. That is why I call it skewed towards the wealthy.\n  As for another part of the tax cut proposal, the dividend tax cut, \nnearly 70 percent of the benefits would flow to the top 5 percent of \nour tax filers, and the top 1 percent would receive 46 percent of the \nbenefits--1 percent would receive 46 percent of the benefits, nearly \nhalf of the benefit to the top 1 percent.\n  So the priorities are quite clear: Tax cuts for the wealthy first; \nnational security, when it comes to the money, further down the list. \nThat is just plain wrong.\n  There is a reason it is being handled that way. I do not suggest lack \nof patriotism, lack of loyalty, lack of conviction on this war. I just \nknow that in the planning, in the machinations that go toward \ndeveloping the budget, what happens is someone says: Hey, guys, do you \nknow what happens? If we don't get that tax cut in the total package, \nwe are not going to get it. It is just not going to happen. It's a lot \neasier to get money for the war, a lot easier to get money for our \ndefense, homeland defense needs. We can get that in supplementals or \nother places. A tax cut, we had better get that now, while we can.\n\n  The President laid out his request for accomplishing these goals. But \nwhat did the Senate Republican budget do? It sacrificed funding for \nnational security in order to provide tax cuts for the rich, as I \nexplained. The process took over. To make matters worse, this budget \nignores the fact that we have gone to war. Every one of us is glued to \nthe news, whether it is the papers or television or radio or whatever \nit is; we want to know what is happening with our troops. We worry. We \nheard about a Black Hawk helicopter that went down. I know I must speak \nfor everybody. We are holding our breath until we learn that those who \nwere carried in that helicopter were rescued.\n  The White House has told the press that it will happen, that we are \ngoing to need the money. Again, I used to be ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, so I know my colleagues on that committee read the \nnewspaper.\n  The administration is about to send up a war supplemental request to \nus of between $60 and $95 billion. It is not in the budget, it is \nsupplemental. It is extra. You can make the case pretty easily. It is \none thing to make the case because of the need. It is another thing to \nmake the case because you want to put the funds that are available in a \nlot of rich persons' pockets.\n  This war and its aftermath will cost a lot of money. Estimates are \nthat the reconstruction of Iraq could cost $30 billion over 10 years. \nEvery year of Iraqi occupation could cost between $17 billion and $46 \nbillion. As far as this budget is concerned, apparently it doesn't see \nany of it happening. So we ignore the war in the budget, we cut \nnational security spending. Why? Simply because it seems, in the eyes \nof the administration, the most important agenda is to provide tax cuts \nto the wealthiest Americans at the cost of other priorities.\n  My amendment makes it clear that tax cuts should not take priority \nover every other need. My amendment restores the 2009 through 2013 \nnational security cuts in the budget resolution. The amendment moves \n$103 billion in budget authority and $88 billion in outlays into a \nreserve fund for national security and homeland security. To offset the \ncost of this critical reserve fund, my amendment simply goes to the tax \ncut and reduces it by $88 billion during the same period, so we can \ntake that cash from the tax cut--again,\n\n[[Page S4062]]\n\nmost of it going to the wealthiest--and put it into the most vital need \nwe have right now, and that is to make sure that every penny we can put \ntogether to make sure our people in the field, those who are fighting, \nknow we will do everything we must by way of financing to make sure \nthey have every tool available, they have all the protections they \nneed. That is where to put the money.\n  We are faced with a clear choice. My amendment says our Nation's \nnational security is far more important than tax cuts for the wealthy. \nI hope when we have a chance to present the amendment, my colleagues \nwill support voting for national and homeland security by voting for \nthe amendment.\n  In the war I fought in a long time ago, we used to talk to the public \nabout what they had to do to prosecute the war, to provide for our \ndefenses.\n\n  This poster shows its age by the way the characters are drawn. It \nsays: ``BUY WAR BONDS.'' I think they were $25 at their least price. It \nsaid: Everybody has to kick in. Everybody has to do their share. Do \nwhat you can to help us conduct ourselves in our defense as proudly, as \nforcefully, as we can. That is what it is about.\n  And here we are ashamed to ask the richest among us to sacrifice \ntheir $90,000 on a $1 million income? Wait, make more money. Warren \nBuffet addressed a group of Senators the other day, and he said: I love \npaying taxes because every time I pay taxes, it means there is more \nmoney left in my pocket. Pretty simple. And that is how we ought to \nface our responsibilities now: Tell the truth to the American people, I \nsay to my colleagues on the other side. Tell the truth about how you \nplan to use the money that otherwise would currently be available to \nprosecute the war.\n  Maybe we would not even have to do a supplemental. There are times \nwhen we are mystified by the arguments presented on one side or the \nother. I am sure that happens with our Republican friends when it is a \nDemocratic proposal. The fact is, these figures that are generated here \nhave been reviewed by the distinguished committees of people who study \nbudgets as a professional thing, as an organizational commitment. They \ntell us: Look, all you have to do is look at the lines, look at the \nyears.\n  Right now, everything looks OK. Get out to about 2007, and you see \nwhat happens. The President's budget is one thing; in the Senate GOP \nplan--that is, the budgeteer's, the majority's plan in the Budget \nCommittee--they have something else. They show they cannot meet the \nPresident's number.\n  The tragedy of this kind of a debate is that we have to confront one \nanother. I believe this is a time when the last thing on the list of \npriorities ought to be tax cuts going largely to the wealthiest among \nus.\n  Let's stand up and do what is right. Let's send all that we have \nright now: commit it, reserve it, make it such that it cannot be \ntouched anyplace else.\n  I hope when we have a chance to review the amendment, we will see the \nthought has prevailed that says: Hey, they could be right on this one. \nLet's send it all into our defense needs which are so heavy right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, as the daughter of a veteran and the granddaughter of \ntwo grandfathers who served in the war, and the mother of two small \nboys, I want to say how proud I am of the men and women who serve in \nour Armed Forces in this great country, those who go to the front lines \nto defend the freedoms and the conveniences we enjoy here every day.\n  They have done a tremendous job, and they continue to do a tremendous \njob. I want them to all know that our thoughts and prayers and, more \nimportantly, our pride is with each and every one of them as they \nperform a mission on our behalf.\n  I also rise today on behalf of the men and women who serve our Nation \nas members of the National Guard and Reserves, who are out there today, \nas well, defending our rights and our freedoms.\n  I am going to discuss an amendment that I will offer, when the time \nbecomes appropriate, with Senator Landrieu, with a tremendous amount of \nhelp and background from many other Senators who have worked on this \nissue, particularly Senator Leahy--an amendment that will bring members \nof the National Guard and Reserve into the TRICARE health care program.\n  Currently, Guard and Reserve families cannot enroll in the TRICARE \nprogram unless the Guard or Reserve member is activated with orders \nlasting over 30 days.\n  Our amendment would allow members of the Guard and Reserves, as well \nas their families, to sign up for TRICARE health care coverage at any \ntime regardless of whether the Guard or Reserve is activated.\n  This amendment is paid for by reducing the size of the proposed tax \ncut by $20.3 billion over 10 years. Specifically, these numbers are \nbacked up by a GAO report on this subject that was authorized by the \nfiscal year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act. And the study was \ncompleted in September of 2002. So we have the numbers to back up what \nwe want to do on behalf of these incredible men and women in the \nNational Guard and Reserves, who deserve the support of health care, as \ndo their families.\n  In recent years, our Nation has increasingly looked to our volunteer \nreservists and guardsmen for our defense and peacekeeping needs, \nrequiring them to leave their jobs and families in defense of our \nNation.\n  Arkansas has sent over 2,000 Guard and Reserve members to contribute \nto the war on Iraq and the war on terrorism. They are among over \n212,000 Guard and Reserve members who have been activated nationwide.\n  Given the scope of their sacrifices, I do not think it is too much to \nask their fellow Americans to sacrifice as well by accepting a smaller \ntax cut.\n  Currently, over 20 percent of this Nation's Guard and Reserve \nsoldiers lack health care coverage when they are not on active duty. \nThat number is much greater in a State such as Arkansas where our \noverall numbers of uninsured are much greater than the national \npercentage.\n  In this time of increased dependence upon the members of our National \nGuard and Reserves, it is imperative we increase benefits for them and \ntheir families for when they are not on active duty.\n\n  I also want to acknowledge this amendment only provides funding for \nthis program. It does not begin to detail how the extended TRICARE \nbenefits should be structured. That test would be left up, and should \nbe left up, to the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  I am also aware that many Senators have been working, for some time, \non the details of how to structure and provide these benefits. I hope \nmy budget amendment will complement their efforts by solely allocating \nthe necessary budget authority to provide these benefits to our Guard \nand Reserve members.\n  I look to the leadership of Senators Leahy and DeWine and Daschle, as \nwell as both the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nto develop the specifics of how these benefits will be provided.\n  I am also aware that this amendment will only provide an estimate of \nthe cost of providing these benefits. In fact, some estimates state \nthat providing these benefits will cost much less than this amendment \nwould provide. I hope that is the case.\n  Nonetheless, this Nation's National Guard and Reserve members and \ntheir families deserve these benefits now.\n  I was drawn into this by a recent visit from our National Guard and \nReserve units in Arkansas. A human resource officer brought to me the \nfact that many of these individuals--Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield another 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n[[Page S4063]]\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, on a visit with our National Guard and \nReserves, a human resource officer came to me and said: Do you realize \nthat when these individuals are called up to active duty, we can't \nactivate them because they have not had the proper medical care? These \nare individuals who have signed on the dotted line and said they are \nwilling to go and defend this country. Yet in their private lives they \ncannot afford or have access to the appropriate health care that keeps \nthem at a health care level that we could actually activate them when \nwe need them.\n  This amendment is just the tip of the iceberg with respect to this \nNation's overwhelming amount of uninsured families. Statistics show us \nthat one in five Americans do not have any form of health coverage at \nall.\n  Congress must address the larger problem of uninsured families across \nthis Nation, but the absolute least we can do is to provide full \ncoverage to America's National Guard and Reserves and their families.\n  The time is right. And this is the right policy and the right \npriority for our men and women serving in the Guard and the Reserves.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to add Senator Pryor as a cosponsor \nto this amendment when we are prepared to offer it.\n  I say to all those Americans listening, we all must make \ncontributions. It is not too much to ask of our fellow Americans to \ndelay a larger tax cut in order to provide the necessary health care \nthat these individuals need to be called up to serve.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield me 5 minutes to \nhave a colloquy with the Senator from Arizona?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We can have that understanding, and then we will come \nback to Senator Brownback for a time he desires.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I listened to the speech of the Senator from \nArkansas, talking about the men and women in the armed services. What I \nwant to focus on for a minute is my son. One of my boys married a \nbeautiful young woman and they have two of my grandchildren. I have \ngotten to know her sister Megan. Megan is a brilliant young woman, \ngraduated Jefferson High School, which is a school for the academically \ntalented, has more merit scholars than any high school in America. She \nis a graduate of MIT, another great scientific institution. This young \nwoman is now in the gulf, an officer on a destroyer. She is trained to \nbe the person who gives the direction to fire missiles.\n  Things have changed since the Vietnam war, the Korean conflict, the \nSecond World War. Women are now heavily engaged in actions that are \nmilitary in nature. When we speak of the men and women of the armed \nservices, I can't help but focus on Megan. She is married. Her husband \nis getting ready to go to medical school. He is here. His wife is in \nharm's way in the Middle East. My conscience has been quirked by the \nvery fine statement of the Senator from Arkansas when she referred on \nmore than one occasion to the men and women of the armed services \nbecause the men and women of our armed services are the Megans of the \nworld. They are standing side by side of the men doing anything that a \nman can do. I congratulate the Senator for the amendment she will offer \nand her contribution to the Senate, not only with this amendment but \nwhat she does every day.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his comments.\n  It is so important for us to realize that these men and women in the \nReserves and the National Guard are leaving their families. They are \nleaving their careers, their jobs. The least we can do is provide for \nthem the ability to provide for their families the kind of health care \nthey need.\n  One of the most outrageous stories I heard was from our reservists in \nArkansas who said: We had to spend unbelievable amounts of money just \nto get these individuals up to the health care level where we could \nactually activate them. These are people who have offered themselves \nand have pledged that they would leave their families, they would leave \nwhat they have worked their entire lives to build to go and defend our \ncountry. There is absolutely no reason that we cannot provide for them \nthe ability to provide for their families and for themselves the health \ncare they need to be ready when the time comes and we call on them.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada. For all of my colleagues listening \nto this debate, I do not think it is too much to ask for the rest of \nAmericans of what we can do for those being called on more and more to \nserve this country. That is the National Guard and the Reserves.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas to introduce an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 282\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to propose an amendment at the \ndesk. I ask unanimous consent that the pending business be set aside so \nI may introduce an amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would be constrained to object at this \npoint because what we are doing is allowing Members to speak on their \namendments on both sides but not actually present their amendments at \nthis point. That has been what we have been doing back and forth all \nday today, as Members have come and spoken on their amendments but not \nactually sent them to the desk, with the exception of Senator Schumer \nwho had an amendment on homeland security. So I am contrained to object \nat this point. The Senator is completely able to go ahead and make his \npresentation. I would have to object at this point.\n  Mr. ENZI. It was my understanding that we were going to go back and \nforth on the introduction. It was our turn to have an introduction of \nan amendment. That is why we did that. We will wait for the \nintroduction.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are trying to go back and forth with respect to \nspeakers and with respect to the opportunity to address amendments, but \nnot formally enter them at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I hope once we are able to present the amendment that \nit will be accepted. We have floated it by both sides and it has been \nvetted as well. I hope it will be accepted.\n  I will be sending an amendment to the desk that will express the \nsense of Senate that a commission be established to provide a real \nmeans of addressing and eliminating Government waste in domestic \nagencies and programs within agencies. The Federal Government needs \nsuch a commission. We don't need one like the ones we have had in the \npast that don't have any teeth to them, that simply report but there is \nnever a vote taken on what the commission puts forward. This one will \nbe different in that respect. Indeed, at a time of economic uncertainty \nand of war, it is imperative that the Government demonstrate real \nfiscal responsibility and accountability in Federal spending. Whether \nit is corporate America or the U.S. Government, fiscal accountability \nis paramount.\n  With the devastating collapses we have had in corporate America, with \nEnron and WorldCom and others last year, we have seen what happens in \nthe corporate world when fiscal accountability grows lax. Let's take \nsteps now to avoid the same pitfalls at the Federal Government level. \nLet us ensure public trust by opening the books of Federal domestic \nagencies and programs within agencies, making changes and reforms where \nnecessary, in order to ensure that hard-earned taxpayer dollars are \nbeing spent wisely.\n  Fiscal accountability is what my amendment to the budget resolution \nis all about. Over the years we have established many useful measuring \nsticks for fiscal accountability in Federal spending. The Government \nPerformance Result Act, GPRA, comes to mind. However, what measuring \nsticks such as GPRA lack is an effective means to implement their \nuseful findings. What this resolution calls for is a commission that \nwould incorporate the Federal Government's existing accountability \nmeasuring sticks to perform additional research of its own and provide \nthe Congress with legislation, which we would vote on to either accept \nor reject as a whole, to implement its recommendations or not to accept \nthem.\n\n[[Page S4064]]\n\n  In a few days I will be reintroducing bipartisan legislation that \ncreates such a commission. The bipartisan Commission on the \nAccountability and Review of Federal Agencies, CARFA Act, would fulfill \nwhat is addressed by this resolution. It is bipartisan. Senator Miller \nfrom Georgia is a cosponsor, and I hope to add a number of others on \nthis bill in the near term.\n  I wish to speak for a minute about the CARFA Act. The CARFA Act \nprovides Congress with a viable proven model to eliminate Government \nwaste and inefficiency. It is modeled after the successful Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission. CARFA will incorporate the findings \nof past measuring sticks such as GPRA and will give them teeth. This \nprogram will focus on domestic discretionary spending. It will not be \nfocused on military or entitlement programs. It is domestic \ndiscretionary programs. Where past commissions and reports failed in \nthat they had no real means by which Congress could implement their \nfindings and recommendations, CARFA will succeed.\n  The scope of review called for by this resolution entails domestic \nagencies and programs within agencies. I want to emphasize that point. \nWhere BRAC is already in existence and has gone through several rounds \nin rooting out waste in the Department of Defense and consolidating \nresources to make them more useful, more viable, CARFA would review \nFederal domestic agencies and programs within agencies using a narrow \nset of criteria which should produce significant results and do what \nBRAC did, consolidating our dollars in more efficient uses in high-\npriority areas.\n  Over the proposed commission's 2-year review, the commission focused \non two particular areas.\n  One, duplicative: Where two or more agencies or programs are \nperforming similar functions which can be consolidated or streamlined \ninto a single agency or program, the commission would recommend that \nthe agency or program be realigned. We do not need duplication within \nthe Federal Government.\n  Second, wasteful or inefficient: Where the commission finds an agency \nor program to have wasted Federal funds by low-priority spending, it \nwould recommend that such an agency or program be realigned or \neliminated.\n  Three, outdated, irrelevant, or failed programs: We have those within \nthe Federal Government. Where the commission finds that an agency or \nprogram has completed its intended purpose--I do not think we ever \nthink about that, that a program actually completes its intended \npurpose, but it happens and we keep spending in the program--has become \nirrelevant, or has failed to meet its objectives--it was designed \nproperly in the sense that the people at the time had the best of \nintentions in the design of the program, but it simply did not work to \nmeet the needs at that time--and it would recommend the elimination of \nsuch an agency or program.\n  Such a commission, upon completion of its 2-year review, would submit \nto Congress both its recommendations for the realignment and \nelimination of domestic agencies and programs, and proposed legislation \nto implement these recommendations.\n  The Congress would then consider the commission's proposed \nlegislation in an expedited manner, with input from the committees \nunder whose jurisdiction the affected agencies or programs fall. \nFollowing the committee's comment period, the proposed legislation \nwould be brought to the floor of each Chamber for debate and a single \nvote, up or down, without amendment, one vote.\n  If we are going to get serious about priority spending during this \ncritical time in our Nation's history, if we want to get the most use \nout of every taxpayer dollar that comes to Washington, such a \ncommission is clearly needed.\n  As in any bureaucracy, inefficiency or low-priority use of taxpayer \ndollars is often a serious threat to the credibility of an agency or a \nprogram, much less the legislative bodies that create and sustain them. \nWe must be certain the money we spend is not just allocated in a \ncertain way just because we have historically spent it that way.\n  I do not know of anything that drives my constituents more nuts than \nto see wasteful Federal spending or programs that have accomplished \ntheir purposes but the money is still being spent. There are people who \ncome up to me and say: I do not mind paying my taxes, but it drives me \nnuts to see the money poorly spent. If I am going to work hard to earn \nthis money, I want it to be wisely spent. Too often there are examples \nof that not occurring.\n  Priorities do change and our spending must change with them. The \nCARFA Act is crafted to take these changes into account. Whether one is \nconservative or liberal or in between, surely we can all agree that \nlow-priority use of taxpayer dollars is an unacceptable strain on hard-\nworking Americans and on our economy. It is certainly no way to operate \na business. Yet I feel, as do many of my colleagues, that we \ncontinually fail to get the most out of every taxpayer dollar that \ncomes to Washington.\n\n  Let's change that. CARFA is about maximizing the benefit of all \nFederal funds. Funds saved through this legislation could be used to \npay down the national debt or be channeled to higher congressional \npriorities.\n  It is my hope this body will agree to this amendment and then proceed \nto consider and enact the CARFA Act. Truly, this will provide a real \ntool at the service of the Federal Government to better prioritize \nspending and shift funds from less beneficial to more beneficial areas. \nAll of us surely support such a move.\n  I believe Americans would greatly benefit from such a commission \nwhich has the real potential to help us truly root out inefficiency in \nthe Federal Government in such a way that we can more fully realize the \nbenefits of all Federal funds. That is the spirit of this amendment and \nthe CARFA Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort, to vote for this \namendment, to adopt it as part of the budget resolution and to show \nsupport for the CARFA Act of 2003 by becoming original cosponsors of \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, as we debate the budget, this is exactly what we need \nto be doing: Finding ways we can prioritize and make sure our spending \nis efficient.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as such time I am allowed to offer an \namendment, I intend to offer an amendment on behalf of myself and \nSenator Corzine. This is an amendment I actually offered in the Budget \nCommittee. I thought we had a good debate on it. It goes to the heart \nof what is happening at this moment on which so many Americans are \nfocusing and on which so many people in the world are focusing.\n  This Nation has gone to war with Iraq. Our thoughts are first and \nforemost with the men and women who serve our country in the Armed \nForces. While we debated the wisdom of going to war with Iraq, and I \npersonally have questioned whether it is a good idea, there can be no \ndebate or doubt about the dedication of our troops and devotion to our \ncountry or the honor they do us through their sacrifice. We all hope in \nearnest for a speedy victory and for the safe and quick return of those \nmen and women.\n  If we fail to prepare in this budget for the fact of this war in \nIraq, we will be engaging in wishful thinking. Worse, we will be \nfailing to think at all. The notion that this budget does not provide \nanything for this enormous undertaking that is occurring is really \ntroubling and really is not what you can call honest budgeting.\n  I will concede no one is really certain how much the war with Iraq \nwill actually cost, but we can be certain this war will be far from \nfree. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the President's \nformer adviser for economic policy, Lawrence Lindsey, estimated the \ncost of the war would be $100 billion to $200 billion. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates, the initial deployment of troops \nand equipment would cost about $14 billion; the first month of combat \nwould cost $10 billion, and then with each subsequent month of combat \ncosting $8 billion per month. To return troops and\n\n[[Page S4065]]\n\nequipment to their home bases after the war some people believe would \ncost $9 billion, and any postwar occupation of Iraq would cost between \n$1 billion and $4 billion, Mr. President, per month--per month.\n  Using CBO's figures, if we make some ballpark assumptions that active \nmilitary combat will last for 2\\1/2\\ months and that the following \nreconstruction and occupation would last another 2 years, we are \ntalking about something between $69 billion and $141 billion.\n  The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments estimates that the \ncost of combat from 1 to 6 months would be $18 billion to $85 billion, \nand the cost of reconstruction for 5 years would range from $25 billion \nto $105 billion. Adding all the potential costs identified by the \ncenter, it would lead to total cost estimates ranging on the low end \nfrom $129 billion to $683 billion on the high end.\n  Plainly, we are talking about a major enterprise, and obviously it is \none for which we should budget.\n  The amendment I offer on behalf of myself and the senior Senator from \nNew Jersey will create a reserve fund to set aside $100 billion.\n  That is an amount well within the range of the available estimates I \nwas highlighting in order to fund this military action and \nreconstruction in Iraq. We pay for this action by reducing the amount \nthat we would budget for cutting taxes in the period covered by the \nbudget resolution--a simple proposition. The amount of $100 billion \nwould be put in a reserve fund so we can honestly estimate a budget for \nthe war in Iraq, and that would come out of the tax cut that is \ncontemplated.\n  When we are conducting a war, the budget must reflect it. We cannot \nblithely go along as if this were a time for business as usual. We \nshould budget responsibly for what is happening right before our eyes.\n  When I am able to actually offer this amendment, I will strongly urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment. The American people will be \nextremely supportive, obviously, of our troops in this effort as it is \nconducted. What they will not understand, though, is if we pretend that \nthis will cost nothing, that we will pass a budget in the midst of this \nwar effort pretending that the war in Iraq will not be an expensive \nproposition. We owe them that. We owe them honesty at this historical \nand very significant moment, and we must set aside a reasonable \nestimate of funds to cover the cost of this enormous undertaking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, I explained earlier why the emergency supplemental was \nnot a part of the regular budget process. I want to share one paragraph \nfrom a CRS report:\n\n       Based on an examination of previous CRS reviews of funding \n     for wars and other major military operations, it appears, \n     with one possible exception, that Presidents have not \n     requested and Congress has not provided funding for wars in \n     advance of the start of operations. Rather, administrations \n     have requested funding after operations have begun and \n     Congress has subsequently appropriated money to meet specific \n     documented budget requirements.\n\n  I yield the floor, reserving the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for 30 seconds to respond to the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in response to the Senator's remarks, \nthe reason these wars were not budgeted for in the past is that they \nwere obviously not foreseen. They occurred after the budget resolution \noccurred. We have known about this war and the imminent reality of it \nfor some time. We are actually seeing it undertaken as we speak, and we \nare doing the budget resolution right now. There simply is no hard and \nfast rule against being honest in budgeting. That is all we are calling \nfor, and this is an appropriate occasion when we can and should budget \nfor the war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I salute the Senator from Wisconsin. I \nthink it is absolutely bizarre that we have the budget before us and we \nhave nothing to pay for the war in that budget. The reason given was \nthat operations had not commenced. Well, operations have commenced. And \nnot to set aside funds for the war makes no earthly sense. How can that \npossibly be defended? We are at war. We have already spent tens of \nbillions of dollars on that conflict, and now to suggest we put our \nhead in the sand and say there is nothing going on defies reality, \ndefies common sense.\n  I very much hope the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin is \nadopted.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from the State of Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, America is at war. Our priority must be \nto keep America and Americans safe, both at home and abroad. I look \nforward to supporting a supplemental budget to pay for the war and to \npay for homeland security, and I also voted to reserve the money to do \nthat. That is why I supported the ``patriotic pause'' that said no tax \ncuts until we know the cost of the war.\n  We know Americans are fighting overseas. The U.S. military should \nknow they have the entire Nation behind them to make sure they have the \nbest weapons, the best strategies, and the best support for their \nfamilies while they are overseas. We also stand up for what America \nstands for. That means strengthening the safety net for those who need \nit the most. That means standing up for America's families.\n  We also need to recognize that families are hurting. We have a weak \neconomy. People are going into debt to put their kids through school; \naffordable health insurance. Some families are facing extraordinary \nchallenges because they care for a loved one who has a chronic \ncondition: a parent with Alzheimer's, a child with autism, a son with \ncerebral palsy, a spouse with multiple sclerosis.\n  These families struggle every day to take care of their loved ones. \nThey face a tremendous emotional and financial burden. It is not the \njob of the Federal Government to help them with their emotional burden, \nbut I believe it is the job of the United States of America to help \nthem with their financial responsibility. For those who are giving \ncare, I believe we should give care. I want to give help to those who \npractice self-help.\n  Therefore, I will be offering an amendment to provide a tax credit \nfor up to $5,000 for family caregivers, or those needing care who have \ncaregiving expenses. This would cost $3.5 billion a year. My tax credit \nwould pay for the prescription drugs, medical bills, or medical \nmanagement for juvenile diabetics, the medical bills, or other care \nneeded if a person has someone they are caring for with Parkinson's \ndisease. My amendment would help people with multiple chronic \nconditions. We are not talking about hay fever, though that is \ndisruptive. We are talking about juvenile diabetes. We are talking \nabout autism. We are talking about multiple sclerosis, people who are \nunable to perform their activities of daily living, who are severely \ncognitively impaired, or children with such complex medical conditions \nthey require medical management and coordination of care.\n  Why is this needed? Well, in 2000, over 125 million people had \nchronic conditions. One in five Americans have multiple chronic \nconditions. Eighteen million children in this country have chronic \nphysical, developmental, or other conditions that impede their ability \nto live full lives. Almost 4 million Americans have mental retardation \nor another severe developmental disability. If the work of family \ncaregivers was replaced with paid services, it would cost the Federal \nGovernment close to $200 billion a year.\n  Family caregivers face many demands, emotional, physical, and \nfinancial stress. They have stresses with their families, with their \nmarriage, the stress of 36-hour days. They pay the high cost of \nmedication, physical therapy, durable medical equipment such as \nwheelchairs, daycare for children with special needs, and medical bills \nfrom care with specialists.\n  People with serious chronic conditions pay for their health care by \neither making gradual medical payments over time or using money from \nsavings, mutual funds, or other assets.\n\n[[Page S4066]]\n\n  Families struggle to make ends meet. Let me give an example. A woman \nin Potomac, MD, was caring for her husband who had a debilitating \nneurological disease. There was no treatment or cure. Her husband could \nno longer talk, walk, or feed himself. The family received no financial \nhelp. She worked full time to support his full-time home care. She \nherself is in her early 60s. She sure could have used that tax credit.\n  Or as the mother of two children in Parkville, MD, one of her \nchildren is a 4-year-old boy with autism. This family has relied on \nvolunteers from local colleges to assist with respite care for their \nson. This mother has not been able to return to work because of the \namount of time needed to care for her two young children. She has two \nmasters degrees in education.\n  Or like the Maryland woman who cared for a parent with Alzhemer's \ndisease who worked 25 hours per week to pay someone to care for her \nmother while she worked to have health insurance for herself; saw her \nown income go from a high of $40,000 a year to a low of $6,000 a year. \nA tax credit could have helped her with home health care and respite \ncare for her mother.\n  I think my amendment speaks for itself, but I try to speak for the \nfamilies where we need to give help to those who are practicing self-\nhelp.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of organizations supporting this \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Who supports BAM's Amendment:\n       Autism Society of America, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, \n     National Organization for Rare Disorders, Easter Seals, \n     United Cerebral Palsy Associations, Arc of the United States, \n     National Health Council, National Council on the Aging, \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America, Family Voices, National \n     Respite Coalition, National Family Caregivers Association, \n     and the National Alliance for Caregiving.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. One of my first milestones in the Senate was the \nenactment of the Spousal Anti-Impoverishment Act to change the cruel \nrules of Medicaid so that families would not have to go bankrupt before \nMedicaid would pay for nursing home care for a spouse. The spouse \nliving in the community could keep the family home, keep a car, and \nkeep some income each month to live on. This has helped one million \npeople.\n  But this was a down payment. Not much has been done since then except \nthe National Family Caregiver Support Program and long-term care \ninsurance for Federal employees. I was proud to sponsor and work on \nboth of these important measures and a bipartisan basis to get them \nsigned into law.\n  Now it is time to make the family caregivers who are the backbone of \nthe long term care system in this country a priority in the Federal law \nbooks and the tax code.\n  I urge my colleagues to get behind our Nation's family caregivers and \nvote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \nexcellent amendment. We appreciate very much her presentation and the \nthoughtfulness and the energy that she has put into this amendment. I \nhope my colleagues will pay close attention to what she has offered.\n  Next, I am going to yield 30 minutes to the senior Senator from South \nCarolina. Let me say that if there was an award in this body for Mr. \nFiscal Responsibility, it would be the senior Senator from South \nCarolina. In the time I have been in the Senate, nobody has been more \nserious, more dedicated to balancing budgets, to paying down debt than \nthe Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the leader from North Dakota. He \nhas led our Budget Committee and done an outstanding job. The kudos \nbelong to him for fiscal responsibility, and the responsibility in the \nposition he has as the ranking member, to try to get the group together \non a consensus, which is next to impossible, but he does the job.\n  I have three amendments at the desk, and I understand we are not \nintroducing amendments, so I will address hastily comments on all \nthree.\n  The first, of course, is the port security amendment for $1 billion a \nyear for 2 years. It is focused, not Pepto-Bismol homeland security of \n$80 billion over 10-some years. I have talked to Senators on both sides \nof the aisle. They want to finance what we passed unanimously--all 100 \nSenators--earlier last year for port security.\n  Right to the point, Osama owns several vessels. His teams landed and \nblew up the Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. His crews were on \nplanes flown into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. He could \njust as easily have two or three crews get on an Exxon tanker going up \nthe Delaware River to deliver a tankerful of oil, throw the captain \noverboard and that tanker aground, and that would close down the \neastern seaboard for at least 1 year.\n  I could go into it, but the amendment is worked out and in detail. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the details of the \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Hollings Seaport Security Amendment to the Budget Resolution\n\n       Amendment would add one billion annually, over the next two \n     years, to the Federal Budget. The one billion will be spent \n     as follows:\n\n     Maritime Administration (610 million):\n       450 million--for grants to ports and waterfront facilities \n     to help ensure compliance with federally approved security \n     plans.\n       150 million--for grants to states, local municipalities and \n     other entities to help comply with Federal area security \n     plans and to provide grants to responders for port security \n     contingency response.\n       10 million--to be used in conjunction with the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Training Center to help develop a seaport \n     security training curriculum to provide training to Federal \n     and State law enforcement personnel, and to certify private \n     security personnel working at seaports.\n     Coast Guard (160 million):\n       50 million--for port security assessments.\n       50 million--for the establishment and operation of multi-\n     agency task force to coordinate and evaluate maritime \n     information in order to identify and respond to security \n     threats.\n       40 million--to help implement the Automated Identification \n     System (AIS) and other tracking systems designed to actively \n     track and monitor vessels operating in U.S. waters.\n       20 million--for additional Coast Guard port security \n     vessels.\n     The Border and Transportation Security Directorate (230 \n     million):\n       100 million--to Customs for the installation of screening \n     equipment, and to be used to help develop new technologies to \n     help develop and prototype screening and detection equipment \n     at U.S. ports.\n       100 million--to TSA and Customs; 50 million each, to \n     evaluate and implement cargo security programs.\n       30 million--for the Transportation Security Administration \n     (TSA) to develop and implement the Transportation Worker ID \n     Card, and to conduct criminal background checks of \n     transportation workers who work in secure areas or who work \n     with sensitive cargo or information.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguish Chair.\n  The second concerns paying for the war. At the very beginning of this \nsession, the first week of January, I introduced a bill to pay for the \nwar in Iraq. I read a book about the fiscal dilemmas we faced each time \nthere was a war, and I say to my distinguished colleague from Wyoming, \neach time our leaders paid for the war. During the Civil War they put a \ntax on dividends. The party of Lincoln did that. In World War I, they \nwent up to a 77 percent marginal tax rate to pay for that war; in World \nWar II, a 94 percent rate; in the Korean war, 91 percent. In Vietnam--\nthat is when President Johnson, who has been abused in history but he \nis the one who wanted to pay for guns and butter--he balanced the \nbudget, paying for both guns and butter, in 1968 to 1969. That was the \nlast time in the history of this Congress we balanced the budget. We \npaid for the war in Vietnam.\n  Now, of course, we come to the war on Iraq. Unlike the Civil War \nwhere we had put taxes on dividends, here, there is no tomorrow; like \ndrunken sailors, we come up to this chamber and say we are not going to \npay for the war.\n  My particular measure on the desk is a reserve fund of $100 billion. \nLarry Lindsey, the President's former chief economic advisor, said the \nwar will cost between $100 and $200 billion, but that is up to the \nFinance Committee to figure out. You have to put your money where your \nmouth is. I think a better way to pay is with new money. We cannot just \nforgo this program or that program. We need a value-added tax of 2\n\n[[Page S4067]]\n\npercent dedicated to paying just for that war in Iraq. It would take \nthe IRS a solid year until they fashioned the tax and we could start \ncollecting it. But it is a very enforceable tax. Every industrialized \ncountry has had one. We had hearings before the Finance Committee back \nin the 1980s about a value-added tax. We almost adopted it then.\n  We ought to get serious and get off the deficit bandwagon we are on \nnow. That is what disturbs me. The Commander in Chief, the President of \nthe United States, says in time of war we run deficits. Then, just the \nother day, in a speech to the nation, he said that ``Americans \nunderstand the costs of conflict because we have paid them in the past. \nWar has no certainty except the certainty of sacrifice.''\n  The point is, we must have sacrifice; yet that is not being followed \nthrough, by any manner or means, with respect to paying for the war. \nNow is the time for this body to sober up and realize we are running \nhorrendous deficits.\n  What we have right now is the certainty of sacrifice, for everyone \nexcept the Commander in Chief and us in Congress. What we are saying to \nthat GI going into Iraq tonight is: We hope you don't get hurt. We hope \nyou don't get killed because we want you to hurry back. Why? Because we \nare going to give you the bill. We are not going to pay for the war. \nThe fellow who fights the war is going to have to pay for the war \nbecause we need a tax cut. We are going to Disney World. We are not \ngoing to have any sacrifice.\n  They are all running around here with flags on their lapels. So I put \nsection 6 into my bill when I introduced it, which says that if members \nvote against it, they will be prohibited from wearing the flags in \ntheir lapels.\n  Now when the President leads you to deficits by saying, in time of \nwar we can run deficits, we are playing a game. He says that so in the \nelection next year, you can say, ``I voted for tax cuts.'' That is our \ndilemma.\n  The other side talks about the need for tax cuts so we can see \neconomic growth and growth and growth; but my third amendment is to \nstop the tax cuts.\n  You can see in this budget before the Senate, the only growth we have \nis in the national debt. It goes from $6.687 trillion in fiscal year \n2003, to $11.919 trillion in fiscal year 2013. It goes up, up, and away \nby $5.2 trillion. I was here when we did not even have a $1 trillion \ndeficit. President Reagan started this tax cut nonsense with voodoo I, \nand we immediately had a recession. Dave Stockman wrote in his book \n``The Triumph of Politics,'' we should have canceled the tax cut in \nNovember 1981, and we did not. He said the President did not do what he \nshould have done.\n  Then we had voodoo II, the year before last, with President Bush's \ntax cut. On June 1, 2001, we had surpluses. Then we passed the tax cut, \nvoodoo II, on June 8, and by July 1 we had a deficit. By September 10, \n2001--one day before September 11 we had a deficit. We were in the red \nby $99 billion, so don't blame the deficits on September 11.\n  We were already in deficits, and voodoo II caused it. Now we seem to \nget no education in the third kick of a mule, so to speak. We are on \ncourse just for the pollsters and buying the election next year with \nmore tax cuts. That is why I resist what some members are trying to do \nby cutting the tax cut down to $350 billion.\n  Do you know what that means to this particular Senator? I was with \nPhil Gramm and Warren Rudman on Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, and our \nparticular initiative called for the reduction of the deficit each year \nby $35 billion. Here they want me to vote to increase the deficit each \nyear by $35 billion for 10 years, or $350 billion.\n  What will happen is we will pass it in the Senate, it will get over \nto the conference, they will fix it, it will be back up to $700 \nbillion-and-something. You will have the votes. You have the majority.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have ``budget realities'' printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

U.S. Government; Beginning in 1962, CBO's The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2004-2013, January 2003.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If you take the years from 1945, from President Truman \ndown through President Ford, 30 years, to 1975, you will find the \naggregate total of all deficits at $358 billion. That is for 30 years, \nsix Presidents, the cost of World War II, the cost of Korea, the cost \nof Vietnam. All throughout that and all the deficits, it was only $358 \nbillion. Last year the deficit was, in 1 year, $428 billion. Here in my \nhand is the President's budget. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the last page in here, page 332.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               TABLE S-14.--FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING AND DEBT\n                                            [In billions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                            Estimates\n              Function                  2002   -----------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       actual      2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       2008\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDebt outstanding, end of year:\n    Gross Federal debt:\n        Debt issued by Treasury....      6,171      6,725      7,294      7,811      8,327      8,832      9,363\n        Debt issued by other                27         27         27         26         26         26         25\n         agencies..................\n                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Total, gross Federal debt      6,198      6,752      7,321      7,837      8,353      8,858      9,388\n    Held by:\n        Debt held by Government          2,658      2,874      3,155      3,451      3,751      4,061      4,385\n         accounts..................\n        Debt held by the public....      3,540      3,878      4,166      4,387      4,603      4,797      5,003\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. On page 332, the President projects we will have a \ndeficit next year of $569 billion. He says this year we will end up \nwith a $554 billion deficit. That $554 billion doesn't include the $100 \nbillion for Iraq. So you can see we are up around $600 or $700 billion.\n  I used to say Strom Thurmond and I are home free. But I think my \nnewest distinguished colleague from South Carolina will have to pay for \nit. I will not have to pay for it. I am not worried about it, and \neverything else like that. We can retire, get our pension, go on home \nand be quiet. But you cannot do it in good conscience when you come to \nGovernment to do the job of the people, and they trust you, they want \nyou to look out for the needs of the country, not the needs of the \ncampaign. That is what we are all engaged in here.\n  People are giving up their lives for us, for what we believe in, for \nwhat we legislate, and for the command we give them to go to war. We \nought at least to pay for the war on the one hand. And we ought to \nensure the peace economically for our children and grandchildren, not \nby tax cuts, but somehow, somewhere, to pay for these budgets.\n  I would like to get Government on a pay-as-you-go basis. I remember \nwhen Alan Greenspan went down with a team to President Clinton and he \nsaid you are going to have to raise taxes. In 1993 we raised taxes. We \ncut the spending and we raised taxes on Social Security, we raised \ntaxes on gasoline, we raised taxes on the highest bracket. And we had 8 \nyears of the finest and strongest economy.\n  Now we come here and want to sell the idea of tax cuts are going to \ngive growth. We know that with $428 billion and $554 billion in \ndeficits, that's really almost a trillion dollars in stimulus, and that \nis without the cost of the war. What gives here?\n  We have to sober up and get off this deficit barleycorn we are \ndrinking like drunken sailors around here, like there is no tomorrow, \nlike we don't have to pay for the war. There is no sacrifice for us.\n  We go to the schoolchildren in America and we say there is one thing \ncertain about war, it is sacrifice. But then we come up with the \npollsters and say we have to get reelected so we want to go ahead next \nyear to say we cut taxes.\n  So there we are. I am not for that $350 billion compromise or \nwhatever it is. I admire the people who are trying to work out the \ncompromise, but that is totally misleading to the American people, that \nsomehow the burden is too great on estate taxes. We have had people \ncome here, George Soros, Bill Gates, and the others come who are paying \nthe estate taxes. They come and say don't worry about it. That is not \nreally too big a burden.\n  With respect to dividends, in the market in New York there is a \ndichotomy, a difference up there with respect to whether or not we \nought to lift the taxes on dividends. But if they would talk about \nseniors, they would say senior are double taxed on their Social \nSecurity. I pay the tax on Social Security and when I receive the \nbenefit, I pay the tax on that Social Security benefit. That is double \ntaxation. Eighty percent of seniors in America depend for the major \npart of their income on Social Security. So if it's seniors we have in \nmind we want to look out for, then look out for, not the rich seniors, \nbut the poor seniors, 80 percent of the seniors, because they are not \nin that top bracket that is worried about estate taxes and everything \nelse of that kind.\n  I really appreciate the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nyielding me this time. I wanted to be able, in a deliberate fashion \ntalk about these amendments, because when we get to that 1 minute a \nside rule I will not be able to.\n\n  I have a very judicious amendment on port security, where we would \njust fund it for 2 years. We voted 100 to nothing, all Republicans and \nall Democrats, with respect to port security.\n  I think we ought to pay for the war. We are not raising the taxes \nhere and we are not telling them how to do it in the Finance Committee. \nThe Budget Committee can't do that. But we can do the amount. And I \nthink we ought not to have any more tax cuts.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota, with my gratitude. I appreciate it very much.\n\n[[Page S4069]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the senior Senator from South Carolina for his \nleadership. One of the people who inspired me to run for the Senate was \nthe Senator from South Carolina. I don't think I have ever told the \nSenator that. But when the Senator from South Carolina was running for \nPresident of the United States, our former Governor, Bill Guy, endorsed \nSenator Hollings.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. My friend.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Bill Guy was a very close friend of my family and \nsomebody who has been a mentor to me in public service.\n  Bill Guy was a balanced budget Democrat. He believed in balanced \nbudgets and he believed in fiscal responsibility. He was proud to stand \nwith the Senator from South Carolina during that time of dramatically \nrising deficits. To him it was a threat to the economic security of the \ncountry and he thought the Senator from South Carolina had the best \nplan.\n  I think if anybody looks back objectively at that time, one will see \nin fact the Senator from South Carolina did have the best plan. If it \nhad been adopted at the time we would have avoided much of the debt now \nfacing the country.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the distinguished Senator will yield, I really am \ngrateful to him. The truth is, more than a balanced budget, we need \nbalanced Senators. The distinguished Senator from North Dakota is just \nthat. He has that even temper in how he approached it, and therefore \nhas been far more effective because I have been wailing and crying \nwithout effect for years. But I will continue on, trying my best, thank \nyou very much.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. And I can only say, I have been \ncompletely ineffective at stopping what I think is a rush to deficits \nand debt and, ultimately, decline.\n  I believe it is profoundly wrong--profoundly wrong--to run up these \nbudget deficits. Unfortunately, the budget that the President of the \nUnited States sent to us and the budget that has come out of the \ncommittee will dramatically increase our budget deficits.\n  As the Senator has indicated, we are going to have a deficit, if the \nPresident's budget is adopted, of over $500 billion this year and will \nnever have a budget deficit below $400 billion any year for the rest of \nthis decade under the budget the President sent us. Under the budget \nthat has come out of the committee, we will never have a deficit under \n$300 billion.\n  On this chart is the President's budget. One can see we have red ink \nas far as the eye can see, over $500 billion this year, over $400 \nbillion in every year for the rest of this decade.\n  Here is what happens to the gross Federal debt. The gross Federal \ndebt is going to go from $6 trillion, in 2002, and is going to reach \n$12 trillion by the end of this budget period. That is the consequence \nof the President's budget.\n  What I think should sober us all is that the cost of the President's \ntax cuts explodes at exactly the time the cost to the Federal \nGovernment of the retirement of the baby boom generation explodes--\ndeficits and debt.\n  These are not my projections. These are official reports of the \nCongressional Budget Office and the President's own budget documents.\n  Here is the President's own budget document as shown right here. This \nis the long-term outlook if the President's policies are adopted. It \nshows that we are in the sweet spot now. This is where we are now. And \nalthough these are record deficits, the biggest in dollar terms we have \never had, if we adopt his policies, it is going to get much worse \nbecause, as I indicated, the cost of his tax cuts explodes at the very \ntime the cost of the retirement of the baby boom generation explodes.\n  That is not a projection. We know baby boomers have been born. They \nare alive today. They are eligible for Social Security and Medicare. \nThere are going to be 77 million of them--about double the number we \nhave eligible today. That is what we face as a consequence of this \nbudget. I think it will be a significant mistake.\n  I want to, for a moment, discuss an amendment I will be offering for \nour colleagues to deal with the promise the Federal Government made on \nIDEA; that is, the Individuals With Disabilities Act. We made a promise \nto local governments that the Federal Government would fund 40 percent \nof the cost. It was a promise we have never kept. As a result, property \ntaxes are higher in every jurisdiction of America.\n  I will offer an amendment to keep the promise of IDEA, and to pay for \nit, and to pay for it by reducing the tax cuts that are part of this \nlegislation.\n  The legislation before us has $1.4 trillion in tax cuts. The \nassociated interest costs another almost $300 billion. So the total \ncost of this tax cut, in this measure, is $1.7 trillion. The \nlegislation I will offer to keep the promise on IDEA is a fraction of \nthat, a small fraction of that--around $70 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  The Federal Government made a promise, when the legislation was \nadopted, that we would fund 40 percent of the cost. My colleagues know \nthat we are only doing about half as much as we promised.\n\n  What does that mean? That means the local districts get stuck with \nthe bill. That means pressure is put on local property taxes. In my own \nState, now the annual property tax is about 2.5 percent of the value of \nthe property. That is a very burdensome tax. In part, it is a result of \nour not keeping a promise and shoving the burden off on local school \ndistricts. That is not something we should do. If we make a commitment, \nwe ought to keep it.\n  I am going to give our colleagues a chance to keep the promise that \nwas made on IDEA, and to fund it out of the tax cut. We are still \noperating under an agreement in which we are discussing amendments but \nnot sending them to the desk at this point. We will do that at an \nappropriate time. But I wanted to alert my colleagues that I am going \nto offer an amendment on IDEA. I am going to offer it in a way that is \npaid for. I am going to offer it in a way that is not at the top end of \nthe range, by any means. It is going to have a cost of between $70 and \n$80 billion over 10 years. We will pay for it by reducing the $1.4 \ntrillion tax cut.\n  A budget is about choices. A budget is about priorities. I believe \nthat ought to be a priority for this body and for this country. I \nbelieve we ought to keep the promise that was made to local school \ndistricts when the legislation was passed. I believe we ought to \nrejigger the priorities of the budget resolution that is before us, \nreduce the size of the tax cut, keep the promise of IDEA, and take \npressure off local property taxes because that is exactly where the \nburden is borne when the Federal Government does not keep its promise.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I share Senator Conrad's desire that we \ndo more for IDEA. Under President Bush, we have done more than ever. We \nalso need reform of IDEA. If we listen to our teachers, principals, and \nschool people, they will tell us that the Federal laws are driving them \ncrazy, undermining their ability to discipline. We need some reform at \nthe same time we put in some additional money. We have a chance to do \nthat this year.\n  What I want to express my concern about is this manufactured issue \nabout the supplemental and that we cannot proceed with our budget \nwithout knowing what the supplemental is going to be. We have a budget \nlaw that says we have to have this done by April 15. We cannot sit \naround here and wait forever.\n  I would just like to remind everybody how we got here.\n  Last fall, in this body and the House--we voted 77 to 23 in this \nSenate to authorize the President of the United States to use force, if \nhe deemed fit, to protect the security of the United States.\n  After great care and every option being pursued, the President has \nconcluded that we should use force. I am not aware that a single one of \nthose 77 Senators wishes to change their vote.\n  I also note that at that time the Democrats controlled this body. And \nat that time, while we voted to authorize the President to act, we \ndebated the\n\n[[Page S4070]]\n\ncost. We talked about the cost a great deal. People had all kinds of \nideas about the cost. And when we voted to authorize him to act, we \nknew there would be a cost.\n  We also knew our budget was not in balance and the effect of the war \nwould be to exacerbate the debt that we had. Nobody had any doubt about \nthat. Nobody has any doubt about that today.\n  In the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member, we voted to \nproceed with an authorization bill. We will have an authorization bill \nthat sets our spending criteria for next year, with a limit that we \npass here. We are going to have a nice increase in the baseline for \ndefense next year, with far greater increases than ever occurred under \nPresident Clinton and the Democratic leadership here. Suggesting we are \nnot doing enough for defense--we are having a nice, solid, significant \nincrease. I wish it could be more. In our circumstances, it is the best \nwe can do.\n  So we know we are going to fund the budget. We are going to fund this \nwar. And we know how we are going to do it; and that is, by a \nsupplemental.\n  Now, for example, Turkey is still waffling around, to some degree, \nabout whether or not we can come through there in pursuing this war.\n  There are a lot of uncertainties out there. It is not fair to expect \nthat the President can walk in here today and give us an accurate total \nabout how much this war is going to cost. We certainly ought not to \nfail to meet our April 15 deadline of passing a budget based on that \nobjection. We are going to fund this war, and we should fund this war \ncompletely. We are going to do it by a supplemental. Everybody knows \nit. It is nothing more than a delaying tactic for them to claim that we \nshould not proceed with the budget until the supplemental is done.\n  In fact, who knows, we could have a supplemental even after the war \nis over, but we probably need it sooner so we can make sure our funding \nstream continues apace.\n  Historically, we have never budgeted the cost of a war. The \nCongressional Research Service has done a report. They report:\n\n       Presidents have not requested and Congress has not approved \n     funding for wars in advance of the start of operations. \n     Rather, administrations have requested funding after the \n     operations have begun, and Congress has subsequently \n     appropriated money to meet the specific documented budgetary \n     requirements.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Congress has provided the executive branch with \n     considerable flexibility in financing military operations in \n     advance of specific congressional action on appropriations.\n\n  So this is just an excuse. This is just a political gimmick that we \nknow is going on. We know this supplemental is going to be significant. \nWe have known that from the very beginning. I don't believe we ought to \nbe deterred from completing our statutorily required duty, and that is \nto produce a budget waiting on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a little later this afternoon we will \nconsider a resolution supporting the men and women in uniform waging \nthe war with Iraq. Many Members will come and express their sentiments. \nIt is appropriate, and this is the right moment to do it. When the \nfirst shot is fired, the political debate should start to take a back \nseat to our solidarity and commitment to standing behind these men and \nwomen who have their lives on the line. We hope this conflict is short \nlived, that it is successful, and that they come home safe with their \nmission accomplished. Our thoughts and prayers are not only with them \nbut with the innocent people of Iraq, many of whom have been victims of \nthe terrorism of Saddam Hussein and his repressive regime.\n  There is another part of this conflict that needs to be addressed. We \nwill also stand with the President, with the administration to provide \nthe money that is necessary to wage the war. There is no doubt about \nthat. This Congress will vote to give the men and women the resources \nthey need to come home safely and quickly. Of course, the question \nposed to us is, How will you pay for it?\n  It is ironic that we are debating a budget resolution today that \ncontains zero for the war in Iraq. I am sure many people are puzzled \nwhen they step back and reflect. We have known the troop buildup was \nexpensive. We know the war itself is expensive, perhaps the cost of \noccupation afterwards. Why don't we budget for this? Why don't we plan \nfor it? Some have said: We don't appropriate money for possibilities. \nWe appropriate money for real needs.\n  This is a real need. We have to be honest. We have allies in this \neffort, primarily Great Britain, but there aren't many countries, if \nany, coming forward with troops in the field or money to pay for the \ncost of this undertaking. That is why I come today in support of an \namendment which will be offered later by Senator Russ Feingold of \nWisconsin. It is an important amendment because basically what Senator \nFeingold is saying is, over the next 10 years we will be setting aside \n$10 billion a year to pay for the cost of the war in Iraq; $100 billion \nis not an unreasonable pricetag. The lowest pricetag we have had for \nthe war is about $26 billion, and the most expensive is way beyond \nSenator Feingold's suggested amendment.\n  I am not suggesting we won't appropriate this money; we will. But we \nshould at this point do not only the patriotic thing but the \nresponsible thing and set aside the money we will need to pay for the \nwar.\n  If we don't, I can tell you what is going to happen. It is going to \ngo into a tax cut proposed by the President for the wealthiest people \nin this country. What is more important, that we meet our obligation to \nour men and women in uniform not just with rhetoric but with a pledge \nof money to pay for the resources they need to win or that we provide a \ntax cut for the wealthiest people in America? That should not even be a \nchoice at this moment.\n  We have to remember we are spending about $700 million a month right \nnow on the war on terrorism. I commend the efforts of the Senator from \nAlaska, Mr. Stevens, during the Clinton administration to have the \nDefense Department budget for ongoing contingencies such as the \nconflict in Bosnia and the no-fly zones in Iraq. These were ongoing \nconflicts with expected costs that were not budgeted, and the Senator \nfrom Alaska insisted on honest budgeting. That is what the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold, is insisting today.\n  The administration may send up a supplemental appropriation bill as \nearly as next week. That really begs the question, Why does the White \nHouse refuse to send up estimates of the cost of the war this week and \ninsist that we pass this budget resolution without one penny for the \nwar in Iraq?\n  To a lot of people who are watching the debate, this may seem like \nsome procedural hassle over accounting techniques. It is more. If we \ndon't set aside the funds for the war in Iraq, those funds will come \nout of programs for education and health care and critical domestic \nneeds. I will support the amendment by the Senator from Wisconsin, but \nI hope all those who stand in solidarity with America's troops in Iraq \nwill also stand in solidarity when it comes to honest budgeting to pay \nfor the cost of the war so that our men and women in uniform can be \nsuccessful and come home safely and as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, would the Senator mind if Senator \nBrownback sent his amendment to the desk? He was ready to offer the \namendment last night and did not. He has already spoken on the \namendment. We\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\nagreed to allow Senator Schumer to send his amendment to the desk. Can \nwe send his amendment to the desk?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would if we can get agreement to send Senator \nFeingold's amendment as well.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have not looked at it. Let me look at his amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Why don't we do that, and if we can get agreement on \nthat, we will be happy to agree to Senator Brownback sending his \namendment to the desk as well.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Brownback has an amendment. I \nbelieve it is at the desk. I ask unanimous consent we set aside the \npending amendment for consideration of the Brownback amendment, and \nfollowing that, I ask consent to set aside the Brownback amendment to \nhave the Feingold amendment be considered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, what will that do to the \nsequence of votes? We would not want the Schumer amendment to lose its \nposition; that we would vote on that prior to the Brownback amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct. There is also a Cochran amendment that \nwill be offered as an alternative to the Schumer amendment. I would \nlike to have that voted on adjacent to the Schumer amendment, but we \nhave not sent that to the desk yet. The Schumer amendment is in the \nqueue. This would put the Brownback amendment in the queue, and it \nwould also put the Feingold amendment in the queue.\n  At some point, I will be asking consent for Senator Cochran's \namendment, and I will ask consent to have it considered adjacent to the \nSchumer amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Fair enough.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the time being, I am asking consent for the \nBrownback amendment to be considered and then the Feingold amendment. I \nunderstand from the Parliamentarian he has two amendments. I am not \nsure which one the Senator requested to be sent to the desk.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It would be the amendment which Senator Feingold \ndiscussed, which is the amendment for a $100 billion war reserve fund \nso that the war is paid for and the resources are available in this \nbudget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 282\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the Brownback amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback], for himself, Mr. \n     Inhofe, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Cornyn, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 282.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that a commission be \n       established to review the efficiency of Federal agencies)\n\n       On page 79, after line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 308. FEDERAL AGENCY REVIEW COMMISSION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that a commission should be \n     established to review Federal domestic agencies, and programs \n     within such agencies, with the express purpose of providing \n     Congress with recommendations, and legislation to implement \n     those recommendations, to realign or eliminate government \n     agencies and programs that are duplicative, wasteful, \n     inefficient, outdated, or irrelevant, or have failed to \n     accomplish their intended purpose.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 270\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RESERVE FUND FOR POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTION AND \n                   RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) In General.--Upon the favorable reporting of \n     legislation by the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate \n     making discretionary appropriations in excess of the levels \n     assumed in this resolution for expenses for possible military \n     action and reconstruction in Iraq in fiscal years 2003 \n     through 2013, the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may, \n     in consultation with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \n     appropriate committee, revise the level of total new budget \n     authority and outlays, the functional totals, allocations, \n     discretionary spending limits, and levels of deficits and \n     debt in this resolution by up to $100 billion in budget \n     authority and outlays.\n       (b) Application.--Any adjustments of allocations and \n     aggregates made pursuant to this resolution shall--\n       (1) apply while that measure is under consideration;\n       (2) take effect upon the enactment of that measure; and\n       (3) be published in the Congressional Record as soon as \n     practicable.\n       (c) Effect of Changed Allocations and Aggregates.--Revised \n     allocations and aggregates resulting from these adjustments \n     shall be considered for the purposes of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 as allocations and aggregates contained in \n     this resolution.\n       (d) Budget Committee Determinations.--For purposes of this \n     resolution--\n       (1) the levels of new budget authority, outlays, direct \n     spending, new entitlement authority, revenues, deficits, and \n     surpluses for a fiscal year or period of fiscal years shall \n     be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee \n     on the Budget of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Chairman of that Committee may make any other \n     necessary adjustments to such levels to carry out this \n     resolution.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I am inquiring how much time I have left on the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Before that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I asked that the reading of the amendment be dispensed \nwith.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Both have been dispensed with?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Both amendments are pending.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We set aside the Brownback amendment, and now the \nFeingold amendment is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. President, I inquire of the Parliamentarian, how much time do I \nhave remaining on the resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five hours and 45 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield back the remainder of my time on the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is yielded back.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think it is good we have a few more \namendments in the queue. I ask Senator Nickles and the staff to review \nthe other amendments and maybe we can get those lined up. We will \nimprove the operations if we can get those lined up. I thank the \nchairman for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first, there has now been agreement on a \nresolution with respect to Iraq. At least we had a caucus and there is \nagreement on the wording of the resolution. I hope very much we get on \nwith that sometime soon.\n  I personally think it is surrealistic to be talking about other \nissues and not talking about Iraq. I hope when we get on to the \ndiscussion of the war with Iraq, not for the purpose of delay, because \nwe could dispense with that discussion hopefully throughout the day and \nperhaps tomorrow morning go back to the budget and complete the budget \nby early next week, which is long in advance of when we need to finish \nit, but to have our country at war and not be discussing that when the \nresolution has now been completed strikes many of us as incongruous.\n  With that said, we are still on the budget. Let me go to the question \nof the amendment I have already announced I will send to the desk.\n  The amendment I will be offering is on funding IDEA. We see that in \n2002 and 2003, we enacted $2.5 billion. Full funding for that period \nwould be $24.4 billion. When we say ``full funding,'' that is not \nreally full funding. That is funding the commitment the Federal \nGovernment made to provide 40 percent of the cost of that legislation, \na commitment that we have never kept. As a result, we forced up local \nproperty taxes all across the country.\n  The budget that has come before us in 2002 is far short of meeting \nthe Federal commitment in 2003 and in 2004.\n  The chairman of the committee has indicated they increased IDEA--and \nthey did, that is absolutely correct--by $1 billion. That is a move in \nthe right direction, and we applaud it. But we are still so far below \nwhat we promised when we passed the legislation. I say to my \ncolleagues, when the Federal Government tells the States and all these \nlocal units all across the country, we are passing this legislation and \nas part of the bargain we will fund 40 percent of it--40 percent--and \nthen we never come anywhere close, that is not a good way for the \nFederal Government to do business. That damages our credibility and it \nalso forces local jurisdictions to raise local property taxes.\n\n  The budget we have before us on education is the smallest increase we \nhave seen in 8 years. There are increases, absolutely; that is true. \nThere is an increase. Our colleagues on the other side like to \nconcentrate on those areas that have increases. They often do not say \nthey have funded many of those increases with corresponding cuts. The \noverall increase is $1.1 billion, and that is by far the lowest \nincrease for education in 8 years.\n  My own strong belief is education is the priority. After defending \nthe Nation, which is our No. 1 priority--that is our No. 1 \nresponsibility--I believe education is right at the head of the line. \nMaybe I believe that because I was raised by my grandparents.\n  My grandmother was a schoolteacher, and my grandfather, who only had \nan eighth grade education, had profound respect for education. \nCertainly my grandmother did. She drummed it into all of our heads: If \nyou want to make the most of your opportunity in life, get the best \neducation you can.\n  My grandparents were deadly serious about it. They were so serious. \nThey were middle-income people, but they made sure they set aside funds \nto help every one of their grandchildren, 13 grandchildren, get an \nadvanced degree. Not just a college degree, but every single one an \nadvanced degree because they saw education as the way to open the door \nto opportunity. That is what we ought to be doing with our education \nfunding. This budget doesn't do it. This budget puts the priority, the \noverwhelming priority, on tax cuts. Of the money above baseline in this \nbudget, 74 percent is for tax cuts; 74 percent of the money above the \nbaseline.\n  That is above the normal spending and the normal taxes. Seventy-four \npercent of the change above baseline is for tax cuts. That is the \npriority in this budget. I do not think that is the right priority.\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues will give serious consideration to this \namendment. It costs $73 billion over 10 years, and it is paid for by \nreducing the $1.4 trillion tax cut by a like amount.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will yield to the Senator from Nevada. As I do, let me \nsay how much I appreciate the partnership of the Senator from Nevada in \nthis endeavor of working on a budget resolution. His patience and \nwillingness to work with others to try to accomplish legislative \nresults are legendary in the Chamber. We appreciate very much his hard \nwork.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to speak while there is not a lot of \nactivity on the Senate floor because it will become hectic. There are a \nfew hours remaining on this resolution, and then we have the Iraq \nresolution, which will be forthcoming soon.\n  I speak for the entire Democratic caucus about our ranking member on \nthe Budget Committee. He is a very modest man. He and I came to the \nSenate together. His parents were killed in an automobile accident \ncaused by a drunk driver. He was raised by his grandparents. His \nparents and his grandparents must be smiling broadly now to see the \ncontribution he has made to our country. The biggest contribution he \nhas made is allowing the Democratic Senators with whom he has served to \nbetter understand the fiscal situation of this country at any given \ntime.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized as the person in the \nSenate who knows the numbers. He believes very strongly that deficit \nspending is bad, that the debt that was in existence when he came to \nthe Senate had to be downsized, and working with the prior \nadministration, that was accomplished. In fact, the debt was being paid \ndown. These past months, he has also articulated so well how it is not \ngood for the country to again have these huge deficits.\n  So I again say on behalf of the entire Democratic caucus how much we \nall appreciate the work, the guidance, and the direction the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has given us. As a result of the education I have \nreceived from him about the financial matters of this country, I better \nunderstand what is going on in the economy of this country. I extend my \nappreciation to the Senator for that education.\n  One of the areas I was totally naive about was the agricultural \nproblems of this country. There are a number of Senators who come from \nagricultural States. I have learned to listen to and admire the \ndirection I have received from other Senators on both sides of the \naisle regarding agriculture, but no one has done more to educate me on \nissues relating to the American farmer than the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  I have received rewards in recent years for voting with American \nfarmers. In Nevada, we do not have a lot of agriculture. We produce \nquite a bit of alfalfa just simply because the growing season is so \nlong. We grow a lot of onions. We are the largest producer of white \nonions in the United States, but basically our agricultural output is \nvery small.\n  So for me to be part of the army to move forward to protect the \nfamily farm is something that I have learned from the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  For these and many others reasons, while there is a little bit of \ndown time, I want to let the Senator know how much I appreciate his \nfriendship and his leadership on the issues of fiscal constraint, the \ngeneral economy of this Nation and the world, agriculture, and so many \nother things on which his great mind has been able to assist me in \nbeing able to be a better Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his kind remarks.\n  I will take this moment to alert our colleagues, who may be listening \nback in their offices, of the circumstance we face. The other side now \nhas yielded back all of their time. We are down to some 5 hours--might \nI inquire of the Chair how much time we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five hours 9 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Five hours 9 minutes. I thank the Chair. So we have just \nover 5 hours remaining. I alert my colleagues and their staffs that if \nthey have amendments they want to offer, this is their chance. Time is \ngoing to run out, and then we will vote on the amendments that are \npending at the time until we have disposed of all of those amendments. \nSo if people want to have a chance to debate and discuss their \namendments, time is running out. This is their chance. I urge my \ncolleagues to take advantage of that opportunity.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in these moments while we are asking \ncolleagues to come to the floor to offer their amendments--and I \nunderstand a Senator is on his way to the floor--I also understand we \nmay be turning to the resolution on Iraq at 2. Instead of having this \ntime wasted, I thought I would review, from my perspective, what has \nhappened to our budget condition over the last several years, where we \nare headed, and why it alarms me so much.\n  My colleagues will recall that 2 years ago we were told there were \ngoing to be $5.6 trillion of surpluses over the next decade. It was in \nthat context that President Bush sent Congress a budget that had a $1.7 \ntrillion or $1.8 trillion tax cut. He said at the time that he would \nonly be taking 1 of every 4 surplus dollars for tax reduction, and he \nsaid he would still be able to fund a strong buildup for national \ndefense, that he would be able to fund the priorities of education and \nhealth care, that he would be able to have a maximum paydown of the \nnational debt, in fact he would be able to virtually eliminate the \nnational debt, and that he would also be able to protect the trust \nfunds of Social Security and Medicare.\n\n  Unfortunately, that proved to be overly optimistic. Many warned at \nthat time that it was unwise to be betting on a 10-year forecast, that \nyou cannot count on a 10-year forecast. You cannot bet the ranch on the \nrevenue coming in as anticipated.\n  We all know what has happened. With the tax cut implemented at the \ntime, with the economic slowdown, with the attack on America, with the \nadditional tax cuts proposed by the President because now he has \nproposed an additional $1.6 trillion of tax cuts, and with the \nassociated interest costs, the total cost of those tax cuts would be \n$1.96 trillion. When that is put together, we are back in the deficit \nditch and by over $2 trillion.\n  Where did the money go? Over this period, most of it went to the tax \ncuts, both those that had been implemented and those proposed. The \nsecond biggest chunk of the money, 27 percent, went to additional \nspending as a result of the attack on the country. Virtually all of \nthis has increased defense spending and additional homeland security \nspending. The next biggest chunk is revenue coming in below \nexpectations not related to the tax cut--in other words, the total \nrevenue below what we would have had without the tax cuts and without \nthe overestimations of revenue.\n  The revenue change is 64 percent, but only about two-thirds of that \nis from the tax cut. The other is from the models not predicting \naccurately what revenue would be raised for various levels of economic \nactivity. The smallest sliver, the smallest part, is the economic \ndownturn.\n  Most alarming is the long-term outlook. The long-term outlook, \naccording to the President's own analysis, from his analytical \nperspectives, page 43 of his budget document, shows what happens if we \nimplement the President's proposals for spending and tax cuts.\n  What one sees should alarm everyone. It shows these are the good \ntimes with respect to deficits. The deficits we are running now are \nrecord amounts. We have never had a budget deficit over $290 billion, \neven including Social Security, not over $370 billion. This year we \nwill have a budget deficit of over $500 billion.\n  This chart shows--and again it is from the President's own analysis--\nthe situation will get much worse as the baby boom generation starts to \nretire because they will put pressure, of\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\ncourse, on Medicare and Social Security, programs for which they are \neligible, programs on which they are counting, and we are going to have \nover 75 million people who are in that baby boom generation. That will \ndouble the number of people eligible for those programs.\n  Look what happens then. If we adopt the President's policy, his tax \ncuts, and his spending policy, when the baby boom generation retires, \naccording to the President's own documents, the deficits absolutely \nexplode.\n  Is this a course we should be on? I don't think so. This is a course \nfor deficits and debt that is utterly unsustainable. This is a course \nthat I believe, and I predict today, will lead to dramatic cuts in \nMedicare, in Social Security, and in virtually every other part of the \nGovernment.\n  I am the first to acknowledge there are items in the Government we \nshould cut. There is waste in Government, there is fraud in Government, \nthere is abuse in Government, no question about that. But we have been \nhunting waste, fraud, and abuse a long time, and we will need to \ncontinue that, and we will need to do a much better job of it because \nwhere we are headed is totally unsustainable.\n\n  If anyone doubts this will lead to massive cuts in Medicare and \nSocial Security, look at the House budget resolution. It proposes $470 \nbillion of cuts in mandatory programs. That is Medicare and that is \nMedicaid. It proposes another over $200 billion of cuts in domestic \ndiscretionary programs that are not defense related.\n  The course we are on is a disaster for this country, of mounting \ndeficit, of mounting debt, right before the baby boom generation \nretires. And this is the sweet spot because right now the trust funds, \nespecially the Social Security trust fund, are generating billions of \ndollars. This year alone there are $160 billion of surplus and we are \ntaking every dime of it under the President's proposal and using it to \npay for tax cuts and other expenses of Government.\n  Some people say that does not matter; the trust fund is still whole \nbecause it is being credited with the amount of money coming in. It is \ntrue, the trust fund is being credited. It is also true that the only \nway those pledges, those IOUs are going to be paid back, is if we have \nsufficient resources to do so at the time those bonds come due. That \ndepends on the size of the economy. That depends on the strength of the \neconomy. That depends on the economic growth we experience between now \nand then. This is something upon which many agree. That is a \nfundamental truth that our ability to redeem those obligations depends \non the size of the economy, depends on how good a job we have done \ngrowing the economy in the interval.\n  That goes to the question, How do we best secure economic growth? \nThis is where we have a profound difference. Many on our side believe \nit is best done by providing a stimulus to the economy now, and the \nstimulus can be either tax cuts or additional spending. Either one of \nthem provides stimulus. There are many economic models that suggest \nspending is actually somewhat superior to a tax cut because all of the \nspending dollars go into the economy. When you do a tax cut, some of \nthe dollars go into the economy but some are saved.\n  To the extent they are saved, that does not provide immediate \nstimulus.\n  Our friends on the other side believe the most effective way is tax \ncuts, that tax cuts will encourage greater economic activity. I say to \nthem, on a factual basis, it is clear spending and tax cuts, either \none, stimulate the economy.\n  All of that has to be in a context. The context is, What is the long-\nterm balance of revenues and expenditures? When you have an imbalance, \nwhen you are spending more than you are taking in, you run deficits. \nDeficits over time have a negative effect on the economy. Why? Because \nwhen you run budget deficits, the Federal Government has to borrow \nmoney. When the Federal Government borrows money, it is in competition \nwith the private sector for borrowing money and that puts upward \npressure on interest rates, especially at a time of economic growth.\n  We have looked at what the President calls a growth package. Not only \nhave we looked at it but economists we respect have looked at it and \nthey have concluded, and many of us have concluded, it does not promote \ngrowth. It will actually inhibit growth. Why? Because the tax cuts are \nnot paid for. They are not paid for by spending reductions under the \nPresident's plan. They are paid for by borrowing the money. That means \nincreasing the deficit, increasing the debt.\n  It is the dead weight of those deficits and debt that are harmful to \neconomic growth. I say harmful, because to the extent you run budget \ndeficits, that reduces the pool of societal savings, that reduces the \npool of money available for investment, and you have to have investment \nto grow.\n  Many believe the President's plan is not a plan of economic growth, \nthat it is a plan that will hurt economic growth because it will \nexplode deficits and debt. That is not the only problem with the \nPresident's plan. It will force choices in the future that will require \ndeep cuts in Medicare, in Social Security, in funding for education, in \nfunding for law enforcement because there is no other possible outcome \nwhen, if you adopt the President's plan, you run deficits of this \nmagnitude.\n\n  This is not Kent Conrad's chart or the Democrats' chart; this is the \nPresident's chart.\n  What he says is: If you adopt my policies, you never escape from \ndeficit. And the deficits, once we get past this period when the trust \nfunds of Social Security and Medicare are producing surpluses and those \ntrust funds turn cash negative, which will happen in the next decade, \nthe deficits will explode. The debt will explode and a future Congress \nand a future President will then face truly difficult choices.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience in listening to this. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I notice the two leaders are here. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent with respect to amendment No. 294, \nthat the names be reversed and Senator Graham of Florida appear first \nas the one proposing the amendment with Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Democratic leader and I have been in \ndiscussion on a resolution in support of the President and the Armed \nForces of the United States. We are now prepared to offer that \nresolution and allow the full Senate to express its support.\n  As people have watched the course of today, we are all aware that \nthere is a lot of activity going on in Iraq as we speak and we believe \nit is very important that Members be given appropriate time to express \nthat support and thus believe this resolution is a wonderful way for us \nto send a signal, today, of that support.\n  I know a number of Members will come to the floor to express that \nsupport over the next couple of hours. They will be making brief \nremarks. Over the course of the coming days, we will have ample \nopportunity to expand upon those remarks. Senators, clearly, will want \nto speak on the resolution, but I do want to encourage people to keep \ntheir remarks short so we can eventually get to the vote as early today \nas possible to express that support with the full support of the \nSenate.\n  We have talked back and forth as to whether we need specific time \nlimits, in terms of how much time to spend on this particular \nresolution. We have\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\nagreed not to have strict time limits because we do want to give \neverybody that opportunity. But we have agreed we will have a vote on \nthis resolution of support for our troops today. Again, it is \nimperative, I believe, that the Senate express its support today \nthrough this resolution.\n  We will resume the budget resolution following the conclusion of the \nresolution of support. There are about 5 hours, I believe, remaining on \nthe budget resolution; therefore, we will finish that resolution this \nweek and we will talk a little bit more back and forth in a few minutes \nabout what our expectations are for later tonight and tomorrow.\n  I know the managers on both sides of the aisle have encouraged \nMembers to submit their amendments. I hope Senators are listening and \nworking with the chairman and ranking member so we can have an orderly \nprocess. Although we have all tried on both sides to avoid a vote-\nathon, there is going to be a vote-athon tomorrow. But we want to have \nan orderly process. To do that, we want to make sure we have those \namendments this afternoon so we can go through and prioritize and then \nbe able to plan for tomorrow.\n  Before I formally call up the resolution, I yield to the Democratic \nleader for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me simply add that it is our hope we \ncan have a vote at about the time that the votes have been called this \nafternoon. We have a cluster of votes on the budget resolution that \nwill be voted upon at around 4 o'clock. My hope would be that we could \nhave a vote on this resolution as we have those votes as well, \nproviding an opportunity for Senators on both sides. I assume time will \nbe controlled by Senators Warner and Levin or their designees and that \nwe will alternate back and forth until that time. Senators, then, would \nhave the opportunity to continue to express themselves after these \nvotes, either on the resolution supporting our troops or in support of \namendments that will be offered during the vote-athon beginning \ntomorrow.\n  I think this is as reasonable and as prudent a way possible with \nwhich to address the challenges that we face as we close out this week. \nWe have worked in good faith on both sides in drafting a resolution \nthat I hope will enjoy unanimous support within the Senate. I think it \ndeserves that depth and breadth of support. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor.\n  I think if we can accommodate the need to address the resolution, as \nthe distinguished majority leader has suggested, if everybody keeps \ntheir remarks relatively brief, we will have ample time as the days \nunfold to come back and express ourselves again.\n  I hope to set the example. With that, I am going to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Democratic leader because all of us know we \nare trying to accomplish a lot this week. We have been able to work \ntogether in an orderly way thus far this week. It will get increasingly \nhectic over the next 48 hours. We have an orderly process which would \nmean the resolution will be introduced now. Over the next several hours \nwe will have ample opportunity for people to make their initial remarks \nof support. We have a series of votes that begins at 4 o'clock today. \nAs the distinguished Democratic leader said, our intention is to follow \nthose votes with this vote on the resolution for support.\n  Following whenever that vote is--and again I encourage our colleagues \nto keep remarks short so we can get to that vote because that is the \nreal signal that we send out from the Senate once we actually vote on \nthat resolution--following that resolution we will come back to the \nbudget and continue the excellent debate, focusing on various \namendments today and tonight. We will be here late tonight. There has \nbeen time yielded back, from our side, to facilitate that process.\n  I think what we would like to do--it really depends on how the \nafternoon and night goes--is to begin the series of votes after all \ntime is exhausted, which would be sometime late tomorrow morning. \nAgain, I do not know exactly what the time would be like. And then it \nreally depends on how many votes we have as part of the so-called vote-\narama. It is our intention to finish this budget this week.\n  As I said this morning, if it is Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, it is \nimportant, we all believe, to complete this budget this week.\n  That is a rough outline of how we would like to see things play over \nthe next 48 hours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4075-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4075-S4107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMENDING THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF \n                                AMERICA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, with that, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to the consideration of the resolution which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 95) commending the President and the \n     Armed Forces of the United States of America.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will keep my opening remarks short, as \nwell, to restate the support that the resolution addresses very \ndirectly, which is, support for the President of the United States as \nCommander in Chief, for our troops, for the military families, for the \ncivilian families, in support of our military.\n  The President has ordered the first salvos in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. It was a moment that all of us had hoped to be able to avoid. \nWe prayed for peace. We worked for peace. But the Iraqi regime chose a \ndifferent destiny.\n  Now our mission is clear: to use the full might of the American \nmilitary to disarm Saddam Hussein and liberate the Iraqi people from \nhis oppressive rule.\n  American warships and planes have been employed to attack enemy \ntargets throughout Iraq, and hundreds of thousands of American troops \nare fighting their way across the Iraqi border. Our men and women in \nuniform are in harm's way. They are engaged in battle as we speak. We \nall pray for their safety and for their success.\n  I am confident of their victory, and I am confident it will come at \nthe earliest possible moment. Ours is the best equipped, the best \ntrained military in the world. They know they have a job to do. They \nknow how to do it, and they know how to do it with extraordinary skill. \nAnd as they do, they have the full support of this body and the \nAmerican people behind them.\n  I also applaud the President of the United States, who has shown bold \nleadership and strong leadership and visionary leadership over the last \nseveral months. Our prayers are with him. Through tremendous diplomacy, \nhe has assembled more than 30 countries to join us in this cause. We \nare grateful for his leadership and the support of our allies.\n  And to the families of our men and women in uniform, I know they are \nconcerned about the safety of their loved ones. The President and \nCongress are concerned, too. We are doing all we can to ensure your \nloved ones return home as quickly and as safely as possible. America is \ngrateful for your sacrifice.\n  This war is justified by our own laws, by international laws, and by \nthe laws of nature, which state all people are created equal and with a \nright to live in liberty.\n  Let there be no mistake, we are defending our own liberty. We have \nalready seen what terrorists can do with the combined power of only \nthree jet aircraft. We are now at war so we will not ever see what \nterrorists will do if supplied with weapons of mass destruction by \nSaddam Hussein.\n  We also fight to liberate the Iraqi people. For those in Iraq who \nhave suffered daily terror from this oppressive tyrant, for those who \nhave survived torture and imprisonment, for those who have watched \nfamily members die in agony from chemical weapons, their moment of \nfreedom is near.\n  For those who will defend this dying regime, the moment of reckoning \nhas come.\n  Mr. President, I welcome the strong bipartisan support that this \nresolution has and will receive. It is an honor to stand here side by \nside with my colleague, the Democratic leader, to send a clear message \nto those brave Americans who are risking their lives for us\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\non the battlefield: Our prayers are with you. Godspeed toward victory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished majority \nleader for his remarks and for the leadership he has shown as we have \ncome to the floor on this historic occasion.\n  Last night, the President announced to the Nation that the \ndisarmament campaign against Iraq had begun.\n  It is the duty of the Senate to address our most solemn decisions now \nas a nation. As a veteran, I know there is no more important or grave \ndecision than whether we send our sons and daughters into armed \nconflict.\n  Once our President makes the decision to commit to the use of force, \nthe Congress has always come together to speak with one voice, for one \npurpose: to support the efforts of our troops, and to pray for their \ncourage, their success, and their safe and quick return home.\n  With pride and resolve, we do so again today.\n  We may have had differences of opinion about what brought us to this \npoint, but the President of the United States is the Commander in \nChief, and today we unite behind him as well.\n  Saddam Hussein is a menace to his own people, and a threat to the \npeace and stability of the entire region.\n  As our soldiers risk their own lives to secure the lives and liberty \nof others, we pledge to repay their courage by guaranteeing that we \nwill spare no resource and no effort to ensure that nothing stands \nbetween them and victory.\n  Recently, within the last couple of weeks, I visited Sturgis, SD, the \nhome of the members of the 109th Engineering Battalion. Its members had \njust been mobilized and sent to the Persian Gulf.\n  As American families have done since the birth of our Nation when our \ncountry has been called to war, fathers and mothers said goodbye to \ntheir children in uniform, and sons and daughters watched as their \nparents left home for battlefields.\n  Once again, the families of our troops are left with prayers, and \nhopes, and the pride that the men and women they love are serving their \ncountry and serving the cause of peace and liberty.\n  One thousand members of the 28th Bomb Wing from Ellsworth Air Force \nBase in my home State are engaged in the Persian Gulf today. Several \nthousand more South Dakotans have been activated in what is now the \nmost robust callup in our State's history. We are proud to have one of \nthe highest proportions of deployed troops in the country. It makes \nsense that so many South Dakotans have volunteered to serve. We are a \nState of small towns and old neighbors. And when you grow up in a small \ntown, you learn early that your future is bound to those around you. \nYou learn early that if you do not do your part, someone else has to \npick up the slack. And you learn early that all we value about our \nhomes and our lives cannot be created or maintained by leaving the work \nto someone else.\n  Soldiers and sailors, airmen and marines, go into battle today driven \nby that wisdom. As they begin the dangerous work of disarming Saddam \nHussein and liberating the people of Iraq, their courage rides on the \nvalues of small towns and old neighbors. Our country--generation after \ngeneration--has been defended by the same willingness to sacrifice.\n  Today, our bravest men and women are called upon to carry forward the \nproud tradition of the American Armed Forces. They are making a more \npeaceful world for all children--for their own and for the children of \nIraq.\n  History will long remember their service. They have our support, our \ndevotion, and our gratitude.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \nour side be managed by Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I announce that the ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Levin, will be our manager. I ask \nunanimous consent that the time between now and the time the votes are \ncast on the amendments pending be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before our distinguished leaders depart \nthe floor, I wish to say as one Senator, I am very proud that the \ndifferences have been reconciled and that this resolution bears both of \nyour distinguished names and that we will strive to have unity in this \nChamber and to have a very constructive and clear debate as a message \nto the men and women of the armed forces, their families and, indeed, \nthe whole world.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from Virginia will yield, I want to add a \nsimilar thought. I wish all of our troops could see the two of you \nstanding together here. I had no doubt we would unite in support of our \ntroops when the time came, and that is exactly what is happening. This \npicture is a very eloquent statement about the unity of the Congress \nonce we are committed to combat.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed under \nthe time allocated to the distinguished majority leader, which I am \nprivileged to manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I recognize that I have the opportunity to \nwork on this debate with my distinguished colleague, Senator Levin. We \nhave served together, now, this is our 25th year on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I say to my colleague, I know of no debate of \ngreater significance than the one we are about to undertake at a \ncritical hour not only in the history of the United States but the \nhistory of the world.\n  It would be helpful if I were to undertake to read the resolution \nthat is at the desk that hopefully will be voted on by the Senate in a \nvery short period of time after all Senators have had the opportunity \nto express themselves.\n  The resolution is entitled ``Commending the President and the Armed \nForces of the United States of America,'' submitted by Senators Frist, \nDaschle, Warner and Levin.\n\n       Whereas Saddam Hussein has failed to comply with United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions 678, 686, 687, 688, 707, \n     715, 949, 1051, 1060, 1115, 1134, 1137, 1154, 1194, 1205, \n     1284, and 1441;\n\n  The most historic of all, in my judgment, resolution 1441, which \nreceived the unanimous vote of all Security Council members, 15--\n\n       Whereas the military action now underway against Iraq is \n     lawful and fully authorized by the Congress in Sec. 3(a) of \n     Public Law 107-243, which passed the Senate on October 10, \n     2002, by a vote of 77-23, and which passed the House of \n     Representatives on that same date by a vote of 296-133;\n       Whereas more than 225,000 men and women of the United \n     States Armed Forces are now involved in conflict against \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas over 200,000 members of the Reserves and National \n     Guard have been called to active duty for the conflict \n     against Iraq and other purposes; and\n       Whereas the Congress and the American people have the \n     greatest pride in the men and women of the United States \n     Armed Forces, and the civilian personnel supporting them, and \n     strongly support them in their efforts;\n       Now therefore be it Resolved by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled, that Congress--\n       (1) commends and supports the efforts and leadership of the \n     President, as Commander in Chief, in the conflict against \n     Iraq;\n       (2) commends, and expenses the gratitude of the Nation to \n     all members of the United States Armed Forces (whether on \n     active duty, in the National Guard, or in the Reserves) and \n     the civilian employees who support their efforts, as well as \n     the men and women of civilian national security agencies who \n     are participating in the military operations in the Persian \n     Gulf region, for their professional excellence, dedicated \n     patriotism and exemplary bravery;\n       (3) commends and expresses the gratitude of the Nation to \n     the family members of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and \n     civilians serving in operations against Iraq who have borne \n     the burden of sacrifice and separation from their loved ones;\n       (4) expresses its deep condolences to the families of brave \n     Americans who have lost their lives in this noble \n     undertaking, over many years, against Iraq;\n       (5) joins all Americans in remembering those who lost their \n     lives during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert \n     Storm in 1991, those still missing from that conflict, \n     including Captain Scott Speicher, USN, and the thousands of \n     Americans who have lost their lives in terrorist attacks over \n     the years, and in the Global War in Terrorism; and\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\n       (6) expresses sincere gratitude to British Prime Minister \n     Tony Blair and his government for their courageous and \n     steadfast support, as well as gratitude to other allied \n     nations for their military support, logistical support, and \n     other assistance in the campaign against Saddam Hussein's \n     regime.\n\n  Mr. President, today in Iraq, in Afghanistan, on the high seas, at \nthe far corners of the world, and here at home, our forces, active duty \nand reserve components alike, are confronting the oppression, tyranny, \nand terrorism that plagues and threatens the world and our Nation. I am \nso enormously proud of our military and their leaders who fashioned a \nforce unlike any the world has ever known, a force capable of \ndelivering overwhelming might anytime, anywhere, if necessary.\n  Just weeks ago my distinguished colleague, Senator Levin, and I, \ntogether with Senator Roberts and Senator Rockefeller, were privileged \nto visit many of these troops in that region, Qatar, Kuwait, and other \nareas. A disciplined force this is, able to employ measured steps in an \nhonorable and decent manner to ensure that everything possible is done \nto provide for the humanitarian and security needs of an innocent \npeople, the people of Iraq. Truly the force has never seen an \nopportunity such as this, and it is under the command not only of our \nPresident but of officers of the United States, Great Britain, \nAustralia, and indeed more.\n  A decision to commit our sons and daughters to combat is never an \neasy one. Clearly, our President anguished over this decision. I was \nprivileged to meet with him, with the leadership here just days ago. \nClearly, he showed his steadfastness, his courage, his wisdom, his very \nbalanced thinking, as he conducted himself with the advice of others, \nto reach this decision, which he did last night.\n  We in the Congress debated this solemn responsibility to authorize \nthe use of force last October. We took our constitutional \nresponsibility seriously. We thoroughly examined the circumstances and \nvoted overwhelmingly, 77 to 23, to authorize the Commander in Chief to \nuse military force if, and only if, he determined that all diplomatic \nefforts to peacefully disarm Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime had been \nfulfilled. I personally think he did that and did it brilliantly.\n  Those efforts, unfortunately, did not result in a Security Council \nresolution of unity, as it did with 15 votes in October.\n  The Security Council became deadlocked for reasons we all know. It is \nimportant to note, however, that our President expended extraordinary \nefforts to bring this clear and growing threat to the attention of the \nUnited Nations and to try to build that consensus for a unified way to \nproceed.\n  The United Nations was unable to step up to its responsibilities of \nenforcing its own mandates largely because of the intransigence of a \nvery few nations to block any form of meaningful enforcement of these \nU.N. Security Council resolutions. The failure of the United Nations to \nstep up to its responsibilities is most unfortunate, for the United \nNations at this time in its long history of over 50 years is facing a \nchallenge unlike any before, with the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, particularly those of nuclear weapons on the Korean \npeninsula, Iran, and other areas of the world. This could have been \ntheir finest hour.\n  Our President has stepped up to his responsibilities to protect the \nAmerican people from a grave and growing threat to our national \nsecurity. Ultimately, the President's constitutional responsibility is \nto the American people. He made the determination that Saddam Hussein, \narmed with weapons of mass destruction, is an imminent threat to the \nsecurity of the people of this Nation and, indeed, other nations.\n  His most sacred responsibility is to protect the American people. The \nCongress, as a coequal branch of Government, has fulfilled, in my \njudgment, its constitutional responsibilities by giving the President \nthe authority he needs to do so.\n  Now the effort has begun to liberate Iraq, restore a secure \nenvironment, and ultimately bring a lasting peace with justice and \nrepresentative democratic principles to a land that has known little \npeace throughout its history. Our forces are capable of helping Iraqis \nrealize this dream. I have no doubt our forces will conduct themselves \nin a very responsible way. Our forces, supported by countless civilian \nemployees and by families and loved ones back home, and joined by \nforces and support from many other nations--over 30, Mr. President--as \na coalition to liberate Iraq, will prevail.\n  We are all hopeful that this operation can be conducted with minimum \nloss of life, with minimum casualties, with minimum destruction and \nhardship. We must await that outcome. We must be prepared, however, for \na broad and concerted effort that may take longer and involve more \nsacrifice than some have predicted. We cannot and will not waiver from \nour resolve to bring freedom and hope to this troubled Nation and to \nrid the world of this threat to regional and global security.\n  I, again, salute our men and women in uniform, their families, and \nthose who support them in this noble effort. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield as much time as Senator Reid needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today in the Senate--it does not happen very \noften--we speak with one voice. Now that the military effort to disarm \nSaddam Hussein and remove his brutal regime from power has started, it \nis important that we, the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, express \nour unified support for our troops.\n  I personally am very proud of the Nevada sons and daughters who have \nbeen deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nNevada has, I believe, the finest military aviation training facilities \nin the world. That is not something that is just provincial in nature. \nWe have the great Nellis Air Force Base and the Fallon Naval Air \nStation, plus we have the Indian Springs Air Force Base where the \ndrones are kept, where people train with those unmanned vehicles.\n  Nellis Air Force Base has a special place in my heart because Bill \nNellis was from my hometown of Searchlight, NV, a very small town in \nsize and the number of people who live there. Bill Nellis served in \nWorld War II and became a hero. His body now lies in a military \ncemetery in Belgium, but all of us in Nevada know where Nellis Air \nForce Base got its name. His family is still there and very proud of \nthe fact that this great training facility for the Air Force is named \nafter Bill Nellis of Searchlight.\n  The Fallon Naval Air Station is also where we train aviators. These \ntwo bases--to show the size of the State of Nevada--are 400 miles \napart. One is the premier training facility for our Air Force, and the \nother, Fallon naval air training facility, is a premier training \nfacility for our naval pilots--Top Gun. It is a rural community 65 \nmiles out of Reno, NV.\n  These pilots--hundreds from Nellis and other personnel critical to \nour mission in Iraq--are right now serving on the front lines. Hundreds \nwho trained at Fallon are there also.\n  When I see those Navy fighters taking off on carriers in the gulf, as \nI did this morning before I came to work, there is no question in my \nmind that they were trained at Fallon.\n  Nevada's Guard and Reserve troops are also playing a significant \nrole, more than 1,000 from Nevada's Guard and Reserve. Nevada's \npercentage of Guard and Reserve callups and deployments is one of the \nhighest in the Nation. This is, of course, a hardship to the \ncommunities, the cities, and the towns from where they come. It is a \nhardship on the employers and families they leave behind.\n  I also recognize the honor that is associated with this hardship and \nthis sacrifice. Our Guard units, for example, have a specially train \nunit to handle prisoners of war. They have been called up. They also \nhave one of the only Blackhawk-equipped medical evacuation teams. It is \nunderstandable why they have been called up. There are many other \nspecialities that are needed in the gulf, and Secretary Rumsfeld has \ncalled them up. They are heroes. They are talented.\n  There are other heroes in Nevada, and they are the families who \nremain behind. Children who are going to school in Nevada have mothers, \nfathers, brothers, and sisters half a world away and hoping and praying \nthey come home but not really knowing if that, in fact, will happen.\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\n  The sacrifice that many of these families are making so our forces \nwill prevail cannot be overstated. In many cases, the lead income \nearner or main caretaker is in the desert right now either pursuing \nSaddam Hussein or maybe even trying to track down al-Qaida operatives.\n\n  I try but I am not sure I fully understand the hardship the families \nare enduring. This Congress and communities all over America stand with \nthe families and will help in any way we can until their loved ones \nreturn. We pray for the safe and speedy return of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines.\n  We understand as a Congress that war entails risk; that the American \nmilitary is the best fighting force ever assembled.\n  I have to take a pause here and commend and applaud the chairman and \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee who have worked together \nas partners for many years now developing the military that is now \nserving in the Middle East. They are two fine Senators. There are no \ntwo men in the Senate for whom I have more respect than the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia and my longtime friend, the Senator \nfrom Michigan. I had the pleasure and honor of coming to Congress with \nhis brother. I have said this to Senator Levin on a number of \noccasions. The first time I ever met Carl Levin, I said: I came to \nWashington with your brother, Sandy.\n  He said: Yes, Sandy is my brother, but he is also my best friend.\n  This is the kind of man we have working with us in the minority. I \nagain commend and applaud the two of them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield a moment? I \nremember so well when we had last year's authorization bill on the \nfloor. The distinguished Senator from Michigan and I time and again \nsought Senator Reid's assistance to keep that bill going, to reconcile \nissues such as health care, current receipts, the BRAC process, and \nother very strong issues. So the Senator has been a full honorary \nmember of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my friend from Virginia. As I said, we in Congress \nunderstand the risks that war entails. The American military, as I have \nsaid before--parting a little off the subject by complimenting my two \nfriends--is the best fighting force ever assembled. We owe a lot of \nthat to these two men. I am confident that the men and women of our \narmed services, with the help of British and Australian soldiers, will \nbring about a decisive victory. Let us hope this can be achieved \nswiftly and with minimal casualties.\n  Mr. President, I will do everything in my power to ensure that \nCongress fully funds and supports the needs of our troops as this \nconflict proceeds.\n  As American troops are engaged in war in Iraq, as well as elsewhere \naround the world, in our ongoing war against terrorists, and defending \nour interests and allies, we think also of previous generations who \nserved our Nation faithfully and proudly to protect American lives, \nliberties and values. To all of our veterans, in Nevada and around the \ncountry, I say, ``Thank you for your service.'' And I reassure you that \nI will continue to make sure our Nation honors our commitment to you.\n  We are so fortunate to live in a Nation that promises fundamental \nfreedom like the freedom of speech and freedom of belief. Those who \nhave served in the United States Armed Forces in past years and those \nwho serve today have fought to guarantee the rights we hold dear. \nThanks to their service and sacrifice, Americans can express opinions \neven if they disagree with the Government without fear of being \nharassed, arrested, tortured or murdered. This is a fundamental \ndifference that separates our American democracy from regimes like the \nTaliban which we ousted from Afghanistan or dictators like Saddam \nHussein whom we will remove from Iraq.\n  So we all appreciate, value and will fight to defend the right of all \nof us--American citizens and those of us in public service--to speak \nfreely. Regardless of whether Americans agree or disagree with the \ndecision to go to war or how the administration has conducted its \nforeign policy, we share patriotic feelings. That is what patriotism is \nabout. And I want our troops to know that we all support them \ncompletely.\n  Americans also stand united with our Commander-in-Chief, President \nGeorge Bush, as he leads the Nation through this difficult period. I \nwill continue to support his efforts to build and strengthen our \ncoalition to assist with post-war reconstruction in Iraq.\n  But today let me re-emphasize that we stand united, and we speak with \none voice, in supporting our troops and working for the swift and \ndecisive defeat of Saddam Hussein. I am confident more peaceful times \nlie ahead. Certainly, peace and freedom lie on the horizon for the \nIraqi people.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before the Senator from Nevada leaves, I add my thanks to \nhim not just for his very kind words but, as Senator Warner said, for \nhis absolutely invaluable leadership on this floor year after year. We \nwere able to get a bill passed last year, in good measure, because of \nhis ability to get us to the point where we could resolve differences \namong Members to get to votes. One particular instance that I hope the \nSenator will always be remembered for--at least he will in our minds, I \nknow--is his leadership to make sure that the veterans who are disabled \nare able to get a disability pension, particularly if they are severely \ndisabled, at the same time they get a retirement benefit.\n  The absurd result that we had veterans who were severely disabled who \nlost their disability benefit at the same time their pension became \navailable to them was wrong. It was corrected by this Senate, in large \nmeasure because of the leadership of Senator Reid. That is one of the \nmany monuments to his leadership that hopefully will be remembered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I rise to join my colleagues in support of this \nresolution. I commend the President and our troops, including civilians \nand national security personnel. I believe it is important, once the \nconflict has begun, that there be full support for our troops in the \nfield.\n  Resolutions were passed by both this body and the House of \nRepresentatives by overwhelming majorities. I respect those who have \ndisagreed with the action of the Congress and with the action of the \nPresident, however, once the Nation moves forward under our \nconstitutional process, where in a representative democracy the \nCongress votes and authorizes the President as Commander in Chief of \nthe Armed Forces to move ahead, we should support this action.\n  It is regrettable there was not a united UN because had that been \ndone, I think it might have been possible to back Saddam Hussein down. \nI had an opportunity to meet with Saddam Hussein for more than an hour \nback in 1990, and while he is venal and brutal, I do not think he is \ninsane or suicidal. However, the international dance and delay was such \nthat he thought he could wear us down.\n  Once the United States had more than 200,000 troops in the field, we \nwere constrained by weather factors and our personnel were threatened \nby chemical and biological attacks, and so we simply had to move. Every \naction on Saddam's part was a delay. So whether there was agreement or \ndisagreement up to this point, now is the time for unified American \naction.\n  This resolution commends Prime Minister Tony Blair and \nhis government, and I believe the coalition of the willing will be \ndoing the work really of the entire free world. It is our hope and \nexpectation that the efforts will be swift and the casualties will be \nheld to a minimum. With success I hope that those who have dissented in \nthe United Nations will come forward because victory will be ours on \nthe battlefield. However, that is not sufficient. Iraq must be rebuilt \nand our international alliances must be reinstated.\n\n  This is the first step today, by having a strong vote, hopefully a \nunanimous vote, in supporting our troops and supporting the action of \nthe United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\n  Mr. President, last month a number of us were fortunate enough to \nvisit our troops in Kuwait, Qatar, and other places in the area. As \nSenator Warner said, he, Senator Roberts, Senator Rockefeller, and I \nhad that opportunity. What an extraordinarily dedicated, and motivated \nprofessional group of men and women they are; what representatives of \nAmerica and the values that we stand for they are; how well trained and \nequipped they are; how extraordinarily high their morale was and is; \nand how determined this Congress is, I know now, to give them our total \nsupport.\n  In the course of that visit, I met with a group of about 20 Marines \nfrom Michigan at Camp Commando. One young Marine asked me what was \ngoing on back home with the antiwar demonstrations. I could tell by the \ndemeanor of the other Marines, both men and women, that this was a \nmatter on the minds of a number of them.\n  I told them that those demonstrating back home were carrying out and \nexercising a right which is something we all cherish. As a matter of \nfact, they were exercising the very freedoms that our Armed Forces have \nprotected throughout our history. I told them we had a vigorous debate \nin the Senate last fall about the wisdom of initiating an attack \nagainst Saddam Hussein if we were unable to persuade the world \ncommunity, acting through the United Nations, to authorize and support \nsuch an attack. I told them that, in the end, a majority of both Houses \nof the Congress voted to authorize the President to use military force \nwith or without that explicit authority of the United Nations.\n  I told them that our democracy functions through debate and decision, \nand that the decision to give the President this authority was \ndemocratically arrived at. Finally and most importantly, I told these \nMarines I was confident that, after the debate in Congress about the \nwisdom of instituting an attack without the support of the world \ncommunity through the United Nations, if hostilities should start, \nthose who have such different views will come together and will rally \nbehind them and give them the full support hey deserve.\n  My prediction that we would come together if hostilities ever began, \ndespite differences over the wisdom of the policy of proceeding without \nU.N. authority, has now come true.\n  We stand here together, shoulder to shoulder, whichever side of that \nparticular issue we voted on, to support the men and women who are now \nin harm's way. We saw just a very visual and visible example of that a \nfew minutes ago when the majority and Democratic leaders literally \nstood shoulder to shoulder here in the well of the Senate as they both \npresented a resolution of support of our troops and then indicated they \nwere going to work hard for its passage.\n  The visit we had was quite an extraordinary visit. The men and women \nwe visited understood fully what we were telling them about the \nnobility of this system of government of ours and how they represented \nthat nobility by putting their lives on the line. I am pleased to have \nhelped draft this resolution. I am pleased to add my voice and my vote \nto it.\n  The hostilities have begun. The democratic debate has occurred. The \nmen and women of our Armed Forces have the unified support of the \nNation they love and for which they willingly serve and for which they \nrisk their all. To them I can only say they are in the prayers of every \nAmerican and that we all hope for a speedy conclusion to this war with \nthe minimal number of casualties and that they return home to their \nloved ones as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time as our distinguished \ncolleague from Oklahoma may require.\n  I might also say Senators Ensign, Burns, the Presiding Officer \nSenator Alexander, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, and Senator Allard, we \nare looking forward to their coming to the floor, in that sequence, on \nour side. We will alternate with my colleague. I alert my colleagues, \nthis debate is moving right along and we are anxious to keep it going.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I similarly indicate Senator Bingaman and then Senator \nBill Nelson would be recognized on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, for a moment let me build on something the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan said talking about our troops. \nHaving been on the Senate Armed Services Committee and having been \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness for a \nnumber of years, I have had a chance to talk to troops all over the \nworld in all kinds of circumstances. Never have I seen such a \ncommitment as is out there right now by these young troops.\n  I remember not long ago I was at a hospital where they were sending \ninjured from Afghanistan. Without exception, each one of the injured \ntroops--some sailors, some marines, some airmen, some Army--all said \nthey were anxious to get back to their units. One young lady, whose \nname was Stennis--I remember her name because she was on the USS \nStennis--a young sailor, she who got tangled up in a refueling line. It \npulled her off to a free fall all the way down into the ocean, crushing \nboth of her lungs. She was a very small person. She made it. She lived. \nShe was in the hospital. Her words were these: I want to get well to \nget back to my units, and I want to make a career out of the U.S. Navy.\n  When I look at our distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator \nWarner, who was Secretary of the Navy, I can assure you we have never \nhad sailors more committed than we have today. That is what is \nhappening right now.\n  I am pleased we are beyond the point of talking about objections. \nThere are three major objections that various individuals are trying to \nvoice. One was: We cannot do anything without allies. We are glad to \nrealize we have allies. We have some 45 nations supporting us in this \neffort to get rid of this terrorist, Saddam Hussein. But even if we \nweren't, we remember Grenada, Panama, we remember 1986 when Ronald \nReagan was President and when Qadhafi had blown up a building, killing \nsome of our soldiers. We did not have overflight permission, and \nPresident Reagan sent in F-111s and pounded Libya, and we have not \nheard from Qadhafi since.\n  The smoking gun argument, we all understand that what we are faced \nwith, with Saddam Hussein--not Iraq, but Saddam Hussein--is an ability \nto do things that would not maybe kill 100 or 200 people but maybe a \nmillion people. Rich Butler, probably the most revered of the former \nweapons inspectors, said one warhead like they have in Iraq filled with \n140 liters of VX gas could kill a million people. We have to reprogram \nourselves and think in those terms.\n  If you did need a smoking gun--which we did not have to have--if you \ndid, last night we learned there are smoking guns. He had denied he had \nthe very missiles he sent over and used last night.\n  The last argument was there had to be a link with Osama bin Laden. We \nhave to again reprogram ourselves because what we are dealing with now \nis a terrorist. This is not a war on Iraq, it is a liberation of the \nIraqi people who have been oppressed and tortured for decades. There is \na war involved. It is not a war on Iraq, it is a war against terrorism. \nThis war was declared by our President at 8:30 in the evening on the \nfateful September 11. He said this is a war on terrorism. You go after \nthe biggest terrorists.\n  A lot of people do not think of Saddam Hussein as a terrorist, but if \nyou measure the severity of terrorism by the number of people someone \nhas tortured or murdered, certainly no one can hold a candle to Saddam \nHussein. In 1983, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International \ndocumented that he executed 8,000 of his own Kurdish citizens aged 13 \nand older. In 1985, it is reported they executed 315 children between \nthe ages of 8 and 17. In 1988--we all remember this very well because \nthat is when he set a record. We believe it is an all-time record that \nholds to this day. He murdered, in one day, 5,000 of his own citizens \nusing a chemical that produces the most torturous kind of death, where \nyour eyeballs are fried and your lungs are actually fried. There was \nmustard gas and other chemicals. That was in 1988. Then they talked \nabout the 60 villages--Human Rights Watch--attacked with mustard gas. \nWomen, children, it did not make any difference.\n\n[[Page S4080]]\n\n  In 1990, Amnesty International listed 38 new methods of torture used \nby Saddam Hussein including mock execution, piercing of the hands with \nelectric drills, electric shocks, sexual abuse, lowering the victims \ninto baths of acid.\n  Then in 1999, at a peaceful demonstration, security forces fired into \na crowd of protesters, killing hundreds of civilians, including women \nand children. In the year 2000, they were looking for a new way to \npunish those who might be suspected of saying something about Saddam \nHussein. They had been sending them into prison, but the prisons were \nfull, so the new method was to pull the tongue out and tear the tongue \noff.\n  In 1991, with a person I think very highly of, we made the first trip \ninto Kuwait. It was so close after the war was over that they did not \nknow the war was over and the fires were still going in the oil fields. \nThe guns were still being fired. Alexander Haig, I, and a guy named \nSauda Saba who was the Ambassador from Kuwait to the United States of \nAmerica, we went in there to see what it was like. Sauda Saba had his \n7-year-old daughter with him. He was of royalty. We went to their house \nwhere we found out that Saddam Hussein had used his house as one of the \nheadquarters. We went through the house and found that the young 7-\nyear-old girl's bedroom had been used as a torture chamber. We found \nbody parts and hair stuck to the walls.\n  I don't believe there is a terrorist anywhere who could be more \ndangerous than Saddam Hussein. That is what this is all about. This is \nnot a war on Iraq, it is the liberation of the people of Iraq. I \nhonestly believe the dancing in the streets after Afghanistan will not \nhold a candle to the dancing in the streets we will see not just in \nBaghdad, but in all the oppressed surrounding nations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Bingaman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Michigan \nyielding me 3 minutes to speak briefly on this issue.\n  War in Iraq is underway. It is appropriate that we in the Senate \nsuspend our other work to observe the start of this very serious \nundertaking. I am very glad to support the resolution the majority \nleader and the Democratic leader have come together on in stating our \nsolidarity with our servicemen and servicewomen.\n  We want the brave men and women who wear the American uniform and who \nhave been sent to this region on behalf of our country to know they \nhave the complete, unwavering support of the Senate.\n  I also state my sincere hope, and the sincere hope, I am sure, of all \nof us, that this conflict will be short lived and that our mission will \nbe accomplished with the fewest possible casualties to our countrymen \nand to the noncombatants in Iraq.\n  Prior to the announcement by President Bush on Monday that he had \ndetermined to begin a military action this week, many of us expressed \nour disagreement with the policy and action of the President. In my \ncase, and I am sure in all cases, those opinions were honestly arrived \nat and were strongly felt. But at this point, now with the war having \nbegun, our focus needs to be on prevailing in this conflict. None of us \ndoubts that we will in fact prevail. I join with all other Senators in \nthe fervent hope that the war will be short, the lives lost on both \nsides will be few. I further hope that out of this we will arrive at a \njust and peaceful and prosperous future for the Iraqi people and for \nthe region and for the entire world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time I yield as much time to Senator Ensign as he \nmay require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee for yielding time. I appreciate his great \nservice to this country leading that important committee.\n  I rise today to talk about the situation in Iraq. There are some \npeople to pay tribute to. It is important that we as Senators show our \ntroops what they mean to us. It is important that all Americans show \nthe people in uniform how much we appreciate what they are doing, and \nalso to show their families how much we appreciate what they are doing.\n  I want to start by sharing a thought about a great leader who has \nshown what it means, in the face of adversity, to lead our country \nthrough a difficult time. That leader is our President, George W. Bush. \nI am very proud that he is, indeed, our Commander-in-Chief at this \ntime. I have heard from so many service men and women how proud they \nare right now, not only to be Americans, but proud that he is our \nCommander-in-Chief during this difficult time--not only for the war on \nIraq, but for the global war on terrorism, which we are still engaged \nin and probably will be for some time.\n  I also want to say thank you as an American to a great friend; \nsomebody who is defining what it means to be a statesman. That is Tony \nBlair from Great Britain. Tony Blair obviously leads the equivalent of \nwhat would be a different party than mine. But Tony Blair has shown, in \nthe face of incredible public opposition, and especially opposition \nwithin his own party, what it means to stand up and be a \nleader. Leaders are expected to lead, and Tony Blair and George W. Bush \nare doing exactly that right now.\n\n  I also thank and take pride in Nellis Air Force Base and the people \nstationed there, and the people stationed at Fallon Naval Air Station, \nand also the Nevada National Guard, all of whom have sent people to the \nMiddle East to engage in this conflict. We as Nevadans say thank you \nfor their service, and take great pride in that they are over there, \nserving our country and protecting our people.\n  I also think it is appropriate for us, whenever possible, as \nAmericans, to adopt the families of our service men and women. Back in \n1991 my brother-in-law was sent over to the Persian Gulf. He was \nstationed in Bahrain during the Persian Gulf war. I remember it was a \nvery stressful time for my sister because she could not have any \ncontact with him. She had no idea where he was, what he was doing. It \nwas incredibly difficult for her, as it was for many other families. \nThat is what a lot of families of our service men and women are going \nthrough right now, the uncertainty of whether their loved ones are \ngoing to be coming home or not. We all in this country need to wrap our \narms around them and also lift them up in prayer, when we rise in the \nmorning or go to bed at night, when we get on our knees and look to the \nAlmighty.\n  There is no question that America has the finest military in the \nentire world. Nobody's military might is anywhere close to what we have \ntoday. But I remind all Americans that no matter how strong our \nmilitary is, without divine providence--as the entire history of our \ncountry has recognized--without divine providence, it doesn't matter \nhow superior your military is. That is not enough to prevail in a war. \nAs Abraham Lincoln said during the Civil War, when asked which side of \nthe conflict God was on, he replied: I don't know. I just want to try \nto be on God's side.\n  I think it would be easy for us as Americans to be arrogant and proud \nand boastful about how great we are and how right we think we are. I \nthink the appropriate approach is for us to go and pray we are right, \nand look to what the morals are that we stand for and the principles on \nwhich this country was founded. If we apply those principles, those \nprinciples that I believe were handed down by the Almighty, then we \nwill be on His side.\n  I believe we are in a just cause. It is time we stand up and support \nthe men and women in uniform and do everything we can as individuals to \nlet them know, while they are there, that they are in our thoughts and \nour prayers. And then, when they come home, we should never, ever again \nallow what happened in this country when our troops came home from \nVietnam. Whenever our troops come home from now on, they should be \ncelebrated, held high as heroes, because we owe our very freedoms to \nthe sacrifices they are willing to make.\n  I stand with other Senators today to say to our troops: Thank you. \nGodspeed. And God bless.\n\n[[Page S4081]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \nremarks, most particularly the concluding remarks about that period \nduring Vietnam. It was my privilege to serve along with the men and \nwomen in that period as Secretary of the Navy. I remember so well how \nthey were received back home, in sharp contrast to the generation in \nwhich I had a modest association in World War II. With open arms were \nthey welcomed home. I share your sentiments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Bill Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have gone around to the \nNational Guard units that have been activated in my State of Florida, \nand I have gone to the Reserve units, merely representing our grateful \nNation. These people have gone off to war, seeing tearful spouses, with \nthe uncertainty of their economic future. And that economic uncertainty \nis not only from their standpoint as a guard or reservist, but it is \nalso from their employer's standpoint. And yet we see a unity and a \ncoming together that is part of the strength of the character of us as \na people.\n  It is with profound gratitude and humility that I express my support \nfor this resolution for a fighting force of men and women who are not \nonly in the military all over the world but who are civilian as well.\n  In fact, some of our civilian agencies today were in Iraq, prior to \nthe military units arriving there, along with other clandestine \nmilitary units performing enormous intelligence functions for us. It is \na profound gratefulness that this Nation expresses to our military and \ncivilians.\n  I particularly wish to call to the attention of the Senate paragraph \n(5). Paragraph (5) of the resolution states that Congress:\n\n       Joins all Americans in remembering those who lost their \n     lives during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert \n     Storm in 1991, still those missing from that conflict, \n     including Captain Scott Speicher, United States Navy, and the \n     thousands of Americans who have lost their lives in terrorist \n     attacks over the years, and in the Global War on terrorism. . \n     . .\n\n  I take the time to call paragraph (5) to the attention of the Senate \nbecause of CPT Scott Speicher, the first American pilot shot down on \nthe first night of the gulf war. Through a series of mistakes, we said \nhe was dead. He was listed as ``killed in action.''\n  Years later, the Department of Defense changed his status to \n``missing in action.'' And years later, the Department of Defense \nchanged his status to ``missing, captured,'' which is ``POW.''\n  I have seen the early evidence, which has been made public, that a \ndefector, who was corroborated--indeed, he passed a lie detector test, \nas well as being corroborated on other evidence--actually drove \nSpeicher from near the crash site to a place near a hospital, and \npicked him out of a lineup of photographs.\n  I have seen more recent information from a variety of sources that \nleads me to believe that Scott Speicher is alive. That opinion, by the \nway, is shared by my colleague, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, now the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, who has been, along with former \nSenator Bob Smith, unrelenting--all of us--in the pursuit of a \nclarification on the status of Scott Speicher.\n  It is my opinion he is alive. So we have gone to our commanders, and \nthey have assured us, we have gone to the civilian agencies, and they \nhave assured us: Scott Speicher is at the top of their list of \npriorities as we are now going into Iraq, to go and find him.\n  And, oh, what a day that would be, if he is alive, and if America can \ncorrect the mistake that our DOD made and bring that American pilot \nhome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. On my time, Mr. President, I commend my colleague, a \nstrong member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Pat \nRoberts, likewise, who is on our committee, and Senator Smith, a former \nmember of the committee.\n  These three Senators have involved our committee in this as well. \nAnd, I think, heretofore, the Intelligence Committee has taken a very \nactive role.\n  Senator Levin and I are both appreciative of their efforts on this \nissue on behalf of the committee. We thank them.\n  I yield such time to the Senator from Montana as he may require.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield, just \nfor a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator has concluded, Senator \nKennedy then be recognized for 6 minutes.\n  Let me add my thanks also to Senator Nelson of Florida for the \nincredible tenacity he has shown supporting Captain Speicher.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts will be recognized for 6 minutes following \nthe Senator from Montana.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Virginia. Yes, \nwe have been conversing and friends ever since the day I got here, he \nbeing an old forest firefighter in Montana when he was younger, and his \nhair was dark. He was a dashing young man on an adventure West.\n  We have also discussed this subject a lot of times in private \nconversations. Whether it has been on the Big Horn River or on a golf \ncourse, I have always enjoyed those discussions.\n  I gave much thought on what I was going to say today. The Senator and \nI also shared the same uniform, the U.S. Marine Corps, at different \ntimes however. He was a good deal ahead of me.\n  We know what goes through the minds of the young men and women who \nare confronted with war. Of all the options we have in the world, war \nis the absolute last one. For our young men and women over there, they \nhave to carry the responsibility.\n  But the real weight may be on the shoulders of our Commander in Chief \nand on the Prime Minister of England, Mr. Blair, for they have stood \nstrong for what is right.\n  We can also call this the commitment of America. It is a commitment \nto our history. Looking in our history books, we see man can be ruled \nby many things, by weapons, by sheer military power, by biological \nweapons, and chemical weapons.\n  But 9/11 taught us something else, that we can be ruled by fear. Fear \nis still the greatest motivator of man. Americans have always accepted \na certain level of risk for freedom. Sometimes we have accepted a high \nlevel of risk for freedom. And we are called upon to do that again. It \nis not a great option, but it is one that America has assumed the \nresponsibility of since the birth of this country over 200 years ago.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 proved that we can be ruled by fear. Even a \nsniper in the Washington area was a reminder that, again, we are \ncurtailed and ruled by fear. It was by only one person, that person not \nknown. But this one is known.\n\n  We commend the President. We pray for our troops as they carry out a \ngreat tradition. Diplomatically, the timing is never right. It is never \nright. But I would say this: We could kick this can down the road. \nMaybe we could have kicked the can down the road in 1940. Would we have \nforgotten Pearl Harbor as fast as we think some people have forgotten \nthe Twin Towers? No matter what we do, some generation of America is \ngoing to have to deal with this cruel man.\n  We stand in support. We stand in prayer for those who lead, those who \ncommit, and those who do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the hour of 4 o'clock, at which time the \nvotes begin on the budget resolution, is fast approaching. I have \nseveral Senators indicating a desire to speak on my side. I ask them to \nlimit their remarks now to about 3\\1/2\\ minutes, thereabouts. I think \nthe Senator from Massachusetts should be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the best of America--our men and women in \nuniform--are now in harm's way in a\n\n[[Page S4082]]\n\ndistant land. Our prayers go with them in the skies and mountains and \ndeserts and cities of Iraq. Fathers and sons--mothers and daughters--\nbrothers and sisters--friends and neighbors and fellow Americans--they \nare all our heroes. So many are still in the dawn of life as they risk \ntheir lives for our country and our ideals. We pray for the success of \ntheir mission and their quick and safe return to their families and to \na proud and to a grateful nation.\n  Many Americans, including many of us in Congress, opposed this war. \nBut today and throughout this conflict, we are united in support of the \nmen and women of our Armed Forces. We pledge to do all we can to \nsupport them.\n  We honor them for their patriotism, their courage, their willingness \nto endure hardship and sacrifice and to give the last full measure of \ndevotion to the country they love and the country that loves them. In \nthe eloquent words of the Navy Hymn:\n\n     O Trinity of love and power!\n     Our brethren shield in danger's hour;\n     From rock to tempest, fire and foe,\n     Protect them wheresoe'er they go.\n\n  Our thoughts and our heartfelt prayers are also with our President, \nas he makes the difficult decisions that will determine the course and \nsuccess of the war that now begins. May God's wisdom guide our \nPresident and protect him in the days that lie ahead.\n  In Massachusetts, we especially honor and remember the thousands of \nmen and women on active duty from communities throughout our state who \nare now at war, and the thousands as well who have been activated from \nthe Reserve and the National Guard--from the Barnes and The Otis Air \nNational Guard Bases, from the Westover Air Reserve Base, from Camp \nEdwards, from the Devens Reserve Forces Training Area, from so many \nother places in our State. We pray for them all, and we admire them for \ntheir dedication to our country and their brave service.\n  President Bush spoke for all Americans last night in expressing \nsupport for our forces. He is right to prepare our country for what may \nbe a long and difficult struggle, and he is right to do his best to \nsafeguard the innocent people of Iraq. We join our President in \npledging our commitment to victory--to disarm Saddam and to bring \nfreedom and opportunity to all the people of Iraq.\n  In Congress, we will do all we can to give our servicemen and women \nthe complete and full support they must have in order to prevail in \nthis war and come safely home. We will do all we can to care for their \nfamilies while they are apart. We will do all we can to protect the \nAmerican people on the home front. We will do all we can to help the \npeople of Iraq, and enable them to rebuild and renew their ancient land \nand rejoin the family of nations. And we will continue in the years to \ncome to do all we can here at home to uphold the same great fundamental \nvalues for which our troops are now risking their lives--for \nopportunity and hope--for liberty and justice for all.\n  In his great poem, ``Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight,'' Vachel \nLindsay wrote:\n\n     It is portentous, and a thing of state,\n     That here at midnight, in our little town\n     A mourning figure walks, and will not rest,\n     Near the old court-house pacing up and down,\n     Or by his homestead, or in shadowed yards\n     He lingers where his children used to play,\n     Or through the market, on the well-worn stones\n     He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away.\n\n     A bronzed, lank man! His suit of ancient black,\n     A famous high top-hat and plain worn shawl\n     Make him the quaint great figure that men love,\n     The prairie-lawyer, master of us all.\n\n     He cannot sleep upon his hillside now.\n     He is among us--as in times before!\n     And we who toss and lie awake for long\n     Breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door.\n\n     His head is bowed. He thinks on men and kings.\n     Yea, when the sick world cries, how can he sleep?\n     Too many peasants fight, they know not why,\n     Too many homesteads in black terror weep.\n\n     The sins of all the war-lords burn his heart.\n     He sees the dreadnaughts scouring every main.\n     He carries on his shawl-wrapped shoulders now\n     The bitterness, the folly and the pain.\n\n     He cannot rest until a spirit-dawn\n     Shall come--the shining hope of Europe free:\n     The league of sober folk, the Workers' Earth,\n     Bringing long peace to Cornland, Alp and Sea.\n\n     It breaks his heart that kings must murder still.\n     That all his hours of travail here for men\n     Seem yet in vain. And who will bring white peace\n     That he may sleep upon his hill again?\n\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask the Senator if he could limit his remarks to about \n3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. Last night, most Americans stayed \nup late watching for news of the war. Most Senators did, too. This \nmorning, many Americans got up and said a little prayer for the men and \nwomen who will be fighting overseas for our country. I suspect most \nSenators did as well.\n  Today, most Americans went about their jobs and the Senate did, too, \nbut our discussions about the budget and our everyday jobs seem a \nlittle less important today compared to what our men and women overseas \nand our Commander in Chief are doing. We pause today to try to show in \na united voice the same respect for our President and our men and women \nwho are fighting overseas and our civilians who are involved, to show \nthe same respect for them that they show for our country. The President \nhas shown real courage. He has told us news we really don't want to \nhear, and he has been calm. He has used restraint, and he has been \ndetermined. But today, we think especially of our Armed Forces.\n  Tennesseans have a rich history of serving in the armed services. We \nare the Volunteer State. We earned that name in the War of 1812, in the \nMexican War and ever since, and the tradition continues today. Twenty \nthousand men and women from Fort Campbell have been deployed in the \nvicinity of Iraq, and another thousand active duty military personnel \nfrom across the State as well. More than 4,000 Tennesseans from more \nthan 80 Reserve and National Guard units have been called up. They come \nfrom units like the 134th Air Refueling Wing from McGhee Tyson; K \ncompany, 3rd Battalion, 23rd Marines in Memphis; and the 3397th U.S. \nArmy Garrison of Chattanooga. They are protecting us from a great \nthreat, and we are grateful to them.\n  I hope and trust that we speak with a united voice, not just for this \none day. I think of Larry Joyce, who sought me out in Chicago in 1995. \nHe was a Vietnam veteran. His son Casey was killed in Somalia while \nserving in our armed services. He wanted to make sure that I or anyone \nelse who might serve in public life remembered the lessons of Vietnam \nand Somalia. They were these: First, have a clear objective. Second, \nhave more than enough force to win. And third, have the stomach to see \nany military action we undertake all the way through to the end.\n\n  Mr. President, we have a clear objective. By 77 to 23, we voted to \ngive the President the authority he exercises today. We would disarm \nSaddam Hussein, liberate Iraq, and help rebuild a strong democratic \nIraq.\n  No. 2, we have more than sufficient force to win, maybe more force \nthan has ever been assembled in a military action.\n  The question that remains is whether we, not our armed services, but \nwhether we in the Congress and the American people have what we did not \nhave in Vietnam and what we did not have in Somalia, which is the \nstomach to see our mission all the way through to the end.\n  I rise today to join in expressing bipartisan support to our \nPresident and our Armed Forces and to hope and trust that we will have \nthe stomach to see this mission all the way through to the end.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be added as an \noriginal cosponsor of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding time. I \nwas on the floor as we began the session this morning. We had the \nprayer and the pledge, and of course this morning the prayer, by the \npastor of St. Joseph's in our neighborhood here in Washington, and the \npledge had renewed and deep meaning.\n  In terms of the prayer, I pray, too, Mr. President. I pray that our \nmilitary action in Iraq is swift, is decisive, is successful, and I \npray that the number of casualties, both military and civilian, is \nsmall.\n  I am deeply grateful--we all are deeply grateful--to the soldiers who \nare overseas. I spoke to departing guardsmen and enlisted men \nthroughout my State of New York, in Canandaigua, Fort Drum, and on Long \nIsland. When I addressed them, I had a lump in my throat because of \ntheir sacrifice, their bravery, their humanity, and because so many of \nthem were there with their families before they were getting on planes \nto go to the Middle East.\n  They are part of a grand tradition, a tradition of young men and \nyoung women who are willing to sacrifice for the rest of us, and we \npray for them. I think all Americans join in that prayer.\n  We have so many different views on the issues of the day and on the \naction in Iraq, but what always happens in this country in time of war \nis unity and prayer for our fighting men and women occur, and I believe \nthat is what is happening now in this country.\n  One last point. I have been asked by so many of my fellow New Yorkers \nwhat should they do, being that we have been in the epicenter of \nterrorism. I say to my fellow New Yorkers, first, you cannot be too \ncareful. If there is anything untoward, report it to authorities. \nSecond, our intelligence, our ability to deal with al-Qaida and other \nterrorist groups, has vastly improved since September 10, 2001, and I \nbelieve New Yorkers should continue to go about their duties, their \njobs, their businesses, their daily lives. I gave the advice to my wife \nand daughters who live in New York City to continue going about their \nlife, and I give that advice to all New Yorkers as well.\n  Again, we hope and pray for a quick, decisive, successful military \naction in Iraq and for minimal casualties, military and civilian.\n  I yield whatever time I have remaining to my colleague from Michigan.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am proud to rise in support of the resolution \nsupporting our troops.\n  America is now at war. My thoughts are with our troops. Our men and \nwomen in uniform have my steadfast support. They have my respect, my \nadmiration, and my gratitude.\n  Americans have differences over the path that led us to war. Yet \nAmericans are united in support of our men and women in uniform. Each \nand every member of our military is part of the American family. Their \nservice is a tremendous sacrifice and great risk. These are ordinary \nmen and women called on to act in an extraordinary way. Whatever their \nnation asks them to do, they will do with bravery, fortitude, and \ngallantry. All Americans owe them a debt of gratitude.\n  The military doesn't just need our thanks; they need our help. We \nmust support them not only with words, but with deeds. That means \nensuring that our troops have the best training and equipment. That \nmeans standing up for military families. They are facing long \nseparations and terrible worries about the safety of their loved ones. \nThey shouldn't also be facing financial worries. So while we are \ntalking about tax cuts for Joe Billionaire, let's not forget GI Joe and \nJane.\n  I believe the war started the right way: targeting Saddam Hussein and \nmembers of his regime in their bunkers. Saddam Hussein is our enemy, \nnot the people of Iraq.\n  Let's not forget why we are at this point: The fault lies squarely \nwith Saddam Hussein. Saddam is dangerous and duplicitous. As part of \nthe gulf war cease-fire agreement, he committed to destroy his weapons \nof mass destruction. For the past twelve years, Saddam Husssein has \nignored UN resolutions by rebuilding his illegal weapons programs. \nResolution 1441 gave Saddam Hussein a final opportunity to destroy any \nprohibited weapons of mass destruction or missiles; to fully report on \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction programs; and to cooperate with \ninspectors to verify compliance.\n  I have consistently called for robust multinational action to disarm \nIraq. Saddam Hussein is a danger to the world, so the world should \nshare the burden of confronting the Iraqi threat. I appreciate the help \nand support of other nations, including Great Britain, Australia, and \nPoland. Other countries are allowing access to territory and airspace, \nproviding logistical and intelligence support, or playing other \nnoncombat roles.\n  America must continue diplomacy, even as we continue the war, to \nexpand the coalition of the willing to share the burden of war and to \nshare the responsibility and the economic cost of rebuilding Iraq.\n  Now that America is at war, our troops must know: I am on their side. \nThe American people are on their side. The thoughts and prayers of the \nAmerican people are with the men and women of our military, and with \ntheir families.\n  God bless our troops, and God bless America.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, with the commencement of engagement by \nU.S. military forces in Iraq, we stand united in support of the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces. These young men and women representing the \nbest of America are entering into harm's way in a distant land. \nWhatever our differences on policy, we speak with one voice in \nsupporting our troops. I have no doubt that our military forces will be \nsuccessful, although we do not now know how quickly or at what cost.\n  As do all Marylanders, indeed all Americans, I pray for the safety of \nour troops and join my colleagues in pledging to them our commitment \nfor the necessary resources and support.\n  These brave men and women and their families are in our thoughts and \nin our prayers. We wish them Godspeed, and their prompt and safe return \nto our shores.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my thoughts and prayers are with Iowa \nfamilies who have loved ones serving their country in the Middle East. \nWhen faced with the difficult and sometimes terrible duty of war, the \nmen and women of our armed services have never let us down. We have the \nbest trained soldiers, the best technology, and the best military \ncommanders in the world. I have full confidence in their performance. \nMy hope is for a swift conclusion and a lasting peace in the entire \nregion. It is also my deep hope that innocent civilians in Iraq and the \nrest of the Middle East suffer a minimum of harm.\n  I know the views in the country have been divided as to the need for \nand the wisdom of this war. Right now, we need to support the men and \nwomen who are serving this country. This war and the reconstruction \nwork that follows will not be easy and many of our troops may bravely \nface risks. They are doing their duty and sacrificing for our security. \nWe need to keep them all in our thoughts and prayers and be fully \nbehind them. That is something on which we can all agree.\n  Right now, over 3,200 Iowans are serving: 2,200 in the National \nGuard, 1,760 are overseas, and over 1,000 in our Reserves here and \nabroad. We are proud of our Iowa, that Iowans are protecting our \nhomeland.\n  In my home State of Iowa, I know there have been some concerns about \nour vulnerable areas in this time of Washington. I want Iowans to know \nI will be working with my fellow Senators to ensure our homeland is \nprotected. As our Governor, Tom Vilsack, said today, it will take the \nresources of our Federal Government to keep our communities safe. I \nintend to work to make sure Iowans and all Americans have the \nprotections we need here at home.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the tens of \nthousands of brave Americans who are risking their lives at this very \nhour in a distant land to try to bring some peace and stability to a \nnation that has been ravaged by a dictator.\n  Late last night the President of the United States ordered United \nStates\n\n[[Page S4084]]\n\nforces to begin attacks on Iraqi installations. There are currently \nalmost 300,000 American service men and women in the Persian Gulf \nregion. Several thousand are from my State of Connecticut, and they are \ndoing their part. There are 1,500 members of the Connecticut National \nGuard, of which I was a member. It seems like hundreds of years ago, \nbut I was a member of that National Guard in my home State. There are \n750 deployed to the Middle East, and another 750 activated to \nparticipate in homeland security and related responsibilities. The \nresults are 530 sons and daughters serving in the Army who are active \nmembers and reservists, 310 in the Air Force, and dozens of police \nofficers and firefighters called to active duty, putting additional \npressures on the homeland security issues.\n  I thank each and every one of them for their service to our State, to \nour country, and for freedom. I say to them I am proud and honored to \nrepresent them in the Senate.\n  As is always the case, these young men and women stand ready to obey \nthe orders of the Commander in Chief to take up arms and risk their \nlives in the defense of all Americans and the values of freedom, \nliberty, and democracy. I greatly admire the courage and \nprofessionalism of our service men and women who are now engaged in \nthis dangerous conflict far away from their homes and their loved ones.\n  Americans stand as one in support of these brave individuals. I \nexpress my gratitude to the family members of our soldiers, sailors, \nmarines, and members of the Coast Guard. They, more than anyone, \nunderstand the sacrifices involved in the service of our Nation.\n  War is a treacherous endeavor and we all pray for their safe return. \nI am confident in the days and weeks ahead America and the U.S. \nCongress will continue to provide our service men and women the support \nthey deserve and they may need.\n  Last fall, I supported President Bush's decision to go to the United \nNations and seek the support of the U.N. members to resolve the threat \nposed by Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and supported the deployment \nof U.S. weapons inspectors to Iraq to verify peaceful disarmament. I \nwanted the diplomatic efforts to succeed. I believe President Bush did, \nas well. Unfortunately, Saddam Hussein obviously did not.\n  While there may have been differing opinions on some aspects of our \npolicy toward Iraq, there has been no disagreement that Saddam Hussein \nis anything but a cruel and murderous tyrant. At a very critical \njuncture Saddam Hussein chose to impede the work of the inspectors and \nat every fork of the road he squandered opportunities for peaceful \ndisarmament presented by the international community. Time has run out \nand we thus find ourselves in this situation.\n  My hope is as we begin the reconstruction process, it will be a sense \nof cooperation internationally on reconstruction. We cannot do this \nalone. We have to reach out even to those we have had disagreements \nwith to help rebuild Iraq and build the peace and stability of the \nregion. That is critically important for America's security for the \n21st century.\n  I regret we did not have more time to discuss this and express our \nviews and thoughts. I do not minimize the importance of the budget \ndebate, but this discussion would trump any discussion of a budget \nissue. Unfortunately, that time is not allocated.\n  Saddam Hussein must bear full responsibility for what is about to \nbefall him. He brought it upon himself. I have no sympathy for his \nplight. The real tragedy is that others may have to suffer for his sins \nalthough I am confident that American soldiers will make every effort, \nuse every means of intelligence, and employ all available technology to \nminimize civilian casualties.\n  Would that Saddam Hussein had shown the same regard for his people \nthat our forces will. His record has been the opposite. This murderous \ntyrant has routinely had his own people tortured, raped, beaten, and \nexecuted. In 1988, he ordered the use of chemical weapons against the \nIraqi people, killing 5,000 men, women, and children in a single day. \nNow, he may be ordering his elite troops to use the city of Baghdad as \na fortress a human fortress endangering the lives of countless Iraqi \ncivilians.\n  It is my hope that United States military action will not only free \nthe world of the dangers posed by Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass \ndestruction, but provide an opportunity for the Iraqi people to free \nthemselves from 30 years of tyranny and oppression, to begin a new \nchapter in the history of their country.\n  The current military action may only last a few days or a few weeks. \nBut in the end, I have no doubt that our American service men and women \nwill prevail in this conflict. However, after we emerge successfully \nfrom our military conflict with Saddam Hussein, another challenge will \nface us the task of establishing a free and stable Iraq. In many ways \nthis is an even more important battle than the one currently ongoing in \nthe deserts of Iraq. And it is a battle that we should not ``wage'' \nalone. An international coalition of friends, allies, and U.N. \nhumanitarian organizations must be mobilized to share the costs and \nresponsibility for providing humanitarian relief to the Iraqi people, \nand the larger and more complex reconstruction of Iraqi society.\n  The United States is not the only nation that has a stake in \nrebuilding Iraq. The entire world has a huge stake in getting this \nright. For only an Iraq that is strong, free, and democratic--only an \nIraq that respects the rights of all its citizens only an Iraq that \nrespects the territorial integrity of its neighbors can be counted on \nto contribute to building a Middle East that is stable and prosperous. \nThat is why I am confident that whatever our past differences may have \nbeen, our friends and allies at the United Nations will join with us in \nthis effort.\n  Once again let me express my thanks to the American men and women who \nhave put themselves at risk for each one of us. Let me also thank the \nservice members from other nations who have joined with our forces in \nthis endeavor. And let me offer one more prayer for their swift and \nsafe return home once their mission is complete.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues and all \nof America in expressing pride in and gratitude to our men and women in \nuniform. With one voice this Congress honors our troops, and with one \nmind we pray for their safe return.\n  Last night, as we all watched from the safety of our living rooms, \nour military went to war. Our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen \nhave left their home country and their home fires to face unknown \ndanger and even death. We cannot be proud enough of these courageous \nmen and women who fight for freedom in Iraq. We cannot be grateful \nenough to these Americans who are willing to risk their lives for our \nsecurity.\n  We have so many people to thank today: our Active Duty forces who \nhave made it their life work to protect and defend us; our citizen \nsoldiers, the Reserves, and the National Guard who have left jobs in \noffices and on factory floors, kissed children and spouses goodbye, and \ndonned the uniform of our armed services; our troops' families who \ndaily endure the hardships of military life and today worry and wait \nfor their loved ones to come home.\n  In my State of Wisconsin we have had over 2,200 men and women called \nup for service in the National Guard and an additional 1,357 mobilized \nfrom the Reserves, more people than at any time since the Berlin \ncrisis.\n  I make special mention of them because they trained in relative \nanonymity during times of peace. It is only in times of conflict that \ncommunities discover how many of their friends and neighbors serve \ntheir country quietly, year in and year out. In times of crises they \nare notable at their absence at scout meetings, church pews, and \nparent-teacher conferences.\n  Last Monday I was fortunate enough to observe the 1158 transportation \ncompany at Beloit, WI, as they bravely headed off, leaving behind \nspouses, children, families, and friends. These soldiers had little \ntime to put their affairs in order before being ordered into harm's \nway. But there were no complaints and no grumbling.\n  The families I met were concerned about the future, were ready to \ndeal with the personal and financial difficulties.\n  I was struck to see young children bravely saying goodbye to their \nparents, without knowing what the future\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\nmight bring. These youngsters did not ask for this war and did not \nunderstand it, but they, too, are making sacrifices for our security. \nOur soldiers are ready and willing to do their duty. They understand \nbetter than anyone else that freedom is not free. They are ready to pay \nthat price today and every day.\n  Our soldiers represent the best of the American people and American \nideals. While many of us will talk about patriotism and service today, \nno words can do justice to the burden they have chosen to bear.\n  So our hearts, our prayers, and our deepest gratitude go out to them \ntoday.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The President has announced that military operations \nto disarm and liberate Iraq have begun. For those of us who have taken \nan oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, entering into war is one \nof the most somber moments we face.\n  When the President sends our troops to battle, the stakes are \nunmistakably clear: our courageous troops are preparing to risk \neverything so that our society can continue to live in freedom. At a \ntime like this, our Nation should come together as one to support our \ntroops in battle, and to support the Commander in Chief.\n  This military action responds to the growing threat to America and \nour allies posed by Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction. \nHere at home and around the world, we have debated how best to disarm \nSaddam. After 12 years of diplomacy, and 17 different U.N. resolutions, \nSaddam remains a serious threat to the peace and stability of the \nregion, and to the safety of Americans and our allies.\n  I, like most of my colleagues, believed we could not live with this \nthreat to America's security. And so I voted last October to give the \nPresident authority to make one final attempt to disarm Saddam through \nthe U.N.--to give diplomacy one last chance to work--and to resort to \nforcible disarmament if that failed.\n  Five months after we passed our congressional resolution, and 4 \nmonths after the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed resolution \n1441, Saddam has still refused to disarm.\n  Now the President has decided, drawing on the authority granted him \nby the Constitution, by the Congress, and by a series of U.N. \nresolutions, to send our troops into battle--to forcibly disarm Iraq, \nend Saddam's rule of terror, and allow the oppressed Iraqi people to \nhave a better life.\n  And it is our responsibility, here in America, to come together to \nshow our troops, who are fighting to protect our freedoms, that they \nhave all our support, and that we are praying for a quick and \nsuccessful campaign.\n  I had the opportunity to visit our troops last month in Kuwait, \nQatar, and Afghanistan, and had the privilege to meet our fine young \nWest Virginians serving there. I am always impressed by the commitment \nand professionalism of our Armed Forces--the brave enlisted men and \nwomen who have dedicated their skills and energy to safeguarding \nAmerica's vital national interests, the officer crops who have honed \nthe most awesome fighting machine the world has ever seen, and the \nreservists and national guardsmen who willingly disrupt their civilian \nlives when their country needs them.\n  To witness their dedication and skill, and their willingness to risk \neverything to defend the greater good of our Nation, is to be reminded, \njust as we learned on that fateful September 11, that heroes still walk \namong us. The Americans who have volunteered to serve in our Nation's \nArmed Forces are some of the finest individuals our society produces, \nand we are all in their debt.\n  We West Virginians have always been particularly proud that while we \nare a small State, we contribute a significant share of America's Armed \nForces. I have here a list of the West Virginia Reserve and National \nGuard units that have been called up for service overseas in the past 2 \nyears. I realize I can't read the entire list, but I would like to note \nthat it encompasses 28 units based in West Virginia and nearly 2500 \nservicemembers, as well as thousands of Active Duty servicemembers who \nhail from West Virginia. I ask unanimous consent to have this list \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nWest Virginia National Guard & Reserve Units Mobilized Since September \n                                11, 2001\n\n       1. 157th Military Police Company, Martinsburg, WV, 124 \n     personnel.\n       2. 152nd Military Police Detachment, Moorefield, WV, 45 \n     personnel.\n       3. 1257th Transportation Company, Huntington, WV, 167 \n     personnel.\n       4. 463rd Engineer Battalion Detachment 2, Wheeling, WV, 50 \n     personnel.\n       5. 554th Adjutant General Company, Ripley, WV, 18 \n     personnel.\n       6. 111th Engineer Group Headquarters, Headquarters Company, \n     St. Albans, 88 personnel.\n       7. 119th Engineer Company, Clarksburg, WV, 159 personnel.\n       8.

A war will always involve risk and uncertainty. That \nis especially the case when we are dealing with a dangerous dictator \nlike Saddam Hussein, who has used illegal; weapons before, and who \nknows that in this instance, war will not end until he is removed.\n  We should never be over-confident, and must go into this knowing that \nour troops will face real risks. But we can take heart that never, in \nthe history of mankind, have there been Armed Forces better prepared to \nmeet the challenges that come their way.\n  In skill, in technological sophistication, and in fighting spirit, \nour troops continue to set new benchmarks the world has never seen. \nNever in modern history has there been a fighting force so clearly \nsuperior to all its competitors.\n  We now stand at an important threshold in our Nation's history, and \nour national security. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nhas altered America's security forever. Before 2001, we believed that \nwe could only be threatened by another superpower--and the demise of \nthe Soviet Union made us think that threats to America's homeland had \nmore or less vanished. On September 11, we learned how wrong we were.\n  In the coming years, the spread of weapons of mass destruction--to \nrogue governments, and to terrorist groups in the developing world--\nwill be America's most important national security challenge. And \nincreasingly, the focus of our diplomacy and defense alliances will \nshift away from our traditional focus on Europe to respond to these \nemerging threats from developing countries in Asia, in Africa, and even \nin Latin America.\n  Indeed, that is already the case today: besides Iraq, the biggest \nsecurity threats currently facing America aren't major power rivalries \nbut illegal proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by states such \nas North Korea and Iran. This threat isn't unique to the United \nStates--but our global leadership role makes us a particularly tempting \ntarget for the disaffected and resentful.\n  We cannot allow foreign terrorist or rogue states to threaten our \nsociety\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\nwith weapons of mass destruction. Terrorism and proliferation can be \nstopped, but to do so will require a concerted, sustained strategy, \nrather than ad hoc, relative efforts.\n  And it will require broad international support--the kind that helped \nus win the cold war--rather than working alone, or begin dismissive of \nour allies because they haven't yet recognized the magnitude of the \nshared threat.\n  War is always a tragedy. To put human lives at risk--both military \nand civilian--can only be considered when all other reasonable options \nhave failed.\n  And in that regard, the significance of this conflict is not just in \ndisarming Iraq. While that is the primary goal, this mission also \ndemonstrates to the world that the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction is such a grave threat to our security that we Americans \nare prepared to use the full force of our militry--our fine and brave \nmen and women in uniform--to stop it.\n  And we are joined in that understanding by the British, and the \nAustralians, and the poles, and many, many allies around the world.\n  Perhaps some other countries haven't reached that understanding yet. \nOr they continue to believe the diplomatic processes developed for a \ncold war environment must be maintained at all costs. But this new \nthreat must be addressed.\n  If our troops find chemicals or biological weapons in Iraq--and I am \nconfident they will--it will demonstrate to the skeptics around the \nworld that we were right about the threat, and that we had to take \naction before these illegal weapons were used. And I hold out great \nhope that a swift victory in Iraq will pave the way for the U.S. and \nour allies to come together around a strategy to deal with the spread \nof weapons of mass destruction elsewhere.\n  I hope, too, that a swift victory in Iraq will provide an opportunity \nfor the U.S. and our allies to come together to support the \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraq. As the President has said, \nwe bear no ill-will to the Iraqi people, only to the brutal and corrupt \nregime that governs them. The reconstruction of Iraq will be a long, \ncostly complicated task, but a vital one--for it will ensure that \nIraqis, now and in the future, will understand that America and its \nallies have come as liberators, not conquerors.\n  Those are longer-term concerns, and we will have to attend to them. \nFor now, though, we must focus on the task at hand, which is the \nprompt, safe and humane execution of the military operation the \nPresident has commenced.\n  I join my fellow West Virginians in telling our troops they have our \nsupport, our gratitude, and our prayers. They represent the best of our \nsociety, and we know they will perform in a manner that makes us all \nproud.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with America at war \nagainst the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, to vote in favor of the \nconcurrent resolution introduced by my colleagues, commending the \nPresident and America's Armed Forces.\n  This is a moment of utmost seriousness and solemnity, without doubt \nthe most critical time of my decade in the Senate.\n  During this difficult time, America and the world must know that this \nChamber stands firmly united behind our men and women in harm's way, \nmen and women willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our \nliberties and our lives. Our hopes and our prayers are with them and \ntheir families.\n  I would also like to recognize those now engaged in combat from my \nhome State of California.\n  More than 102,000 Californians have been sent to the gulf from every \nbranch of the military--Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and \nMarines, along with 13,000 reservists. This is the largest number of \nAmericans from any State fighting in this war.\n  And while many people in California are opposed to this war, I would \nurge all of them to unite behind these courageous men and women and \ntheir families here at home.\n  I have had questions about how we got to this point. I would have \ndone it a different way, and I will have more to say about that at the \nappropriate time.\n  But now, as we unite behind our military and our Commander in Chief, \nthe United States must be prepared for the long term. Winning the war \nwill mark but the first step.\n  Once the shooting stops and the dust clears, we must be equally \ncommitted to winning the peace in Iraq, and to see that longstanding \nethnic rivalries not be allowed to surface. Failure to do so would, at \nthe very least, negate any military success.\n  This means, of course, that the United States must take the lead in \nrebuilding the Iraqi nation, in stabilizing its new government, in \nproviding interim security to prevent the emergence of tribal \nhostilities, and to see that Iraq is no longer a producer of weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Winning the peace in Iraq is absolutely critical. Indeed, winning the \npeace means: reducing the likelihood of a possible clash of \ncivilizations, pitting the United States and our allies against the \nMuslim world; reducing the incidence of renewed terrorist attacks, both \nhere and abroad; increasing the chances of achieving lasting peace in \nthe Middle East--of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian crisis; allowing \nus to recommit ourselves to the still uncertain future of Afghanistan \nand the government of Hamid Karzai; and ensuring that the United States \nwill persevere, sooner rather than later, in the overall war on terror.\n  So, as the courageous men and women of the American military set out \nto remove Saddam Hussein from power, risking their very lives for us \nand the liberties we must never take for granted, the focus of our \nthoughts and our prayers are with them.\n  We wish them every success and a speedy return home to their \nfamilies. For those that may fall in battle and pay the highest price, \nhowever, their sacrifice must never be forgotten.\n  And the best way to honor them is by winning the peace in Iraq--by \nhelping the Iraqi people rebuild their lives, and by demonstrating to \nMuslims everywhere that the United States, while a powerful nation, is \nalso motivated by a sincere desire to one day see the entire world \nsafe, prosperous, and free.\n  This, after all, is what this conflict is all about, and why we must \nprevail.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as this conflict begins, all of us pray \nfor a swift and decisive victory, and the safety of our brave men and \nwomen in battle.\n  North Dakota has sent thousands of sons and daughters to wage this \nfight at home and abroad, including more National Guard members per \ncapita than any other State.\n  Along with the men and women from the airbases in Minot and Grand \nForks, North Dakotans will bear a heavy burden in this conflict.\n  I know they will be strong. I pray they will be safe.\n  I have great confidence that the fourteen B-52s deployed from Minot \nAir Force Base and their crews will turn in a brilliant performance, \nonce again demonstrating the awesome power and effectiveness of these \nreliable planes and their expert crews. B-52s made a huge contribution \nto our success in Afghanistan, helping to turn the tide quickly against \nthe terrorists. They were decisive in the last gulf war, and I know \nthey will again play a key role.\n  The Grand Forks base is operating at a greater tempo than at any time \nin its history, flying its massive tankers and providing the air bridge \nthat allows our forces to operate against an enemy halfway around the \nworld.\n  Our National Guard members have been called up to bases inside the \nUnited States, ready to support operations on the ground, and we hope, \nthe operations that will be necessary after a victory. The Guard units \nhave been drawn from Fargo, Bismarck, Grand Forks, Edgeley, Grafton, \nRugby, Wishek, Cando, Carrington, Mayville, Oakes, and Wahpeton. There \nis hardly a town in my State that has not seen at least one of its \ncitizens called up to serve. They have left their jobs and their \nfamilies to do their duty in defense of the Nation.\n  I could not be more proud of the tremendous contribution the men and \nwomen of my State are making, their dedication and their patriotism.\n  I had hoped for a peaceful solution, but today we are at war. Like \nall Americans, my thoughts and prayers will be with our troops and our \nallies in the difficult hours to come. My greatest hope is that the \nconflict will be settled quickly, with minimal loss of life,\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\nand that stability will be restored to the region.\n  As the conflict continues, I stand with my colleagues united behind \nour troops here at home and overseas. With my family and my colleagues \nI pray for the men and women who now stand in harm's way. May they be \ngranted a swift victory, and may the sacrifices of this war lead to a \nsafer and more peaceful world.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, On Monday, March 17, the attention of the \nworld was focused on Washington, DC and the White House. The President \nwas about to speak to the Nation about Saddam Hussein and the refusal \nof the Government of Iraq to live up to its signed agreements and the \nresolutions of the United Nations to eliminate their stock of weapons \nof mass destruction. In the 15 or so minutes that followed, our \nPresident made clear his determination to take action and resolve the \nsituation in Iraq. He said he was going to end forever the evil \npresence of a dictator in Iraq who had done nothing during his reign \nbut abuse his power as he pursued his dreams of glory and increased \npower and prestige while showing little regard for the health and \nwelfare of his own people.\n  As the President spoke with passion and conviction on the need to rid \nthe world of Hussein's dictatorship, he cut through the rhetoric and \nthe misleading positions and promises that had been so often heard \nduring the past few years. He made it clear that this was an ultimatum \nof more than words--action was sure to follow if his words were left \nunheeded. He did everything he could to make it abundantly clear to \nSaddam Hussein and the people of the world that such evil would not be \nallowed to stand. He stated a final deadline.\n  Soon after he spoke, the movement of our troops intensified as an \ninternational coalition took up their positions surrounding Iraq as we \nall waited for Saddam Hussein's response. There could be only one \nacceptable response to the President's message. Saddam had to leave \nIraq, relinquish his power, and take his sons and family with him. \nAnything less would be unacceptable.\n  Now we have our answer. A deadline has been set which has come and \ngone. In response our troops are now advancing into Iraq and heading \nfor its capital of Baghdad. A series of events that began years ago \nwith our defense of Kuwait will now end where it must--with the removal \nof Saddam Hussein and an end to his brutal dictatorship.\n  As our troops head further into Iraq, they will be heading into \nunknown dangers and trouble that cannot be accurately predicted, though \nthey have been trained and will be prepared for it.\n  Will Saddam Hussein try to use chemical weapons to prolong his hold \non power? What has he hidden from the team of inspectors that he may \nnow want to unleash? These and so many other questions will be in the \nminds of our troops as they come closer and closer to Iraq's capital \ncity. The rewards that will come with our success will be great. But, \nas we know from our past experiences, the sacrifices that may lie ahead \nmay be equally as great.\n  War is a very dangerous business and Wyoming is no stranger to the \nkind of sacrifice it sometimes requires from those who serve in our \nmilitary. Down through the years, the people of Wyoming have always \nanswered the call to protect and preserve the peace and answer the \nthreat of any enemy of our Nation, wherever it has led them. Many paid \nthe ultimate price.\n  In 1991, when Saddam Hussein decided to attack Kuwait and drain that \ncountry of its supplies and resources, our Armed Forces were there to \nrespond to the cry for help that came from Kuwait.\n  Joining in as part of that effort was one of Wyoming's own, Manuel \nDavila. Manuel was a brave young man, a father, and a nice guy who had \na kind word for everyone he met. He was the kind of person you would \nwant on your side if there were tough times ahead. There were tough \ntimes on the horizon as this battle began and we were fortunate to have \nbrave men and women like Manuel on our side.\n  I watched Manuel grow up because he came from my home town. He loved \nhis life and he loved Wyoming. But he loved freedom more. When he was \ncalled on to bring the freedoms he loved to people he had never met, he \ndid not hesitate. He traded his beloved blue skies and mountaintops of \nWyoming for the flat dessert and skies darkened by Saddam Hussein's \ndesperate attempts to delay the end of his occupation by setting every \noil well he could on fire. He traded the sweet smell of Wyoming's clean \nmountain air for the use of a gas mask and the threat of exposure to \nthe Iraqi war machine's stock of gas and chemical weapons.\n  Sadly, he was one who didn't come home from that war. But he did \nleave behind a legacy of standing up for what you believe in, keeping \nyour word, and never allowing evil to win by failing to act or by doing \nso little in response it was as if you did nothing at all.\n\n  Then came September 11, and another round of attacks by a madman \nfueled by hatred and a mad desire for power. Once again we looked to \nour sons and daughters to respond and to end the threat of terrorism \nonce and for all. The bravest and best of Wyoming and many other States \nwere soon on the front lines, ready to put their training into action. \nAs they did, one of the first lost was Jonn J. Edmunds, a young man \nfrom Cheyenne, who was killed as our Nation took action against those \nwho supported and planned the terrorist attacks of that terrible day.\n  Now, as we stand here together in prayerful support of our Armed \nForces, I have no doubt that Manuel and Jonn and all the others who \nhave served so bravely in our military over the years would be proud of \ntheir comrades and their liberation of Iraq which is finally at hand.\n  Soon Iraq will be welcomed back into the family of nations and the \nrights so cherished by our Nation and our people will be part of the \ndaily routine in Iraq, too. By our actions we are showing the world \nthat the rights with which we are endowed by our Creator, the rights to \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, which are a part of our \nown Declaration of Independence, were intended to be claimed not just \nby the people of our own Nation. They are to be rightfully claimed by \npeople all over the world as well.\n  As we wait for today's news from Iraq, we are fully aware of the \nseriousness of the challenge that lies before us--its difficulty and \nits magnitude. For the first time since I was a young boy we are facing \nan enemy who is faceless and nameless and may have operatives who \nsympathize with him who may strike us on our own soil. With the \nexception of Pearl Harbor, we have never faced that kind of a threat in \nour lives. September 11 changed that and we must now all be more \nvigilant for in a very real sense we are all part of the war effort--\njust as we were in the days of World War II.\n  As the effort to remove the tyranny of Saddam Hussein continues, the \nfate of both our nations hangs in the balance. The degree of our \nsuccess in what we set out to do and the aftermath as we work to bring \na lasting peace to Iraq will speak volumes to the world about our \nability to walk our talk.\n  When this war is over and Iraq is free, we will have sent a message \nto all those who would deny their people the basic rights of human \nexistence. The world will no longer tolerate their abuse of power and \ntheir refusal to acknowledge or respond to the needs of their people. \nWe will also have ended the regime of a dictator and eliminated his \nstock of weapons of mass destruction. We will have taken a strong, \ndecisive action which will help to increase the security of our Nation \nand the world.\n  Ronald Reagan once said that ``Some people live an entire lifetime \nand wonder if they have ever made a difference in the world. The \nmarines don't have that problem.''\n  Neither does the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard or \nthe Merchant Marine. Through their brave and courageous actions on \nbehalf of the people of Iraq, they will do for that country what they \ndid for the people of Kuwait. They will give them their country and \ntheir lives back. They will give them the chance to dream again about a \nbetter future for their children. They will give those who live under \noppression around the world a real reason to hope that someday things \nwill be better for them in their own country.\n  We all know what brave, remarkable people our soldiers are. They \ndon't see any limits to what they can do because they will never quit \nuntil the job is done and the war is won. We owe them\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\neach a debt we will never be able to repay. We can never forget that it \nis because of them--and not us--that the rights enumerated in our \nConstitution are guaranteed. Whether it is freedom of religion, the \npress, or freedom of speech, it has always been the efforts of our \nsoldiers that have provided us with a platform from which to speak, and \nthe ability to exercise these and all our rights. Even those who have \nspoken out against their efforts have our soldiers to thank for their \nright to do.\n  Tonight, when we spend those last few minutes tucking our children \ninto bed, I hope we all take a moment to comfort our children and our \ngrandchildren, and to assure them that things will be all right someday \nsoon. Make sure they know they can sleep peacefully tonight and in the \nnights to come, because the brave men and women of this Nation, our \nsons and daughters--and perhaps their own sisters and brothers--are \never vigilant, on guard and have taken a stand on our behalf. We can \ntake a great deal of pride in them all.\n  As a member of the Senate, I have always been very proud of the way \nwe come together whenever we are faced by a threat, or forced to use \nour nation's military to answer an attack or address a wrong. As our \nyoung men and women head into battle, I know I won't be the only one \nwho will bow his head to pray.\n  May God bless and protect the men and women of our Armed Forces. May \nHe watch over the Iraqi people and keep them safe from harm as we fight \nto liberate their country and bring them freedom and peace--a just \npeace that will recognize their rights and ensure that they have food, \nmedicine, and the essentials of life that have been denied them for too \nlong. May our victory be swift so their wait for relief will not be \nlong. And may all our loved ones return home safely, and in peace.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues and the \nNation in a strong and unequivocal expression of support for the \ncourageous men and women of the United States military, who now defend \nAmerica's values in the Persian Gulf.\n  This expression is far more than a personal expression. It is an \nexpression of the feelings of the people of New Jersey--many who are \nmothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, and spouses of those in harm's \nway. For all of us, these brave individuals are in our hearts and \nprayers.\n  Mr. President, today our Nation is united. United in support for our \nNation's military. United in appreciation for the bravery and sacrifice \nof our service men and women, and their loved ones. United in our \nunshakable commitment to victory, a victory, with the grace of God, \nthat will be achieved with maximum speed and minimum casualties.\n  Mr. President, we Americans obviously had our differences as we moved \non the path that got us to this point. There are many reservations I \ncould express and people more thoughtful than myself have done so. But \nin our democracy, there is a time for differences and a time for \ndebate. That said, there comes a time to end debate and unite. That \ntime is now. That unity is without regard to party, ideology, or \nphilosophy. We all stand together as members of the great American \nfamily.\n  Mr. President, the United States military is unrivaled in its power \nand its competence. In that strength, I am confident that we will \nsucceed in our mission. A mission to free the Iraqi people. A mission \nto help ensure that our Nation can live in peace, without the threat of \nweapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of madmen and \nterrorists.\n  So, Mr. President, on behalf of all New Jerseyans and in company with \nall Americans, let me again express my deep appreciation to the \ncourageous Americans who are putting their lives on the line, and for \ntheir loved ones. They are America's heroes. Their Nation will support \nthem every step of the way until the day comes, as we pray it will, \nwhen these hostilities are complete.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today, our hearts and prayers go out to \nthose people in the Armed Forces who are fighting the war in Iraq. This \nmorning, I put on this orange ribbon I wore when I was Governor of the \nState of Ohio during Desert Storm. I am going to continue to wear it \nduring the war in Iraq to remind me and others that our men and women \nare in harm's way, and I will continue to wear it until they return.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as we stand here today on the Senate floor, \nAmerica's finest citizens and the world's greatest military men and \nwomen have been called upon in the cause of disarming Saddam Hussein.\n  These are Americans who willingly serve this country, who knowingly \nplace themselves in harm's way to defend our Nation, and who are ready \nto do the jobs for which they have trained. These men and women in the \nArmed Services and intelligence community are unmatched in their \nprofessionalism and skill, and I have no doubt that they will prevail.\n  As I said on the House floor in 1991, on behalf of the authorization \nof what would become Operation Desert Storm, ``the magnitude of the \nvote I now face is greater than any other I have or likely will cast.'' \nI was proven wrong on October 9, when I cast a vote of equal gravity \nand solemnity, authorizing the President to use force in the \ndisarmament of Saddam Hussein.\n  In the days since that vote, while President Bush pursued a course of \ndiplomacy, Saddam Hussein instead pursued a course of deceit. Under the \nterms of UN Resolution 1441, approved unanimously by the Security \nCouncil, Hussein determined the course upon which we have now embarked \nby refusing to fully and immediately disarm. Armed conflict was not the \nhope of anyone among us. Now that it regrettably has become a necessary \nreality, we stand united in support of our troops who once again will \nbe on the vanguard in service to freedom and the protection of all \nthose nations that embrace this noble ideal.\n  I have had the great privilege to meet countless soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and women, and veterans during my quarter-century tenure in \nCongress. We are grateful because we know that they are the bulwark \nbehind which we stand, and against which our enemies strain. And we are \nin awe because we cannot fully comprehend their ability to so \ncompletely substitute the concept of ``self'' with the virtue of \nselflessness.\n  Today, the realities of war weigh heavily on our hearts, and the \nfocus of all our prayers is now with our men and women in uniform. In \nthe protection of freedom, the disarming of Saddam Hussein, and the \nliberation of the people of Iraq, American sons and daughters may well \nmake the ultimate sacrifice. That they would undertake that risk for \nour Nation and the world overwhelms the words available to honor their \nextraordinary spirit and courage.\n  The best we can hope to do is to come together, behind our Commander \nin Chief and all of our troops, with nothing but the greatest pride in \ntheir courage and the strongest support for their mission. A freed \nIraq, a world free of the tyranny of Saddam Hussein and his weapons of \nmass destruction, and a menacing cloud lifted from the heartland of a \ntroubled region--none of these would be possible without those men and \nwomen who put their lives at risk for the greater good.\n  It is for them that we pass this resolution and pray for safe return. \nMay God bless all those who wear the uniform of our armed forces, and \nmy God bless the United States of America.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, as a citizen, Senator, and former marine, \nmy hopes and prayers are with the troops and their families. I returned \njust a few weeks ago from the Persian Gulf and will be going back as \nsoon as possible. I went to the region to assess whether the war \nfighters in the field were armed with the best intelligence possible to \nfight and win a battle against Saddam Hussein. Take my word for it, our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are ready. They will take care \nof business consistent with American values. They will take care of \neach other. When they return, they will receive the accolades of a \ngreateful nation.\n  The operation in Iraq is a component of the war against terrorism. We \ndepend on our men and women in uniform to keep the terror plotters and \noperators far off our shores, away from our families, communities, and \nour Nation. That is quite a responsibility. I can not imagine a more \nimportant mission.\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\n  I support the resolution under consideration, and I am pleased it \nmentions those who have yet to return home from the original conflict \nin 1991, most notably Navy Captain Scott Speicher. I am also pleased \nthat colleagues have come to the chamber not to argue about Iraq, \nrather to proclaim support for our service personnel.\n  The debate ended last October while a 77-to-23 vote to permit a \nmilitary option, should one be needed, in the case of the Baghdad \nregime. In passing H.J. Res. 114, Congress specifically authorized the \nPresident to ``use the Armed Forces of the United States in order to--\n(1) defend the national security of the United States against the \ncontinuing threat posed by Iraq; and (2) enforce all relevant United \nNations Council resolutions regarding Iraq.'' This action was, of \ncourse, in addition to the Iraq Liberation Act, which Congress passed \nand President Clinton signed into law October 31, 1988. That act \nclearly states the United States should foster regime change in Iraq. \nThe House passed that bill by a vote of 360 to 38, with 157 Democrats \njoining 202 Republicans. Lastly, on November 8, 2002, the U.N. Security \nCouncil passed Resolution 1441 which gave Iraq one last opportunity to \ncomply with its disarmament obligations.\n  A few months later, the Director of Central Intelligence declared \n``Iraq has in place an active effort to deceive the UN inspectors and \ndeny them access. This effort is directed by the highest levels of the \nIraqi regime. Baghdad has given clear directions to its operational \nforces to hide banned materials in their possession.'' Let's be candid \non the issue of compliance. The truth is that no amount of U-2 \nsurveillance flights nor increase in the number of inspectors would \nhave solved the problem of Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass \ndestruction. Now I don't want war. Nobody wants war. The fact is, \nhowever, we are already at war. Over the last two decades, 5,700 \nAmericans have lost their lives as a result of the kind of terrorist \nactivity Saddam Hussein supports. I recall that the Marine Barracks in \nLebanon, Pan Am 103, Khobar Towers, the embassy bombings in Kenya and \nTanzania, the USS Cole, and of course, September 11, 2001. Only after \nthe latter tragedy, did we begin to fight back.\n  So I say to our troops and their families, thank you and I support \nyou. You are freedom's best hope.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nexpress, on behalf of Washington State, our prayers and thoughts for \nthe men and women of the United States armed forces that have now been \ncalled to duty in service of their country.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues in the Senate and Americans \nthroughout the country to come together to support our troops and pray \nthat their mission is completed quickly, effectively, and with minimal \ncasualties.\n  America's deepest hope is for a swift conclusion to this war to \nliberate Iraq and protect the world from its weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  In Washington State, we are proud to be the home to thousands of \ntroops from our State that are currently serving our country in this \nconflict.\n  The men and women of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, homeported in \nEverett, WA, have been deployed in the region since last summer and are \na critical element of our efforts as a launching stage for air \noperations, including 50 missions over Southern Iraq just yesterday.\n  Air operations will depend heavily on tanker aircraft, many of which \nare based in Spokane, WA's Fairchild Air Force Base. And almost all air \nmissions will be dependent upon the critical support of EA-6 radar \njammers and P-3 aircraft, many of which are based in Naval Air Station \nWhidbey Island in Oak Harbor, WA.\n  In the ground operations, troops from Fort Lewis, near Tacoma, WA, \nwill be providing critical infantry support. And cargo planes from \nMcChord Air Force Base, also near Tacoma, have and will continue to be \ncrucial in providing transportation support.\n  We also recognize the important sacrifices being made by the National \nGuard and reserve units in our State that have been activated, leaving \njobs and livelihoods behind to serve the call to duty.\n  And let us not forget the parents, wives, husbands, friends and \nchildren of the men and women of our armed forces, whose support--in \nthe face of fear and anxiety--is admirable and inspirational.\n  We are enormously proud of our fellow Washingtonians that are serving \nthe Nation. Along with men and women from all 50 States serving in the \nmilitary, these brave and courageous Americans have volunteered to put \ntheir lives on the line to defend the security of our country and the \nstability of our world.\n  Our prayers are with them, and we look forward to their speedy \nsuccess and return home.\n  I have tremendous confidence in the men and women of our armed \nservices to bring this conflict to a successful conclusion.\n  Yet, this support for the effort is accompanied by a deep sense of \nanxiety and concern.\n  Nobody wants war.\n  The death, destruction and misery of war are things that we should \nnever ignore and we cannot forget. When our troops are called to defend \nour Nation and international peace, we do so with a heavy heart but \nstrong confidence that we will prevail.\n  In reaching our objective of disarmament, we must not forget the \nplight of the Iraqi people.\n  Iraqi civilians have been victims of a brutal, harsh and inhumane \ndictator that has not only stripped away political liberty and free \nexpression, but has combined the tactics of torture, deprivation and \nmurder to maintain his terrible regime.\n  We must soberly recognize that the Iraqi people will be innocent \nvictims of this conflict, and we must remain dedicated to doing \neverything in our power to ensure their safety and, ultimately, \nliberation.\n  Importantly, this dedication must extend beyond military success. We, \nin this Chamber, must recognize that the prospect of creating a stable, \npost-Saddam Iraq will be a huge, expensive and politically volatile \nendeavor.\n  This will not be easy, especially given the historic rivalries among \nIraq's Kurdish, Shiite and Sunni population.\n  However, whatever the costs and whatever the commitment, we owe it to \nourselves and the world to ensure that the liberation of Iraq our \ntroops are fighting for is not wasted away by a failed post-war \nstrategy.\n  Our troops are answering the call of duty.\n  As our hearts go out to their families and loved ones, we are a \nNation that is profoundly grateful for their courage, dedication and \nsense of mission.\n  We know that our troops will meet the challenge that they have been \ngiven.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I rise in support of S. Res. 95, which commends our \nArmed Forces.\n  The war with Iraq is underway. I regret that diplomatic efforts to \ndisarm Saddam Hussein have failed. I regret that diplomatic efforts to \nbuild a broader coalition of nations willing to join us in military \naction have also fallen short.\n  But the task force before us now is to pledge our unqualified support \nfor our courageous young men and women on the battlefield; to do \nwhatever is needed to ensure they have every advantage now that the \nfighting has commended.\n  I was in the Army during World War II and served in Europe. As a \nveteran, I know how important it is for our Air Force personnel; and \nour soldiers and sailors to know that we feel close to them and they \nare constantly in our thoughts.\n  Winston Churchill said: ``We shall not escape our dangers by \nrecoiling from them.'' So we send our young men and women in uniform--\neach one a volunteer--to Iraq and to other distant places such as \nAfghanistan.\n  They fight to protect us, and they fight to free other people they \ndon't know from cruelty and savage oppression.\n  Our troops are the best trained and best equipped in history. We have \nno doubt that they will prevail in their mission to oust Iraq's brutal \ndictator, eliminate Iraq's dangerous arsenal, and make the world a \nsafer place.\n  War may be necessary, and war may be right. But it is never good. So \nwe hope that this campaign to rid the world of Saddam Hussein and his \nmurderous cohorts will be quick and decisive. We hope that there will \nbe little collateral damage and as few casualties as possible, both \namong our troops and\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\namong innocent Iraqi noncombatants. We hope that our brave young men \nand women in uniform will return home to their families safely, and as \nsoon as possible.\n  Once we win the war in Iraq, we will have to secure the peace. That \nwill be the best way we can honor our troops.\n  Even as we engage in the fighting today, we have to start planning \nfor what comes tomorrow. That will require a steadfastness of purpose \nequal to what our troops are displaying as we speak. The task will not \nbe easy. All people, all nations have the same tendency: we judge \nourselves by our intentions; we judge others by their actions. We know \nthat our intentions are noble; many others, however--including some of \nour long-standing allies--only see our actions and they condemn them. \nIt is imperative that once the shooting stops, we do whatever is \nnecessary to build a free, open, and democratic Iraq at peace with \nitself, its neighbors, and the world.\n  So, no matter the length of the battle, no matter how demanding the \nwar, we face some years of concerted effort after the guns have fallen \nsilent. We have to be prepared to lead the world in peace with the same \nvigor and purpose as our troops are currently demonstrating. I'm \ncertain America is up to the task and we will prove to the world that \nour intentions are honorable.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last night, President Bush ordered \nAmerica's military to disarm Saddam Hussein, eliminate his weapons of \nmass destination, and liberate the oppressed people of Iraq. The \nAmerican people stand united behind the Commander-in-Chief and the men \nand women who defend our Nation.\n  For 12 years, the United States and a broad coalition of nations \nexhausted diplomatic means to contain and undermine Saddam Hussein's \ndangerous and tyrannical regime in order to end the threat posed by his \npursuit of weapons of mass destruction. For 12 years, patient diplomacy \nyielded only persistent Iraqi intransigence and disobedience of \ninternational law. For 12 years, Saddam Hussein flagrantly violated \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolutions, making a mockery of that \nbody by feverishly continuing his pursuit of chemical, biological, and \nnuclear weapons.\n  We have made every effort to avoid war, but diplomacy has finally run \nits course. Those who suggest that the United States is to balance for \nthe failure of diplomatic efforts to disarm Hussein could not be \nfurther from the truth. The responsibility for this war rests squarely \non the shoulders of Saddam Hussein, a ruthless tyrant whose disregard \nfor the edicts of the United Nations is matched only by his disregard \nfor the lives and interests of his own people.\n  It is clear that Saddam Hussein does not understand the language of \ndiplomacy, but only the language of military force. What the United \nNations failed to accomplish with 12 years of toothless diplomacy, the \nUnited States and a broad coalition of allied nations must now \naccomplish with just application of military force. On Monday, \nPresident Bush noted succinctly: ``The United Nations Security Council \nhas not lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to ours.''\n  Truly, we must not let the world's most dangerous dictators acquire \nthe world's most dangerous weapons. Unless tyrants like Hussein are \ndisarmed, deterred, or destroyed, the use of weapons of mass murder \nagainst the United States and our allies is not a question of if, but \nof when. As President Bush said to the Nation last night, ``We will \nmeet that threat now with our Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and \nMarines, so that we do not have to meet it later with armies of \nfirefighters and police and doctors on the streets of our cities.''\n  From Afghanistan and Albania to the United Kingdom and Uzbekistan, \ngovernments throughout the world have publicly committed to providing \nsubstantive support, military and otherwise, to our efforts to disarm \nHussein by force. Many other nations have quietly offered material \nsupport for our efforts to liberate the oppressed people of Iraq. \nIndeed, this multilateral coalition is larger than that formed in \nsupport of Operation Desert Storm during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The \nmembers of this broad coalition, many of which have suffered under \noppressive authorization rule in the past, understand the danger of \nliving at the mercy of tyrannical regimes that threaten peace and \nstability with weapons of mass murder.\n  Like all Americans, I hope and pray for the safety of our troops who \nfight so that we may remain free. I am proud to represent tens of \nthousands of Kentuckians who will participate in military operations \noverseas, as well as the thousands of Kentuckians in the National Guard \nand Reserves who have been activated to play critical roles in \ndefending our homeland. My thoughts and prayers are with them and their \nfamilies. These Kentuckians, led by the 101st Airborne, Air Assault, \ndivision based at Fort Campbell, KY, will defend our freedom and \nsecurity with honor and dignity.\n  Just as our ongoing operations in the war against terrorism will \nrequire patience and perseverance, so too will this effort to liberate \nthe Iraqi people. But we are resolved as a nation to carry out our \nmission in support of peace, stability, and freedom. We are certain \nthat our cause is just, and necessary. As our military fights to \nprotect America, to disarm Hussein, and to provide security in an \nunstable region, the liberation of the people of Iraq draws near. \nUnique in its place in the world, the United States does not fight wars \nof empire and expansionism. Rather, we fight for the protection of our \nliberty, and for the liberty of others. And just as in France in 1944, \nor Afghanistan in 2001, long-oppressed civilians--who have suffered \nunder the brutal reign of Saddam Hussein--will soon experience the \nbenevolence of the American people and their own inalienable right to \nlive in freedom.\n  I am grateful for President Bush's steady leadership as Commander-in-\nChief, and I have no doubt that our military men and women are the \nfinest in the world and will defend our Nation with skill, precision, \ncourage, and honor. May God bless America. And may He bless our \nsoldiers in harm's way.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as our Nation is engaged in \nconfrontation with Saddam Hussein and his Iraqi-regime, I join with my \ncolleagues in offering my gratitude and support for our troops, both \nhere and overseas.\n  None of us desire the use of force. Yet, as history has repeatedly \ntaught us, the failure to confront a menacing tyranny today can lead to \nfar greater devastation tomorrow. Had British Prime Minister Neville \nChamberlain stood fast against Nazi Germany's 1938 demand to dismember \nCzechoslovakia in exchange for ``peace in our time,'' the lives of 50 \nmillion people could have been saved.\n  I salute the brave men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces who are \nwilling to place their lives on the line to protect our freedoms. My \nthoughts and prayers are with the friends and families who remain \nbehind, praying their loves ones not be harmed.\n  The dangers facing our troops are many. Will the Iraqi army quickly \nsurrender? Will chemical and biological weapons be used? How long will \nthis military campaign take? In addition, our service members must \ncontend with the scorching heat of the desert; the blinding conditions \nof sand storms; and the logistical nightmares of crossing the Tigris \nand Euphrates Rivers.\n  We can feel better knowing our troops are prepared for all \ncontingencies and have been trained to meet whatever challenges Saddam \nand his regime may throw their way.\n  Our troops hail from all fifty States; our territories and insular \npossessions. Every Member of Congress is impacted.\n  During the first Gulf War in 1991, one Alaskan was killed: Sergeant \nDavid Douthit, a 24-year-old from Soldotna. Alaskans are currently \nparticipating in Northern and Southern Watch, enforcing the no-fly \nzones in Iraq. They are in Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom. \nThey are in South Korea participating in the annual Foal Eagle military \nexercises.\n  Unit 210 of the Kulis Air National Guard in Alaska has been activated \nand is awaiting deployment to the Middle East as part of an elite \nrescue squad. This is a group of everyday Americans--bankers, \neconomists, and teachers--who are serving their Nation at a time of \nwar. May no harm come to them.\n  There is on question that Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator. He has\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\nkilled thousands of his own people. He has used chemical weapons \nagainst the Kurdish population. He imprisons and tortures political \nopponents and subjects Iraqi citizens to beatings, starvation, \nmutilation and rape.\n  As the President put it when declaring the 4-hour deadline, the day \nof liberation for the Iraqi people is near.\n  American troops are in Iraq to secure our Nation from the threat \nposed by Saddam Hussein. He repeatedly failed to disarm and chose to \nignore his obligations to the international community. The time has \ncome for him to leave.\n  An enormous burden is now placed on the shoulders of our Armed \nForces. Together, with allies from over 40 member nations who are \nsupporting this effort, we seek to eliminate the weapons and facilities \nthat Saddam should have destroyed 12 years ago. Now, we will finally \nensure that the United States and our allies do not face the threat of \nchemical, biological or nuclear attack from those who would seek to \nharm us.\n  Like so many who came before them, these brave men and women are \nplacing their lives on the line to secure our freedom and protect our \nideals and liberties. They have my undying thanks and support.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 95. As the \nUnited States and her allies begin the campaign to defend the world \nagainst the tyrannical rule of Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein, we must \nall rally behind our Commander in Chief and Old Glory.\n  The military action underway in Iraq is both just and lawful. We must \nrise and stand for humanity and help liberate the Iraqi people. After \nmonths of deception and noncompliance from the Iraqi regime about their \nweapons of mass destruction, the United States and over 30 allies \ndecided to take military action to enforce United Nations resolution \n1441 and disarm Saddam. Along with an overwhelming bipartisan majority \nof my colleagues in the Senate, I voted in favor of authorizing this \nuse of force last fall.\n  The brave men and women of our Armed Forces come from all across our \ngreat Nation, but I wish to specifically recognize the vital role that \nKentucky is playing in this noble effort to disarm Saddam. I am \nconfident that the 101st Airborne Screaming Eagles, 5th Special Forces \nGroup, and 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment will continue to \nmake Fort Campbell, KY, and our great Nation proud.\n  Thousands of our soldiers now in the Middle East completed vital and \ncomprehensive training at Fort Knox. Fort Knox is the Home of Mounted \nWarfare where tank training is performed and perfected. These soldiers \nwho trained at Fort Knox in mostly Abrams tanks are now on the front \nlines against the Iraqi Republican Guard. I guarantee our tank soldiers \nwill prevail.\n  Also, our men and women at the Bluegrass Army Depot in Richmond, KY, \ncontinue to make sure that our troops have the munitions they need to \ndefeat the enemy. Thousands of enlisted and reserve troops from \nKentucky have answered their Nation's call to duty. From the Bluegrass \nArmy Depot, they load munitions onto trains which end up in guns and \nthe weapons systems of our ground forces and air power. They are \nhelping freedom ring throughout the world.\n  It is also important to thank our civilian workforce on our military \nbases and those who indirectly support the military and war effort. \nThey play a key role in ensuring our installations are maintained and \nour soldiers are housed and fed and given the support they need to \nsecure our freedoms. Their work and contribution must not be \noverlooked.\n  This resolution reinforces that now is the time for America to be \nunited and show our unconditional support for our troops and their \nmission. Freedom and democracy do not come easy and our soldiers are \nwilling to sacrifice even their own lives to ensure that future \ngenerations will have the opportunity to embrace such concepts as \nliberty and human rights and lead the world to more peaceful and secure \ndays.\n  We all hope and pray our troops come back safely and quickly after \nsuccessfully disarming Saddam's brutal regime and liberating the Iraqi \npeople. The cause of our military and allies is noble and just. Our \nthoughts and prayers are also with the family and loved ones of our \nsoldiers. God bless them all.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, yesterday our mission to disarm the Iraqi \nregime began. It is my hope that our actions will deliver the people of \nIraq from a brutal dictator and help bring peace and stability to a \nvolatile region.\n  Our commanders in the field have developed an operations plan that \nwill maximize the power of our forces, and I have no doubts about their \ncapabilities to successfully achieve their military objectives.\n  I commend the President for promptly addressing the Nation last \nnight. It is important that he continues to keep Congress and the \npublic informed of our military actions and the status of our mission. \nAnd I agree with his assessment that we should not view this war in \nterms of timetables. To speculate at this point would be \ncounterproductive. Rather, we should view this conflict in terms of \nmeeting our strategic and tactical goals.\n  As a Senator and member of the Armed Services Committee, I stand \nready to work with my colleagues and the President to provide any and \nall support possible to ensure the success of our military forces \nconducting these operations.\n  Our Nation is a nation of diverse views, ideologies, and opinions. We \nmight not all agree on how or why we arrived at this point; \nnonetheless, we must come together as a country and support those \nservice men and women who are currently risking life and limb.\n  As we stand here today, over 300,000 United States military \npersonnel, including a number of Arkansans, are forward deployed in \nIraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Turkey, and the waters and skies all around \nthe world and at bases around the country. They put themselves in \nharm's way not for personal aggrandizement or advancement, but for \nimmense love of country, liberty, and family. If they can hear me \ntoday, I say be assured, for the American people are behind you.\n  When appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee a few weeks \nago, GEN John Keane, Vice Chief of Staff for the U.S. Army, testified \nto the courage of our military personnel. He said when asked what their \ngreatest challenge was, his division commanders replied ``keeping our \nsoldiers from being too brave.'' We owe these men and women overseas \nand at home not only our gratitude, but also our very existence as the \nonly country on Earth committed to promoting and spreading the ideals \nof democracy. Our military has kept us safe for over 200 years. We \ncannot thank them enough.\n  Just as we should thank our military overseas and at home, we should \nthank our first responders that protect our hometowns. Firefighters, \npolice, and health care personnel risk their lives and sacrifice \nprecious time with their families every day to keep us safe from those \nwho would try to do us harm. Their commitment and contributions to \nnational security and homeland security should not be forgotten.\n  Mr. President, I urge all Americans to pray for our troops, their \nfamilies, and our President as we defend our Nation and the world from \nthose that seek to do us harm.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last October, I voted against the \nresolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq and believe it was \nright that, in recent months, the country debated the wisdom of using \nmilitary action against Iraq at this time. But the commencement of \nmilitary action unites us as we focus on our ongoing support for our \ntroops. I am confident in their abilities and I hope for their safe and \nquick return to their families. Even more so now that this action has \nbegun, my thoughts, and the thoughts of all Americans, are with our \nservice men and women, and with their families.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is taking this opportunity to formally \ngo on record in support of our brave men and women in uniform with this \nresolution.\n  The dedicated men and women of our military spend time away from \ntheir homes and families in different parts of the country and the \nworld, and, too often, are placed into harm's way in order to protect \nthe American people and our way of life. We owe them a huge debt of \ngratitude for their selfless service.\n  The war in Iraq and the fight against terrorism are turning upside \ndown the lives of tens of thousands of Active Duty, National Guard, and \nReserve personnel and their families. These men and women seek to do \ntheir duty to our\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\ncountry and honor commitments to their families, and, in the case of \nthe National Guard and Reserves, to their employers. As of March 19, \nmore than 212,000 National Guard and Reserve personnel were on Active \nDuty.\n  Some Wisconsinites are facing the latest in a series of multiple \nactivations and deployments for family members. Others are seeing their \nloved ones off on their first deployment. All of these families share \nin the worry and concern about what awaits their relatives and hope, as \nwe do, for their swift and safe return.\n  We owe it to our military personnel and their families to do \neverything that we can to support them in this difficult time. I will \ncontinue to work to ensure that our troops and their families have the \nresources that they need, both to combat our adversaries and to provide \nfor their families, during this tumultuous time and when they return \nhome.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong and \nunconditional support for our troops currently engaged in disarming \nIraq. As the war continues to progress, I have every confidence in \ntheir capabilities, their courage, and their patriotism. I am pleased \nto support the resolution before us, and believe it will send a message \nto all the world that the Congress is united in support of our young \nmen and women in the Gulf.\n  On many occasions in recent months, this institution has debated the \nthreat posed by Saddam Hussein and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. \nIndividual Senators have made honest arguments expressing widely \ndiffering points of view on this issue. Now that our troops are engaged \nagainst the forces of Saddam Hussein, however, we must speak with one \nvoice.\n  It is my hope and expectation that this war will be short, and that \nour victory will be decisive. Our military is the best-equipped and \nbest-trained force that the world has ever seen. As Maine's \nrepresentative on the Senate Armed Services Committee, it has been my \nprivilege to work side-by-side with military leaders to ensure that \nthis is the case. If there is any message we could send to members of \nthe Iraqi military, it would be to express the futility of resistance. \nThe President has been clear, that we come not as conquerors, but as \nliberators. Our military superiority is overwhelming, and our forces \nwill not stop until Iraq is disarmed.\n  Of course, there is very little certainty in combat. In the fog of \nwar, there are innumerable factors that might affect the course of \nbattle. Our leadership has worked to anticipate and prepare for \nwhatever eventualities might develop. I suspect in the coming days we \nwill be receiving conflicting reports, confusing media accounts, and \ndistorted descriptions of the battlefield. However, one thing should be \nunmistakable . . . our troops will receive whatever support they need \nto bring this conflict to a rapid and successful end.\n  We also need to send a message to other forces in this world that \nseek to do us harm. They might believe that, because so many of our \nforces are engaged in the Middle East, we have left ourselves \nvulnerable. The administration has moved the Homeland Security Advisory \nto Orange, indicating that we are at high risk of terrorist attack. \nGordon England, the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, has assured \nme that our Nation is taking almost unprecedented steps to protect our \ncritical infrastructure, to identify potential terrorist threats, and \nto secure potential targets. Certainly, we do have some difficult days \nahead.\n  However, we are working to deter, detect, and, if necessary, respond \ndecisively to any terrorist attack.\n  I also want to say a word to the families of those men and women \ncurrently in harm's way in the Middle East. They truly carry a heavy \nburden, and I want to express my personal and heartfelt appreciation \nfor the sacrifices that they make. No war comes without cost. While our \nmilitary leaders will do everything they can to minimize the danger our \ntroops will face, there is still much risk and danger. To the wives, \nhusbands, children, and parents of troops, I thank you for your bravery \nand your strength. You and your loved ones deserve our admiration, our \nrespect, and our appreciation.\n  When I came to the Senate over 6 years ago, I could not have imagined \nthis moment. We lived in a different world then. In the coming months, \nwe will debate how we came to this conflict, and how we need to \nproceed. Historians will study this period in our history every \nclosely. There will be time to place this war in its proper context. \nToday, however, as our troops stand in harm's way, I only want to show \nmy unwavering support for our troops, thank them for their service, and \nexpress my hope for their safe return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, may I inquire of the Presiding \nOfficer the amount of time in control of the Senator from Virginia and \nthe amount of time in control of the Senator from Michigan?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 9 minutes 13 \nseconds. The Senator from Michigan has 18 minutes 1 second.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Levin and I have now sought to advise our \nleadership on the ever-growing number of Senators anxious to speak. \nThey, I presume, will consider how we will add more time to this debate \nnow or during another period. I wish to put Senators on notice that we \nhave the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, awaiting recognition, \nfollowed by the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard, and then the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  I am going to do the very best I can to get the time to accommodate \nthese Senators, and I see other Senators present on my side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  I thank my friend for working to accommodate as many Senators who \nwould like to speak. I do not think it is necessary for us to make long \nspeeches--3, 4, 5 minutes--but I do believe it is very important and we \nhave a responsibility to do so. To the extent the Senator from Virginia \nand the Senator from Michigan can work together to add some time, it \nwould be most appreciated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Virginia--has the Senator been \nyielded to already?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Texas is to be recognized next.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Texas yield for an inquiry?\n  Mr. WARNER. I have to ask it be on your time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On my time. I have the following Senators on our side who \nare here and indicated they wish to speak: Senator Dorgan, Senator \nDayton, Senator Reed who is in the cloakroom, Senator Boxer, Senator \nBaucus, Senator Byrd. So there is no way we are going to be able to \ncomplete even the people who are here, much less additional people who \nwish to speak and who come to the floor, and still have a vote on this \nresolution immediately after the three votes that are currently \nscheduled.\n  So I join my good friend from Virginia in asking the leadership as to \nhow they wish us to address this problem at this time.\n  I have 19 minutes left before 4 o'clock--how many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Seventeen minutes. If I talk longer, it will be 16 \nminutes. I have 17 minutes before the first vote begins, but there is \nno time set on the resolution itself we are debating; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the leadership can give us guidance in how they want to \nhandle this.\n  Mr. WARNER. I join in that request. I also have Senator Coleman, \nSenator Hatch, the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from North \nCarolina, and the number is growing.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would it be possible to move the 4 o'clock vote, say, to \n4:30 in order to get these speeches ahead of the vote? It could be \nincluded in the series of votes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to our distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia, both Senator Levin and I have put that to our respective \nleadership.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this resolution we are talking about \ntoday is for those brave men and women who are in harms way as we \nspeak, close to midnight their time, far across the oceans. America's \nthoughts and prayers are with each and every one of them--Active Duty, \nReserve, Guard, Americans, and our loyal allies.\n  September 11, 2001, was a brutal wake-up call for our Nation, one \nthat our President refuses to ignore. By disarming and liberating Iraq, \nthese troops are working to prevent a 9/11 with a weapon of mass \ndestruction. Today we are entering a new phase in the campaign to root \nout terrorism wherever it is bred.\n  How did we get to this point? In 1993, terrorists bombed the World \nTrade Center, killing 6 people, wounding more than 1,000.\n  In 1996, terrorists bombed the U.S. military living quarters at \nKhobar Towers, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 brave Americans and wounding \nscores more.\n  In 1998, followers of Osama bin Laden attacked U.S. embassies in \nKenya and Tanzania, killing and wounding hundreds.\n  In 2000, bin Laden followers attacked the USS Cole in a harbor in \nYemen, killing 17 sailors and wounding 39 more.\n  But sadly, it took 4 hijacked airplanes being turned into weapons of \nmass destruction and the loss of nearly 3,000 lives for us to respond, \nand this time the terrorists and those who harbor them will know the \nUnited States of America is resolved to preserve our freedom.\n  Our President will not waiver. Congress will not waiver in our \nsupport of our President and our troops.\n  There are those in this world who hate America and what it stands \nfor. They despise our love for freedom, our passion for democracy, and \nour tolerance of other religions and beliefs. Their hatred led them to \nrecklessly kill thousands of innocent civilians in our country and \nabroad.\n  September 11 brought a sea change in our national security strategy. \nWe now know that deterrence alone is not enough. Our new strategy in \nthis new kind of war articulates a policy of preemption. It is when we \nfail to act or fail to lead that our enemies strike.\n  The President has said we will not give Saddam Hussein the \nopportunity to attack. The Iraqi dictator seeks to make weapons of mass \ndestruction, and those weapons would find their way into the hands of \nterrorists. So coalition forces from our allied nations are on the \nground with us in Iraq, and we commend them for their bravery and their \nunwavering loyalty to our Nation and their pursuit of freedom.\n  For 12 long years, Saddam Hussein has treated the world with lies and \ncontempt. Diplomacy, sanctions, and 17 U.N. resolutions failed to do \nthe job. His brutal campaign for decades against his neighbors, his own \npeople, and the world is coming to an end as we speak because brave men \nand women are doing the job for us.\n  The men and women on the front lines in Iraq, the anxious families \nwaiting back home, and the thousands of National Guard and Reserve \nforces who have been called to duty must count on the American public \nto stand by their side until the very end. We will not fail them.\n  In Congress, we must ensure our Armed Forces have every resource \nnecessary for a swift and successful campaign. We will not fail to \nprovide. It is our duty, as the beacon of freedom for the world, to \nensure that Saddam Hussein's brutal reign comes to an end. This is our \ntribute to those in the past who fought for the liberty we enjoy, and \nit is our commitment to pass the torch of freedom to future \ngenerations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I anticipate that we will soon have a \nunanimous consent request about timing, but until that is finished \nmight I suggest that the Senator from Michigan recognize another of his \nspeakers.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could just interject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Perhaps I can at least describe what we are anticipating \nas the unanimous consent request. I think we are about ready to \npropound it. There have been a number of Senators who have indicated to \nthe two managers that they wish to address the resolution. We are \nprepared to accommodate all of those requests. We would then ask for \nunanimous consent that the votes that are currently scheduled for 4 be \nmoved back to 5 to accommodate the additional time allocated for \ndiscussion of the resolution. At that point, we would then vote on the \namendments, in addition to the resolution.\n  Following those votes, we would still allow Senators to speak, either \nto the resolution in support of the troops or to the resolution \nrelating to the budget in both amendment as well as in general comment, \nso that throughout the evening Senators could still be accommodated to \nspeak to the resolutions, either one.\n  I hope that we could entertain a unanimous consent request that all \nthose speeches which are made on the resolution in support of the \ntroops appear in the Record prior to the vote so that the Record will \nread appropriately. That would be our intent, and I would hope that all \nSenators would be prepared to accommodate that request.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have before me a proposed unanimous \nconsent request. I will now make that request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the adoption of this \nresolution occur at the hour of 5 today; provided further that debate \nbetween 4 and 5 be equally divided as provided earlier. Further, I ask \nthat the previously scheduled stacked votes occur beginning immediately \nfollowing the vote on the adoption of this resolution, S. Con. Res. 26, \nwith no amendments in order to the resolution or preamble.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe votes Senators be recognized for purposes of making additional \nstatements; that the time throughout the evening be equally divided and \nthat their speeches appear in the Record prior to the vote cast on the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I will recommend that the \ndistinguished Democratic leader's unanimous consent be accepted, but I \nwould like to speak with my leader before agreeing to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to announce that on my side, the \nfollowing Senators have indicated the desire to speak. I will be in the \nChamber to accommodate them as best I can within the 30 minutes that I \nhave remaining: Senators Allard, McCain, Coleman, Hatch, Stevens, Dole, \nDomenici. \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will read the list of Senators on this \nside so that everyone will know who will be speaking before the vote on \nthe resolution under the unanimous consent that was just adopted, and \nthen who would come afterwards with their statements on the resolution \nbeing put in the Record before that: Senator Dorgan would be recognized \nfor 5 minutes, Senator Dayton for 5 minutes, Senator Jack Reed for 5 \nminutes, Senator Boxer for 6 minutes, Senator Baucus for 7 minutes, \nSenator Byrd for 15 minutes. If my math is correct, all of those could \nbe accommodated prior to the vote at 5.\n  I notice the Parliamentarian has been adding up those numbers, and I \nam wondering if my math is correct.\n  After the vote, if my math is correct, Senator Landrieu and Senator \nBiden would then be recognized on this side, and any other Democrats \nwho wish to speak can come after the resolution, after those two \nSenators.\n  Is the Senator correct that all of those I named up to Senator Byrd \ncould be accommodated with the times indicated prior to the vote at 5?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator allocated 43 minutes, which \nappears to fit within the timeframe now allowed.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S4094]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, America makes no more difficult decision \nthan that which asks its sons and daughters to go to war, and those who \nare in harm's way as we speak need to know that our country is united \nin support of them. Our thoughts and prayers go to those soldiers who \nhave answered the call for our country. Our thoughts and prayers go to \ntheir families.\n  In my State, we have two Air Force bases, international guard. We \nhave the highest rate of deployment. Almost 30 percent of all Guard and \nReserves are now deployed in North Dakota under a callup. I am \nenormously proud of what they are contributing to this country and to \nits national defense. They and their families need to understand our \nunited support for them.\n  To the people of Iraq, we need to say that we have no quarrel with \nthe people of Iraq, and we pray also for the safety of those innocent \nnoncombatants inside the country of Iraq.\n  I wish with all my heart that the people of free nations, working \nthrough the United Nations, would have been able to find a diplomatic \nsolution to require the disarmament of Saddam Hussein, but that was not \npossible. So our Nation now will take action to disarm this dictator.\n  In the sometimes lonely and dark hours when America is challenged, I \nthink of the words of Thomas Wolfe in his great novel. He talked about \nthe peculiar quality of the American soul. He said Americans have an \nindestructible belief, a quenchless hope, a boundless optimism, that \nsomething good is sure to happen.\n  Let us hope and pray through this conflict something good will \nhappen. As we do, let us express our profound gratitude for those who \nnurture, protect, and risk their lives for freedom. It will be and \nshould be left to another day to talk about what should have been done \na decade or two ago, what could have been done long ago to avoid this \nintersection of war and strife.\n  The question is, How do we, in the free world, prevent the emergence \nof more dictators, tyrants, and terrorists who threaten America's \nliberty? That is a long and difficult discussion for other days.\n  For today, all of us from every philosophy in every corner of our \ncountry say to those in harm's way and who serve our country: We are \nproud of you; America is united in support of what you are doing.\n  I yield the floor and I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, last night at 10:15 p.m. eastern standard \ntime, President Bush announced to the Nation that the war to rid Iraq \nof weapons of mass destruction had begun. It was a solemn moment that \nreminded us that diplomacy was no longer an option.\n  I recall the President's comments that you cannot have peace when you \nhave to deal with a leader who is not peaceful.\n  It also meant the men and women of our Armed Forces were now going to \nbe committed to battle. The resolution before the Senate commands and \nsupports the efforts and leadership of the President as Commander in \nChief in the conflict against Iraq. The resolution recognizes the \ncontribution of our defense forces and expresses support for the \nthousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen \nwho have been mobilized, deployed, and are now fighting to defend the \nsecurity of our Nation. I strongly support the resolution and believe \nit deserves the Senate's unanimous support.\n  Today our Nation demands much of our military. Our forces continue to \nfight in Afghanistan, assist forces in Yemen, Djibouti, and Georgia, \nand defend our homeland. Now they have taken on a new mission, the \nliberation of Iraq.\n  Despite many hardships, our military members have extended forward \nand embraced our country's call to arms. Over the last month, 5,000 \nsoldiers from Fort Carson, CO, have been sent to confront Iraqi \noppression and terrorism. The soldiers have embraced their duty and are \nnow serving their country with pride and determination. We cannot \nforget the valuable contribution of reservists and National Guardsmen. \nMany of these service men and women have left their careers and their \nfamilies to answer our Nation's call to arms. Over 3,000 Coloradans in \nthe Reserves and National Guard have extended forward and they have \nresponded with determination. They are committed to defending our \nNation and deserve our support. We ought to recognize their employers \nwho have recognized at the workplace that they are dedicated to \nprotecting freedom in America and are making sacrifices while their \nworkforce serves this country overseas.\n  We should not forget the families of our men and women in uniform. \nThey have watched as their loved ones were sent overseas to defend our \ncountry. They made sacrifices and deserve our support as they fight and \nmake sacrifices for freedom.\n  Today our men and women in uniform are in harm's way. They are \nfighting for the safety and security of all Americans. I believe it is \nimperative we express our support for their efforts. I ask for God's \nblessing for America.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Dayton.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Winston Churchill once advised:\n\n       In War: Resolution. In Defeat: Defiance. In Victory: \n     Magnanimity. In Peace: Good Will.\n\n  I add to that, before war, honest debate.\n  That fundamental right of the first amendment to debate, to agree and \ndisagree is the difference between our democracy and Saddam Hussein's \ndictatorship. The measure of our free country is not how well our \ncountry tolerates agreement but, rather, how well they accept \ndisagreement.\n  Now, however, the time for this debate is passed. Our country is at \nwar and our Armed Forces are fighting life-and-death battles against \nIraqi troops. The President has made that momentous decision, and I \nwill support him, his military command, and the brave American troops \nwho are carrying out his orders.\n  In war: Resolution. Let us in the Senate resolve to provide whatever \nis needed to win the war as quickly and decisively as possible and then \nreplenish our military arsenals so we quickly regain our great strength \nto protect and defend our country again.\n  In victory: Magnanimity. There is no question that our Armed Forces \nwill win this war for our country, for the Iraqi people and for, I \npray, the ultimate benefit of the world. I pray the courageous \nAmericans who will win that victory, many of them young men and women \nless than half our age, may return safely home.\n  Let us who are at home now begin the practice of magnanimity, \nmagnanimity toward the people of Iraq who did not take up arms against \nus, magnanimity toward their past suffering and future needs.\n  Occupation is not magnanimous; the Marshall Plan was magnanimous. We \nhave the obligation and the opportunity to be magnanimous and generous \ntoward the people of Iraq and Afghanistan. In doing so, we can showcase \nour way of life, our economic and technical know-how, and our humanity. \nWe should match each year the increase in our military spending with \nthat same increase in an international recovery fund. Both are key to \nour national security.\n  In peace: Good will. Our leaders must become again the lead \npractitioners and worldwide promoters of good will. They can allow \nthemselves no more derisive and destructive reactions to whoever does \nnot see our way, not to the leaders and people of other nations, not to \nthe leaders and representatives of the international organizations, not \nto our fellow American citizens.\n  We must resume our leadership of the world on the path toward \ninternational security, prosperity, peace, and good will. That is our \ngreatest challenge. That must be our ultimate victory.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, this is a profound moment in all our \nlives. Words are inadequate, so I will be brief. It is an honor to \nspeak right after my friend and colleague, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Minnesota, and to join with him in support of our men and \nwomen on the front lines, in support of the President's decision to \ncommence military action to disarm Iraq.\n  In this Chamber it is often said the foreign policy debate ends at \nthe water's edge. This resolution makes clear\n\n[[Page S4095]]\n\nthat debate on the use of force in Iraq ends with the firing of the \nfirst weapon. I support our troops and military families to the utmost, \npraying for their safety, and working with them to achieve the mission \nour Commander in Chief has given them.\n  This situation represents a balance of risks. War is always costly in \nhuman terms on all sides. But the threats of terrorism, mass \ndestruction, are also real. The dangerous nature of the world we now \nlive in was brought home to us by the events of September 11. That \nreality requires us to act decisively when we are threatened, rather \nthan simply to wait and hope for the best. I agree with the President \nthat it is better to send soldiers into battle than to send police, \nambulance drivers, and firefighters to the site of future terrorist \nattacks.\n  My firm belief is that our Nation is blessed with responsible, \nprincipled leadership. Our military is as courageous as it is capable. \nOur goals in this conflict are both clear and just. Now we are \ncommitted and we must carry on our duty to the end.\n  It has been said that courage is fear that has said its prayers. May \nwe all offer our support and praise to our troops, military leaders, \nand our President until the dangerous days are over. Our hearts and \nprayers are with all the women and men in harm's way in the Middle East \ntoday, and with their families.\n  I ran across this quotation from Thomas Paine from his pamphlet \nCommon Sense, written in 1776:\n\n       These are the times that try men's souls. The summer \n     soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink \n     from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, \n     deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like \n     hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation \n     with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the \n     triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it \n     is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven \n     knows how to put a proper price on its goods; and it would be \n     strange indeed if so celestial an article as Freedom should \n     not be highly rated.\n\n  No one wanted this to come to war. But it is here. I am proud to join \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in support of our men and \nwomen, in support of our Commander in Chief, in support of our \nfamilies. Our prayers are with all of them.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, once again, America has placed its fate and \nits future in the hands of young American fighting men and fighting \nwomen. Both our future and our faith could not be in stronger, more \ndecent, and more qualified hands. We are here today, united in our \nsupport for these extraordinary soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and \nCoastguardsmen, all of them superbly trained, faithful to their \nuniforms, and also faithful to those who served before them--an \nunbroken legacy of courage and commitment to this Nation.\n  I take a moment to recognize particularly those many individuals from \nmy State of Rhode Island. First, the thousands who are serving on \nactive duty in units in all of our services, and then, also, our \nNational Guard and Reserve forces, because in this conflict the \nNational Guard and Reserve are playing a critical role. Rhode Island \nhas 648 Guard men and women and Reserve members who are stationed \nthroughout the globe.\n  Many members of the National Guard 143rd Airlift Wing Security Forces \nand Communications have been deployed to Southwest Asia. They have been \njoined by the Air National Guard's 281st Combat Communications Group, \nthe Air National Guard's 282nd Combat Communications Squadron and the \nAir National Guard's 102nd Information Warfare Squadron. The Guard \n143rd Airlift Wing Aerial Port Squadron is in Turkey and members of the \nRhode Island Air National Guard headquarters are in Kyrgzstan and \nTurkey.\n  Rhode Islanders are also protecting the homefront while war is waged \nin the Middle East. The Army National Guard's 1207th Transportation \nCompany is at Fort Dix, New Jersey. The Army National Guard's 118th \nMilitary Police Battalion, 119th Military Police Company, and 115th \nMilitary Police Company are at Fort Drum, New York. And the Marine \nReserves, General Support Motor Transport Company and the Army National \nGuard's 1st Battalion, 103rd Field Artillery Brigade are providing \nsecurity in Rhode Island.\n  All of these men and women have been called to the colors, have \nresponded, and will serve magnificently.\n  The battle has begun. The battle will be pursued vigorously to a \ncomplete victory. I have every confidence in that. Part of my \nconfidence stems from the privilege of having served with the leaders \nof our Army who, today, are commanding the forces that are sent against \nIraq. Both as classmates and contemporaries at West Point, I had the \nprivilege of knowing GEN Chuck Swannack who commands the 82nd; Dave \nPetraeus, the 101st Commander; and also General Hagenbeck, who \ncommanded the 10th so well in Afghanistan.\n  I know because these men are superb professionals, because they are \ncommitted to getting the job done and making sure their soldiers come \nhome. We will be successful.\n  Today, we are united in our support and our admiration for the forces \nwho serve this country so well.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the war to disarm Saddam Hussein and \nliberate the Iraqi people has begun. Many Americans feel we have waited \na long time for this just war to come; many feel we haven't waited long \nenough. But the Iraqi people have waited for far too long, suffered for \nfar too long and the world has for too long failed to come to grips \nwith the consequences of Saddam Hussein's acquisition of an arsenal of \nterror. The wait is over; the liberation of the Iraqi people is \nunderway; and the world is witnessing the end of one of the most \nhorrible regimes in modern history, and with it the end of the threat \nIraq has for too long posed to its people, its neighbors, and the \nworld.\n  There has been no rush to war. That the United States exhausted \ndiplomacy is evident in both the 12-year history of our dealings with \nIraq since the first Gulf War and the 6 month effort at the Security \nCouncil to build consensus on the need to disarm Iraq. There will be \nplenty of time to discuss the American diplomatic campaign that \npreceded the war once military action is over. There is no cause to do \nso today. We stand united in our support for our armed forces and \nconfident in the swift victory that we pray will be theirs.\n  One of America's finest traditions is our ability to draw together in \nsupport of our men and women in uniform when they are actively engaged \nin the defense of our freedom. American forces in the Iraq theater \nfight not for narrow interests or for reasons of national pride. \nAmerican soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are engaged in combat \ntoday so that our people do not live in a world in which tyrants armed \nwith weapons of horror hold free nations hostage, and in doing so \nthreaten freedom itself.\n  Our armed forces fight to disarm and destroy a regime that has proven \nnot only that it will continue to stockpile weapons of mass \ndestruction, but that it will use them. Our military fights to uphold \nthe demands of the United Nations Security Council for Iraq's \ndisarmament, even though some in that body shirk their own obligations \nto hold Iraq to account for its defiance. Our men and women fight so \nthat the Iraqi people no longer live in terror but have cause to \nbelieve, as Americans believe, that liberty's blessings are not the \nprerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable right of all mankind.\n  The liberty we cherish, and in which we want all people to share, has \na price. Young Americans are paying it tonight in Iraq--not out of any \ngrand design for empire, not for oil, not out of dislike for the Iraqi \npeople, but for love--love of America, love for her founding \nprinciples, love for her way of life, and love for the greatness that \nhistory has judged to be hers not because of riches or power, but \nbecause of her abiding commitment to the cause of human freedom.\n  America is great not because of what she has done for herself, but \nbecause of what she has done for others. In another age, we helped \nliberate Europe from Hitler's tyranny, and ended Japanese imperialism \nin Asia. In extraordinary acts of generosity, we helped rebuild Europe \nand Japan and transform\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\nformer enemies into the closest of allies. I believe the liberation of \nIraq will be judged by history to be of similar nobility.\n  Many of us remember parents and grandparents who served in the Second \nWorld War as our ``greatest generation.'' Another generation of heroes \nis being forged from the ruins of the attacks of September 11th. Just \nas Pearl Harbor opened the eyes of America to the grave peril beyond \nher shores, so have the terrorists who attacked us roused in America \nthe conviction that we will never again suffer such infamy.\n  Nearly a century ago, President Woodrow Wilson issued a rousing call \nto make the world safe for democracy. Americans, and the world, did not \nrise to the challenge, and the bloodiest century in the history of \nhumanity ensued. The President has ordered American forces into action \nin Iraq to help make America, and the world, safe from another such \ncentury, when tyrants are empowered by technology to inflict the sort \nof devastation from which free nations might not recover--a capability \nthat puts freedom itself in peril. America, the greatest of free \nnations, will not take that risk.\n  I wish American forces in Iraq every hope for rapid victory. They \nfight for love of freedom--a love which is invincible. The world is \nbetter for their courage and dedication. Victory will be ours--and all \nhonor will be theirs. God bless them and may humanity honor their \nsacrifice.\n  Mr. WARNER. We go to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I address the Senate with regard to \nthe remaining speakers on my side of the aisle to alert them? We have \nnext the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, followed by the Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. Kyl, the Senator from North Carolina, Mrs. Dole, and \nthe Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as military action begins in Iraq, I send \nmy strong support, as a Senator, as a mother, as a grandmother, to our \nsons and daughters who are carrying out the mission asked of them.\n  Military personnel from my State of California are a lead contributor \nin this effort. They include marines from Camp Pendleton and Twentynine \nPalms, carrier groups from San Diego, and Air Force personnel from \nTravis Air Force Base.\n  There are many more soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines from \nthroughout California serving us today, including 6,100 Guard and \nreservists who have recently been activated. Thousands of California \nfamilies are impacted.\n  From my seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have \nfollowed the issue of Iraq very closely. And for the past several \nmonths, my view was that we should build a worldwide coalition to \ndisarm Iraq, a worldwide coalition that would truly be partners in \nname, in action, and in cost-sharing. That is why I was so proud to \nsupport Senator Levin's resolution to authorize force with the backing \nof the United Nations. While this amendment was defeated in the Senate, \nI believe it called attention to the importance of working with a large \ncoalition of allies.\n  As one who has recently voted twice to give a President--a Republican \nPresident and a Democratic President--the right to use force, I believe \nwar should always be the last resort. I voted to give President Bush \nthe authority to go to war against al-Qaida, and for President Clinton \nto use military force against Slobodan Milosevic.\n  In this case, in Iraq, I supported intrusive inspections backed by a \nunited coalition as the best way to achieve Iraqi disarmament. While \nthe U.N. inspectors asked to continue their work, that was not to be. \nSo that debate is behind us. I do want to say, the need to work with \nour allies in postwar Iraq is very important because we want to lift--\nwe want to lift--the physical burden off the shoulders of our men and \nwomen and share that burden. And we want to, of course, try to share \nthe cost burden as well.\n\n  Like all Americans, I hope and I pray that hostilities end soon and \nthat casualties are minimal. And like all Americans, I very much hope \nthat democracy in Iraq will take root. Last night, I saw an interview \nwith a young man who is a soldier in the Army, and he was as eloquent \non this same point as any statement I had ever heard, eloquent in his \nsimplicity, in expressing his hope for this mission.\n  Congress is supporting our troops from the minute they went in. I \nbelieve one way we can demonstrate that is to ensure that the lives of \nboth parents of dual-military families with small children are not \nunnecessarily put at risk. I raised this issue with the Secretary of \nDefense in February, and I am awaiting a response from him. Senator Ben \nNelson is also working on this issue as well as other quality-of-life \nissues for our military. We must be mindful of the impact on a child \nwhen both parents are put in harm's way. I believe we can make sure \nthey are not both placed in harm's way. I will work to make sure of \nthat.\n  I also intend to work to provide additional funding for four \nimportant programs.\n  First, we need to increase funding for impact aid programs to help \nschool districts with military families. Our children of military \nfamilies need attention now. They must have attention now. And we are \nnot fulfilling our responsibility to our military families if those \nchildren do not get help.\n  Gandhi once said: If there is to be peace in the world, it must begin \nwith the children. So we must never, ever forget the children. We have \nheard from many military families struggling to pay for daycare and \nother expenses who have one family member deployed from home. We have \nheard from them that they are having a very hard time.\n  Next, I think we need to help with homeland defense. Clearly, \neveryone has told us--from the CIA to the FBI to Secretary Ridge--that \nthe probability has now greatly increased that we will be facing more \nproblems here at home. That is why I am supporting the Schumer \namendment, when we get back to the budget, to reimburse our States for \nthis burden.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Governor of California, pointing out these incredible \nexpenses the States are having because of firefighters and police and \nemergency workers working overtime.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Governor Gray Davis,\n\n                                                   March 20, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I understand that the United States \n     Senate may take up an amendment tomorrow to the Fiscal Year \n     2004 Budget Resolution to substantially increase funding for \n     state and local first responders. As you are aware, an \n     increase in funding is critical to our efforts to protect \n     Californians and I appreciate your support for these efforts.\n       As Governor, my first job is to provide for the safety of \n     all Californians. Thanks to our first responders, \n     Californians are safer than at any time since September 10, \n     2001. For 18 months, California has been hard at work \n     preparing for all emergency contingencies.\n       As you know, since September 11th, the state has spent \n     hundreds of millions of additional dollars to prepare for and \n     prevent a terrorist attack. Even in the best of times, this \n     is a burden that would require a strong federal partnership; \n     in the face of the fiscal problems that states across the \n     nation now face, that partnership is critical to state and \n     local first responder preparedness.\n       Governors across the nation are extremely disappointed that \n     the dollars for first responder activities we expected this \n     year are not forthcoming. With passage of this homeland \n     security amendment to the Budget Resolution, Congress can \n     ensure that funding for equipment and training for those in \n     the front lines of this battle is robust in the next fiscal \n     year.\n       Governors, Democrats and Republicans alike, have worked \n     hard to protect and safeguard their residents against \n     terrorist attacks--but we need a strong federal partnership \n     to fully realize this goal.\n       Thank you for all your work toward ensuring the safety of \n     all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Gray Davis.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. And last, Mr. President, I hope we will be able to work \non the development of a missile defense system for our airplanes, our \ncommercial airplanes, which are facing the danger of shoulder-fired \nmissiles.\n  Many people throughout California have asked me, what can they do to\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\nsupport our troops? The Department of Defense has provided some \nexcellent ideas that can be accessed on the official DOD Web site, \nDefenseLINK. I think it would be good for those who want to do \nsomething now to get on that Web site. We have a link on our Web site \nas well. The ideas are there on how to send a virtual thank-you card to \nour troops, how to provide them with telephone calling cards. These are \nthings that will make their lives much better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 6 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for 15 seconds, if I might.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 15 additional seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let's do everything we can for our troops \nand everything we can to protect our homeland. And let us all pray for \nour men and women in uniform, and for their families, and for wisdom \nfor all those who send them forward into battle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 2 to 3 minutes to our \ndistinguished colleague from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  I am proud to stand here with this former marine, my great friend \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner, as I recall the phrase, ``From the halls \nof Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.''\n  I believe the President has the authority. We all pledged, ourselves, \nwhen we were sworn into Federal office, to defend this country against \nenemies foreign and domestic.\n  He has taken action--firm action--to protect us against enemies. The \nfreedom of Iraq, the freedom of the people of Iraq, is the goal of this \neffort we are undertaking. But it is being done by free men and women--\nyoung women, young men of this generation. They have talked about our \ngeneration being the Greatest Generation. These young men and women are \nall volunteers. They have gone out there in harm's way to protect us \nand to carry out their pledge to the people of the United States. I \nsupport them for that.\n  I only add one comment. I keep hearing people talk about overtime, \nand getting money to pay people here who are working so long and \nworking overtime in cities and various functions. Those men and women \nover there are not getting paid overtime.\n  I think it is time we started thinking about some voluntarism in the \nUnited States right here at home, volunteers to help this country get \nthrough this period. When our men and women are over there, they are \nvolunteers, they are not getting any extra pay for what they are doing.\n  I think we should recognize the concept that every one of us should \nvolunteer more of our time to help our country in this period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to Senator Baucus.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a minute for \npurposes of recognition of the Senator from Mississippi, who wishes to \nput a statement in the Record?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I call the attention of the Senate to the fact that \nback in my State of Mississippi, our legislature is in session, and our \nState senate has adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 605, under \nthe leadership of our Lieutenant Governor, as presiding officer of that \nbody, Amy Tuck. And the president pro tempore is Travis Little.\n  The operative clauses are:\n\n       That we do hereby declare our complete support for and our \n     great pride in the Armed Forces of the United States, \n     particularly the men and women from the State of Mississippi, \n     both in the Middle East and elsewhere, who are participating \n     in and supporting military operations. . . .\n\n  And it goes on to say:\n\n       That we do hereby express our support of President George \n     W. Bush and the President's cabinet for their courage and \n     decision to remove Saddam Hussein from power.\n\n  There are whereas clauses in another part of that resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire concurrent \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 605\n\n       Whereas, events in Iraq have reached the final days of \n     decision, and at the direction of the President of the United \n     States, the Armed Forces of the United States are poised to \n     launch military operations with our allies against Saddam \n     Hussein and his forces in Iraq; and\n       Whereas, among the forces participating in this \n     mobilization under Operation Enduring Freedom are many \n     members of the regular United States Army, Navy, Marines, Air \n     Force, Coast Guard, Reserves and National Guard who are \n     residents or natives of the State of Mississippi who are \n     being deployed, including 182 female and 2,056 male soldiers \n     in the Mississippi Army and Air National Guard already \n     deployed, with a total number of 3,662 dependents recorded \n     for those deployed; and\n       Whereas, the dictatorship of Iraq has continued to develop \n     weapons of mass destruction in violation of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1441; the dictator, Saddam \n     Hussein, has demonstrated a willingness to use weapons of \n     mass destruction against neighboring nations and the citizens \n     of Iraq. Saddam Hussein threatens the Middle East and the \n     global economy with the threat to use weapons of mass \n     destruction; and\n       Whereas, the United States of America has the sovereign \n     authority to use force in assuring its own national security. \n     Recognizing the threat to our country, the United States \n     Congress voted overwhelmingly last year to support the use of \n     force against Iraq, and that duty falls to President George \n     W. Bush as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces; and\n       Whereas, Mississippians understand the costs of conflict \n     because we have paid them in the past, and we again accept \n     that responsibility. The men and women of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States will be the guardians of civilization as we \n     know it. War has no certainty except the certainty of \n     sacrifice, yet the only way to reduce the harm and duration \n     of war is to apply the full force and might of our military; \n     and\n       Whereas, it is our earnest prayer that the job be done well \n     and swiftly and that the return home to family and friends be \n     safe and soon: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Mississippi, (the \n     House of Representatives concurring therein), That we do \n     hereby declare our complete support for and our great pride \n     in the Armed Forces of the United States, particularly the \n     men and women from the State of Mississippi, both in the \n     Middle East and elsewhere, who are participating in and \n     supporting military operations against Saddam Hussein and his \n     forces in Iraq, and we pray for the quick and successful \n     conclusion of their important mission and for their safe and \n     sound return home; be it further\n       Resolved, That we do hereby express our support of \n     President George W. Bush and the President's cabinet for \n     their courage and decision to remove Saddam Hussein from \n     power; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution be sent to the President of \n     the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security, Major General James H. Lipscomb III-\n     Mississippi National Guard, the Commanding General-American \n     Military Forces-Operation Enduring Freedom and to members of \n     Mississippi's congressional delegation, and be made available \n     to the Capitol Press Corps.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi and \nthe Senator from Montana.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, be \nadded as a cosponsor of the pending resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is a solemn day for our Nation. I rise today to add \nmy voice to the chorus of support and prayers that are being sent from \nthis Chamber to our brave and heroic troops in the deserts of Iraq. The \nmen and women who are serving the country on the front lines are sons \nand daughters, brothers and sisters, and mothers and fathers. Their \nheroic military service is helping bring an end to a brutal regime and \nreducing terrorist threats by stopping those who provide assistance to \nterrorist operations. I know they will be successful in their mission.\n  While many differences of opinion were expressed about the way this \nwar came to be, the time for debate has ended. We now remain steadfast \nin support of our troops. And we must look to tomorrow and the massive \nrebuilding that will be needed following military actions. It is \nimportant that we continue to work with our allies to build a stronger \ncoalition of support. We will need our friends in the coming days and \nweeks.\n  And we must also focus on providing our troops with all the \nassistance and\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\nresources they need. With that in mind, I would like to take a moment \nto urge support of the ``Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003.'' The \nHouse passed this important bill today. And it passed smoothly out of \nthe Finance Committee weeks ago. It very much ties in with the remarks \nof the Senator from Alaska, that our valiant men and women overseas \ndon't get overtime pay. And the very least we can do is voluntary work \nand other ways to help our troops this bill fits into that suggestion.\n  In this time of war, I can think of nothing more appropriate than \npassing a bill that is dedicated to providing assistance to those who \nserve in our armed forces. In addition, our bill encourages more women \nand men across the country to join our armed forces.\n  There are many, many brave men and women from my state of Montana who \nare playing a pivotal role in Iraq. Following the events of September \n11, members of the 120th Fighter Wing of the Montana Air National Guard \nwere called to secure the skies of the no-fly zone over Iraq. Their \nbravery will once again be seen in the current operation.\n  I want to help members of 120th Fighter Wing, and every other member \nof our armed forces. We can do this by passing the Armed Forces Tax \nFairness Act.\n  Let me describe some of the key provisions.\n  Under our current tax code, if a member of the armed forces dies \nwhile on active duty, the federal government pays the surviving spouse \na small death benefit of $6,000. The entire amount should be excluded \nfrom taxable income. However, because of a glitch in the law, only half \nis excluded. Our legislation corrects this by excluding the entire \n$6,000 payment.\n  Just last week, one of our soldiers from Montana, Private First Class \nStryder Stoutenburg, was tragically killed during a Blackhawk \nhelicopter crash. A native of Missoula, Private First Class Stoutenburg \nwas only 18 years old. His mother will receive the death benefit \npayment, but will be taxed on half of it. She has already lost so much. \nIt is unfair to also take away part of the small compensation she is \nreceiving.\n  Another provision of this bill would ensure that military members who \nare frequently required to move from town to town and country to \ncountry, are not punished with capital gains taxes when they sell their \nhomes. Under current law, an individual must live in their house for 2 \nof 5 years in order to qualify for capital gains taxes exclusion. This \nisn't feasible for many in the armed forces and our bill would \neliminate the 2-year requirement.\n  A third provision seeks to take a financial burden off of our men and \nwomen who serve in the National Guard and the Reserves. Many reservists \nmust travel away from home for weekend drills and wind up spending a \nsubstantial amount of money for overnight travel and lodging.\n  In fact, for many of our younger, more junior reservists, the \nexpenses exceed their take home pay for the weekend. Our bill would \nallow them to deduct these expenses from their taxes, even if the \nexpenses do not exceed the 2 percent floor.\n  In addition to providing financial assistance, this bill will not add \nto the deficit since it's completely offset in two ways. First, we \nimprove the collection of unpaid taxes from people who have renounced \ntheir American citizenship in order to avoid future U.S. taxes. Second, \nwe extend certain IRS user fees. These are modest, sensible changes. In \nfact, in the case of expatriates, the offset seems especially timely.\n  There is no better time than today to pass legislation that will \nallow our military personnel to fight for our country, not have to \nfight the tax code. I know that the thoughts of every single Member of \nCongress go out to the troops who are risking their lives. We pray for \ntheir fast and safe return home. I'm hopeful for quick passage of this \nbill that will provide needed tax relief for our troops.\n  I thank Members who contributed to the development of the bill: \nSenators Levin and Warner of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Johnson, Senator Harkin. And especially I thank \nChairman Grassley of the Fiance Committee who I have enjoyed working \nwith and who, once again, in this case has helped us to develop an \nimportant piece of bipartisan tax legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nresolution be considered as a Senate resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I recognize the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico for a period of 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from New Mexico would yield for a request, \nI ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from New Mexico has \ncompleted, Senator Byrd then be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator from Montana if he would place the \nSenator from New Mexico's name on the various military and veterans \nbills.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I make that request.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today is a day, as I see it, to be \nthankful, to have hope, and to pray. I stand before the Senate thankful \nfor our freedom and for the thousands of American young men and women, \nhusbands and wives, sons and daughters, who are volunteers in the U.S. \nmilitary, especially for those who are serving in combat in Iraq. I \nthank each of them for their service and for volunteering to protect us \nand to protect freedom in faraway lands.\n  I think it is also important to thank their parents, their \ngrandparents, and their spouses for their sacrifice as they wait for \ntheir loved ones who are overseas giving of themselves to save the \nworld from a tyrant in possession of weapons of mass destruction. These \nbrave men and women are there to protect us and protect the neighbors \nof Iraq from the scourge of a tyrant who has violated international \nrules and failed to disarm. Our men and women, joined by others from \naround the world, will see to it that he is disarmed. In doing that, \nthey will be doing a very important duty, and they will be giving us \nthe most important gift we can have, to be contributors to freedom in \nthat part of the world and in our own country for the future.\n  Last night, airplanes from Holloman Air Force Base, NM, were the \nplanes that did the initial strikes on Baghdad. They were far away from \ntheir home in Holloman Air Force Base, NM. They are the F-117 stealth \nfighters. They have been joined in that theater of war by men and women \nfrom our two other military bases, the air bases at Cannon and \nKirtland. They are also joined by units of the New Mexico National \nGuard and Reserve.\n  On behalf of all of those military personnel, their relatives and \nfriends, as one of their Senators from New Mexico, I thank them. I \ncongratulate them for their willingness to fight for freedom and for \nthe generosity of being volunteers to keep America safe and free.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Byrd graciously agreed to yield 2 \nof his 15 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota. It will be very \nclear to the body as to why that was such an important and gracious act \non the part of Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin and my colleague, \nSenator Byrd.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the men \nand women serving in our Armed Forces in the war on Iraq. I join with \nmy colleagues in the Senate and with the American people in conveying \nour gratitude to each of them for their willingness to courageously \nserve our Nation.\n  Now that the war has begun, it is time for all Americans to come \ntogether to support our military. While we had hoped a diplomatic \nsolution could be found so that we could avoid the use of force, it now \nappears that military action is imminent. I will do all that I can to \nassure that our troops have the resources they need to complete their \nmission quickly, efficiently, and with as little loss of life as \npossible.\n  Be they active duty or members of the National Guard or Reserves, our \nArmed Forces are the best equipped,\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\nbest trained fighting force in the history of the world. Despite our \npreparedness, this may not be a quick and easy war. The Iraqi Army, if \nit chooses to fight, remains a formidable force. But let there be no \ndoubt that our military will achieve its mission. We will disarm Saddam \nHussein. We will end his brutal dictatorship, and we will liberate the \nIraqi people.\n  We should not forget that we are fighting this war not only to ensure \nthat Saddam Hussein never again is able to use weapons of mass \ndestruction, but also to give the 22 million Iraqi people the chance to \nbuild a democracy and to live in freedom. Our goals are noble, and the \nactions of our military are just.\n  Finally, to the families whose sons and daughters, fathers and \nmothers have been deployed to the Middle East, I want to say that you \nand your loved ones are in our prayers. As a father with a son serving \nas a sergeant in the 101st Airborne, now in the Iraqi theater, I \nunderstand the mix of pride and fear that family members are feeling at \nthis time. I wear my blue star with pride. They should find comfort in \nthe fact that they are not alone; our entire Nation is with them during \nthese difficult moments.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to address \nthe Senate on this timely and important matter and to offer my thanks, \nprayers, and gratitude to our Armed Forces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I can think of no one in this body who is \nmore appropriate to bring this debate to a close, or near to a close, \nthan Senator Johnson of South Dakota whose son is serving with such \nhonor and distinction and who brings such pride to his family. I thank \nthe Senator for sharing with us the emotions I know he feels at this \nvery moment as a father.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I also join my colleague and express \nhow grateful we are he came to the floor with a great sense of emotion \nand humility and, the final sentence with which he concluded, his pride \nin his son. I commend the Senator.\n  I should note that the son of a member of the senior staff of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, COL Chuck Alsup, who is with me in the \nChamber, leaves today as a military man to join the forces in the gulf.\n  We will have the Senator from North Carolina address us for 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I thank the Chair. To date, nearly 40,000 men and women \nfrom North Carolina's military bases have been deployed for duty in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Last month, as a new member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \nvisited three of our military installations in North Carolina. I have \nalways had the greatest respect and admiration for the brave men and \nwomen who dedicate their lives to defending our freedoms. It was \nparticularly important to me to visit our armed forces personnel at \nthis critical moment in our history and to tell them how much I \nappreciate what they do for us, for our country, each and every day.\n  At Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, at Cherry Point Marine Corps Air \nStation, and at Fort Bragg, I was moved by the dedication, the \ncommitment, the patriotism of the members of our armed forces and their \nfamilies. They make me proud and thankful to be an American.\n  In a recent interview, my husband, Bob, was asked about his service \nin World War II--about being part of ``the Greatest Generation.'' He \nresponded that it is the men and women of our military today who are \nthe greatest generation. I agree with him completely. We have the best \nequipped, most capable, most courageous military force in the world.\n  I remember my first day, 12 years ago, as president of the American \nRed Cross, walking into my new office to find a letter from Colin \nPowell, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of the oldest \nRed Cross assistance programs, the Armed Forces Emergency Services, was \nin jeopardy due to a lack of donor interest. I promised Colin Powell \nright then and there that we would do whatever it took to preserve that \nprogram for our men and women in uniform--and we did.\n  Many people do not realize that wherever our military goes, the Red \nCross goes with them to provide support and services, delivering 4,000 \nemergency messages a day to our military men and women. On that first \nday on my job, during the Persian Gulf war, our thoughts and prayers \nwere with the Red Cross and our armed forces.\n  Shortly after the war ended, I traveled to the Persian Gulf to thank \nthe Red Crossers for their work and to deliver humanitarian aid to \nKuwait. Even now, I can clearly recall the horror of Saddam Hussein's \noccupation of that country--oil fields burning, a hospital where scores \nof children had died because doctors and nurses fled the country to \nescape the horrors of Saddam Hussein and his forces. I put a call out, \nright then and there, for doctors and nurses to come to Kuwait through \nRed Cross sponsorship--and about 50 American medical personnel \nresponded immediately.\n  Saddam Hussein is a dangerous man who continues to pose a threat to \nthe region's stability, to his own people, and to the American people \nthrough his sponsorship of terror. Right now, he's passing weapons of \nmass destruction to Iraqi troops--weapons he claimed not to have. He \nwould gladly pass these weapons to terrorists to use against America.\n  President Bush exhausted every option before resorting to military \nforce.\n  It is time to free the people of Iraq from Saddam Hussein's terror, \nto remove his weapons of mass destruction, to help Iraq establish \ndemocracy.\n  I have the highest confidence in our Armed Forces, and I know they \nwill complete the mission they are called to accomplish. As we go \nforward, my thoughts and prayers will constantly be with our Commander \nin Chief, with these men and women and their families, with the Iraqi \npeople, and with all those on the front lines of this war.\n  May God bless them all, and may God bless this great land of the free \nand home of the brave--America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I grant the Senator from Utah 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand here and support our \nyoung men and women in the Middle East and the efforts they are making \nto defend our Nation and, of course, defend against terrorism and to \nend the intolerant behavior and leadership of Saddam Hussein.\n  Last night we began a war that will end Saddam Hussein's threat to \nhis own people, to the Middle East, and to this country. It was a time \nwe chose, and a historic moment for the United States, the Middle East, \nand the world.\n  Today, as we vote in support of S. Res. 95, our prayers go with our \nbrave soldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors. I am proud to say that \nthis includes over 3,000 of my fellow Utahns.\n  Every attempt was made to find a diplomatic way to disarm Iraq, to \nmake Iraq comply with commitments it began to violate shortly after the \nfirst gulf war in 1991. And so, in many ways, the war with Iraq never \nended in 1991. A condition of ending the conflict was full and \ntransparent disarmament, and Saddam Hussein has never--never--complied \nwith that condition. Iraq never complied, over a decade of insistence \nby the international community, over a decade of frustrated inspections \nregimes, over a decade of resolutions by the United Nations, all of \nwhich have been ignored by Iraq. All of them. Throughout this time, the \nUnited States has worked with the United Nations. We supported all 17 \nresolutions. We supported not just what was written, but was intended. \nWe supported not just the words, but the actions they demanded. We \nwanted resolutions with resolve.\n  As I said, I believe this administration made every attempt to find a \nsolution without resorting to force. Every attempt, that is, except a \ncommitment to perpetuating the dangerous belief that force would never \nbe an option. Another nation, France, declared that it would veto any \nresolution requiring the use of force now. That nation did so, arguing \nit rejected the ``logic of war.'' I have read the history of Saddam \nHussein and his dictatorship in Iraq. I have concluded that Saddam \nHussein has never--never-- changed his behavior unless confronted with \nthe threat of force. For France to reject the ``logic of war'' in \ntrying to compel\n\n[[Page S4100]]\n\nSaddam Hussein's disarmament, it was willfully ignoring this \nfundamental fact of Saddam Hussein. France is ignoring history; it is \nignoring logic.\n  President Bush said on Monday night that ``we are now acting because \nthe risks of inaction would be far greater.'' I support the President, \nand I support this rationale.\n  In Saddam Hussein's Iraq, there remain unaccounted vast amounts of \nchemical and biological weapons. This is a fact documented, not by some \nhawks in or out of the U.S. Government but by the international \ncommunity. In Saddam Hussein, there is a long and established history \nof association with, and support for, terrorists. All those within \nreach of a television or newspaper saw, within the past weeks, \nPalestinian terrorist groups doling out Saddam's largesse. Saddam has \ntrained terrorists, funded suicide operations, and allowed members of \nal-Qaida to live in his tightly controlled Iraq.\n  Some opponents of the President's policy have suggested that he \nfailed to make the case that Saddam Hussein caused the attacks on \nSeptember 11. These critics are disingenuous: The administration has \nnever made this claim. It has asserted, and I believe them, that \nelements of al-Qaida have been in Iraq since September 11. As we learn \nmore, I also believe that the history of al-Qaida will reveal a long \nassociation with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, going back years, and being \ndeveloped in Iraq, Sudan and Pakistan.\n  I have said this before. Association is not causation, I know. But \nwhen it comes to regimes hiding weapons of mass destruction and \nharboring terrorist organizations dedicated to our doom, I say this: \nAssociation is reason enough for alarm, reason enough for action. The \nPresident said it clearly last on Monday night:\n\n       Responding to such enemies only after they have struck \n     first is not self-defense, it is suicide.\n\n  I commend his administration for searching for every possible \nsolution short of war. That this was not possible does not mean they \ndid not work earnestly and assiduously to avoid conflict. The effort \ndoes not guarantee the result. It does not guarantee support of the \nU.N. Security Council.\n  On that Security Council, China would rather see a nuclear Korean \npeninsula than a passive U.S. presence in South Korea. I have seen how \nRussia would rather see genocide in the Balkans--and Chechnya--than \nNATO success there. France would rather reject the ``logic of war'' in \nresponding to a dictator who has never been motivated by anything other \nthan the threat of force. These countries have their own self-interest, \nwhether we like it or not. They stand down when outlaw regimes stand \ndefiant with their illicit weapons of mass murder.\n  I thank God for the patience, wisdom and courage of this \nadministration. I believe I join all my colleagues as we offer our \nthoughts and prayers for the members of the American military, their \nfamilies, our allies, and the people of Iraq, who will soon be free of \na despicable, murderous regime that has kept the world fearful for far \ntoo long. And last night, I prayed to God that our mission in Iraq is \nblessed with providence and His protection. To our brave military I \nsay: Godspeed and safe home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, following the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, the Senator from Virginia will recognize Senator Kyl for \n2 minutes and then in rotation the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, \nfor 2 minutes. That results in all the time under my control being \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 13 minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin, for his courtesy, his characteristic accommodative \nspirit. I also thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia for his \ncharacteristic courtesy always. I thank those who have written this \nresolution.\n  Months of uncertainty over the fate of Iraq ended with the first U.S. \nair strikes on Baghdad. Today, regardless of where any of us stand on \nthe decision to go to war, we are all Americans, and our thoughts and \nprayers go out to the men and women of the U.S. military who have been \ncalled to battle in a foreign land.\n  Few doubt the outcome of this war. The fate of Iraq is sealed. The \nUnited States, with its awesome military might, is virtually certain to \nprevail decisively. But the fate of the individual soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who will carry the battle to Iraq \nis far less certain. We pray that every man and woman engaged in the \nwar will return home safely and soon.\n  Our troops will face intense dangers as the mission to unseat Saddam \nHussein proceeds. When our airplanes penetrate the sky above Iraq to \ndeliver computer-guided bombs to their targets, and our ground troops \nbegin their armored charge through the deserts of Iraq, our men and \nwomen in uniform surely know that one unlucky shot could send their \nfamilies into mourning for a fallen patriot.\n  There are unknown perils as well. We do not know if Iraqi civilians \nwill unite to repel a foreign enemy from their homes. We do not know if \nIraq's military will lure us into bloody, house-to-house fighting. We \ndo not know if Saddam Hussein will use chemical or biological weapons \nagainst our forces. I pray that the sons and daughters of the United \nStates will never face these grave risks to their safety.\n  More than 225,000 U.S. troops are now involved. True to its \ntraditions of service to our country, West Virginia continues to have \nthe highest per capita rates of participation in our armed forces. \nThousands of West Virginians are now carrying out missions to defeat \nSaddam Hussein, protect our homeland, and root out terrorists in \nAfghanistan.\n  Thirty-three different units of the National Guard and military \nreserves based in the Mountain State are now activated. The 459th \nEngineer Company, based in Bridgeport, must now be readying to bridge \nthe ancient Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. The 1092nd Engineer Battalion, \nbased in Parkersburg, has been called to duty and might soon join in \nthat effort. The 130th and 167th Airlift Wings are using their cargo \naircraft to move men and materiel to where they are needed. West \nVirginians attached to the 363rd, 157th, and 304th Military Police \nCompanies, out of Grafton, Martinsburg, and Bluefield, stand ready to \nmaintain law and order in places far distant from their homes and \nfamilies. These are but a few of the multitude of tasks now being \ncarried out by West Virginia mountaineers in service to our country.\n  The men and women of these military units, like the rest of our \ntroops, did not join the armed forces to fight Saddam Hussein. They did \nnot ask to be sent to the harsh climes of the Arabian desert. Our \ntroops volunteered to serve our country and uphold our Constitution. \nThey are to be commended for their dedication to our country.\n  I stand foursquare behind our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. \nI urge every American to pray for our troops, and pray that they will \nreturn safely from those faraway sands, to the loving arms of their \nfamilies. I will do everything in my power as a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, and as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee to provide our troops with the funds that are needed to \nensure their safety.\n  I do not agree with every word of this resolution. I have strong \nreservations that the new doctrine of preemption does not meet the test \nof international law. I have strong reservations about the assertion \nthat the Congress has ``fully authorized'' this war against Iraq. I do \nnot believe that Congress can cede its constitutional power to declare \nwar to the President of the United States.\n  I have questions about our long-term strategy for the reconstruction \nof Iraq, the plans to democratize the Middle East, and the application \nof the pre-emptive doctrine that has led the United States to war in \n2003.\n  But I have no question about the ability of our military to deliver a \ncrushing blow to whatever army might stand in their way in Iraq. I have \nno question that our armed forces will carry out their mission with \nhonor and resolve. I have no question that our Nation has the \nobligation to finish the job and destroy whatever chemical, biological, \nand radiological weapons that Saddam Hussein possess.\n\n[[Page S4101]]\n\n  Last night, in his address to the Nation, the President said that \n``our forces will be coming home as soon as their work is done.'' I \nsupport these words by the President, for they speak to the millions of \nAmericans who now wonder when their loved ones might return home. This \nis the ultimate measure of support that our Government can give to our \nmilitary servicemen and women.\n  We do not know how long this war might last, or how long our troops \nmight occupy Iraq after our victory. We should not rule out the \npossibility that Saddam Hussein could flee at anytime during the course \nof the battle, precluding further carnage. In the coming days, the \ntelevision news is sure to show pictures of smart bombs dropping on \ntargets, and perhaps grainy, night-time images of our troops moving to \ntake their objectives. These sanitized images do not reflect the true \ncost of war. They cannot hope to convey the perils that our military \nwill encounter as the war continues. But I hope the words spoken on the \nfloor of the Senate today will convey the deep and abiding support of \nevery Member of this body for the men and women of the United States \nmilitary serving in the Persian Gulf.\n  I close by referring to those words by Longfellow in ``The Building \nof the Ship'':\n\n     Thou, too, sail, on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what forge and what a heat\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n     Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\n     'Tis of the wave and not the rock;\n     'Tis but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with three,--are all with thee!\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, last night leading elements of our coalition \nforces began to rid the land and the people of Iraq of the oppression \nof Saddam Hussein and eliminate the threat he poses to the rest of the \nworld.\n  Throughout our history, our Nation has experienced moments that have \ndefined our spirit, our cause.\n  We really do hold ``these truths to be self evident. * * * That all \nmen are created equal,'' that all ``men are endowed by their Creator \nwith certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, \nand the Pursuit of Happiness.'' This applies to the innocent Iraqis who \nhave been brutalized by a cruel and morally bankrupt regime as much as \nit applies to the citizens of our Nation who deserve to be free of \nSaddam Hussein's threats.\n  In the past, Americans have crossed oceans to free subjugated peoples \nand protect ourselves. On more than one occasion in the past century, \nour friends on the European continent have required our intercession \nand our sacrifice to extricate them from the foul pit of regional war, \nand genocide perpetrated by the evil men of those times.\n  Our experience of war on our own soil also brought with it defining \nmoments. On July 2, 1863, in a field outside of a little town in \nPennsylvania called Gettysburg, a young Colonel named Joshua Lawrence \nChamberlain addressed a group of his men, men of the 20th Maine, who \nwere about to play a pivotal role in the success of the Union forces in \nthat horrible battle. For his part in this battle, he was awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor.\n  Though no exact record of his words exist, the following has been \nattributed to him, and I believe it reflects our motive, our mission, \nand the attitude of our men and women who are now in harm's way. He \nsaid to the assembled group: ``We all volunteered to fight for the \nUnion * * * ours is a different kind of army. * * * If you look back \nthrough history, you will see men fighting for pay, women, some other \nkind of loot * * * they fight for land or power * * * because a king \nleads them or because they like killing. We are here for something \nnew--this has not happened much in the history of the world--We are an \narmy out to set other men free.''\n  To those who do not agree with us right now, to those who believe \nthat the threat posed by Saddam Hussein is not worth the effort or the \ncost required to remove him, I offer the words of one of the great \nphilosophers of liberty. The Englishman John Stuart Mill wrote: ``War \nis an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and \ndegraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing \nis worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is \nwilling to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal \nsafety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless \nmade and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.''\n  Mr. President, I call upon everyone to pray for our troops; to pray \nfor their safety, to pray that the battle will be quick, and that their \nfamilies will see them home again soon. I call upon the country to \npray, too, for the innocent civilians of Iraq and the citizens of \nnearby nations whom Saddam seeks to harm; that all of them as much as \nwe may be protected from his evil designs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support to the resolution \nbefore the Senate.\n  The President has now started an operation that we had all hoped to \navoid. Now that battle has begun, we must win the war and win the \npeace.\n  There has been considerable disagreement leading up to this moment--\nin this chamber, in this country, and throughout the world. Many people \nhave very strong feelings about the military operation in Iraq, and \nthey have expressed those feelings.\n  The debate has been vigorous. But now that American forces are in \ncombat, our soldiers should not doubt our support for them.\n  We stand firmly behind the men and women of our military. They have \nvolunteered to serve their country. We are proud of their service, and \nwe admire their courage. During this difficult time, our thoughts and \nprayers are with them and the families who await their return.\n  My State of Washington is home to thousands of soldiers, sailors and \nairmen. I have had the privilege of meeting many of them--at Fort \nLewis, Fairchild Air Force Base, McChord Air Force base, Whidbey Naval \nAir Station, Everett Naval Station, Bremerton Naval Station, the Bangor \nSub base, and our Coast Guard stations.\n  Some of Washington State's finest are now serving in the Middle East, \nand may be seeing combat. I have no doubt they will distinguish \nthemselves in carrying out their missions.\n  Many of these soldiers have family back in Washington State. \nThroughout my state and across the nation, families are anxious, \nknowing that their loved ones are in military action.\n  We take comfort in knowing that America's soldiers are the best-\ntrained, best-equipped, and most capable fighting force the world has \never known. They will carry out this dangerous mission, and they will \nprevail. We are proud of their dedication and courage, and we all pray \nfor their safe and swift return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, and I understand the Senator desires to speak and will yield \nto the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin for his \nleadership on this resolution and on this issue.\n  Last night, the Liberty Bell of freedom and democracy began to ring \nagain. Last night, the United States of America headed down a path of \nfreeing the people of Iraq from the cruel dictator, Saddam Hussein. I \ndon't know how long President Bush or Prime Minister Blair will be in \noffice, but this has to be the most difficult decision that they have \nmade or will ever make. But I commend them for their courage and their \nleadership. No one wants to see war. But there are times in our \ncountry, in the history of our country, when military conflict is \nnecessary to ensure that America and Americans are safe and secure.\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\n  I am very proud of all the Active Duty, Reserve and Guard personnel \nfrom my State who have been deployed from 8 of the 13 military \ninstallations in Georgia. We wish them Godspeed, a successful and quick \nvictory, and wish that they come home safely, sound and soon.\n  I am privileged to yield the remainder of my time to the only member \nof the Reserve serving in the Senate, my good friend from South \nCarolina, Lindsey Graham.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, there is a better day coming. It is a cloudy day right \nnow. We are worried about our families and our troops, but there is a \nbright day coming. Our American servicemen will give freedom to Iraq, \nmake us more secure. They are a blend of who we are: Rich, poor, black, \nwhite, Jew, Gentile, all mixed up into the American military. The \nstrength of our military is they are an optimistic bunch. They are \nfighting for causes greater than their self-interest. That is why we \nwill win.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 44 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to Senator Landrieu and 1 minute to \nSenator Stabenow.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, less than 24 hours ago, President Bush, \nour Commander in Chief, issued orders to begin military actions to \ndisarm Saddam Hussein and his totalitarian regime. War is never our \nfirst choice, but it is sometimes a necessary last choice. As a mature \ndemocracy, we prefer to settle disputes peacefully and use diplomacy \nwhenever possible. But sometimes, disputes cannot be settled \npeacefully. Force must be used to defend against threats to our freedom \nand liberate an oppressed people. That is what we are doing in Iraq. I \nwant to express my support for our men and women in uniform and this \ncourse of action.\n  I wish to offer my wholehearted and unwavering support for those \nserving in our Armed Forces. The men and women serving our country in \nthe military symbolize the best America has to offer. They are \ndedicated to the defense of our Constitution and willing to make the \nultimate sacrifice, if necessary, to protect the Constitution for every \nAmerican. More importantly, they volunteer to do so. They are well-\ntrained and ready to defend our way of life and improve the lives of \nIraqis. Along with the people of Louisiana, I will be praying for our \ntroops and their families. I wish our men and women safety in their \nmissions and a quick return home.\n  Barksdale--B-52s and A-10s from the 2d Bomb Wing and 917th Air Wing \nare making great contributions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guam. I am so \nproud of Barksdale's leadership, pilots, flight crews, and their \nfamilies.\n  Fort Polk is the premiere light armored training center in the world. \nOur Army will succeed in Iraq because it trained for victory at Fort \nPolk. Currently, 4,000 men and women of the 2d Armored Cavalry are \nworking to liberate Iraq, and I could not be more proud. Their families \nshould also be proud.\n  Louisiana has 14,000 Air and Army National Guardsmen; 2,400 are \ncurrently deployed, and many are in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many \nGuardsmen have been activated three times since September 11. In the \nlast 18 months, they have seen little of their families, but they have \ndone much for their country. These proud warriors have served above and \nbeyond the call of duty.\n  Belle Chasse is the premiere Joint Reserve Base for the Marine \nReserve, Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard. Belle \nChasse has contributed A-10s, Cobras, F-15s, and F-18s; pilots and \ncrews to the war on terrorism. These men and women, too, have been \ncalled up a number of times. They have served valiantly and with \ndistinction.\n  In closing, I want to thank our allies who have joined us to defend \nour shores, bring liberty to the people of Iraq, and root out \nterrorism. British Prime Minister Tony Blair risked his political \ncareer to do what is right for world security. I want to tell him that \nthe American people appreciate his courage. Australia is committing \nforces, and we are grateful. Additionally, Eastern European countries \nlike Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland have been staunch supporters of \ndisarming Saddam Hussein. They have done so because not long ago they \nlived under dictators. They have recently experienced the sweet breaths \nof freedom, and they want the Iraqi people to experience the same. God \nbless our troops.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my esteemed colleague and \nleader, Senator Carl Levin.\n  With the first shots fired last night, I rise today to talk about the \nneed to support our troops now fighting in the gulf, as well as those \non duty around the world.\n  From that freezing winter in Valley Forge to the baking heat and \nswirling dust storms of the gulf today, our men and women in uniform \nhave shown over and over the hardships they are ready to endure in \nservice to their country.\n  They are all in our thoughts and prayers. And we pray this ends \nquickly and with little loss of life.\n  I have met with many of these men and women and their commanders and \nhave been impressed with their professionalism, training, and sense of \nduty and sacrifice.\n  From my home State of Michigan, the men and women of the 127th Air \nNational Guard Wing in Selfridge, the 110th Fighter Wing in Battle \nCreek and the Combat Readiness Training Center in Alpena have been \nmobilized and deployed to bases around the world, including Kuwait, \nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, South West Asia, and Turkey.\n  Army National Guard and Reserve unites from Owosso, Taylor, Grand \nLedge, Grayling, Sault Ste. Marie, Midland, Pontiac, Three Rivers, \nAugusta, Selfridge, and Ypsilanti have all been mobilized and are \nawaiting their deployment orders.\n  Many of these men and women leave families and well-paying jobs \nbehind, creating hardships for themselves and their family just so they \ncan serve their Nation.\n  As the sole remaining superpower, we are asking a tremendous amount \nof our Armed Forces today. When we look around the globe, the numbers \nare staggering.\n  Right now about 225,000 troops are deployed in the Mideast--with more \non the way.\n  But, again, as the sole remaining superpower we still have \nresponsibilities around the globe.\n  We still have 38,000 Active Duty troops in Korea, nearly 40,000 in \nJapan, more than 100,00 permanently stationed in Europe, and about \n50,000 sailors and soldiers afloat on ships in foreign waters.\n  In fact, according to the Department of Defense, the U.S. military is \noperating in more places around the globe than at any time in its \nhistory, including World War II, with a military presence in about 140 \nnations.\n  These men and women in uniform need to know their Nation will do \neverything in its power to give them the support they need to do their \njobs--and also that gratitude for their sacrifice they will have our \nsupport when they come home as well.\n  General George C. Marshall, who oversaw the movement of forces in \nEurope and the Pacific in World War II, knew that the morale of the \ntroops is crucial if the Armed Forces are to be effective. He once \nsaid:\n\n       It is not enough to fight. It is the spirit which we bring \n     to the fight that decides the issue. It is morale that wins \n     victories.\n\n  I agree.\n  And I believe one of the things we must do in this Congress to ensure \nhigh morale among our 2.3 million men and women in uniform, including \nActive, Reserve and Guard units, is to show them we are treating the 25 \nmillion veterans who came before them, including about 875,000 from \nMichigan, with the respect a grateful nation owes them.\n  One thing I would like to see is a change of policy so that our \n600,000 disabled men and women who wore their country's uniform could \ncollect both full pensions and disability benefits.\n  I also want to make sure our veterans have access to the best \npossible health care by fully funding the Veterans Affairs health care \nsystem.\n  If you cared enough to wear the uniform, you should be guaranteed \nhigh-quality, uniform care.\n\n[[Page S4103]]\n\n  We also need to eliminate bottlenecks at the Veterans Administration \nfor veterans who need prescription drugs.\n  Finally, we need to pass legislation creating tax fairness for \nmilitary personnel.\n  We need to send to the President S. 351 that would address long-\noverdue tax reforms for National Guard and Reserve personnel.\n  We also need to remember that in the world after 9-11, our first \nresponders are now also a crucial part of our national security, and \nthey need our full support as well.\n  They were then, and remain now, on the front lines of hometown \ndefense in this new war against terrorism.\n  For the past several months I have been traveling throughout Michigan \nmeeting with the public safety officials who have been given the \nmission of trying to prevent an attack--or be first on the scene to \nsave lives if one occurs.\n  In nine meetings from Michigan's Upper Peninsula to Detroit, I heard \nthe same message over and over:\n\n       Help us get the training, personnel and equipment we need \n     to protect the people we need to protect, and help us meet \n     our obligations in the face of these new threats to our \n     communities.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope we will do just that as soon as possible.\n  This Sunday I will participate in a special ceremony that puts this \nall in perspective for me. This Sunday I meet with an American hero of \nWorld War II to present him a long overdue and richly deserved Bronze \nStar.\n  His name is Sergeant Herbert Munford and his story is inspiring.\n  Sergeant Munford had already earned a Silver Star at the Battle of \nthe Bulge. Of the 385 men in his company when the battle began, only 18 \nwere standing at the end--the rest killed, captured, or wounded.\n  Months later, SGT Munford's platoon was scouting along the Rhine, \nlooking for a place to cross in advance of General George S. Patton's \n3rd Army.\n  A German machine gun nest opened up on the platoon. SGT Munford made \na run for some tall grass, hoping to hide himself while he circled \naround behind the machine gun.\n  He was shot in the hip as he was making his run out in the open. But \nhe still managed to make it into the tall grass, circle behind the \nmachine gun nest and take it out.\n  And what does SGT Munford say today about his heroic act. Well, he \njokes about it. He called being shot in the hip his ``million dollar \nwound.''\n  Why? Well, in his own words SGT Munford says:\n\n       I can't swim. I didn't know how I was going to get across \n     the Rhine in the first place. I was sent back to be treated \n     for my wound and when I got back about two days later, Patton \n     had taken the Rhine and built a bridge so I could just walk \n     across.\n\n  What modesty! And keep in mind, that German bullet is still lodged in \nhis hip today.\n  And his story doesn't end there. SGT Munford went on to win an Oak \nLeaf Cluster for his Bronze Star for bravery under fire in Korea.\n  I tell this story, because I think SGT Munford's story, like the \nstories of so many of our veterans, shows the great patriotic tradition \nof our Nation--a tradition that is on display today in the gulf and \naround the world.\n  And when I meet with SGT Munford on Sunday--and he's standing there \nwith his family and fellow veterans--I want to be able to look each and \nevery one of them in the eye and tell them in this time of conflict \nthis Nation is doing all it can to support our present military \npersonnel serving in the gulf and other duty stations around the globe. \nAnd that we stand behind our veterans of past wars as well.\n  I want them to know that we are committed to the proposition that \nthose who answered the call to duty will never need to call out for \nhelp due to indifference.\n  I want them to know that those who sacrifice for their country will \nreturn to a country ready to sacrifice for them as well.\n  And I want them to know that those who wear the uniform of this \nNation with honor, will themselves be honored long after that uniform \nhas been put away and the guns gone silent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The men and women we have now placed in harm's way are \ncarrying the prayers of every single Member of this body and every \nsingle man, woman, and child in this Nation. They are carrying on in \nthe greatest traditions of the American military. We thank them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this has been a historic debate, fully \nparticipated in by many Senators. I am privileged to be a part of that \ndebate. I again salute the distinguished majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader for drawing up this resolution. The Senate has \nspoken.\n  As we conclude this historic debate, which conclusively states the \nsupport of the Senate behind our President, our men and women in \nuniform and their families, I believe it is appropriate to include as \npart of this record the speech given to the British Parliament on March \n18, 2003 requesting authority to use British forces alongside American \nforces in the liberation of the people of Iraq, by the Prime Minister, \nthe Honorable Tony Blair, whom I and others view as Churchill II. My \ncolleagues will recall that Prime Minister Blair was specifically \nmentioned in the text of this resolution I read earlier. This was a \npurposeful reflection of our great esteem for this courageous leader \nwho has stood so firm arm-in-arm with America. His request to use force \nwas not a popular motion, but he prevailed. The following is the text \nof his speech and I commend it to my colleagues. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print the speech in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Tony Blair's Speech\n\n       I beg to move the motion standing on the order paper in my \n     name and those of my right honourable friends.\n       At the outset I say: it is right that this house debate \n     this issue and pass judgment. That is the democracy that is \n     our right but that others struggle for in vain.\n       And again I say: I do not disrespect the views of those in \n     opposition to mine.\n       This is a tough choice. But it is also a stark one: to \n     stand British troops down and turn back; or to hold firm to \n     the course we have set.\n       I believe we must hold firm.\n       The question most often posed is not why does it matter? \n     But why does it matter so much? Here we are, the government \n     with its most serious test, its majority at risk, the first \n     cabinet resignation over an issue of policy. The main parties \n     divided.\n       People who agree on everything else, disagree on this and \n     likewise, those who never agree on anything, finding common \n     cause. The country and parliament reflect each other, a \n     debate that, as time has gone on has become less bitter but \n     not less grave.\n       So: why does it matter so much? Because the outcome of this \n     issue will now determine more than the fate of the Iraqi \n     regime and more than the future of the Iraqi people, for so \n     long brutalized by Saddam. It will determine the way Britain \n     and the world confront the central security threat of the \n     21st century; the development of the UN; the relationship \n     between Europe and the U.S. the relations within the EU and \n     the way the U.S. engages with the rest of the world. It will \n     determine the pattern of international politics for the next \n     generation.\n       But first, Iraq and its WMD.\n       In April 1991, after the Gulf war, Iraq was given 15 days \n     to provide a full and final declaration of all its WMD.\n       Saddam had used the weapons against Iran, against his own \n     people, causing thousands of deaths. He had had plans to use \n     them against allied forces. It became clear after the Gulf \n     war that the WMD ambitions of Iraq were far more extensive \n     than hitherto thought. This issue was identified by the UN as \n     one for urgent remedy. UNSCOM, the weapons inspection team, \n     was set up. They were expected to complete their task \n     following declaration at the end of April 1991.\n       The declaration when it came was false--a blanket denial of \n     the programme, other than in a very tentative form. So the \n     12-year game began.\n       The inspectors probed. Finally in March 1992, Iraq admitted \n     it had previously undeclared WMD but said it had destroyed \n     them. It gave another full and final declaration. Again the \n     inspectors probed but found little.\n       In October 1994, Iraq stopped cooperating with UNSCOM \n     altogether. Military action was threatened. Inspections \n     resumed. In March 1995, in an effort to rid Iraq of the \n     inspectors, a further full and final declaration of WMD was \n     made. By July 1995, Iraq was forced to admit that too was \n     false. In August they provided yet another full and final \n     declaration.\n\n[[Page S4104]]\n\n       Then, a week later, Saddam's son-in-law, Hussein Kamal, \n     defected to Jordan. He disclosed a far more extensive BW \n     (biological weapons) programme and for the first time said \n     Iraq had weaponised the programme; something Saddam had \n     always strenuously denied. All this had been happening whilst \n     the inspectors were in Iraq. Kamal also revealed Iraq's crash \n     programme to produce a nuclear weapon in 1990.\n       Iraq was forced then to release documents which showed just \n     how extensive those programmes were. In November 1995, Jordan \n     intercepted prohibited components for missiles that could be \n     used for WMD.\n       In June 1996, a further full and final declaration was \n     made. That too turned out to be false. In June 1997, \n     inspectors were barred from specific sites.\n       In September 1997, another full and final declaration was \n     made. Also false. Meanwhile the inspectors discovered VX \n     nerve agent production equipment, something always denied by \n     the Iraqis.\n       In October 1997, the U.S. and the U.K. threatened military \n     action if Iraq refused to comply with the inspectors. But \n     obstruction continued.\n       Finally, under threat of action, in February 1998, Kofi \n     Annan went to Baghdad and negotiated a memorandum with Saddam \n     to allow inspections to continue. They did. For a few months.\n       In August, cooperation was suspended.\n       In December the inspectors left. Their final report is a \n     withering indictment of Saddam's lies, deception and \n     obstruction, with large quantities of WMD remained \n     unaccounted for.\n       The U.S. and the U.K. then, in December 1998, undertook \n     Desert Fox, a targeted bombing campaign to degrade as much of \n     the Iraqi WMD facilities as we could.\n       In 1999, a new inspections team, UNMOVIC, was set up. But \n     Saddam refused to allow them to enter Iraq.\n       So there they stayed, in limbo, until after resolution 1441 \n     when last November they were allowed to return.\n       What is the claim of Saddam today? Why exactly the same \n     claim as before: that he has no WMD.\n       Indeed we are asked to believe that after seven years of \n     obstruction and non-compliance finally resulting in the \n     inspectors leaving in 1998, seven years in which he hid his \n     programme, built it up even whilst inspection teams were in \n     Iraq, that after they left he then voluntarily decided to do \n     what he had consistently refused to do under coercion.\n       When the inspectors left in 1998, they left unaccounted \n     for: 10,000 litres of anthrax; a far reaching VX nerve agent \n     programme; up to 6,500 chemical munitions; at least 80 of \n     mustard gas, possibly more than ten times that amount; \n     unquantifiable amounts of sarin, botulinum toxin and a host \n     of other biological poisons; an entire Scud missile \n     programme.\n       We are now seriously asked to accept that in the last few \n     years, contrary to all history, contrary to all intelligence, \n     he decided unilaterally to destroy the weapons. Such a claim \n     is palpably absurd.\n       1441 is a very clear resolution. It lays down a final \n     opportunity for Saddam to disarm. It rehearses the fact that \n     he has been, for years in material breach of 17 separate UN \n     resolutions. It says that this time compliance must be full, \n     unconditional and immediate. The first step is a full and \n     final declaration of all WMD to be given on 8 December.\n       I want to go through all the events since then--the house \n     is familiar with them--but this much is accepted by all \n     members of the UNSC: the 8 December declaration is false. \n     That in itself is a material breach. Iraq has made some \n     concessions to cooperation but no-one disputes it is not \n     fully cooperating. Iraq continues to deny it has any WMD, \n     though no serious intelligence service anywhere in the world \n     believes them.\n       On 7 March, the inspectors published a remarkable document. \n     It is 173 pages long, detailing all the unanswered questions \n     about Iraq's WMD. It lists 29 different areas where they have \n     been unable to obtain information. For example, on VX it \n     says: ``Documentation available to UNMOVIC suggests that Iraq \n     at least had had far reaching plans to weaponise VX . . .\n       ``Mustard constituted an important part (about 70%) of \n     Iraq's CW arsenal . . . 550 mustard filled shells and up to \n     450 mustard filled aerial bombs unaccounted for . . . \n     additional uncertainty with respect of 6526 aerial bombs, \n     corresponding to approximately 1000 tonnes of agent, \n     predominantly mustard.\n       ``Based on unaccounted for growth media, Iraq's potential \n     production of anthrax could have been in the range of about \n     15,000 to 25,000 litres . . . Based on all the available \n     evidence, the strong presumption is that about 10,000 litres \n     of anthrax was not destroyed and may still exist.''\n       On this basis, had we meant what we said in resolution \n     1441, the security council should have convened and condemned \n     Iraq as in material breach.\n       What is perfectly clear is that Saddam is playing the same \n     old games in the same old way. Yes there are concessions. But \n     fundamental change of heart or mind.\n       But the inspectors indicated there was at least some \n     cooperation; and the world rightly hesitated over war. We \n     therefore approached a second resolution in this way.\n       We laid down an ultimatum calling upon Saddam to come into \n     line with resolution 1441 or be in material breach. Not an \n     unreasonable proposition, given the history.\n       But still countries hesitated: how do we know how to judge \n     full cooperation?\n       We then worked on a further compromise. We consulted the \n     inspectors and drew up five tests based on the document they \n     published on 7 March. Tests like interviews with 30 \n     scientists outside of Iraq; production of the anthrax or \n     documentation showing its destruction.\n       The inspectors added another test: that Saddam should \n     publicly call on Iraqis to cooperate with them. So we \n     constructed this framework: that Saddam should be given a \n     specified time to fulfill all six tests to show full \n     cooperation; that if he did so the inspectors could then set \n     out a forward work programme and that if he failed to do so, \n     action would follow. So clear benchmarks; plus a clear \n     ultimatum. I defy anyone to describe that as an \n     unreasonable position.\n       Last Monday, we were getting somewhere with it. We very \n     nearly had majority agreement and I thank the Chilean \n     President particularly for the constructive way he approached \n     the issue.\n       There were debates about the length of the ultimatum. But \n     the basic construct was gathering support.\n       Then, on Monday night, France said it would veto a second \n     resolution whatever the circumstances. Then France denounced \n     the six tests. Later that day, Iraq rejected them. Still, we \n     continued to negotiate.\n       Last Friday, France said they could not accept any \n     ultimatum. On Monday, we made final efforts to secure \n     agreement. But they remain utterly opposed to anything which \n     lays down an ultimatum authorizing action in the event of \n     non-compliance by Saddam.\n       Just consider the position we are asked to adopt. Those on \n     the security council opposed to us say they want Saddam to \n     disarm but will not countenance any new resolution that \n     authorizes force in the event of non-compliance.\n       That is their position. No to any ultimatum; no to any \n     resolution that stipulates that failure to comply will lead \n     to military action.\n       So we must demand he disarm but relinquish any concept of a \n     threat if he doesn't. From December 1998 to December 2002, no \n     UN inspector was allowed to inspect anything in Iraq. For \n     four years, not a thing.\n       What changed his mind? The threat of force. From December \n     to January and then from January through to February, \n     concessions were made.\n       What changed his mind? The threat of force. And what makes \n     him now issue invitations to the inspectors, discover \n     documents he said he never had, produce evidence of weapons \n     supposed to be non-existent, destroy missiles he said he \n     would keep? The imminence of force.\n       The only persuasive power to which he responds is 250,00 \n     allied troops on his doorstep.\n       And yet when the fact is so obvious that it is staring us \n     in the face, we are told that any resolution that authorizes \n     force will be vetoed. Not just opposed. Vetoed. Blocked.\n       The way ahead was so clear. It was for the UN to pass a \n     second resolution setting out benchmarks for compliance; with \n     an ultimatum that if they were ignored, action would follow.\n       The tragedy is that had such a resolution been issued, he \n     might just have complied. Because the only route to peace \n     with someone like Saddam Hussein is diplomacy backed by \n     force.\n       Yet the moment we proposed the benchmarks, canvassed \n     support for an ultimatum, there was an immediate recourse to \n     the language of the veto.\n       And now the world has to learn the lesson all over again \n     that weakness in the face of a threat from a tyrant, is the \n     surest way not to peace but war.\n       Looking back over 12 years, we have been victims of our own \n     desire to plactate the implacable, to persuade towards reason \n     the utterly unreasonable, to hope that there was some genuine \n     intent to do good in a regime whose mind is in fact evil. Now \n     the very length of time counts against us. You've waited 12 \n     years. Why not wait a little longer?\n       And indeed we have.\n       1441 gave a final opportunity. The first test was the 8th \n     of December. He failed it. But still we waited. Until January \n     27, the first inspection report that showed the absence of \n     full cooperation. Another breach. And still we waited.\n       Until February 14 and then February 28 with concessions, \n     according to the old familiar routine, tossed to us to whet \n     our appetite for hope and further waiting. But still no-one, \n     not the inspectors nor any member of the security council, \n     not any half-way rational observer, believes Saddam is \n     cooperating fully or unconditionally or immediately.\n       Our fault has not been impatience.\n       The truth is our patience should have been exhausted weeks \n     and months and years ago. Even now, when if the world united \n     and gave him an ultimatum: comply or face forcible \n     disarmament, he might just do it, the world hesitates and in \n     that hesitation he senses the weakness and therefore \n     continues to defy.\n       What would any tyrannical regime possessing WMD think \n     viewing the history of the world's diplomatic dance with \n     Saddam? That our capacity to pass firm resolutions is only \n     matched by our feebleness in implementing them.\n       That is why this indulgence has to stop. Because it is \n     dangerous. It is dangerous if such regimes disbelieve us.\n\n[[Page S4105]]\n\n       Dangerous if they think they can use our weakness, our \n     hesitation, even the natural urges of our democracy towards \n     peace, against us.\n       Dangerous because one day they will mistake our innate \n     revulsion against war for permanent incapacity; when in fact, \n     pushed to the limit, we will act. But then when we act, after \n     years of pretence, the action will have to be harder, bigger, \n     more total in its impact. Iraq in not the only regime with \n     WMD. But back away now from this confrontation and future \n     conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating.\n       But, of course, in a sense, any fair observer does not \n     really dispute that Iraq is in breach and that 1441 implies \n     action in such circumstances. The real problem is that, \n     underneath, people dispute that Iraq is a threat; dispute the \n     link between terrorism and WMD; dispute the whole basis of \n     our assertion that the two together constitute a fundamental \n     assault on our way of life.\n       There are glib and sometimes foolish comparisons with the \n     1930s. No one here is an appeaser. But the only relevant \n     point of analogy is that with history, we know what happened. \n     We can look back and say: there's the time; that was the \n     moment; for example, when Czechoslovakia was swallowed up by \n     the Nazis--that's when we should have acted.\n       But it wasn't clear at the time. In fact at the time, many \n     people thought such a fear fanciful. Worse, put forward in \n     bad faith by warmongers. Listen to this editorial--from a \n     paper I'm pleased to say with a different position today--but \n     written in late 1938 after Munich when by now, you would have \n     thought the world was tumultuous in its desire to act.\n       ``Be glad in your hearts. Give thanks to your God. People \n     of Britain, your children are safe. Your husbands and your \n     sons will not march to war. Peace is a victory for all \n     mankind. And now let us go back to our own affairs. We have \n     had enough of those menaces, conjured up from the continent \n     to confuse us.''\n       Naturally should Hitler appear again in the same form, we \n     would know what to do. But the point is that history doesn't \n     declare the future to us so plainly. Each time is different \n     and the present must be judged without the benefit of \n     hindsight.\n       So let me explain the nature of this threat as I see it.\n       The threat today is not that of the 1930s. It's not big \n     powers going to war with each other. The ravages which \n     fundamentalist political ideology inflicted on the 20th \n     century are memories. The Cold War is over. Europe is at \n     peace, if not always diplomatically.\n       But the world is ever more interdependent. Stock markets \n     and economies rise and fall together. Confidence is the key \n     to prosperity. Insecurity spreads like contagion. So people \n     crave stability and order.\n       The threat is chaos. And there are two begetters of chaos. \n     Tyrannical regimes with WMD and extreme terrorist groups who \n     profess a perverted and false view of Islam.\n       Let me tell the house what I know. I know that there are \n     some countries or groups within countries that are \n     proliferating and trading in WMD, especially nuclear weapons \n     technology.\n       I know there are companies, individuals, some former \n     scientists on nuclear weapons programmes, selling their \n     equipment or expertise.\n       I know there are several countries--mostly dictatorships \n     with highly repressive regimes--desperately trying to acquire \n     chemical weapons, biological weapons or, in particular, \n     nuclear weapons capability. Some of these countries are now a \n     short time away from having a serviceable nuclear weapon. \n     This activity is not diminishing. It is increasing.\n       We all know that there are terrorist cells now operating in \n     most major countries. Just as in the last two years, around \n     20 different nations have suffered serious terrorist \n     outrages. Thousands have died in them.\n       The purpose of terrorism lies not just in the violent act \n     itself. It is in producing terror. It sets out to inflame, to \n     divide, to produce consequences which they then use to \n     justify further terror.\n       Round the world it now poisons the changes of political \n     progress: in the Middle East; in Kashmir; in Chechnya; in \n     Africa.\n       The removal of the Taliban in Afghanistan dealt it a blow. \n     But is has not gone away.\n       And these two threats have different motives and different \n     origins but they share one basic common view: they detest the \n     freedom, democracy and tolerance that are the hallmarks of \n     our way of life.\n       At the moment, I accept that association between them is \n     loose. But it is hardening.\n       And the possibility of the two coming together--of \n     terrorist groups in possession of WMD, even of a so-called \n     dirty radiological bomb is now, in my judgment, a real and \n     present danger.\n       And let us recall: what was shocking about September 11 was \n     not just the slaughter of the innocent; but the knowledge \n     that had the terrorists been able to, there would have been \n     not 3,000 innocent dead, but 30,000 or 300,000 and the more \n     the suffering, the greater the terrorists' rejoicing.\n       Three kilograms of VX from a rocket launcher would \n     contaminate a quarter of a square kilometer of a city.\n       Millions of lethal doses are contained in one liter of \n     Anthrax. 10,000 liters are unaccounted for. 11 September has \n     changed the psychology of America. It should have changed the \n     psychology of the world. Of course Iraq is not the only part \n     of this threat. But it is the test of whether we treat the \n     threat seriously.\n       Faced with it, the world should unite. The UN should be the \n     focus, both of diplomacy and of action. That is what 1441 \n     said. That was the deal. And I say to you to break it now, to \n     will the ends but not the means that would do more damage in \n     the long term to the UN than any other course.\n       To fall back into the lassitude of the last 12 years, to \n     talk, to discuss, to debate but never act; to declare our \n     will but not enforce it; to combine strong language with weak \n     intentions, a worse outcome than never speaking at all.\n       And then, when the threat returns from Iraq or elsewhere, \n     who will believe us? What price our credibility with the next \n     tyrant? No wonder Japan and South Korea, next to North Korea, \n     has issued such strong statements of support.\n       I have come to the conclusion after much reluctance that \n     the greater danger to the UN is inaction: that to pass \n     resolution 1441 and then refuse to enforce it would do the \n     most deadly damage to the UN's future strength, confirming it \n     as an instrument of diplomacy but not of action, forcing \n     nations down the very unilateralist path we wish to avoid.\n       But there will be, in any event, no sound future for the \n     UN, no guarantee against the repetition of these events, \n     unless we recognise the urgent need for a political agenda we \n     can unite upon.\n       What we have witnessed is indeed the consequence of Europe \n     and the United States dividing from each other. Not all of \n     Europe--Spain, Italy, Holland, Denmark, Portugal--have all \n     strongly supported us. And not a majority of Europe if we \n     include, as we should, Europe's new members who will accede \n     next year, all 10 of whom have been in our support.\n       But the paralysis of the UN has been born out of the \n     division there is. And at the heart of it has been the \n     concept of a world in which there are rival poles of power. \n     The U.S. and its allies in one corner. France, Germany, \n     Russia and its allies in the other. I do not believe that all \n     of these nations intend such an outcome. But that is what now \n     faces us.\n       I believe such a vision to be misguided and profoundly \n     dangerous. I know why it arises. There is resentment of U.S. \n     predominance.\n       There is fear of U.S. unilateralism. People ask: do the \n     U.S. listen to us and our preoccupations? And there is \n     perhaps a lack of full understanding of U.S. preoccupations \n     after 11th September. I know all of this. But the way to deal \n     with it is not rivalry but partnership. Partners are not \n     servants but neither are they rivals. I tell you what Europe \n     should have said last September to the U.S. With one voice it \n     should have said: we understand your strategic anxiety over \n     terrorism and WMD and we will help you meet it.\n       We will mean what we say in any UN resolution we pass and \n     will back it with action if Saddam fails to disarm \n     voluntarily; but in return we ask two things of you: that the \n     U.S. should choose the UN path and you should recognise the \n     fundamental overriding importance of re-starting the MEPP \n     (Middle East Peace Process), which we will hold you to.\n       I do not believe there is any other issue with the same \n     power to re-unite the world community than progress on the \n     issues of Israel and Palestine. Of course there is cynicism \n     about recent announcements. But the U.S. is now committed, \n     and, I believe genuinely, to the roadmap for peace, designed \n     in consultation with the UN. It will now be presented to the \n     parties as Abu Mazen is confirmed in office, hopefully today.\n       All of us are now signed up to its vision: a state of \n     Israel, recognised and accepted by all the world, and a \n     viable Palestinian state. And that should be part of a larger \n     global agenda. On poverty and sustainable development. On \n     democracy and human rights. On the good governance of \n     nations.\n       That is why what happens after any conflict in Iraq is of \n     such critical significance.\n       Here again there is a chance to unify around the UN. Let me \n     make it clear.\n       There should be a new UN resolution following any conflict \n     providing not just for humanitarian help but also for the \n     administration and governance of Iraq. That must now be done \n     under proper UN authorisation.\n       It should protect totally the territorial integrity of \n     Iraq. And let the oil revenues--which people falsely claim we \n     want to seize--be put in a trust fund for the Iraqi people \n     administered through the UN.\n       And let the future government of Iraq be given the chance \n     to begin the process of uniting the nation's disparate \n     groups, on a democratic basis, respecting human rights, as \n     indeed the fledgling democracy in Northern Iraq--protected \n     from Saddam for 12 years by British and American pilots in \n     the no-fly zone--has done so remarkably.\n       And the moment that a new government is in place--willing \n     to disarm Iraq of WMD--for which its people have no need or \n     purpose--then let sanctions be lifted in their entirety.\n       I have never put our justification for action as regime \n     change. We have to act within the terms set out in resolution \n     1441. That is our legal base.\n       But it is the reason, I say frankly, why if we do act we \n     should do so with a clear conscience and strong heart.\n       I accept fully that those opposed to this course of action \n     share my detestation of Saddam. Who could not? Iraq is a \n     wealthy country that in 1978, the year before Saddam seized \n     power, was richer than Portugal or Malaysia.\n       Today it is impoverished, 60 percent of its population \n     dependent on food aid.\n\n[[Page S4106]]\n\n       Thousands of children die needlessly every year from lack \n     of food and medicine.\n       Four million people out of a population of just over 20 \n     million are in exile.\n       The brutality of the repression--the death and torture \n     camps, the barbaric prisons for political opponents, the \n     routine beatings for anyone or their families suspected of \n     disloyalty well documented.\n       Just last week, someone slandering Saddam was tied to a \n     lamp post in a street in Baghdad, his tongue cut out, \n     mutilized and left to bleed to death, as a warning to others.\n       I recall a few weeks ago talking to an Iraqi exile and \n     saying to her that I understood how grim it must be under the \n     lash of Saddam.\n       ``But you don't,'' she replied. ``You cannot. You do not \n     know what it is like to live in perpetual fear.''\n       and she is right. We take our freedom for granted. But \n     imagine not to be able to speak or discuss or debate or even \n     question the society you live in. To see friends and family \n     taken away and never daring to complain. To suffer the \n     humility of failing courage in face of pitiless terror. That \n     is how the Iraqi people live. Leave Saddam in place and that \n     is how they will continue to live.\n       We must face the consequences of the actions we advocate. \n     For me, that means all the dangers of war. But for others, \n     opposed to this course, it means--let us be clear--that the \n     Iraqi people, whose only true hope of liberation lies in the \n     removal of Saddam, for them, the darkness will close back \n     over them again; and he will be free to take his revenge upon \n     those he must know wish him gone.\n       And if this house now demands that at this moment, faced \n     with this threat from this regime, that British troops are \n     pulled back, that we turn away at the point of reckoning, and \n     that is what it means--what then?\n       What will Saddam feel? Strengthened beyond measure. What \n     will the other states who tyrannise their people, the \n     terrorists who threaten our existence, what will they take \n     from that? That the will confronting them is decaying and \n     feeble.\n       Who will celebrate and who will weep?\n       And if our plea is for America to work with others, to be \n     good as well as powerful allies, will our retreat make them \n     multilateralist? Or will it not rather be the biggest impulse \n     to unilateralism there could ever be. And what of the UN and \n     the future of Iraq and the Middle East peace plan, devoid of \n     our influence, stripped of our insistence?\n       This house wanted this decision. Well it has it. Those are \n     the choices. And in this dilemma, no choice is perfect, no \n     cause ideal.\n       But on this decision hangs the fate of many things.\n       Of whether we summon the strength to recognise this global \n     challenge of the 21st century and meet it.\n       Of the Iraqi people, groaning under years of dictatorship.\n       Of our armed forces--brave men and women of whom we can \n     feel proud, whose morale is high and whose purpose is clear.\n       Of the institutions and alliances that will shape our world \n     for years to come.''\n       I can think of many things, of whether we summon the \n     strength to recognise the global challenge of the 21st \n     century and beat it, of the Iraqi people groaning under years \n     of dictatorship, of our armed forces--brave men and women \n     whom we can feel proud, whose morale is high and whose \n     purpose is clear--of the institutions and alliances that \n     shape our world for years to come.\n       To retreat now, I believe, would put at hazard all that we \n     hold dearest, in turn the UN back into a talking shop, stifle \n     the first steps of progress in the Middle East; leave the \n     Iraqi people to the mercy of events on which we would have \n     relinquished all power to influence for the better.\n       Tell our allies that at the very moment of action, at the \n     very moment when they need our determination that Britain \n     faltered. I will not be a party to such a course. This is not \n     the time to falter. This is the time for this house, not just \n     this government or indeed this prime minister, but for this \n     house to give a lead, to show that we will stand up for what \n     we know to be right, to show that we will confront the \n     tyrannies and dictatorships and terrorists who put our way of \n     life at risk, to show at the moment of decision that we have \n     the courage to do the right thing.\n       I beg to move the motion.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, resolutions, such as the one before us, \nare not possible without a dedicated, bi-partisan effort. Our staffs \nhave worked hard and well together over the past few days to help \nmembers craft this resolution. I want to especially recognize and thank \nSteve Biegun of the Majority Leader's Office, Dennis McDonough of the \nDemocratic Leader's Office, and Judy Ansley, Rick DeBobes and Chuck \nAlsup of the Armed Services Committee staff, for their efforts in \nhelping draft this important resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Has all time expired?\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I make a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Landrieu be added as a cosponsor, and \nevery Member of the Senate who chooses to, who wants their name added, \nbe allowed to do so, and even though it comes after the vote, that it \nappear that it occurred before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I specifically ask the Senator from New Mexico be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will close on leader time.\n  Mr. President, I welcome the strong bipartisan support and the \nbipartisan spirit in which this debate has been conducted today, the \nbipartisan support over the last several hours of remarks. American \nsoldiers, American sailors, and airmen are fighting to end the regime \nof one of the world's worst tyrants.\n   Our men and women in uniform are in harm's way. They are engaged in \nbattle as we speak. Let us pray for their safety and their success.\n  I am confident of their victory, and I am confident that it will \noccur at the earliest possible moment. In passing this resolution, the \nSenate says to the men and women who wear our Nation's uniform and to \ntheir families: We are grateful for your sacrifice.\n  As they act to free the Iraqi people from Saddam Hussein's oppressive \nregime, let there be no mistake--they are defending our own liberty as \nwell.\n  Again I ask in this vote we send a clear message to those brave \nAmericans who are risking their lives for us on the battlefield. Our \nprayers are with you. Godspeed toward victory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.

Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nevenly divided on the Kyl amendment No. 288, as modified. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Kyl amendment would move up the time \nof making permanent the elimination of the estate tax by 1 year. That \ncosts $46 billion. The Senator has proposed paying for it by cutting \nthe Finance Committee jurisdiction. That means cutting Medicare, \nMedicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the State Health \nImprovement Program, and the earned-income tax credit.\n  This is the wrong way to go. We ought to reform the estate tax, not \nrepeal it. I hope my colleagues will resist the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what my distinguished colleague just told you \nis absolutely false. If it were true, then I would not support the \namendment.\n  Our amendment cuts from the discretionary funding across the board. \nThere is no Medicare. There is no Medicaid. There is no Social \nSecurity. We would not do that. That would be foolish. It would not be \nprudent. We are not doing that.\n  All this does is advance by 1 year the repeal of the death tax. We \nrepealed it permanently in this body, starting with the year 2010. All \nthis amendment does is start it in the year 2009. That is all it does. \nSince we have already adopted the permanent repeal, I hope my \ncolleagues will support moving this up by 1 year.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator yesterday said he took it from \nthe Finance Committee jurisdiction for mandatory spending. That is what \nthe record shows. That is where it comes from.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota intruded into the time, let me reiterate, this funding is from \nfunction 920, across-the-board discretionary funding. That is the fact. \nThere is no Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security offset, period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Regular order.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

There are now 2 minutes evenly divided on the \nGraham of Florida amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we are about to take the Medicare vote of \nthe year 2003. Last year, the Senate cast 52 votes for the plan that \nthis amendment would allow us to consider again. It failed with 52 \nvotes because we were operating under a budget resolution which \nrequired us to have 60 votes.\n  This amendment will allow us to pass the same prescription drug plan \nthat a majority of Senators wanted to do a year ago. The alternative, \nif we do not pass this amendment, is going to be to adopt the \nPresident's prescription drug plan which will require seniors to be in \nHMOs in order to have access to prescription drugs. I don't believe \nthat is what this Senate wants to do.\n  The amendment I offer will do two things. It will add $219 billion to \nthe Medicare account; it will put $177 billion over the next 10 years \ntoward deficit reduction. That is a responsible program that will \nsecure a good Medicare prescription drug benefit and make a significant \ncontribution toward deficit reduction.\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\n  I close by thanking my colleagues Senator Dorgan and Senator Stabenow \nfor their great assistance.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment \noffered by Senators Graham, Dorgan, Stabenow, and others that would \nincrease funding in the budget resolution by $220 billion for a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, providing a total of $620 billion \nfor a comprehensive benefit. This amendment would also reduce the tax \ncut by nearly $400 billion and reduce the deficit by $250 billion.\n  According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 38 percent of \nseniors and disabled Americans have no prescription drug coverage \nwhatsoever. Instead of finding ways to help these individuals and \nimprove access to care for those with coverage, President Bush has \nproposed pushing Medicare beneficiaries into private health plans as a \nmeans of receiving drug coverage. And the level of coverage that could \nbe provided under this scenario is questionable. Given the history of \nthe Medicare+Choice program, many of my colleagues and I are skeptical \nthat such a proposal would be successful. Many private insurers have \nwithdrawn from the Medicare program or severely limited service areas \nin recent years. Of those who have remained, many plans have decreased \nprescription drug benefits and other benefits so much so that they \noffer little or no advantage over the traditional Medicare fee-for-\nservice program. It is unclear how the President's proposal will avoid \nsimilar problems.\n  This amendment would increase funding in the budget resolution for a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program that is available to \nall beneficiaries. In addition, it specifies that prescription drugs \nshould be provided on an equal basis with respect to benefit level \nregardless of whether beneficiaries remain in the traditional Medicare \nfee-for-service program or enroll in a private plan like those proposed \nby the administration. This is consistent with the approach that the \nsupporters of this amendment and I favor. We have been working toward \nlegislation that would create an affordable, comprehensive, and \nvoluntary Medicare drug benefit and lower costs for all Americans by \nincreasing access to lower priced drugs.\n  It is clear that even this additional funding would not completely \nmeet the needs of Medicare beneficiaries. A recent Congressional Budget \nOffice estimate suggests spending for prescription drugs by and on \nbehalf of Medicare beneficiaries would total $1.84 trillion over the \nnext 10-year period. However, this amendment moves us much closer to \nmeeting the needs of Medicare beneficiaries while simultaneously \nreducing the deficit.\n  Our Nation is facing serious challenges at home and abroad. And we \nknow that challenging times often require sacrifice. We must ask \nourselves who will bear the brunt of these sacrifices. Are we going to \nspread them evenly? Or will we force those who have worked hard to make \nthe United States the great Nation that it is to carry an unnecessarily \nheavy load? I fail to see how it is appropriate, at this time, to pass \na tax benefit that benefits the wealthiest Americans without providing \nadequate resources to provide a prescription drug benefit for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Our older Americans and the disabled individuals who \nrely on Medicare deserve more than this budget resolution provides. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support the Graham-Dorgan-Stabenow \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment, not \nbecause Medicare is not a very legitimate subject of discussion; it is. \nThe difference between this year and last year, last year we did not \nhave a budget resolution. The process this year is a very orderly \nprocess toward getting us a prescription drug program as part of \nMedicare. That very orderly process is, first of all, to have a budget \nresolution. It is a very orderly process. We are going to have a budget \nresolution this year. We are going to have $100 billion more for \nMedicare/prescription drugs than the last time we debated this.\n  Most of the people on the other side of the aisle 2 years ago helped \nus get a $300 billion figure. We have a $400 billion figure. We have a \nSenate majority leader who is committed to the committee process \nworking. Out of the Finance Committee in June, we will produce a good \nprescription drug program for the Senate to debate this summer.\n  I urge Members to vote against the amendment. I move to table the \namendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller), is \nnecessarily absent, due to a family medical matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

There are now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nRockefeller amendment.\n  The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order Of Business\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will give everybody an outline of what we \ncan expect over the next 24 hours before we begin what will be the last \nvote of the evening.\n  Following this next vote, which will begin shortly, there will be \napproximately 5 hours remaining for consideration of the budget \nresolution. Our plans are that we will stay in session tonight. The \nchairman and ranking member will remain this evening to debate the \namendments with others, and to participate in that debate until all \ntime has expired.\n  The plan will be to reconvene tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning. And it \nwill be a long day. At 9:30 we will begin our rollcall votes, a series \nof rollcall votes. I know the two managers are committed to try to make \nthis an orderly process as we complete the budget resolution. That, in \npart, means they need to have all amendments, and they will accomplish \nan ordering of those amendments so we can start right in at 9:30 and \nstart clicking through the amendments at the appropriate speed \ntomorrow.\n  I do ask Members to notify the managers if they intend to offer an \namendment during the voting sequence tomorrow. Once the voting begins \ntomorrow, we will remain until the budget resolution is completed.\n  I thank all Members for their real cooperation today. Again, it was a \nchallenging day for all of us. And it has worked out almost perfectly, \nseamlessly in many ways, as we were able to recognize the service of \nour military personnel and the President of the United States and at \nthe same time continue the budgeting process.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  I know that before the agreement was reached regarding the resolution \non our troops, we had made a promise that those who could not speak \nprior to\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\nthe vote could have the opportunity to speak as soon as these votes \nhave been completed.\n  The majority leader did not mention that, but I assume that has not \nchanged. I asked earlier whether we could ensure that those comments \nwould be printed in the Record prior to the vote, as well. If that \ncould be accommodated, that would be helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, indeed, those statements, written and oral \nstatements, will appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  Also, we would encourage people tonight to take advantage of the fact \nthat we are going to be here in session. We have agreed that that time \nwill be on the budget, the 5 hours that are remaining. I think it is 5 \nhours. And people are welcome to speak tonight.\n  Again, I remind people they will have other opportunities to express \nthemselves on support for the troops, as well.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I just request of the majority leader if we might start \nthe votes at 9:45 instead of 9:30 to accommodate one of our Members. I \nalso request of our colleagues, I know some people--Senator Conrad and \nI do not want vote-aramas. And I hate for anybody to come back and say: \nI have not had a chance to debate my amendment. We will be here tonight \nto discuss amendments, and we will work together to schedule amendments \naccording to Senators' wishes. But we need to see copies of the \namendments in advance, and then we will try to schedule the amendments. \nWe will work energetically--as soon as we get copies of amendments--to \nwork out some of these amendments, maybe accept some amendments if we \nhave some advance notification. We are going to try to be as \ncooperative as possible.\n\n  So my first request would be, hopefully, to move the first rollcall \nvote to 9:45. And then I just urge our colleagues, if they wish to \ndebate their amendments tonight, please do so. And if not, I request \nthat they submit us copies of the amendments as early as possible so we \ncan do some work on those amendments tonight.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, with regard to the 9:45 start, the surgeon \nin me says we ought to start at 8 o'clock, but we will start at 9:45.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Was there a second request?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Do I understand correctly, from the exchange that just \ntook place, immediately after this vote there will be an order to make \nstatements with respect to the resolution that was passed just a short \nwhile ago?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is in order to do so. But I will turn to \nthe two managers of the bill to respond to that. If statements are \nmade, part of the 5 hours will be used up for the statements.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the majority leader will yield, let me attempt to make \na clarification because I do not think we want a misunderstanding on \nthis question.\n  The majority side has yielded back all of their time. I have \nsomething like 4\\1/2\\ hours remaining on this side. But the way the \nrules work, there are three pending amendments, and the Republican side \ngets half on each of those amendments.\n  My understanding is--and I think it is the appropriate inclusion \nhere--that time on the war resolution from your side would come off \nyour amendment time, not off my time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n  I say to my colleagues on our side, if I may, please understand that \nwhen they say there is 4\\1/2\\ hours left, there is 4\\1/2\\ hours left in \ntotal. Even though they have given back all of their time, because \nthere are three amendments pending, they get half of the time on each \nof those amendments. So we do not have 4\\1/2\\ hours. We have much less \nthan that left potentially.\n  We have significant amendments to debate. I know there are colleagues \nwho would like to speak, still, on the war resolution. We will attempt \nto accommodate them. But my intention is to give them 2 minutes each \nbecause otherwise we are not going to have time to debate very \nconsequential amendments with respect to reducing the size of the tax \ncut, with respect to the transportation infrastructure amendment that \nis very significant, with respect to other amendments that are pending, \nSenator Harkin's IDEA amendment, and others.\n  So we are going to have to use a lot of discipline and forbearance \nfor people to have an opportunity to debate very consequential items \nand discuss the war.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask a question of the majority leader.\n  In light of the statement Senator Conrad just made, would it not be \npossible to have, say, an hour, after this vote, for the making of \nstatements on the resolution unrelated to taking time away from \nconsideration of the budget?\n\n  This is an important resolution. There are many Members who did not \nget a chance before the vote to make a statement. It seems to me a \nreasonable accommodation in light of what the ranking member of the \ncommittee has just stated.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will yield in 1 second.\n  A discussion with the Democratic leader and myself today was under \nthe understanding--again, no unanimous consent agreement--under the \nunderstanding that if people were going to be talking about the Iraq \nresolution, time would be coming off the time on the budget.\n  Let me also clarify the earlier statement. If our side is speaking on \nthe Iraq resolution, it will come out of the 2 \\1/2\\ hours of our time. \nIf your side is speaking on the Iraq resolution, it will come out of \nyour time.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I wanted to make that clarification. For the information \nof our colleagues, I guess theoretically we could spend a lot of time \ntalking about amendments pending and not allow time to be discussed on \nIraq. That is not our intention. I will be happy to share time with my \ncolleague from North Dakota and others who wish to speak on Iraq. We \nwill be here until midnight. If people want to speak longer on \namendments, I am happy to do that, too. I want to be as accommodating \nas possible but still try to complete this resolution by tomorrow \nnight. I will be happy to yield some time if it would help some of our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield on that point, we are, \nobviously, on a track to complete this budget resolution. As I \nunderstood it, the 3 hours of debate from 2 to 5 before the vote on the \nresolution did not come out of the time on the budget; is that correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. All I am suggesting is given there are some additional \nMembers who wish to speak, that we have another hour after this vote \nunrelated to time on the budget resolution to discuss the support for \nour troops resolution.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to, out of the time we have in the \nbank, you might say, for the amendments, to allow Members to speak up \nto an hour on the Iraq resolution, if they so desire. I don't want to \nyield all of it, but I will be happy to do that. I don't think that is \ngoing to be necessary. I will be happy to work with our colleagues.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It seems to me that this is a matter of such \nconsequence.\n  Mr. STEVENS. You should have been here this afternoon.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I was here this afternoon, in response to my colleague \nwho raised that point. There was a very long list of people wishing to \nspeak. There wasn't time to speak within the time that was allotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader controls the time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Let's have regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 275\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote on amendment No. 275. Who yields time? The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S4112]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenators Landrieu, Specter, Johnson, and Dayton as cosponsors of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This amendment is a simple sense-of-the-Senate \namendment. That is all it is. It asks that there be no less than $30 \nbillion over the next 18 months of which half must be for Medicaid to \nbe given to the States for fiscal relief within the stimulus package.\n  Our States are broke. Quite frankly, the $98 billion that States \nspend on Medicaid today actually turns into $280 billion of fiscal \nstimulus. So it is fiscal stimulus. If we don't do this, 1,700,000 more \npeople will lose their Medicaid, lose their health care. They are our \nmost vulnerable citizens. I ask that our colleagues support this \namendment offered by Senator Collins, Senator Nelson, and myself.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I want to say just a few words in support \nof the amendment, No. 275, offered by my friend Senator Rockefeller on \nbehalf of Senators Collins, Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Clinton, \nSenator Schumer, myself and others. This amendment is extraordinarily \nimportant for our homeland security, our families, and our entire \neconomy.\n  This amendment says that any economic growth package has got to \ninclude at least $30 billion for State fiscal relief. I think that is \nexactly right. I have offered a bill that would provide $50 billion in \nrelief. At this time, in the context of the budget resolution, this \namendment--at least $30 billion--is the most important thing we can do.\n  With our troops at war today, their security is first on everybody's \nminds today. Our thoughts and prayers are with these men and women who \nare risking their lives for our freedom and safety even as we speak.\n  At the same time, we are also thinking about security here at home. \nWe know there is a real risk of an attack now that we are at war. Just \nas we must always make sure our troops on the frontlines abroad have \nwhat they need, we also need to make sure our troops on the frontlines \nat home have what they need. And the troops on the frontlines at home \nare our police and our firefighters. They need the best protective \ngear, the best bomb detection equipment, the best emergency training, \nand the best communications systems in the world.\n  They aren't getting that right now. And one reason they aren't \ngetting it is that States can't afford to provide aid because of their \ndeficits. We are seeing the largest State fiscal crisis since World War \nII--deficits of over $100 billion. And with those shortfalls, States \njust cannot afford to hire more first responders or give them the \ntraining and equipment they need. And that is a huge mistake.\n  So we need fiscal relief so States and local governments can provide \nfor first responders. My bill would set aside $10 billion for that.\n  But fiscal relief is about more than homeland security. It is about \nour entire economy.\n  Virtually every American has felt this economic downturn. They have \nfelt it from North Carolina to Nevada, from the biggest cities to the \nsmallest towns. They have felt it in convenience stores, in factories, \nin hospitals--they have felt it everywhere. Two million jobs lost, \nwages down, stock market down--and the list goes on. All Americans \ndeserve a better economy than we have got right now.\n  Now, the state fiscal crisis is seriously hurting our economy. Here \nis what is happening. Let's say you are a governor, and you are facing \na massive deficit. In North Carolina, we have a deficit of close to \n$1.7 billion. What do you do? You can't print money like a President \ncan. You can't borrow like a President can. You have only two choices. \nYou can raise taxes--property taxes or income taxes or sales taxes. Or \nelse you can cut spending on priorities like homeland security, \neducation, and health care. Or you can do a little of both.\n  States are already calling for $14 billion in tax increases. \nPortland, OR, will likely cut 5 weeks from its school year. Hundreds of \nCalifornia nursing homes may go bankrupt. In Florida, 26,000 low-income \npeople may lose medical coverage.\n  So this economic downturn hurts our families. They pay more in taxes, \nor they get less from their schools, their hospitals, their police \nforces. Or both--they pay more and get less.\n  At the same time, our whole economy gets hurt. At a time when we \nshould be investing more, tax hikes and education cuts mean we end up \ninvesting less. According to the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, the state spending cuts and tax increases now likely will \nmake our economy 1 percent smaller. That is 1 percent of our economy, \ngone because of the fiscal crisis. And according to the Center on \nBudget, ``The only way this blow to the economy can be mitigated is \nthrough federal fiscal relief for the states.''\n  Now, it is unthinkable to offer nothing for the States right now. \nThis fiscal crisis was caused by the current economic downturn, and now \nthis fiscal crisis is making the current economic downturn even worse. \nThe only way out is to stop the crisis with fiscal relief.\n  As I have said before, I believe we can and must pay for this fiscal \nrelief over the long term. It would be irresponsible not to do that. \nAnd the way to pay for it over the long run is to cut wasteful \nspending, close needless loopholes, and roll back some of the tax cuts \nfor the very wealthiest Americans.\n  This relief is hugely important, and I urge my colleagues to support \nit. I have actually offered a State fiscal relief package that provides \n$50 billion in aid to States, and I am hopeful that we can get some \naction on that package. Passing this amendment is the first and most \nimportant step we can take to ending a fiscal crisis that benefits \nnobody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this bipartisan sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution would help ensure that any economic growth package includes \n$30 billion in desperately needed fiscal aid to the States. Half of the \nmoney would have to be used for the Medicaid Program which has been \nseverely cut. Forty-nine States are facing budget shortfalls.\n  This approach would have no impact on the deficit. It would not \nchange the caps in this resolution. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on \nthe Rockefeller, Collins, Nelson, and Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 hours 52 minutes remaining on the \nresolution, with time controlled by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me a few minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am more than pleased to yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I appreciate that very much. In light of the discussion \nthat was earlier held, my own view is that we should have allowed more \ntime to talk about the resolution with respect to Iraq straight out, \nwithout mixing it into the budget resolution problem. It is obviously \nthe issue facing the country. I think Members wanted to address it, and \nI do not believe it ought to be truncated. But I understand the \ndifficult position in which the able Senator from North Dakota, who has \ndone such an excellent job in terms of his efforts on the budget \nresolution, now finds himself. So I will try to limit my time in that \nregard. I thank the ranking member for his courtesy.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sarbanes are printed in today's Record in the \ndebate on S. Res. 95.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  How much time is the Senator seeking?\n  Mr. DODD. Four minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, who \nhas been very patiently waiting.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to my colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I could have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Harkin are printed in today's Record in the \ndebate on S. Res. 95.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join first of all with my colleague from \nMaryland in expressing some regret we have to ask unanimous consent to \nhave remarks added to the Record here at a moment like this when \n300,000 Americans in uniform are presently engaged in conflict in the \nMiddle East. I would have thought, like he, there would be a little \nmore time for everyone to express our strong sense of support to these \nmen and women rather than to find ourselves limited because of the \nbudget debate; that more time would have been allocated. Given the \nseriousness of this situation, I would be hard pressed to think of \nanother situation in recent times that is as serious as this. It would \ncertainly command the attention and time of this institution.\n  Having said that, I add my words of commendation for my friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota. He has done a magnificent job and we are \nall extremely proud of the work he and his staff have done in trying to \nfashion together a budget debate that allows for a meaningful \ndiscussion of the important issues that are included in this budget \ndiscussion.\n  I, like many, regret we have not had a chance to talk about and \ninclude in the budget debate, obviously, the issue of the cost of the \nconflict in the Middle East, the cost of reconstruction--not because we \nnecessarily disagree with it at all; in fact, I supported the \nresolution last fall--but it ought to be part of the debate and \ndiscussion of the budget. Those matters have to be left for another day \nas we go through this budget resolution.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd are printed in today's Record in the debate \non S. Res. 95.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I agree completely with the Senator from \nConnecticut. I deeply regret the decision was not made to spend this \nday discussing the war. I said this morning, I find it very difficult \nto understand, as much as I value the budget and the budget process, \nafter spending my entire time in the Senate on the Budget Committee. \nThat is not, frankly, the focus of the attention of the American people \ntoday. The war is the focus of the attention of the American people \ntoday and we should have spent this entire day on the war. We should \nhave put off the budget discussion and the budget debate until later.\n  The majority refused to do that. The majority insisted the budget was \nthe priority and we would have limited time to discuss the war. That is \na mistake. It is not right. That is where we are.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is seeking time, and I yield 3 minutes to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kohl are printed in today's Record in the debate \non S. Res. 95.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I thank him very much \nfor his patience. Again, I want to express my regret that we are forced \ninto this circumstance of limiting time on such a consequential \nsubject. But the rules unfortunately dictate the circumstance we are \nin, and the unwillingness of the other side to give us an extended time \nfor discussion; instead to be locked into the budget discussion, which \nis regrettable.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has also been extraordinarily patient, not \njust today but for several days. He has an amendment that is one of the \nmost consequential to come before the body on this subject. So I \napologize to the Senator from Louisiana. He has been, as always, a \ngentleman. How much time would the Senator seek?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Can I have 10 minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana. If he would like additional time, we will do that as well.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member. I thank him \nnot only for yielding and his nice comments about what we are \nattempting to do, but I also congratulate him on the very difficult job \nof serving as ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. This is a \nvery difficult job. He has handled it with a great deal of finesse and \nmaturity and understanding about the intricacies of the budget process.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 339\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask it \nbe reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask the amendment be set aside and ask the amendment at \nthe desk be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Voinovich, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 339.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX.

This amendment I have sent to the desk is on behalf of \nour colleague on the Republican side, Senator Snowe; on behalf of the \nranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Baucus; and \nalso on behalf of our Republican colleague, Senator Voinovich from \nOhio.\n  I remember that a great Chinese philosopher once said: May you live \nin interesting times.\n  I would also add today that we are actually living in very confusing \ntimes.\n  The bombs began to drop on the country of Iraq last night. We have \nover 200,000 men and women engaged in a war in a far off country. We \nhave a country that is presently on orange alert, the second highest in \nour country's history. We have a war, and we do not know how long it is \ngoing to last, whether it be 4 days or 4 weeks or 4 months. We have a \nwar and we have no concept of how much it is going to cost. We have \nestimates from $50 billion, $60 billion, $100 billion, depending on how \nlong the conflict lasts.\n  We have a financial situation in this country where we have a $300 \nbillion deficit that is now facing us in the short term. Yet we have a \nbudget recommending that we now take the action of cutting revenues to \npay for the cost of the war by about $1.36 trillion, of which the \nbudget request adds $726 billion be protected by the process of budget \nreconciliation which would prevent any effort to filibuster that, on \nbehalf of our Republican colleagues.\n  In addition, we all know in this Congress we are faced with \nadditional costs in health care, particularly in the Medicare Program \nwhere we are attempting to add a prescription drug benefit plan to a \nMedicare Program which is desperately in need of additional funds. We \nhave all of our Governors and all of 50 States saying how they do not \nhave enough revenues to adequately run their State Medicaid Program.\n  Indeed, it is not only interesting times, it is very confusing times \nin the sense of trying to rationalize how we as a nation, with the \npending demands we have on our society, financial demands that are \nlegitimate and pressing, especially the conduct of a war in the country \nof Iraq, and at the same time we are asking to cut revenues by a total \nof $1.36 trillion.\n  I remember back when we looked at the last major tax reduction and \ntax cut in this country, back in the year 2001. We passed and \nultimately enacted a $1.35 trillion tax cut. Times were different. \nTimes were not as confusing. In those days we had a $5.6 trillion \nsurplus. We had $5.6 trillion more in the Federal Treasury than we \nneeded to operate and serve the people of this country. When you have a \nsurplus of that magnitude, it is appropriate that you give some of the \nmoney back to the taxpayers of this country. We had a surplus. We were \nnot at war. Conditions were different. Times were different. They were \nnot confusing. We knew what we were facing.\n  Today that has changed, completely, totally, 180 degrees. We are at \nwar, Medicare is on the verge of collapse, Medicaid is in fact \ncollapsing, and we have a deficit, not a surplus. Yet we are faced \ntoday with a proposal that says in those conditions, one of the most \nimportant things we can do is cut revenues, and cut revenues not by an \ninsignificant amount but, rather, by a total of $1.36 trillion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  I know of only a small number of people who say that makes common \nsense. What business that is in debt and losing money would declare a \ndividend? What government that is facing war, and in fact is in war, \nwith a net\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\ndeficit of over $300 billion in 1 year, would say we need less revenues \nto meet our demands when in fact just the opposite is true: That is the \nissue that is facing us.\n  Some Members on the Republican side of the aisle think the number of \nthe tax cut at $726 billion in this budget under reconciliation \nprotection is just the right number. There are some on our side who \nthink, no, we should have no tax cut until we know what the costs and \ndemands are in our society. They would suggest we should have a zero \ntax cut until we know the cost of the war, and how much we are going to \nneed for Medicare and prescription drugs and Medicaid, and how much we \nare going to have to pay for homeland security. They take the position \nthat until we know those answers, we should not be reducing and cutting \nand slashing the revenues that we need to run Government.\n  Tax cuts are popular, but they also have to be realistic. Tax cuts \nare not free. We do not just eliminate $726 billion in revenue and \nthink it is going to come out of the sky. In fact, we have to pay for \nit. And to pay for provisions in this legislation is simply adding to \nthe deficit of this country at a time of great demands and at a time \nwhen we do not know what the future holds.\n  I think that is not good policy. I would prefer no tax cut at this \ntime, but that is not politically possible. So what my colleagues and \nfriends, in a bipartisan fashion, have tried to do is to say there must \nbe some meeting of the minds, somewhere in the middle, between $726 \nbillion in tax cuts and zero in tax cuts. That is why two Democrats and \ntwo Republicans--who have worked weeks and weeks together to come up \nwith this--are now presenting this amendment to our colleagues in the \nSenate.\n  We have met with economists. We have met with tax experts. We have \nmet with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, to get \nhis ideas and to get his suggestions about what we need to do.\n  What we have before the Senate now is a reflection of that. It is the \nonly bipartisan amendment being offered that I think has a realistic \nchance of passing. It is clear in my mind, for those on my side of the \naisle who would prefer zero in tax cuts, that if they do not vote for \nthis amendment, with a $350 billion tax cut, they in effect are voting \nfor a $726 billion tax cut. Because it is clear in my mind, and I think \nin the minds of others, that if our amendment does not pass, the tax \ncut that remains is $726 billion.\n  I know for those who say, I don't want any, it is difficult for them \nto vote for $350 billion. But let me say to them, what they are doing, \nin doing that, is reducing the tax cut by a substantial amount and a \nsignificant amount. In fact, they would be reducing the tax cut by $375 \nbillion by voting for our amendment. They would be reducing the Federal \ndeficit by $464 billion. That is not insignificant. It should be more, \nbut this is what we have the potential, and the political reality, of \naccomplishing.\n  So for those on my side, it is very important to understand, if this \namendment does not pass, the likelihood of what passes is much larger \nand increases the deficit substantially. By voting for our amendment, \nyou have a chance to reduce the Federal deficit by $464 billion over \nthe next 10 years. That is real progress for people who believe in \neconomic balanced budgets.\n  It is, in fact, the conservative thing to do, I say to my Republican \ncolleagues, because you don't spend money you don't have. Whether it is \nfor a tax cut or whether it is for some spending program, they both \nhave the same results. We have to pay for them.\n  So I think what we offer today is an amendment that should, \nhopefully, find comfort and support from both sides of the aisle. That \nis what we have attempted to do. And that is what this amendment, in \nfact, does.\n  I know some would like a much larger tax cut, but in looking at what \nwe have offered, I think it does represent a tax cut, so that we in the \nFinance Committee, and later in the full body, will be able to craft \nsomething that has meaning, that really adds stimulus to the economy. \nAnd we would support that. That type of program can pass with a \nsignificant number of Democratic votes joining with our Republican \ncolleagues in a bipartisan fashion.\n  It should not be all or nothing. That is too risky. It is too \nirresponsible. So what my colleagues and I have offered together is a \ncompromise, a bipartisan compromise, which I think makes a great deal \nof sense for everyone who is concerned about the future of this \ncountry.\n  It is difficult in challenging times. These are confusing times. \nThese are uncertain times. And in these times, I would suggest the \nright course of action is to be a little more conservative with how we \nspend our Nation's money, as we prepare to face obligations which no \none can be certain how large or for how long they are going to \ncontinue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield time, on behalf of the ranking \nmember, to the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, these obviously are very \ndifficult times and, obviously, the point at which we find ourselves in \ntrying to reconcile some of the more significant issues that are \nincorporated in this budget resolution.\n  As the Senator from Louisiana indicated, several of us have been \nworking across the political aisle--with the Senator from Montana and \nthe Senator from Ohio--to reconcile some of the issues with respect to \nthe central question in this budget resolution in terms of the extent \nto which we should have a growth package--what type, what size, and \nwhat should be included in that growth package.\n  Obviously, the policy will not be determined in the budget \nresolution. But certainly we can determine the size that could dictate \nultimately the policy in the days and weeks ahead.\n  I appreciate our ability to work across the political aisle to help \ncraft this amendment. As the Senator from Louisiana indicated, it is an \namendment that will reduce the size of the tax cut from $726 billion to \n$350 billion. And the remaining $376 billion would be applied towards \ndeficit reduction. Through this alone, we would achieve $86 billion \nsavings in interest costs.\n  I happen to believe this is a responsible, well balanced approach \nthat will both stimulate our economy in the short term and protect our \neconomy from the effects of unnecessary deficits in the long term. That \nis particularly important because when we compound future deficits, we \nraise the likelihood we will drive up long-term interest rates.\n  I understand the challenges of bringing forth a budget resolution. \nFirst, I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee, in his new \nposition as chairman, for having the persistence and the determination, \nas well as the dedication, to bring this budget resolution before the \nSenate.\n  I commend him for his tireless work in forging and producing the \nbudget we have debated on the floor this week. As a former member of \nthe Budget Committee, I know what goes into this process. I also know \nthat Senator Nickles wants what we did not have last year, which was a \nbudget resolution. It is critical because it imposes structure and \ndiscipline and defines the priorities in Federal expenditures.\n  That is a fundamental responsibility of Congress. That is why it is \nso critical and instrumental to get it done, to pass a budget \nresolution, so we can advance the budget process that ultimately will \ndetermine the policy as well as the appropriations, so we do not have \nwhat we had this year. This year, the first month and a half was \ndevoted to the unfinished business of the last Congress--half of the \ndomestic budget--because we had failed to pass a budget resolution. So \nthat is important.\n  That is why I and the Senator from Louisiana, the Senator from \nMontana, and the Senator from Ohio worked together, because we \nunderstood, in order to pass a bipartisan budget resolution, it was \nalso important to focus on some of the issues that would divide us. One \nof those questions was, of course, on the size of the growth plan as \nproposed by the President.\n  I commend the President for his leadership in initiating the debate \non the\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\nnecessity of stimulating our economy. I happen to share his belief that \nwe should take steps to rejuvenate this sluggish economy, to try to do \nwhat we can in the short term to strengthen the economy.\n  I also happen to believe that our budget resolution has to bear the \nstamp of the totality of the extraordinary historic events and times in \nwhich we live. In the last 2 years, it has been an extraordinary \ntransformation for America, in the aftermath of the most horrific \nevent, the devastating attack on American soil, the ongoing war on \nterrorism, the initiation of military action in Iraq and more than \n250,000 troops poised for potential war. We also have grave concerns \nabout the nuclear proliferation on the Korean peninsula. All of these \nglobal uncertainties have cast a dark shadow over a domestic economy \nthat was already on shaky ground even before September 11. The events \nof September 11 catapulted an already shaky economy into a recession.\n  Indeed, over the past year our Nation's economy has only grown worse. \nThe economy grew at an anemic .7 percent in the fourth quarter, the \nweakest quarterly gain since the end of the recession, and just last \nmonth 308,000 people joined the unemployment rolls, bringing our \nunemployment to an 8-year high. Since the recession began, we now have \nlost more than 2.3 million jobs in the private sector. Without \nquestion, we need to have a stimulus package to address the short-term, \nimmediate economy.\n  As Allen Sinai said, chief economist for Decision Economics, the \nfiscal stimulus is ``absolutely essential'' because the U.S. and world \neconomies are struggling.\n  In short, failing to act now by passing an immediate growth package \nin this budget is to risk contributing to a jobless recovery or \nincurring a double dip recession. We cannot afford to wait until our \nmilitary action in Iraq is concluded.\n  This is the right time. This is the right vehicle for action. We can \nalways debate further issues later. But we will never be able to turn \nthe clock back to jump-start the economy.\n  When we were involved in deliberations about a stimulus package in \n2002, we had numerous discussions with Chairman Greenspan and other \nexperts. The one thing we did hear was this: If you want to effect the \nshort-term behavior of the economy, you have to do it as soon as \npossible to have the maximum impact on short-term behavior. So we \ncannot afford to lose time. I believe we should have a growth package \nin this budget. At the same time, given these unprecedented times and \nthe confluence of circumstances on which they are defined, whether it \nis the economic uncertainties, the war in Iraq, the projection of \nhigher and higher budget deficits, the domestic fiscal challenges that \nlurk on the horizon because of Social Security and Medicare, our \nresponsibility to carefully evaluate the impact of any tax reduction \nand spending increases in this budget is that much greater.\n  That is the context in which we must shape this budget. These are \nrealities that we cannot afford to ignore. Indeed, our projected \nFederal deficit for this fiscal year is now estimated to be $246 \nbillion. That is an increase of 54 percent. That is without any new \nspending or tax cuts. There were only 3 other years in the last 32 \nyears in which we saw higher deficit levels in terms of real dollars. \nWhat is required in this budget resolution is careful calibration, if \nwe are to produce short-term benefits for our economy without \njeopardizing long-term fiscal responsibility and economic growth.\n  Let there be no mistake, just as the need for short-term economic \nstimulus is compelling, so, too, is the need to return to balanced \nbudgets and, indeed, surpluses as soon as possible.\n  I have been in Congress, both the House and Senate, for 25 years. I \nhave seen how difficult it is to achieve a balanced budget. After all, \nit took 18 years of my career before we saw the realization, the \naccomplishment of a balanced budget amendment. We all cheered on the \nsuccess, that for the first time we were able to escape the chronic \nbudget deficits that had characterized the budgetary process for \ndecades. Then a year later we were able to have the first on-budget \nsurplus. We have been able to have 4 years of surpluses from 1998 to \n2001. I don't want that to be an anomaly. I want deficits to be an \nanomaly.\n\n  As I said, over the last two decades, I saw the progression of the \ndeficits. I saw the progression of various procedures and how we were \ngoing to attack deficits, from Gramm-Rudman-Hollings to every other \nmechanism. There were those who said we should not have a balanced \nbudget because they said it was a gimmick. I said, if it was a gimmick, \nwe would have passed it a long time ago. It wasn't a gimmick. It \nworked.\n  We cannot risk the impact of undue deficits in the long term because \nthose chronic deficits drive up interest rates. That is going to stymie \nour ability to do what we need to do for future generations. It will \ndiminish our ability to address the problems associated with Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  That is how I am approaching this economic growth question in the \nbudget resolution. What will stimulate the economy today versus what \nwill not? And for those measures in this package, and the funding \nmeasure that we are including in this budget resolution are not strong, \nimmediate, and of limited duration, if they truly have merit in their \nown right, then they should be paid for as we go.\n  We need to ask ourselves in this current circumstance, can we really \nafford to deficit finance nonstimulative proposals? Maybe we could do \nit in a different time or place, but not now.\n  It all comes back to setting priorities. That is what we said time \nand again in all those years that we were fighting for a balanced \nbudget that was accomplished right here in the Senate back in 1996. \nThat is what we talked about, establishing priorities, getting our \nfiscal house in order. Now that is what we need to do in this budget \nresolution. We have to draw lines, and we have to draw distinctions.\n  What I am saying tonight is, if those proposals that are \nnonstimulative to change our tax structure are part of a long-term \neconomic growth plan or are part of tax reform, those proposals should \nbe fully paid for so as to not exacerbate our future economic situation \nand lead to greater problems down the road. That is not my view. It is \nthe prevalent view among economists--Chairman Greenspan and so many \nothers across the board--because we are dealing with so many challenges \nand crises simultaneously.\n  How much can we afford to do now? How much? How much is too much? \nShould it be $726 billion? Should it be a trillion? Should it be $2 \ntrillion? We have to draw lines. That is why I am here tonight. That is \nwhy I reached across party lines, to work together so we can pass a \nbipartisan budget resolution that reaches a consensus on this key issue \nof whether or not we should have a growth plan, and, if so, how much \ncan we afford to do now?\n  I drew the line on what was stimulus versus nonstimulus. We need to \nhave a carefully calibrated growth plan that is limited, of short \nduration, to have an immediate impact on the economy and that will not \nhave a negative impact on long-term interest rates.\n  I looked at the outyears because I wanted to get exactly a snapshot \nof where we are today and where we are going in 2013. All I can see \ndown the road are deficits as far as the eye can see. We have deficits \nevery year. We have deficits through 2013, the year in which we will \nalso have the onset of 77 million baby boomers retiring. So we will \nhave a convergence of not only that massive wave of retirement that \nwill impact Social Security and Medicare, but we will also continue to \nhave deficits.\n  I looked at the projections by CBO. What I found were interesting \nfacts. CBO projects a return to surpluses in 2008. But let it be clear, \nthe assumptions do not account for real budget costs--the war in Iraq, \ntax cuts, prescription drugs, more spending on defense and homeland \nsecurity, all national imperatives.\n  In fact, CBO's baseline assumes real discretionary spending will \nremain constant. That certainly contravenes the recent trends of around \n8 percent growth in spending. According to the Brookings Institute, it \nsaid:\n\n       Such assumption implies real outlays will fall by 9 percent \n     relative to population, and by 20 percent relative to gross \n     domestic product over the next decade.\n\n  I do not think anybody seriously believes that is realistic. Putting \nthese\n\n[[Page S4117]]\n\ncosts into the budget, we could have a deficit this year of over $300 \nbillion and next year it could approach $400 billion. If we anticipate \na supplemental of $100 billion or more in the short term, that will \npush our deficit near 4 percent of GDP, and that will be a historical \nhigh. I have heard time and again these deficits represent a minimal \namount as a percentage of the GDP. I heard those arguments through the \neighties. I heard them in the nineties. How much is too high? Today it \nis 2 percent. Tomorrow it will be 3 percent. With the supplemental next \nweek, it could be 4 percent.\n  Why are we not focusing on how we can return to a balanced budget as \nsoon as possible? Are balanced budgets no longer part of the political \nand economic lexicon? We should be devoting our time to figuring out, \ngiven all these exigencies, extenuating circumstances which, without \nquestion, need to be funded, how much can we do now in terms of a tax \ncut? We had a tax cut in 2001. We had a tax cut in 2002, and in my \nentire career, I have supported tax cuts, but now we are looking at \nmultiple challenges on the horizon that demand significant Federal \nexpenditures.\n  Therefore, I say, let's be prudent, let's be proportional, let's be \npractical, and target the growth plan to $350 billion that would be \nsufficient to have an effect on the short-term economy to turn this \neconomy around.\n  Some people say wait until after the conflict with Iraq is over. If \nyou have a weak economy, we have no way of prognosticating the future \nin terms of what the economy will look like in the aftermath of Iraq. \nWe may have fundamentals strong enough that we can rebound. Certainly \nChairman Greenspan has indicated he thinks that will be the case. If \nnot, we do not want to take the risk, particularly because it affects \nthe well-being of the American people and particularly those who have \nlost their jobs. So let's put something in place now. Mr. President, \n$350 billion seems to me to be a right size approach to do that for the \nshort term.\n\n  Some people say that is just splitting the difference, 726, 350, it \nis half a loaf. It is splitting the difference. It is the moderate's \napproach to splitting it in half. It is not about splitting the \ndifference, it is about making a distinction. It is making a \ndistinction between what is a stimulus and what is not, what we can pay \nfor now and what we can pay for in the future. That is the difference, \nand that happens to be a major difference.\n  Finally, when I look to the future, I think we all share the concern \nabout the fact that we now have reverted back to using the surplus of \nthe Social Security trust fund to mask the size of the true deficit. As \nI said earlier, we broke that chronic pattern of bad fiscal behavior. \nWe were able to finally realize that moment where we could say that we \nno longer use the surpluses from the Social Security trust fund.\n  We know why we are in this situation today. No one questions that. \nThe question is, how do we get back to where we were? That is my \nconcern. When I look at the long-term projections, when I look at the \nfact that in the year 2013, we will be using $2.5 trillion in the \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses to mask the true condition of the \nbottom line, that is of concern. That should be a concern to all of us, \nparticularly at a time in which we will see as well the first wave of \nbaby boomers retiring.\n  These are serious times. We cannot afford to diminish our ability to \nstrengthen Social Security and Medicare. We have looked to this next \ndecade, the decade we are in, as a window of opportunity to return to \nsurpluses to prepare us for the future challenges. But as we have seen \nover the last 18 months, we can see how projections dramatically change \nand opportunities have evaporated. We know we had a $5.6 trillion \nsurplus just 2 years ago, but we also understand what happened on \nSeptember 11 that transformed this country. We obviously had to address \nemergencies, homeland security, the war on terrorism, and 68 percent of \nthe surpluses were evaporated as a result of the declining economy.\n  So I do believe we need to have a growth plan, but we must exercise \ncaution so that we do not aggravate the long-term picture and threaten \nour ability to address long-term priorities.\n  We have to be cautious because when you have fluctuations, and as the \nones that have been as dramatic as they have been over the last few \nyears, it can increase or it can decrease the amount of revenues that \nare available for other programs and certainly can decrease the amount \nof revenues coming in to the Federal Treasury.\n  Just a 1-percent fluctuation in the GDP can decrease tax receipts by \n$120 billion over 5 years and increase outlays by $52 billion over 5 \nyears--just a 1-percent change. Think of where we have been in terms of \neconomic growth and the fluctuations that have occurred.\n  That is why I think we have to be prudent. The President was right to \noffer a growth plan, but I think we cannot ignore the impact of all the \nchallenges we face. If we step back and take the long view, I do \nbelieve we have to make a decision in terms of how much we can afford \nto do now, and what we need to do is to stimulate the short-term \neconomy. What we cannot afford to do, without paying for it, without \nadding to the deficit, is advancing long-term economic growth plans, \ntax reform, nonstimulative proposals.\n  I hope my colleagues will give this very serious consideration in \nsupport of this amendment. I do not offer this lightly. I have taken \nthis responsibility very seriously. I happen to believe it is important \nto get a strong bipartisan budget resolution with the right size number \nfor a stimulus plan, a figure that will help us get a budget on a \ntimely basis, a number that will help us to stimulate the economy.\n  I happen to believe the amendment we are offering today strikes the \nright balance. It represents the most effective way, I believe, that we \ncan advance a growth plan that can achieve the strongest possible \nsupport but, more importantly, have the maximum effect on our economy \nwithout affecting the long-term future. We know these are extraordinary \ntimes, but I hope we will not abandon our goals for fiscal discipline. \nI hope we will not compound the outlook, the chronic future budget \ndeficits, and diminish our ability to address and finance our security \nin Medicare. We need to lift the economy but without adding to future \ndeterioration.\n  I hope we are not retreating in the notion that we can never return \nto balanced budgets. I hope we will concentrate on the goal of \nreturning to balanced budgets as soon as it is possible. I hope we can \nbegin now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Who yields time on the amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time is the Senator seeking?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I seek 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, before I address the merits of this \namendment, I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for his \nsuccessful efforts to bring a budget resolution to the floor. I would \nlike to particularly commend the chairman for including several \nimportant budget reform initiatives that will control spending and \nimpact the soaring deficit: Extension of supermajority enforcement, \nreestablishment of discretionary spending limits in the Senate, \nreestablishment of restrictions on advance appropriations in the \nSenate, providing a clear definition of emergency legislation, \nreestablishment of the pay-as-you-go point of order in the Senate. \nThose are good things, but I must say I take issue with the \nreconciliation instructions contained in the budget resolution. As much \nas I oppose deficit spending, I also oppose deficit tax reduction, and \nthese reconciliation instructions have the opposite effect of the \nbudget reforms in the resolution.\n  I say to my colleagues this evening that we are on the edge of a \nserious crisis in terms of our Federal budget. In the past decade, \nconservatives worked hard to return the Federal Government to a \nbalanced budget. For a short time after hand-to-hand combat, we met our \ngoal for 2 years in 1999 and 2000. We balanced the budget without \nraiding the Social Security surplus. We had an on-budget surplus. That \nmeans we did not use Social Security in 1999. In 2000, again we did not \nuse Social Security and we had a true on-budget surplus of\n\n[[Page S4118]]\n\n$87 billion. Ever since 2000, we have been increasing our budget \ndeficit to the extent that if the budget deficit for 2003 is projected, \nit will be $408 billion, the largest budget deficit we have experienced \nin the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, as I said, our balancing the budget was short lived. \nToday, instead of reducing our $6.2 trillion national debt, we are \nexpanding it. In 2001, we suffered an on-budget deficit of $33 billion. \nIn 2002, we suffered an on-budget deficit of $314 billion. CBO now \nprojects that if Congress were to go home and not legislate any \nfurther--and that does not include costs associated with the economic \nstimulus, a drug benefit for Medicare, or the war--we would suffer an \non-budget deficit, as I mentioned, of $408 billion. It is clear that \nincreased discretionary spending has led to these exploding Federal \ndeficits.\n\n  This discretionary spending reached a post-cold-war low in 1995 of \n$502 billion. At the current rate of growth, discretionary spending \nwill exceed $1 trillion in fiscal year 2008. In terms of deficits, the \nfuture does not look very good. CBO recently prepared an analysis of \nOMB's budget proposals and, according to this report, if these \nproposals are enacted, we can expect a whopping on-budget deficit of \n$452 billion in fiscal year 2003, which does not include costs \nassociated with war, and $512 billion in fiscal year 2004. Again, that \ndoes not include the costs associated with the war.\n  The fact of the matter is that in 2003 and 2004, if we include Social \nSecurity, we are going to be borrowing over half a trillion dollars to \nrun our Government.\n  Currently, as I said, we have a $6.2 trillion debt. The \nadministration has recently asked Congress to again raise the debt \nceiling. I am sure they are reluctant to come over here and ask us to \nraise the debt ceiling at the same time we are talking about a $726 \nmillion reduction in taxes.\n  The current Federal debt represents an obligation of more than \n$21,000 for each man, woman, and child in the United States, including \nthe Budget chairman's new grandson Nicholas and my new granddaughter \nEmily. Under CBO's baseline, again, assuming Congress goes home and \ndoes not legislate anymore for the next 10 years and spending grows at \ninflation, we will reach a total debt of $8.7 trillion by 2008 and $9.7 \ntrillion by 2012. However, under current policy assumptions, which \ninclude costs associated with economic stimulus and a drug benefit for \nMedicare, but not the war, OMB's budget projects Federal debt will \nexceed $9.3 trillion by 2008. The President's budget did not even \ninclude a projection for debt of 10 years.\n  I say to my colleagues that debt does matter. Every dollar we add to \nthe Federal debt today must be repaid in the future with interest, and \nthere is no way around it.\n  I am also concerned about the seemingly new message which minimizes \nthe importance and effect of the debt. In contrast, Federal Reserve \nChairman Greenspan has consistently stated that all things being equal, \na declining level of Federal debt is desirable because it holds down \nlong-term interest rates, thereby lowering the cost of capital and \nelevating private investments.\n  Even the proponents of using the debt-to-GDP ratio as a measure of \nfiscal responsibility must acknowledge our current situation is not \ngood. As recently as 2000, we had a surplus-to-GDP ratio of 2.4 \npercent. In 2001, when we passed the last stimulus package, the ratio \nof deficit to GDP was only 1.5 percent. Currently, CBO estimates the \nGDP ratio for 2003 will be 3 percent and could go higher. We have \ndoubled that percentage in 1 year without including the cost of the \nwar.\n  In January, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan described the \neffort to bring deficits under control and decisions needed to maintain \nfiscal discipline. He said: Achieving a satisfactory budget posture \nwill depend on ensuring that the new initiatives are consistent with \nour longer run budgetary deficits. As you craft the budget strategy for \nthe coming years, you may want to consider provisions that in some way \nwould limit decreasing tax and spending initiatives if specified \ntargets for the budget surplus and Federal debt were to be satisfied.\n  In other words, in putting our budgets together, we have to look down \nthe road to the day of reckoning when the baby boomers retire and we \nare in a position where we can take care of their retirements.\n  Many foreign investors believe budget deficits demonstrate the \nrelative strength of an economy. In addition, they believe this ratio \ngives a fair idea of Government policies and political aspects of the \nindividual nation's monetary systems. Consequently, the Maastrich \nTreaty requires the EU countries not to exceed a debt-to-GDP ratio of 3 \npercent. When the costs of the anticipated supplemental spending \nrelated to the war are added, the current budget deficit will exceed 3 \npercent of GDP in 2004.\n  The U.S. Federal budget would demonstrate less fiscal discipline than \nEuropean nations are imposing on themselves. This change in perception \nwould tend to increase interest costs for Federal borrowing since the \nUnited States finances a large portion of its debt held by the public \nthrough the sale of T-bills. And it will become progressively more \ndifficult to finance continued deficits or pay future Social Security \nbenefits.\n  That being said, and despite my concerns regarding the expanding \nnational debt, I think most agree that some economic stimulus is needed \nto provide a shot in the arm to our economy, although many economists, \nincluding Alan Greenspan, have said the problem is geopolitical, that \nafter the cloud of a war is over our economy will move forward.\n  Stimulus, I believe, is still needed. But not $700 billion worth of \nstimulus. Our amendment calls for $350 billion in stimulus. And \nrealistically, tax cuts larger than $350 billion appear to have very \nlittle support on either side of the Hill. It might not be possible to \npass any stimulus proposal if the pricetag is too large. The all or \nnothing approach could rob us of the opportunity to give business the \nstimulus it needs. That is unacceptable. We need to cooperate and enact \na $350 billion stimulus package and get the economy moving as rapidly \nas possible.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, when I was Governor of Ohio, if I \nsuggested a $700 billion package of tax reductions to the legislature \nand they came back to me and said on a bipartisan basis, we will give \nyou $350 billion, I would have taken it and ran. We believe that $350 \nbillion will cover what is needed to help rev up the economy, \nespecially given the fact we will be borrowing each and every dollar \nused for the tax cut.\n\n  Reconciliation instructions at the $350 billion level provide the \nfinancing committee the ability to enact one large tax reform proposal, \nseveral small reforms, or a combination of medium and small reforms. It \nis reasonable to expect future economic growth within 10 years would \nbegin to pay for the cost of tax reforms limited to $350 billion.\n  It is also important to note our amendment does not preclude Congress \nfrom passing a larger economic stimulus package this year. It just says \nwe need to pay for it.\n  We should honor the principle embodied in pay-go. If people want more \nthan $350 billion in tax reductions, pay for them with offsets. Even \nproponents of dynamic scoring can see it would take much longer than 10 \nyears for economic growth to begin to pay for tax reductions of more \nthan $350 billion. Although many have agreed to vote for final passage \nof the budget resolution, I can guarantee we will not support a package \nlarger than $350 billion.\n  The Senate should also clearly recognize bipartisanship is the best \nstimulus we can provide the American people at this time. The Senate \ndid not even consider a budget resolution on the floor last year. It \nled to partisan gridlock and failure to enact appropriations bills \nbefore the end of the 107th Congress. Major programs, including many \nrelated to homeland security, were left in limbo. We must not repeat \nthis mistake. The Senate, the administration, and the American people \nare best served through bipartisan support for budgetary initiatives.\n  The people are watching us. They want to see us work together. We are \nat a time of war. Given the current economic and geopolitical climate, \nwe should avoid excessive partisanship which breeds uncertainty and \ndiscourages business investment. Enacting a budget resolution with only \na one or two vote margin tells financial markets that Congress is \nlikely to drag out\n\n[[Page S4119]]\n\nthe whole process, including reducing taxes and passing appropriations \nbills when they are needed. In contrast, enacting a budget resolution \nwith strong bipartisan support will signal stability, tell financial \nmarkets that Congress is likely to manage Federal finances efficiently \nand effectively, and encourage business investment.\n  Additionally, I think it is very important that we act in a unified \nmanner, supporting the President due to the war. I disagree strongly \nwith my Republican colleagues who maintain that not passing the \nPresident's larger package will look bad for him. I don't agree with \nthat. Instead, I believe passing a $350 billion package with strong \nbipartisan support will be looked upon very favorably by the American \npublic, that the Congress and the President can work together to move \nthings ahead on a bipartisan basis.\n  Let's send a signal to Wall Street, Main Street, and the rest of the \nworld that during this time of crisis we are able to overcome our \ndifferences and unify behind fiscal policies with a broad base of \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nyielded to Senators Breaux, Snowe, and Voinovich be taken from the \namendment time rather than the resolution time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Just to comment, first, I respect very much my \ncolleagues, Senator Breaux, Senator Snowe, Senator Voinovich, and \nSenator Baucus for offering this amendment. They come from a centrist \ntradition of the Senate of which I was long a member before I got into \nthis position, and it is really no longer appropriate for me to be part \nof that group. I have enormous respect for them. I thank them.\n  The Senator from Montana is seeking 15 minutes off the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes remain.\n  Mr. BENNETT. How much time would be available on the amendment for \nthose who are opposed to the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak \nfollowing the Senator from Montana in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I revise my request. There are only 7 minutes; we \ntake 7 minutes off the amendment and give an additional 8 minutes off \nthe resolution so the Senator from Montana would have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my fellow colleagues, \nSenators Breaux, Snowe and Voinovich, in support of this important \namendment that works to reach a middle ground.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment and will allow Congress to pass a \nresponsible economic stimulus package, a package that will provide a \nreal boost to the economy while not burdening our future generations \nwith skyrocketing deficits.\n  The budget resolution we are debating today includes a \n``reconciliation'' instruction for the Finance Committee to reduce \nrevenues by up to $725 billion over 10 years.\n  This is the same amount of the President's economic stimulus package. \nAnd while I support tax cuts and have worked closely with the President \nin the past to enact tax cuts, I am very concerned by the size of his \ncurrent package.\n  First, we are at war and the immediate and long term costs of the \nconflict and reconstruction are unknown. Our economy is sluggish and we \nface rising unemployment. This is not the time to enact a package of \ntax cuts as large as the President has suggested.\n  I recognize that the economy needs a shot in the arm. So I have \njoined my fellow Senators in offering this amendment to keep a stimulus \npackage at $350 billion. And ensure that the $375 billion which is \nsaved goes toward deficit reducing measures.\n  Our amendment does not dictate what tax cuts should be passed out of \nthe Finance Committee. It simply reduces the size of the tax cut. And I \nbelieve if this amendment is not passed, the Federal budget and the \nU.S. economy will be hurt significantly.\n  As my colleagues know well, ``reconciliation'' instructions ensure \nthat any legislation that is reported out by a Committee pursuant to \nthose instructions enjoys special privileges when it is brought to the \nSenate floor.\n  That means that the legislation only needs a simple majority of 51 \nvotes to pass. In contrast, without reconciliation protection, \nlegislation takes a supermajority of 60 votes to pass.\n  Legislation under reconciliation instructions is also protected from \nnon-germane amendments. Such amendments can create serious obstacles to \nthe passage of legislation. But passage of a non-germane amendment to \nreconciliation legislation requires a supermajority of 60 votes. And \nthis is usually difficult to achieve.\n  What these special privileges really mean is that reconciliation \nlegislation is more likely to pass the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, passing legislation to reduce revenues by $725 billion \nwould hurt our budget and our economy. I believe the budget resolution \nshould not instruct the Finance Committee to make $725 billion of tax \ncuts.\n  Why do I believe $725 billion of tax cuts is inappropriate? The most \nserious problem is that this enormous tax cut is not paid for. The \nFederal budget is facing huge annual deficits.\n  This is happening at the worst possible time. In a few short years, \nthe huge baby boom generation will begin to retire. The added costs for \nSocial Security, Medicare and Medicaid will put a huge amount of \nadditional stress on our budget. And on our economy too.\n  With these budgetary and economic pressures looming, we should be \nrunning surpluses--not deficits--as soon as the economy returns to full \nemployment in the near-term. We should be retiring debt, not creating \nit when the economy is at full employment.\n  If this amendment does not pass, we are going to add an additional \n$375 billion in debt and deficits during the next ten years. This is \nduring a period when the economy should be at full employment.\n  What difference does it make if we run large deficits when the \neconomy is at full employment?\n  The answer is that large deficits eat up savings that would otherwise \nbe used by businesses to invest in new plant and equipment. Without \nthese investments, the economy will grow more slowly. And our future \nstandard of living will be reduced. As well as the standard of living \nof our children and grandchildren.\n  Once the economy is at full employment, large deficits will also \ncause long-term interest rates to go up. This will increase the cost of \nmortgages. And car loans. This will hurt the consumer. But it also will \nhurt the economy. Because people will buy fewer homes and cars.\n  The simple truth is this. We cannot afford to increase Federal budget \ndeficits by an additional $375 billion. If anything, we should reduce \ndeficits, not add to them.\n  With the concerns about the costs of a war and growing deficits, many \nof you may be asking why aren't we trying to eliminate the entire $725 \nbillion package?\n  The answer is that right now, the economy is not at full employment. \nThat means that we need to encourage more spending. More spending will \nstimulate more production. And that will increase employment and return \neconomic growth to its full potential.\n  The $350 billion of tax cuts that we are leaving intact, therefore, \nshould be used for tax cuts and program initiatives that would increase \nspending right now.\n  And, the incentives to encourage more spending must also be \ntemporary. Once the economy returns to full employment, the decrease in \nsavings that would result from the increase in consumption will reduce \ninvestment. And that will lower our standard of living in the long-run.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that we do not dictate what the tax cuts \nshould be--we simply say the amount should be lower. But I believe \nthere are three specific areas we should consider to effectively \nstimulate the economy in the short-run.\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\n  First, probably the best short-run stimulus is increasing aid to \nstate governments on a one-time basis. The recession and subsequent \nweak economy has severely reduced state revenues. States are facing \nbudget deficits in the upcoming fiscal year of $70 to $85 billion.\n  Unlike the Federal Government, almost all states have annual balanced \nbudget requirements. So even though the economy is weak, States must \nlay off workers, cut spending programs, and increase taxes in order to \nbalance their budgets.\n  These actions make the economy even weaker. They also reduce \nimportant services that state governments provide.\n  There is a remedy, however. By increasing Federal aid to states, \nstates can avoid layoffs. Avoid cutting programs. And avoid increasing \ntaxes. In contrast, any attempts by Congress that lack a state relief \ncomponent will ultimately fail to stimulate the economy. Because \nefforts to spur the economy will fail if, at the same time, states are \nforced to raise taxes, cut spending, and eliminate jobs.\n  Increased aid to state governments should only be made on a temporary \nbasis, however. Once the economy improves, the increased aid must stop.\n  Second, cutting taxes on households who are likely to spend those tax \ncuts quickly effectively stimulates the economy. The President's plan \nincludes an acceleration of many of the tax cuts that were enacted in \n2001.\n  I fully support acceleration of some of the tax cuts that are \nprimarily directed to those taxpayers who will spend most of the tax \ncuts they receive. Such as accelerating the reductions in the marriage \npenalty or the increases in the child tax credit.\n  But, a portion of America's households will not receive any benefit \nat all under the President's plan. Therefore, I believe we also need to \naccelerate the reduction of marriage penalties for households receiving \nthe earned income tax credit. And we also need to accelerate the \nrefundable portion of the child tax credit from the 2001 tax cut.\n  Acceleration of these tax cuts will give the economy a boost in the \nshort run. But without increasing deficits in the long-run. Because the \nrevenue losses are in the years when the acceleration takes place. \nThere is no revenue loss in the years after that.\n  Third, we can stimulate the economy by completely eliminating the \nincome tax on the first $3,000 of wages. This proposal also puts money \ninto the hands of taxpayers who will spend it. Especially if we make it \nrefundable. Which will provide a tax cut to the 30 million Americans \nwho are left out of the President's program.\n  These are just three ways to stimulate the economy--aid to the \nstates, acceleration of some tax cuts, and elimination of income tax on \nthe first $3,000 of wages. Needless to say, there are other proposals \nthat we should consider. Some of these other proposals include \nincreased funding for highway construction, health insurance tax \ncredits for businesses, and allowing small businesses to deduct more of \ntheir investments in plant and equipment.\n  A reconciliation instruction of $350 billion of tax cuts to the \nFinance Committee can be used for several types of economic stimulus \nwithout increasing long-run deficits. But we cannot add to that a \nlarger tax cut that will increase long-run deficits. That would weaken \nour economy. We cannot let that happen.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I also want to say that I will \nbe proposing another amendment this evening, or tomorrow.\n  My amendment is a very simple amendment. It would clarify the \nMedicare reserve fund language to say that beneficiaries who choose to \nremain in the current fee-for-service program which, I might add, is 89 \npercent of all seniors right now should get the same drug benefit as \nthose who choose to enroll in a private plan.\n  Let's put aside the question of whether $400 billion is enough for an \nadequate drug benefit. Having spent a lot of time reviewing the cost of \ndifferent benefit levels, I know that $400 billion buys a rather paltry \nbenefit.\n  But whatever benefit level we can afford with that amount, we should \nmake sure that the same benefit is available to seniors who choose to \nstay in the fee-for-service program as those who enroll in an HMO, a \nPPO or any other sort of private plan in Medicare.\n  I believe that is the commitment many of us have made to our seniors, \nand that is the commitment we ought to fulfill.\n  Earlier this month, President Bush unveiled his vision for Medicare \nreform. I am pleased that he doubled the amount of money he is willing \nto spend on a prescription drug benefit over what he proposed last \nyear.\n  But I am concerned that the President's vision for reform is to \nprivatize the program. He would give a comprehensive drug benefit to \nseniors who enroll in private plans. But those who choose to stay where \nthey are now, in the fee-for-service program, would get only a discount \ncard and catastrophic coverage.\n  That is not something I am willing to support. Let me explain why.\n  First, we already know that private plans have had difficulties \nserving the Medicare population. Many of my colleagues may recall that \nthe reason Medicare was created in the first place was because so many \nseniors were ill-served by the private market. About half of the \nelderly were uninsured in 1965. Because of Medicare, now nearly all \nelderly are covered.\n  More recently, since Medicare+ Choice was created in 1997 to expand \nprivate plan options in Medicare, we have seen a dramatic drop in the \nnumber of HMOs participating in the program. And as a result, an \nestimated 2.4 million beneficiaries have lost their health plan.\n  As you can see by this chart, only 875 counties across the country \ncurrently have a Medicare managed care plan. That is out of a total of \n3,200 counties. So more than 2,300 counties don't have access to \nmanaged care plans or PPOs.\n  Looking at this map, I might add that the counties without these \nplans are predominantly rural.\n  And it is not that plans are underpaid, as some might try to argue. \nThe average payment to Medicare+Choice plans is currently 104 percent \nof local fee-for-service costs. That figure doesn't tell the whole \nstory, but it does suggest that simply increasing payments will not \ndraw private plans into rural areas.\n  My own state of Montana is a good example. The floor payment for \nMedicare+Choice plans in Montana is 128 percent of local fee-for-\nservice costs. Yet, we don't have any HMOs or PPOs in my state.\n  Let me repeat that: despite a payment rate that is 28 percent higher \nthan traditional Medicare, private health plans are still not serving \nMontana seniors.\n  All this leads me to the second reason I do not support the \nPresident's proposal it doesn't save any money. Moving beneficiaries \ninto private plans will not save the program for the next generation \nand will do nothing to address Medicare solvency.\n  We can all talk about coordination of care, disease management, and \nthe potential efficiencies private plans might be able to achieve. But \nat the end of the day, private health plans are subject to the same \ncost pressures affecting the entire health care system. Just look at \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, FEHB. This plan serves \nfederal employees, retirees, and their dependents and has been held up \nas a model for Medicare reform. Yet we find that FEHB premiums have \nincreased, on average, by more than 10 percent each year in the last 5 \nyears. Far faster than Medicare's per capita costs.\n  Third, and finally, I don't support a differential drug benefit, \nbecause it is just not fair to make beneficiaries move into a private \nplan to get a drug benefit. In Montana, virtually all beneficiaries are \nin traditional Medicare. That means, in order for them to get a drug \nbenefit, they would need to drop their supplemental coverage and enroll \nin a private plan accepting all the restrictions, preferred networks, \nand coverage limitations that come along with the plan.\n  For a senior who may be older, used to what she currently has, and to \nanyone with a chronic health condition, this is a frightening \nproposition.\n  As the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Tauzin so \naptly said recently, ``You couldn't\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\nmove my own mother out of Medicare without a bulldozer. She trusts it, \nbelieves in it. It's served her well.''\n  That is the case with millions of seniors around the country. They \nlike what they have now, and they want to stay there. They need a drug \nbenefit, they have been pressing Congress to act for months, years now, \nand they don't believe they should have to swallow such far-reaching \nreforms to get the help they need. And the more we delay, the more \nexpensive it gets to provide this benefit.\n  In the 4 years that Congress has been seriously debating Medicare \nprescription drugs, we have considered a range of options. And we've \nseen the CBO scores for these proposals go up and up as we've taken \nlonger and longer to act.\n  While there are differences in the bills we have debated, they all \nhave one thing in common. They would offer all seniors the same level \nof drug benefit if they chose to enroll in the new benefit. Not just \nprivate plan or HMO enrollees, but all beneficiaries.\n  In closing, I would like to point out that 90 Members of the Senate \nwho are here today voted in favor of legislation last summer that would \nuphold this principle.\n  I think we should keep the commitment we made last summer. I am happy \nto work with the administration and my colleagues across the aisle on \nways to improve and increase private plan participation in Medicare. \nBut we need to make sure that the benefit is provided in full to fee-\nfor-service beneficiaries as well as private plan enrollees.\n  For the sake of America's seniors, particularly the oldest, the \nsickest, and the most frail, and for the sake of America's rural \nseniors, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah is to be recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have been very interested in the \ndiscussions we have had up until now. I think there are several things \nthat need to be said. Even though they have been said before, they need \nto be stressed again.\n  With respect to the projections that are made about the future, and \nthe numbers we are looking at, the one thing we can be sure about, with \nrespect to the projections, is they are wrong. What we cannot be sure \nof is whether they are wrong on the high side or the low side. But we \ncan be sure they are wrong.\n  We also can be sure they will be adjusted, revised, and issued with \nthe same pronouncement of certainty a year from now. They will be \ndifferent a year from now, but we will be told: These are the numbers.\n  The second thing I think we need to understand as we enter this \ndebate is the nature of the recession we have just gone through. I have \nreferred it to as the first recession of the information age.\n  The recession in 1990-1991, I believe, was the last recession of the \nindustrial age. That is why this recession is so different from any \nothers we have had.\n  I want to make it very clear, we are not currently in a recession. \nThe press talks as if we are. I have heard speeches on the floor \nsaying: This is the worst economy in 50 years. This is not the worst \neconomy in 50 years. This is not close to the worst economy that we \nhave had in this last half century, in any way.\n\n  It is different. It feels different. For some people, it feels \nterrible. For other people, these are booming times. If you are in the \nhousing business right now, you say: What recession? Because housing \nhas been booming all through the recession period.\n  If you look at the unemployment rate--when I went to school, I was \ntaught in economics that 6 percent unemployment was full employment, \nthat you could not get below 6 percent unemployment without causing \nstrains in the economy. We proved that wrong in the 1990s. We got down \nto the point where we thought 3 percent unemployment was normal.\n  Well, we hit 6 percent unemployment as a result of the recent \nrecession. We are now backing off from that number. The last number was \n5.7 percent.\n  If we were to take the economic numbers that currently apply to the \nUnited States and transport them to Germany, the Germans would feel \nthey were in the strongest recovery they could imagine, because \nunemployment there is double digits.\n  Last year--a sluggish year, a year that Alan Greenspan referred to as \na ``soft patch''--we grew at 2.7 percent of GDP. The Germans are not \ngrowing. The Japanese are not growing. The French are not growing. They \nwould be delighted to have our numbers. And they are clearly not nearly \nas bad as people are talking about them. But they are a soft patch. And \nthe soft patch is too soft, and it is going on too long. And we need to \naddress the question of what we do about it.\n  I have said, this is the first recession of the information age. It \nis not a recession driven by inventory imbalances which usually has \nsignaled a recession in the industrial age. This recession was created \nby overinvestment, something that in the industrial age we never saw. \nAnd, indeed, as an investment recession, it has to be dealt with with \nan investment solution.\n  We saw the excitement, almost to the point of ``tulip time,'' that \noccurred in the late 1990s. I say ``tulip time'' to refer to the great \ntulip mania of the Dutch in the Middle Ages, where the price of a tulip \nbulb rose so high, as people thought tulips would always continue to \nincrease in value, that families would mortgage their farms, sell \neverything they had, to buy a single bulb, in the hope they could sell \nthat bulb to somebody else for more money later on. When the tulip \nmania burst, the economy of Holland was damaged for close to a century, \nas they had to deal with it.\n  Well, that is an overstatement of what we went through in the late \n1990s, but we went through a fascination with dot-coms and with high-\ntech companies and IPOs, where we had an investment bubble. And the \nbubble burst. When it burst, we had a tremendous decrease in what \neconomists refer to as ``the wealth effect,'' as Wall Street saw a \ncorrection to that overenthusiasm of the time. It was not brought about \nby a traditional business cycle. It was brought about by a new kind of \noverexuberance in the business cycle.\n  The Wall Street numbers were inflated improperly. They had to come \ndown. But when they came down, the confidence was lost, the wealth \neffect was gone, and people who had overinvested then decided they were \ngoing to stop investing.\n  So we had an investment-led recession for the first time. As that \nrecession was coming, but before it hit, we had the projection of a \n$5.6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. That was given to us by \nthe same models that now talk about deficits as far as the eye can see. \nThey were not bad people who made those decisions. The models worked \nthemselves out. The problem was, the assumptions that went into the \nmodels, seemingly logical at the time they were made, produced that \nkind of a situation.\n  What happened to the surplus? We have heard a lot of rhetoric about \nwho is responsible for destroying the surplus. Some of the rhetoric has \nbeen quite political. Let's just look at the same numbers for the $5.6 \ntrillion surplus and say, all right, as we feed in current numbers, \nwhat happened to the surplus?\n  This in dark blue is the Bush tax cut. Yes, that was done \ndeliberately on the grounds that the surplus could afford it. The \nsurplus said we should bring taxes down. I will talk about that in a \nmoment.\n  The gray over here, light blue, depending on what you see it as, 45 \npercent of the loss of the $5.6 trillion surplus is the weak economy \nand changes in the estimates. In other words, these estimates were made \nbefore we realized where we were in the excesses of the 1990s. And as \nthe economy contracted and people changed the estimates, obviously, \nwhile the tax cut represented 25 percent of the surplus, and that was \ndone deliberately, this hit us because we didn't make the right \ncalculations. To be sure and to be fair to the people who made the \ncalculations, they did not anticipate September 11. They did not \nanticipate all of the shock waves that came out of that situation. They \ndid not anticipate what would happen when the economy hit the \ninvestment recession to which I referred.\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\n  The red represents increased spending, increased spending at 28 \npercent. We have spent more than the tax cut. Some of that, again, we \ndid not anticipate. We did not anticipate we would have to spend $40 \nbillion to rebuild New York. We did not anticipate we were going to \nhave to spend the amount of money that we have spent in homeland \nsecurity. We did not anticipate all of the other. But a lot of that \nspending came out of the mentality that, gee, we have a $5.6 trillion \nsurplus; we can spend a little more here and we can spend a little more \nthere. And a little more here and a little more there turned out to be \na lot more when added to the problems. And this is what we get.\n  Now let's put it in 2004 because we have had a lot of rhetoric about \nthis particular fiscal year and the budget we are facing. Here are the \nsame numbers with respect to the projections that were made for the \nsurplus for fiscal year 2004. The Bush tax cut for that original \nprojection of the surplus: 19 percent. It is a smaller percentage of \nthe deficit for 2004 than it is for the 10-year. The weak economy: 51 \npercent. It is a bigger number affecting 2004 than it does the 10-year \npicture. Increased spending, 24 percent; and then other tax relief \nbecomes a bigger issue.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. On the previous chart, if you could go back to that for a \nmoment, might I just ask, is the President's additional proposed tax \nincrease included in that chart?\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. No. This is the tax increase that was enacted.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the tax increase already passed and implemented?\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I could inquire of the Senator, if the additional \nproposed tax increase by the President were added to that chart, can \nthe Senator tell us then what one would see in terms of the calculation \nof the disappearance of the surplus and what is the primary culprit?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I happen to have another chart. I will get to that if \nthe Senator will be patient. I appreciate his willingness to listen.\n  Back to 2004, we see once again the impact of the soft patch. We see \nthat if we are going to look at this and say, what can we do to get \nthis money back, the first thing we can do, the best thing we can do, \nis get rid of this. Fifty-one percent of the whole comes from the weak \neconomy. Another good thing we can do is hold down this: 24 percent \ncomes from increased spending.\n  For those who said, we will solve our deficit problem if we just \nrepeal the tax cut--and we have heard that rhetoric on the floor--no, \nthat is the least effective way to get this back where it belongs. I am \nglad people who have said let's repeal the tax cut are backing away \nfrom that position.\n  Here is another way of demonstrating how the projections went wrong \nand the impact of the spending. These were the revenues in that boom \ntime. And then we began to see the revenues start to slack off just as \noutlays that were increasing at one level began to increase very \nsharply. Here again is the responsibility of where we are.\n  Here is the chart answering the question about the impact of the \nPresident's growth plan. This shows the total taxes that will be paid \nin the next 11 years, $29.3 trillion. And the President's growth plan \nsays we will have $725 billion, or 2.4 percent of that amount, that \nwill come out of the overall pie. If you add the $725 billion to the \n$29.3 trillion that will still be paid, you come up with $30 trillion. \nIt is obvious that the $30 trillion is a nice round figure, which will \nbe wrong. It will once again be wrong on the high side or wrong on the \nlow side, but no one with any certainty can look out 11 years and add \nup the exact amount of tax revenue that will come in. It is simply not \nhumanly possible.\n  The best estimate that can be made says: Well, it will be, and it is \nrounded off, at $30 trillion. So you take $30 trillion, and we are \ntalking about 2.4 percent of that.\n  The net effect of this over the next 11 years is, if I might use a \nphrase we are all familiar with, within the margin of error. It is \nclear that the estimate of what this will be cannot be that close, to a \n2.4 percent accuracy. It is within the margin of error. We are not \ntalking about a major impact. Seven hundred twenty-four billion sounds \nlike a huge amount of money, and of course it is. But when it is \nstretched out over 11 years and when it is compared to $30 trillion, \nthen you put it in perspective.\n\n  Many people say: Why should we be cutting taxes at all? Let's err on \nthe prudent side and get that money in.\n  The fact is, of course, that we cannot assume that if we set the tax \nburden at a certain level, the economy will yield that kind of tax \nrevenue.\n  I was in Ireland with a group of my colleagues last summer, and the \nIrish economy was booming, growing more rapidly than any other economy \nin Europe. We said to the Prime Minister of Ireland: To what do you \nattribute your growth? He said: We attribute it to the fact we cut our \ncorporate tax rate to 10 percent, and we immediately started booming.\n  I will concede immediately that is a simplistic answer and there must \nhave been other reasons involved, but I will not concede that the \ndecision to cut the corporate tax rate to 10 percent was a trivial one \nor that it did not have a major impact on seeing that the Irish economy \nbecame the strongest economy in Europe.\n  I think it is not an accident that they have the lowest tax rates and \nthe highest rate of growth. I think there is some correlation between \nthose two, while conceding that there are other aspects.\n  Let's look at the historic tax burden we have had in the United \nStates measured in the only way that really makes any sense; that is, \nas a percentage of the economy. For those who say: Oh, no, that does \nnot matter, let me repeat again a personal experience that I think \ndemonstrates it does matter.\n  As I have said before, before I came to the Senate, I ran a business. \nWhen I was hired as the CEO of that business, the total debt of the \nbusiness was $75,000. When I stepped down as the CEO of that business \nprior to running for the Senate, the total debt of that business was \n$7.5 million. If you are going to measure my stewardship by the size of \nthe debt, you can say Bennett was a lousy steward and we are good to \nget rid of him because he took a little tiny debt of $75,000 and ran it \nup to $7.5 million, and now we have to pay off that debt and he left us \nin this terrible hole.\n  Let me add a few more facts. When I took over as the CEO of the \ncompany, they were doing about $300,000 a year in total business; \n$75,000 in debt represented 25 percent of the sales and, indeed, \nthreatened the survival of the business because the business could not \nservice a $75,000 debt on $300,000 in sales. Indeed, the business was \nlosing money at $300,000 a year in sales and could not survive unless \nwe did something.\n  When I stepped down as the CEO of the business, we were doing over \n$75 million in sales, and the $7.5 million in debt represented 10 \npercent of the sales instead of 25 percent of the sales. Furthermore, \nwe were earning enough money, our margins were strong enough that we \nhad over $7 million in the bank.\n  You say: Why didn't you pay off the debt? Because the debt \nrepresented primarily mortgages on real estate that had prepayment \npenalties on them. We had borrowed the money to build the facility. We \nneeded to run the business, and it was cheaper for us to earn interest \non the money in the bank than it was to pay the prepayment penalty on \nthe mortgage.\n  I frankly think I did a pretty good job at that company. I think my \nstewardship was proper, if you measure it solely on the basis of the \ndebt, though I took a $75,000 debt and ran it up to $7.5 million. If \nyou take the total value of the company, it was failing, and at the \npoint of extinction with a $75,000 debt, it had a market cap of $200 \nmillion or $300 million with the $7.5 million debt.\n\n  Applying that same principle, and I think it is legitimate to do so, \nwe should look at our debt now not in terms of how big is it in \nnumbers, but how big is it with respect to the size of the economy, and \nit is now at a level with respect to the size of the economy less than \nit was at the time of the Eisenhower administration.\n  The highest point of our debt as a percentage of gross national \nproduct was in 1945 at the end of the Second\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\nWorld War. We were running a total debt of close to 1\\1/2\\ times the \nsize of the economy. Adding in the Social Security trust funds and all \nof the rest of it, it is about 60 percent. We are way below a level \nthat at one time in our history we demonstrated we could survive with.\n  Putting that same calculation to the issue of taxation, here is a \ndemonstration of taxes as a percentage of GDP. We have drawn a line at \n20 percent of GDP. When did taxes get higher than 20 percent in our \nhistory? Once back in 1945, again responding to the Second World War \nwhen we had a debt that was three times GDP, and we immediately brought \nthe taxes down to 15 percent and started to see the economy growing in \nsuch a fashion that the debt started coming down in dramatic fashion as \na percentage of GDP.\n  With the tremendous surge of tax revenue that came primarily as a \nfunction of the high-tech run up in the late nineties and the \nrealization from capital gains when, in this Chamber, we cut the \ncapital gains tax rate so people started cashing in their dot-com \nstocks and paying enormous capital gains revenues to the Treasury, even \nthough the rate went down, the rate went down but the realizations went \nup. We saw, once again, for the first time since the Second World War \nthe total tax take as a percentage of GDP go above 20 percent.\n  To me that was the more compelling argument than the one that even \nthe President made when he said: We are taking too much of your money; \nwe need to give it back to you. I said how does it fit overall in the \neconomic pattern?\n  Historically, when the tax take begins to get up to this 20-percent \nline, it is a signal that you have too much burden on the economy and \nyou need to bring the tax take down below 20 percent. That is why I \nsupported the President's decision and supported the President's \nposition in the Tax Code that said: OK, let's bring it down.\n  You always see tax revenues drop in a time of recession. We had the \ntax cut, and then it was followed by the recession. This is the \nestimate of what will happen under current law if we do not do \nsomething about making the tax cut permanent. We will be in a historic \narea until the tax cut expires and goes back up, at which point we will \nbounce back over 20 percent of GDP.\n  I want GDP to grow more rapidly than Government expenditures. If GDP \ngrows more rapidly than Government expenditures, we have no need to \nworry about the future. But if it does not, we cannot tax our way to \nprosperity. We cannot tax our way to a balanced budget.\n  There have been a lot of quotations of Alan Greenspan around here. I \nhappen to be a great Greenspan supporter. Sometimes I am a little \nsurprised to think I can understand him. I have been in the Senate now \n10 years and on the Banking Committee, and he has appeared before us \nevery year. I am on the Joint Economic Committee, and he appears there \nevery year. For the first few years, I did not break the code, but I \nthink I am now beginning to understand Greenspan speak.\n  This is a point he made to a group of us that I think is essential to \nthis debate: You can set expenditures at almost any level you want. You \ncannot set revenues at any level you want. Revenues are a function of \nthe economy, and if you do something wrong in fiscal policy that causes \nthe economy to fail, you are not going to get the revenues you may \nproject.\n  One can, on the spending side, commit themselves to long-term, built-\nin obligations that they cannot then cover if the revenues are not \nthere. This is the ominous number on this chart. If we can get the \nrevenues back up by getting the economy back up, back to the first \nchart--get this part of it solved, the weakness in the economy--then we \nwill be just fine.\n  Now we come to the amendment. After all of the presentation, we come \nto the question of how big should the growth package be? Should it cost \n$724 billion over 11 years or can we get rid of this part of the \nsoftness for only $350 billion over the next 11 years? I think that is \nthe wrong question to ask because it is a mathematical question to \nwhich there is no correct answer.\n  As I said at the beginning, all of these projections are wrong. All \nof them will be revised. No one can, with certainty, make a prediction \nof what is going to happen in 11 years in this economy and be anywhere \nnear close. So the question to ask is, Will the proposals the President \nhas made actually produce a structural change within the economy that \nhas a chance of dealing with the softness in the economy?\n  I go back to the other thing I said, which is this particular \nrecession was an investment recession. So the fundamental question to \nask is, Will the proposals the President has made address the \ninvestment side of the soft patch we are in?\n  Well, we had a tax cut. Part of it addressed the consumer side and we \nthought: that is going to stimulate the economy. We sent out checks, \n300 bucks for everybody who had filed a tax return. We discovered that \nit was not stimulative. Why not? Because it was aimed at the consumer \nside. It was not aimed at the investment side. And it did not produce \nany major structural change to give us the kind of growth we needed. It \ndid not even hit the consumer side to the point that we projected \nbecause many consumers we now know did not spend it. They used it to \npay down personal debt, which is a very logical thing for many people \nto do. But it upset all of the projections we made of what would \nhappen.\n  So as I see it, the President's proposal has two big groups. The \nfirst group is a collection of tax cuts: the marriage tax penalty, the \nelimination of the death tax, the child credit. That is about half of \nthe $720 billion that we are talking about. I think those are all \nsalutary. I think those will all help, and I am prepared to vote for \nthem.\n  Then we come to the other half, which is the elimination of the \ndouble taxation on dividends. If we pass this amendment, the \nconventional wisdom is that the elimination of double taxation on \ndividends is dead, that it will never come out of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Let me focus on why the passage of the President's proposal with \nrespect to the elimination of double taxation on dividends will go \ndirectly to the heart of the softness on this chart and why it is the \ninvestment solution to deal with an investment recession.\n  If we go back to the excesses of the late 1990s and look at them now \nhistorically, we find that one of the things that drove the excesses on \nthe stock market, and indeed got us into trouble as far as corporate \nmanagement is concerned, was the tremendous desire to drive up stock \nprices. Stock prices were driven up by driving up earnings estimates. \nEnron, WorldCom, and the rest of these companies did everything they \ncould to create the notion that they had tremendous earnings. \nThey drove it up partly by leverage. Leverage, by definition, means \nborrowing, and they were borrowing because they could deduct the \ninterest. They could get the money, they could deduct the interest, \nthey could produce the leverage, and in the case of Enron they could \nlie about it. Make no mistake, there was tremendous greed and chicanery \ngoing on, but the whole system was geared towards debt as the primary \nsource of capital.\n\n  If you go to the equity market and try to entice people to give you \nsound equity investments, you have to say to them, we cannot pay you a \nreturn on your investment because dividends are taxed at an effective \n60-percent rate, so your only return on investment will be if you can \nsell your shares to somebody else at a higher price than you bought \nthem. Sound like tulips? Yes, there is some similarity. The greater \nfool theory--the bigger fool theory: I buy this stock hoping that there \nis a bigger fool than me out there who I can sell it to at a higher \nprice.\n  That is not really the way the stock market works, but that is the \nway it seemed to work in the late 1990s. Remember when Alan Greenspan \nwarned us against irrational exuberance in the stock market? The Dow \nwas at 6,000. Today, it is over 8,000, and we are saying it is the \nworst economy in 50 years. It got to 12,000 before tulip time finally \nhit and it backed down.\n  If we change the situation so a company can go to the equity market \nand say, if you give us equity capital instead of going to the debt \nmarket to get debt capital, we can give you a return on your equity \ncapital that will only be taxed once, we can give you a return that \nwill make it logical for you to hang in with us over the long term,\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\neven if the stock does not go up immediately in the short term, you can \nhold the investment because you are going to get your dividends and \nyour dividends are only going to be taxed once. This is a structural \nchange that the economy badly needs. This is a structural change, once \nagain to quote the guru that has been talked about, that Alan Greenspan \nhas endorsed as good for the economy. This is a structural change that \ncan begin to address the question of the weaknesses in the economy that \ncan have long-term consequences. And this is a structural change that \nwill make us more competitive with the rest of the world because the \nrest of the world does not tax dividends at the same rate we do.\n  That is what this debate really should be about. It should not be \nabout numbers: Is 350 too little or is 350 too much? Is 724 too big or \nis 724 too little? It should be about whether these proposals work. I \nbelieve they will.\n  If we have identified that they will work, then the question is, How \nmuch money do we need to put in the budget to allow them to go forward?\n  So the number comes after the decision of whether the program makes \nsense rather than the number driving the program. In my opinion, this \nis a gamble well worth taking.\n  Back to the total tax take that we are talking about, where the 2.4 \npercent of the estimate is within the margin of error, this is not a \nserious gamble. In my opinion, if one were to say, OK, we are going to \ncut this in half at 350 so the 2.4 percent goes down to 1.2 percent, \nthat is really what we are talking about, 1.2 percent of a $30 trillion \npie when the evidence is overwhelming, in my view, that the dividend \nthing will work.\n  How does it have to work in order to pay for itself? It has to make \nthe economy 1.2-percent more efficient. The studies out of the business \nroundtable from the econometric model down at the University of \nMaryland say this will add 2 points to GDP growth. What will happen to \nthis $30 trillion pie if it grows at 2 points higher than the present \nestimate? It is a gamble worth taking. That is why I oppose this \namendment.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, the reason I inquired of the Senator what his chart \ndepicted was that he has only shown the tax cut advocated by the \nPresident that has already been implemented. He did not show the \nadditional effect of the tax cut the President has proposed, which is \neven larger than the one that has already been implemented.\n  He showed on his chart that 25 percent of the $5.6 trillion surplus \nwent to the President's first tax cut. He does not talk about the \nadditional tax cut that costs $1.9 trillion when you add the associated \ninterest costs.\n  Second point: On the Senator's chart he attributes the additional \ninterest cost of the tax cut to spending. Any fair allocation of the \nadditional interest costs from the tax cut has to be attributed to the \ntax cut, not to spending.\n  Those two things change the picture quite dramatically. What we see \nis, over the decade, if you take the President's tax cuts already \nimplemented and the tax cuts proposed, and attribute the interest costs \nof the tax cuts to the tax cuts, the biggest culprit in the \ndisappearance of the surplus, and in fact, moving to deficit, is the \ntax cuts.\n  The Senator makes a very important point on what will work. The \nSenator believes the additional tax cuts the President has proposed \nwill help grow the economy. I don't believe it. Not only don't I \nbelieve it, but a whole group of economists do not believe it.\n  This chart is the work of Macroeconomic Advisors. These folks are \nunder contract to the White House, they are under contract to the \nCongressional Budget Office to do macroeconomic analysis. What they \nhave concluded is the President's plan will give a short boost--this is \nthe green line--if you do nothing; the black line is if you do the \nPresident's policy. After 2004, they say the President's plan will \nactually reduce growth from what we would have if we did nothing. Why? \nBecause they say, as Chairman Greenspan has said, you will get a \ncrowding out effect because the President's tax cuts are not financed \nby cutting spending, they are financed by borrowing the money.\n  You cannot borrow your way to prosperity. What happens when you \nborrow the money is you reduce the pool of societal savings; you reduce \nthe amount of money available for investment; you reduce economic \ngrowth.\n  Let's talk about real world tests of that theory. In the 1980s, we \nhad a real world test of the notion of running deficits and having tax \ncuts and that would spur the economy.\n  Let me finish, and I will be more than happy to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I just want to talk about your chart.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me complete this thought, and I will be happy to talk \nabout this chart or your chart or other charts.\n  In the 1980s, we tried the big tax cut, the big deficits. In the \n1990s, we tried the alternative, which was to eliminate deficits and to \nhave restraint, to reduce spending, actually increase revenues.\n  I have a chart that shows the long-term spending revenue. This is a \nvery important debate to have. The red line shows spending from 1981 \nprojected out to 2018. The red line is spending as a percentage of GDP, \nwhich the Senator from Utah indicated is an appropriate way to judge \nthese things. I agree entirely. The blue line is the revenue line.\n  In the 1980s, we had an enormous gap with big budget deficits. \nSpending went up to over 23 percent of gross domestic product. In 1993, \nwe passed a plan to bring down spending and to raise revenue. We did \nthem both. The economy was weak. When we did that plan, we were told by \nthe other side it would crater the economy. We were told: You are going \nto increase deficits; you are going to decrease economic growth. I can \nremember the debate in the Senate so well, being told it would crater \nthe economy.\n\n  They were wrong. We raised revenue, we cut spending, and we helped a \nsurge of economic growth unprecedented in our history, the longest \nperiod of sustained economic growth in U.S. history, the lowest \nunemployment in 30 years, the lowest inflation in 30 years. We turned \ndeficits into surpluses, and we did it the old-fashioned way; we got \nrevenue above expenditures.\n  Now look at what happened. Our friends are showing the chart. It is \ntrue, revenue collapsed. Part of that is the tax cuts. It is true that \nspending has gone up. Why has spending gone up? Where did the spending \ngo? In 2001, 73 percent of the increase in spending went to national \ndefense. We all supported it. Fifteen percent of the increased spending \nwent to homeland security. We all supported it. And 7 percent went to \nNew York City relief. We had to rebuild New York. We all supported it.\n  In 2002, 55 percent of the increase went to national defense, 21 \npercent to homeland security, 19 percent to rebuilding New York; 95 \npercent of the spending increase in those 2 years was national defense, \nhomeland security, rebuilding New York.\n  In 2003, 73 percent is defense, 15 percent is homeland security, and \n88 percent of the spending increase went for the purposes of homeland \ndefense and national defense.\n  That is where the money has gone. We all supported it. The question \nis, How are we going to pay for it? What my colleagues are proposing is \nto keep the revenue line down below the spending line for the entire \nrest of this decade.\n  The reason that is so dangerous, in this Senator's opinion, is this \ndecade is like no other in our economic history. What is coming is not \na projection. What is coming is the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration that is going to double the number of people eligible for \nSocial Security and Medicare. It will explode the cost to the Federal \nGovernment of those two programs.\n  Those programs right now are throwing off big cash surpluses in their \ntrust funds, but in the next decade they start to go cash negative. \nWhen they do, that is the very time the President's tax cut, which is \nthe red bar--the trust fund is green, and blue is Medicare-Social \nSecurity surplus, the red is the President's tax cut--the very time the \ncosts explode, the costs of tax cuts explode, leading to deficits \ntotally unsustainable.\n  We just got released today the results of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee meeting of January 28 and 29.\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\nThere is a lag before the releasing of the results of the meeting. Here \nis what the report says: A number of members expressed the hope that \nthe legislation would not encompass provisions that would lead to \npermanently large Federal deficits with negative consequences for the \neconomy over the longer term.\n  That is precisely what is wrong with the President's plan and wrong \nwith the budget plan from the committee. It is going to lead to large \nbudget deficits over time. That is going to hurt economic growth. Don't \ntake my word for it. The deficits in the budget resolution are right \nhere. They are large and continuing. The President's own documents go \nout to 2050 and they show these are the good times. Even though they \nare record budget deficits now, his own documents, page 43 of \n``analytical perspectives,'' show the deficits now are the good times \nbecause, as you go forward and adopt the President's policy, the cost \nof the tax cuts explodes at the very time the cost of the retirement of \nthe baby boomers explodes and you have deficits of such enormous size: \n10 percent, 11 percent of GDP, 2 \\1/2\\ times what they are today. That \nis totally unsustainable.\n\n  The conclusion of many economists is those tax cuts will actually \nhurt economic growth. It is the dead weight of those deficits and debt \nthat will hurt economic growth. The fundamental reason is the \nPresident's tax cuts are not offset by spending reductions. He is not \nproposing offsetting them by spending reductions. He is proposing \nincreases in spending. I do not fault him for that. He is talking about \nincreasing defense--we have to do it; increasing homeland security--we \nhave to do it. But we have to pay for it. If we do not, on the eve of \nthe retirement of the baby boom generation we will saddle this country \nwith so much deficit and so much debt that it will serve as a dead \nweight on this economy and it will inhibit, it will limit, it will \nreduce the pool of societal savings, and it will reduce the amount of \nmoney available for investment.\n  I am not going to take longer. I could go on, on this subject, for a \nlong time. But I am happy to respond to an inquiry from my colleague.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if the Senator will put back the one \nchart, I would like to address that chart. The one which the Senator \nquotes as coming from the President.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes--no, this is not from the President. This is from \nMacroeconomic Advisers, which is under contract to the White House and \nunder contract to CBO.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Under contract to the White House.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. First, let me say, in another time and place, and I know \nothers wish to speak, I think the Senator and I could explore this at \nsome greater depth. I agree with him absolutely that the problem is \nahead in the retirement years of the baby boomers. The place where we \ndiffer is whether this proposal the President has put before us will \nprepare us for a more efficient economy in that period and thereby give \nus the strength we need or whether it will do damage. The Senator \nobviously believes this proposal will damage the economy. I, obviously, \nbelieve it will better the economy.\n  As long as we are quoting economists back and forth, I once again say \nthat Alan Greenspan has endorsed the dividend thing as a logical long-\nterm structural change.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could I just say on that point, you have to read very \ncarefully what Chairman Greenspan said. He said the dividend proposal, \nas long as it is revenue neutral--not financed by borrowing--is good \nfor the economy. If it is financed by borrowing, it is not good for the \neconomy.\n  Mr. BENNETT. When Mr. Greenspan comes before the Joint Economic \nCommittee, I will explore that with him in depth, so we can get it \nnailed down.\n  The point I want to make off the Senator's chart, where he has the \nblack line demonstrating the impact of the President's policy and the \ngreen line representing the base, he shows the President's policy would \nindeed produce a significant beneficial change in 2004.\n\n  The question, of course, is whether or not the projections beyond \nthat are reliable. Once again, my experience in this body is that \neverything gets changed year to year, as you go forward. To get us out \nof this soft patch we are in, it would be very nice to have that kind \nof a spike in 2004.\n  But even if we accept the chart exactly as it is presented, is it not \ntrue that the black line ends up, long-term, above the green line? That \nin the years out there, it shows the long-term impact of the \nPresident's proposed policy is a better economic result than the \nbaseline, and that, if it is true, is the argument I am making that the \nlong-term structural change of the President's proposal will give us, \nlong term, a healthier economy, and long term is where the Senator and \nI both agree the problem lies.\n  With that, I do not want to prolong this. I have taken up too much of \nthe Senate's time on it and I appreciate the indulgence of my \ncolleagues as I have gone on. I appreciate the openness and candor and \nexpertise of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have enjoyed this debate. Let me just say to my \ncolleague, I wish I had--I am asking my staff to get it, but I do not \nwant to interrupt the discussion any further.\n  Let me just say the text of the analysis from Macroeconomic Advisers \nmakes clear they believe the long-term impact is negative. Because of \nthe crowding-out effect, because it is borrowed money, it is because \nthat reduces the pool of societal savings. I have loads of other \neconomic analysis that concludes the same thing. It is what I believe. \nI think it is a mistake. That is where we differ.\n  I am not going to interfere any further in this other discussion we \npromised people they could have. How much time is the Senator seeking?\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 20 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me express my sincere thanks to my good \nfriend from the Dakotas, and thank him for the work he has done on the \nBudget Committee as the ranking member. I thank my friend from \nOklahoma, the chairman of the Budget Committee, as we are seeing that \nbeing on the Budget Committee is one of the most thankless jobs around. \nYou have to read economic analysis, tons and tons of pages, and 50-year \neconomic analyses. Then you come out with a bill that is a series of \nnumbers. It is all supposed to work out. Then people like me come along \nand try to change it. It is with some experience on the Budget \nCommittee that I express my appreciation for the work that has been \ndone.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. BOND. Today, along with a number of my colleagues, I want to \naddress an amendment which is at the desk, amendment No. 358 to the \nSenate budget resolution. I am very pleased to be joined in this by \nSenator Reid of Nevada, Senator Inhofe, Senator Jeffords--all three \nfrom the EPW committee--as well as Senators Shelby, Sarbanes, Warner, \nMurray, Murkowski, Byrd, Chafee, Feinstein, Collins, Specter, Levin, \nLott, Reed of Rhode Island, and Brownback.\n  This amendment would increase the budget allocations to $255 billion \nfor highway infrastructure, and $56.5 billion for mass transit needs \nover the 6-year period fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2009.\n  Before these numbers startle some of my colleagues and good friends, \nlike my friends on the Budget Committee, let me remind my colleagues we \nare not abandoning the ``user pays'' concept of the Highway Trust Fund. \nIn fact, over the past several years, a great deal of money has been \nstolen or diverted out of the Highway Trust Fund, paid in by highway \nusers, that rightfully should have gone for road improvements.\n  For example, highway users started paying a 2.5 cent tax in 1990 with \nthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that never went to road \nimprovements. It went to the general fund instead. The tax even grew to \nas high as 6.8 cents in 1994 and 1995, and over the years, highway \nusers have paid well over $40 billion--that is a conservative \nestimate--$40 billion which never went into the highway trust fund.\n  In addition, the highway trust fund lost revenues as a result of \nalternative fuel vehicles. I support alternative fuel vehicles, whether \nthey run on hydrogen or electricity or some other form of energy. But \nwe also must remember that\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\nthese alternatively fueled vehicles travel on the roads. They use the \nroads. They crowd the roads. They are, in fact, burdens on the roads. \nAnd they must somehow pay some share, just as those vehicles fueled by \ngas or diesel pay for a share.\n  Some very significant constituents have spoken out about the needs \nfor the highway trust fund. I have letters of support, that I will \noffer later, from affiliated labor unions engaged in transportation, \nconstruction, and the broader Transportation Construction Coalition, \nthe Highway Users Alliance, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nGovernors Association, and others.\n  I daresay we have all heard from our respective State transportation \nofficials, our metropolitan planning organizations, from our labor \nunions, our friends in the transportation industries, and others about \nthe needs. But perhaps more importantly, we have all seen the \ncongestion, the potholes covered with steel plates, the bridges down to \none lane.\n  If any of you who have done what I have done, and had an open meeting \nin a townhall forum in the last several months as we came up on the \nreauthorization of TEA-21, you have heard that our citizens are \nconcerned about inadequate transportation. They are really chafing at \nthe bit because in too many areas our country is strangling.\n  Now, we have all waited in traffic, hoped our car's alignment would \nnot be permanently damaged, and looked down through a bridge to see the \nwater below.\n  We have also comforted far too many friends and families who have \nlost loved ones because of unsafe roads or bridges. I still correspond \nwith families who have made getting decent highways their cause to \nremember a loved one who was killed because of an inadequate highway \nsystem with too much traffic on it.\n  Our Nation has some needs. This little chart shows in red what the \nPresident proposed in his budget. What the Budget Committee has come \nout with is shown in green. And what this Bond-Reid amendment would do \nis shown in blue. As you can see, these start going up a little bit.\n  You may ask, what is this big yellow line way up here above all of \nthem, even well above the blue line? Well, it is simply this \nadministration's own estimate of the cost simply to maintain the \ncurrent system; that is, not to get it any better. Just to keep it as \nit is, we should be spending this much, as shown in yellow. Right now, \nthis budget has us spending what is shown in the green. We really need \nto get up at least to this high, as shown in the blue, so we can begin \nto try to keep up with the needs.\n  We know our Nation's transportation needs are staggering and our \nconstrained transportation system is costing our country a whole lot of \ntime and money. We know it is time to do something about it.\n  The transportation system is a lifeline of our country and our \neconomy. I was a student of American history. The economic history of \nAmerica really began when railroads tied together this Nation and \nbrought it as a whole economic unit. Railroads were the tie that bound \nus together in the 19th century. In the 20th century, it became the \nhighway system. The highway system provides mobility. It \nprovides transportation for economic activities. It, in essence, brings \njobs.\n\n  I can tell you, in the years I spent as Governor of Missouri, I spent \nan awful lot of time working on economic development. It was one of my \ntop priorities. And I could see, economic development was going by \nwhere the roads went. If you build a good four-lane road, jobs will go \nthere.\n  Jobs and economic opportunity require good transportation. Not all \njobs. We have e-mail and telecommunications. But distribution requires \na good transportation system.\n  I can tell you, for the 21st century, it is not only good railroads, \nit is not only good roads and highways, it is good transportation \nsystems, it is good air transportation, it is good water \ntransportation, and it is good mass transportation that is going to be \nessential for our growth.\n  Looking at the road side of it, in my home State of Missouri the \nproblems are diverse and complex. To highlight just a few of the \nglaring examples: Commercial truck traffic is expected to increase 89 \npercent by the year 2020. The cities of St. Louis and Kansas City spend \nover $1 billion each year on costs associated with traffic congestion. \nFatalities on Missouri highways are considerably higher than the \nnational average--nearly 7,000 people were killed between 1995 and 2000 \non our highways.\n  How will this broad range of problems be adequately and appropriately \naddressed? The answer simply is investment--investment in the future of \nour Nation's surface transportation to promote safety, to increase \nemployment, to decrease congestion, and to enhance security.\n  In order to meet these needs, Federal, State, and local government \ninvestment will have to be significantly increased. Our amendment we \noffer today will allow it to do so at a very modest rate compared to \nthe true needs, but without raising gas taxes and diesel taxes at this \ntime.\n  I want to emphasize to my colleagues, this transportation \nresponsibility is a duty of the Federal Government. Road building is \none activity that the Government should administer but in coordination \nwith the private sector and other levels of government. If we do not \nwant the responsibility at the national level, or if we are unwilling \nto fund it, then let's quit calling our I-70s, our I-80s, our I-5s, our \nI-95s, and our other interstates by those names.\n  When President Dwight Eisenhower first proposed the interstate \nhighways, if I remember correctly--I was a youngster at the time--our \nNation's defense was the primary focus, the national defense highway \nsystem.\n  Now terrorism threatening our homeland requires an adequate defense \nnetwork to get the people, the law enforcement, the military, to \nprevent actions, to bring in responders where there is an action, to \ngive people a means away from an area of danger. These all require good \nroads and highways.\n  To demonstrate the enormity of this crucial task of relieving \ncongestion and building highway infrastructure, we have to examine the \ncosts involved. A report by the Nation's State transportation officials \nfound that $92 billion will be needed on an annual basis just to \nmaintain the current conditions of highways and to keep traffic from \ngetting worse.\n  However, if our goal were to be as I think it should be--to improve \nsignificantly the overall condition of U.S. highways, enhancing safety \nstandards, reducing traffic congestion; a goal that I think is critical \nto the protection of American lives as well as our economy, the study \nshowed that more would be needed, a total of $125 billion annually.\n  Now, those figures do not even include the additional $19 billion in \ncapital investments required each year to maintain existing road \nconditions and service levels. Clearly, this will be a massive and \nexpensive effort.\n  Increased funding for transportation will also have other beneficial \neffects. It creates jobs at a time when many businesses around the \ncountry are heading in the reverse and are contracting. The added \ninvestment for transportation will serve to directly stimulate the \neconomy. Every billion dollars of investment is 47,000 jobs.\n  Naturally, this will contribute to the prosperity of American \ncommunities by bringing a wide variety of benefits to people in every \nState and every location across the country. The increased investments \nin roads will help satisfy many of our needs currently and for the \nfuture.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's 2004 budget provides allocations \nthat remain wholly inadequate for conquering the ever-growing needs of \nthe people who use our Nation's transportation infrastructure. It is \nthe status quo funding.\n  Again, our amendment will increase spending authority on highways to \n$255 billion and on mass transit to $56.5 billion over the 6-year life \nof the TEA-21 reauthorization bill. As my colleagues know, a budget \nresolution amendment is all about numbers and not about specific \nrequirements. However, I will offer some ideas and thoughts because \nthere is a menu of sources and options, so you can understand where \nthat money comes from.\n  Let me go over a few of the aspects. The $255 billion increase over \nthe budget, where does that come from: 5.2 cents on the ethanol tax \nincentive fix,\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\nsomething the Finance Committee is going to work on; spending down the \ntrust fund balances. This was proposed by the President in his budget, \nand it is proposed in the Budget Committee's markup that we extend \nthat. We provide interest credit on the balances, and we restore a lost \n$8 billion in TEA-21; $8 billion just disappeared from the trust fund. \nWe put that back. We maintain the historic relationship between \ncontract authority and obligation limitations. I will forgo a \ndescription of the contract authority and obligation limits. I don't \nthink it is necessary to add further confusion at this point. But let \nme say we straighten out the problem that the underlying budget \namendment has.\n  Then we ought to have fair share funding for alternative fuel \nvehicles--electric hybrids, natural gas, recognizing the loss to the \nfund for these vehicles which pay little or nothing into the trust fund \nbut cause the same damage to roadways. This is vitally important, as is \ncracking down on tax evasion and compliance initiatives, dealing with \nthose who avoid the taxes or otherwise have been excluded from paying \nfor their use of our roads and highways.\n  This increased investment authorized by our amendment will decrease \ncongestion, enhance security, help to create jobs, stimulate the \neconomy, and, most importantly, will save American lives by improving \nsafety on the highways.\n  These are the highway-related fatalities in thousands, beginning with \n39.3 thousand in 1992, reaching as high as 42.1 thousand in 1996, and \nagain in 2001, over 40,000 people killed in each of these years, too \nmany of them because of inadequate highways. It is not an option to \nstand idle in the wake of these conditions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print letters of endorsement for this proposal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 18, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate begins debate on the Fiscal \n     Year (FY) 2004 Budget Resolution, the 28 national \n     associations and labor unions working together in the \n     Transportation Construction Coalition urge inclusion of the \n     highest level possible for investment in highway and public \n     transportation infrastructure programs. This is particularly \n     critical, as later this year the Congress must work to \n     reauthorize the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \n     Century (TEA-21).\n       Unlike many federal initiatives, investment in improved \n     transportation infrastructure provides tangible benefits that \n     impact the safety and quality of life for every American on a \n     daily basis. An efficient transportation infrastructure \n     system is also a key component of national security and \n     emergency response activities.\n       The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) surface \n     transportation Conditions and Performance Report just sent to \n     Congress provides data clearly showing that a $375 billion \n     federal investment in the federal-aid highway and public \n     transportation network is necessary over FY 2004-2009. This \n     federal share is the amount necessary to begin the process \n     reducing highway deaths and injuries, and the traffic \n     congestion that is costing the nation $67 billion per year in \n     lost productivity and wasted motor fuel.\n       The USDOT report shows that a $50 billion per year federal \n     highway investment is necessary to simply maintain the \n     current physical conditions and system performance of the \n     nation's highways and bridges. A $12 to $14 billion annual \n     investment in public transportation, the report suggests, is \n     necessary to meet our pubic transportation needs. To actually \n     improve these vital facilities, greater levels of investments \n     are necessary.\n       The bipartisan leadership of the Senate Environment and \n     Public Works Committee (EPW)--and perhaps other senators--\n     will offer amendments to increase transportation funding in \n     the FY 2004 Budget Resolution. We urge you to support the \n     Senate EPW amendment, which would provide a very significant \n     step forward toward meeting the needs identified by the USDOT \n     through the TEA-21 reauthorization process.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Transportation Construction Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    National Heavy\n\n\n                                           & Highway Alliance,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: During the debate on the Fiscal Year 2004 \n     budget resolution, there is likely to be an amendment offered \n     by the bipartisan leadership of the Senate Environment and \n     Public Works Committee. The purpose of the amendment will be \n     to increase spending for the federal-aid highway program from \n     FY 2004 to 2009 to a $255 billion investment level. In \n     addition, the amendment will also increase federal transit \n     spending to the $55 billion level over the same time period.\n       Given the recent US Department of Transportation's \n     Conditions and Performance Report, the proposed amendment \n     seriously begins to address our country's surface \n     transportation needs. The funding level contained in the \n     Senate Budget Committee's resolution is completely inadequate \n     to either maintain or improve our highway and transit \n     infrastructure systems as reflected in the DOT Report. We \n     commend the leadership of the Senate Environment and Public \n     Works Committee for realistically addressing the critical \n     surface transportation needs in our country.\n       We strongly urge you to support the higher investment \n     levels in the proposed amendment to help stimulate our \n     economy and to create jobs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Raymond J. Poupore,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist and Senator Daschle: As you debate the \n     fiscal year (FY) 2004 budget resolution, the nation's \n     Governors would like to reiterate the importance of adequate \n     transportation funding levels. The nation's Governors support \n     growth in Highway Trust Fund revenues and an increased \n     federal funding commitment to transportation to enable states \n     to maintain safe, secure, and reliable highway and transit \n     systems. Decisions made during consideration of the pending \n     FY 2004 budget resolution will have irreversible impacts on \n     our nation's transportation infrastructure as Congress moves \n     to consideration of the transportation reauthorization \n     legislation later this year.\n       Transportation infrastructure is the engine that powers our \n     economy. Investments in surface transportation and highway \n     projects provide greater returns than any other area of \n     government spending. In fact, for every $1 billion of federal \n     highway investment, 42,000 jobs are generated. The \n     transportation industry accounts for 11 percent of the \n     nation's economic activity, and accounts for one out of every \n     five dollars of total household spending.\n       TEA-21 significantly increased investment in our nation's \n     transportation system by increasing funding levels to help \n     meet our transportation needs. Historically, however, \n     investment levels in surface transportation have been \n     insufficient to meet the growing transportation needs of our \n     country. In order to maintain the transportation system now \n     in place and address myriad pressing needs, revenues invested \n     in surface transportation must be increased.\n       On behalf of the nation's Governors, we thank you for your \n     leadership and attention to the transportation needs of our \n     country.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul E. Patton,\n     Dirk Kempthorne,\n       Governors.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: As the Senate debates the Fiscal Year \n     2004 budget resolution, the Associated General Contractors of \n     America (AGC) urges you to support the Bond-Reid-Inhofe-\n     Jeffords amendment to increase highway and transit funding in \n     the legislation. The amendment would allow highway funding to \n     be increased to $255 billion and transit funding to $56 \n     billion over the six years in the upcoming reauthorization of \n     the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).\n       The importance of substantially increasing funding for our \n     surface transportation programs is well documented. A report \n     by the American Association of State Highway and \n     Transportation Officials (AASHTO) found that the current $65 \n     billioin annual level of highway investment by all levels of \n     government will have to increase by 42 percent, to $92 \n     billion annually, to keep highways in their current \n     condition, including keeping traffic congestion from getting \n     worse.\n       The AASHTO report found that it would take nearly doubling \n     current highway investments, to $125 billion annually, to \n     imporove significantly overall conditions of the nation's \n     highways, including improvements in safety and reduction in \n     traffic congestion.\n       To begin addressing these documented needs we must boost \n     investment in the highway and transit programs. The Bond-\n     Reid-Inhofe-Jeffords amendment will help address the \n     investment shortfall. AGC urges you to suppoort this \n     amendment, which will enable us to address the needs and \n     improve our highway and transit systems.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Peter J. Loughlin,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                           Governmental Affairs & Federal Markets.\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                    American Road & Transportation\n\n\n                                         Builders Association,\n\n                                                   March 19, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: Thursday, March 20, the U.S. Senate will \n     start debate and then cast votes that will determine the \n     level of surface transportation program funding that will be \n     included in the FY 2004 Budget Resolution. This will be the \n     first important vote in Congress this year on future highway \n     and transit investment. The funding levels adopted in the \n     Budget Resolution will likely frame the parameters for the \n     Senate TEA-21 reauthorization bill that will authorize annual \n     federal highway and transit investment levels through 2009.\n       The bipartisan leadership of the Senate Environment & \n     Public Works Committee and other transportation supporters \n     will offer an amendment during the Thursday morning debate \n     that would boost the Budget Committee's recommended highway \n     funding contract authority level by at least $49 billion over \n     six years. The Bond-Reid-Inhofe-Jeffords Amendment would set \n     total highway investment over FY 2004-FY 2009 at $255 \n     billion--an average $42.5 billion annually. The amendment \n     would set transit investment over the period at $56.3 \n     billion--or an average of 9.4 billion annually. This \n     amendment would go a long way toward closing the $13 billion \n     per year ``maintain existing conditions and performance'' \n     federal highway investment gap and transit needs detailed in \n     the U.S. Department of Transportation's 2002 report to \n     Congress.\n       The federal highway and transit program should be \n     considered one of the nation's most important weapons in the \n     fight to improve public health and safety. Forty-two thousand \n     Americans die each year on America's roads. Over 3 million \n     Americans are injured annually in motor vehicle crashes. \n     Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death of Americans \n     6 to 28 years of age and result in more permanently disabling \n     injuries to young Americans than to any other type of \n     accident.\n       These grim statistics should be an outrage to every \n     American. Particularly when poor roadway conditions or \n     outdated alignments are a factor in nearly one-third, or \n     14,000, of those deaths annually, according to the U.S. \n     Department of Transportation. This unacceptable safety \n     performance can be addressed by upgrading the overall \n     conditions of our highway system, by increasing overall \n     surface transportation capacity, building more forgiving \n     roads, and targeting road and bridge improvements that have \n     documented positive cost-benefit ratios.\n       Motor vehicle crashes cost American society more than $230 \n     billion each year, according to the National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration. That's more than six times what the \n     federal government is investing in highway and public \n     transportation improvements this year.\n       Without surface transportation capability additions, \n     traffic congestions will also continue to increase in all \n     major U.S. urban communities, according to the Texas \n     Transportation Institute's 2002 Urban Mobility Report. The \n     economic cost to the nation in lost productivity and wasted \n     motor fuel caused by traffic gridlock will grow from $67.5 \n     billion in 2000, to almost $100 billion by 2009.\n       Please vote for American jobs, safety and mobility by \n     increasing transportation investment in the FY 2004 Budget \n     Resolution. We urge you to co-sponsor and vote for the \n     bipartisan Bond-Reid-Inhofe-Jeffords Amendment to the FY 2004 \n     Budget Resolution. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                           ------.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to ask my colleagues \nto support the Bond-Reid amendment to S. Con. Res. 23 which increases \nfunding for highways to $255 billion and increases funding for transit \nto $56.5 billion. The amendment does not assume a tax increase. Nor do \nI take lightly that I am asking my colleagues to increase spending. Let \nme be very clear on this next point. This amendment does not have to \nmean deficit spending. There are choices we as a body can make to \noffset the increased spending. I share the same reservations that many \nof my colleagues do about deficit spending.\n  Normally, I would be down here urging you to vote against any such \namendment. I would like you to consider the following before you make \nup your mind on this amendment.\n  The primary purposes of federal spending are to support a strong \nnational defense and to invest in and maintain a strong national \ninfrastructure.\n  Unfortunately, we are coming out of an extended period in which we \nneglected defense spending and we are now having to play catch up. \nDuring the Clinton Administration, 1993-2001, defense spending was $407 \nbillion under the rate of inflation. Yet during that same period, \ngovernment spending increased. This increased spending went to domestic \nprograms. I personally believe that, given this wartime environment, \nthose domestic programs should now shoulder an across the board cut. I \nam not here to make that argument today, but rather to discuss the \nimportance of increased transportation spending.\n  Projected highway trust fund receipts do not support the level of \nspending in the amendment. However, we need to be honest in our \nanalysis and recognize that the lag in trust fund receipts is temporary \nbecause of a slow economy and a sharp increase in the cost of fuel. \nOnce the economy recovers and gas prices stabilize, receipt will \nincrease above the current projections. Additionally, we need to get \nthe revenue currently lost to the trust fund from users of the system \nwho do not pay their fair share.\n  As much as it pains me to say this, this budget resolution fails to \nprovide sufficient funding to maintain our nation's infrastructure, \nmuch less improve it. The Federal Highway Administration's, FHWA, \nrecent 2002 Status of the Nation's Highways, Bridges, and Transit: \nConditions and Performance report states the following:\n\n       . . . maintaining the overall conditions and performance of \n     highways and bridges at current levels would require \n     significantly more investment by all levels of government. . \n     . . the average annual investment [needs] to be . . . 17.5 \n     percent larger.\n\n  The resolution before us sets spending at $30.5 billion in FY04, \nincreases it to $35.1 billion in FY05 and then flat lines it at that \nlevel through FY09, for an average investment of $34.3 billion per \nyear. This represents a significant shortfall of over $80 billion from \n2004 to 2009 to simply maintain the existing system.\n  Again, quoting from the Conditions and Performance report:\n\n       Despite the historic investments in highway infrastructure \n     and improving conditions on many roads and bridges, \n     operational performance--the use of that infrastructure--has \n     steadily deteriorated over the past decade. In 1987, for \n     example, a trip that would take 20 minutes during non-\n     congested periods required, on average, 25.8 minutes under \n     congested conditions. By 2000, the same trip under congested \n     conditions required 30.2 minutes, or an additional 4.4 \n     minutes.\n\n  Colleagues, this resolution simply does not adequately address the \nneeds. The Bond-Reid amendment sets a reasonable spending level of \n$39.2 billion in FY04 and moves us in a direction that at least \nmaintains existing infrastructure.\n  My colleagues on the Budget Committee will argue that this amendment \nbreaks the link between user fees and highway spending because it does \nnot assume an increase in gas taxes. That is not correct. We can pay \nfor this increased spending as I will outline. In the final analysis, \nthe relevant Committees and this body will determine the best ways to \npay for this amendment if we choose to do so.\n  I will now talk about how we can increase spending on transportation \nand pay for it without increasing the deficit.\n  First, the trust fund needs to be reimbursed the $8 billion in \nhighway user fees that were transferred to the general fund during the \ndrafting of TEA21. Those were dollars paid by highway users and should \nbe used on highway infrastructure. This is a moral issue. When the \nmotorist pays the gas tax at the pump, they rightly expect that the \ndollars they pay in taxes will be used for transportation \ninfrastructure. We broke faith with them when we allowed the $8 billion \ntransfer to the general fund.\n\n  Furthermore, we as a nation have made some policy choices to \nencourage the use of certain fuels that cost the highway trust money. \nMost of us understand that the 5.2 cent tax incentive for ethanol use \ncomes directly from the highway trust fund because ethanol users do not \npay the full 18.4 cents per gallon. I believe most would agree that the \nhighway trust fund should be compensated for this amount which is \nestimated to be over $9 billion. A vehicle that uses an alternative \nfuel creates the same wear and tear on the system as a gasoline powered \nvehicle.\n  Additionally, there is a national policy to encourage the purchase of \nhybrid and electric vehicles. While these vehicles address an important \npolicy goal of promoting clean burning transportation, they also cost \nthe highway trust fund money. They either pay a limited amount of fuel \ntaxes because their vehicles are hybrids, or in the case of electric \nvehicles they do not sue gasoline at all and thus do not pay anything \ninto the highway trust fund. Yet the highway trust fund is expected to\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\npay for the infrastructure for their use. Currently there are 640,000 \nhybrid vehicles on the road. It is estimated that by 2009 there will be \n5 million. This is going to be a real problem in the future in terms of \nhow we fund transportation infrastructure. It is irresponsible to not \naddress this before it becomes a crisis. We need to work now on coming \nup with a fair mechanism whereby the highway trust fund is compensated \nfor these vehicles using the highway system. I believe that could \nresult in up to $10 billion of new revenue into the trust fund.\n  Indexing the current gas tax to inflation would result in about a \none-half cent increase per year and yield $17 billion from 2004-2009.\n  Additional options include:\n  Interest on the trust fund cash balance--$3 billion plus;\n  Fuel Tax Evasion Measures--$6 billion;\n  Lost interest on the $8.1 billion transfer--$2 billion;\n  Retroactive Interest on TEA-21 cash balance, 1991-2003, $4.5 billion;\n  Bonding--$30 billion, American Association of State Highway \nOfficials;\n  Clinton Gas Tax Increase Paid into General Fund--over $40 billion.\n  On this last option, I realize it is not feasible, but that doe not \ntake away the fact that this money belongs to the highway trust fund.\n  Added together, these ideas generate more than enough to offset the \nincreased spending proposed by this amendment.\n  Again, I oppose deficit spending and will not ask my colleagues to do \nso. If I did not believe that there was a way to get this spending \nwithout increasing the deficit, I would not be down here today asking \nyou to vote for it. Personally, I support across the board cuts to pay \nfor the amendment, but again, I recognize others do not share my \nfeelings on this and so I have given several very viable options from \nwhich to choose.\n  Finally, I realize that in times of economic downturn and the war, \nSenators are hesitant to further increase spending. I don't think my \nreputation around here is that of someone who goes out of his way to \nincrease government spending. I would hope that most recognize that I \nam a strong advocate of slowing down the rate of government spending \nand in most cases I favor cutting spending. In this instance, I believe \nit is the right thing to increase spending because we cannot strengthen \nour economy unless we have an efficient transportation system. In order \nto improve our transportation system we need to invest significantly \nmore than is assumed by this budget resolution.\n  Today's vote is the first step in drafting a bill that will govern \nhow and where our transportation dollars are spent. If we short change \nourselves today we won't get a bill that improves transportation or \nadds to the national economy. I ask you give the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee the head room we need to write a bill.\n  Support the Bond-Reid amendment and know that it can be done without \nincreasing the deficit by using some of the above mentioned options.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Bond which I am pleased to cosponsor along with a number of \nmy colleagues. This bipartisan amendment would increase highway \nspending to $255 billion and transit spending to $56.5 billion over the \nnext 6 years.\n  This amendment is essential to provide for continued growth in the \nFederal investment in mass transit and highway infrastructure across \nthe country. Together, these increases will ensure that much needed \nresources are in place to help meet our Nation's staggering surface \ntransportation needs.\n  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, expires \non September 30, 2003, and as we move forward, it is important that we \nmaintain our commitment to improving the nation's transportation \nsystems. I believe it is critical that we invest significantly in \ntransportation funding in order to address the growing demand for new \nand safer roads and new and better transit systems for all communities. \nOur transportation systems connect America.\n  Continued investment in these areas helps to relieve congestion, \nstimulate the economy, improve productivity and generally enhance the \nquality and safety of our highways and transit systems.\n  Federal, State and local investment in our nations' transportation \ninfrastructure is vitally important to a growing economy. The U.S. \nChamber of Commerce has estimated that each $1 billion invested in \ntransportation creates 47,500 jobs.\n  Additionally, the Federal investment that we are proposing today will \nleverage State and local dollars, as well as generate significant \nprivate investment in local communities all over this country.\n  This amendment provides additional resources necessary to maintain \nthe gains that have been made in mass transportation and highway \ninfrastructure development. Recognizing these benefits, since 1982, \ntransit has been allocated 20 percent of all new surface transportation \nfunding. This amendment will assure that this balance in funding \nbetween highways and mass transit is continued.\n  Under this amendment, in fiscal year 2009, transit would be allocated \n20 percent of total amount of highway and transit funding. This is \nparticularly important because we have seen evidence that improvements \nin mass transit have stimulated economic growth and enhanced the \nquality of life for millions of Americans.\n  This amendment provides funding to assure that the highway and \ntransit infrastructure is in place to allow our economy to continue to \ngrow. I urge my colleagues to support adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with several of my \ncolleagues to offer an amendment to boost transportation funding for \nthe 6-year period to be covered by the next highway bill.\n  The enactment of a new surface transportation bill will be a mammoth \ntask for the 108th Congress. No group of Senators is more familiar with \nthe depth of this challenge than the principal cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  In my more than 56 years in elected office, I have always served in a \nlegislative body. I served in the West Virginia House of Delegates and \nthe West Virginia Senate. I served three terms in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives before joining the Senate roughly 45 years ago. Over \nall those years, I have been called on to vote on thousands of \namendments. As such, I learned a long time ago to take careful note, \nnot just of the substance of each amendment, but also who is offering \nit.\n  As such, I ask all Senators to take careful note of the principal \ncosponsors of this amendment. They include the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee; the chairman and \nranking member of that committee's Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation; the chairman and ranking member of the Banking, Housing \nand Urban Affairs Committee; the ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee; and, the chairman and ranking member of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n  What unites all these Senators is an acute knowledge of the \nchallenges that stand in front of us as we seek to reauthorize the TEA-\n21 law. What also unites us is an acute knowledge of the true needs of \nour transportation system, whether it is the need to renew our aging \nhighway infrastructure or expand the capacity of our mass transit \nsystems. While we are required to reauthorize every 6 years, many of us \nface these issues every year. Indeed, both Senators Bond and Reid, in \naddition to their authorizing responsibilities, serve with me on \nSenator Shelby's and Senator Murray's Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee. Just last month, we all worked together to reject the \nBush administration's attempt to cut highway spending by some $8.6 \nbillion. We were successful in restoring almost every penny of that \ncut.\n  But when we assess the current conditions of our highway system and \nthe growing demands our society places on that system, each one of us \nknows that holding steady at the current level of funding is simply not \nadequate. And that is what brings this bipartisan group of Senators to \nthe floor today. Together, we are offering an amendment to \nsubstantially boost our level of investment in both highways and mass \ntransit. And we ask all Senators to join with us in this effort.\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\n  In a just a few weeks time, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and the Banking Committee will begin in earnest to draft \ntheir portions of the surface transportation bill. During that time, I \nexpect that each of my fellow Senators will be approaching the chairman \nand ranking member of these committees to articulate the most critical \ntransportation needs for their states. For some Senators, their focus \nwill be deteriorating highway bridges; for others it will be \nalternative fuel buses, or the widening of existing highways or the \nconstruction of new highways. Some Senators will be focused on the need \nto provide seismic retrofits of bridges near earthquake faults while \nother Senators will be looking for new commuter rail lines or even \nferry terminals.\n  No matter what the transportation needs are in their State, I implore \neach and every Senator to reflect seriously on these needs before they \ncome to the floor and vote against this amendment.\n  Much has been said over the last week about the need for this budget \nresolution to be based on the true budgetary realities that we face as \na nation. We need to focus on the real world cost of the war. We need \nto focus on the real costs of a meaningful prescription drug benefit \nfor our Medicare recipients.\n  Here are some other real world facts that we must attend to:\n  Approximately 30 percent of the bridges along our Nation's highway \nsystem are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n  It would require $42 billion more in annual investment to actually \nmake progress to improve the conditions of our Nation's highways. Put \nanother way, if we continue as a nation to provide only inflationary \nincreases in the current rate of highway spending, the condition of our \nNation's highways will just continue to deteriorate.\n  These are not the observations of Robert C. Byrd--they are the \nobservations of the Bush administration's own report on the Condition \nand Performance of our National Transportation System.\n  We must face these realities head on as we draft the next surface \ntransportation bill. And to do so, we are going to need more \nresources--far more resources than are called for under the budget \nresolution we are currently debating.\n  So I urge all Senators to join with me and the leadership of both the \ntransportation authorizing committees and the transportation \nappropriations subcommittee in setting us on a path where we can make \nmeaningful improvements to our highway and transit systems. I commend \nthe bipartisan leadership of the transportation authorizing committees \nand I intend to stand with them as we seek to advance the cause of our \nNation's mobility and prosperity.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to voice my strong support for the \nBond-Reid amendment to ensure that we invest in our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  Time and again, in our daily lives and in the news we hear and see \nthat our Nation's roads and transit systems are crowded. On our way to \nwork or on our way to visit family, we spend countless hours stuck in \ntraffic or waiting for a bus.\n  But this congestion is more than just a personal inconvenience. \nIndeed, we know from studies by the Texas Transportation Institute and \nothers that traffic congestion costs our economy $67.5 billion every \nyear. That's billions in lost productivity.\n  Sadly, the budget resolution before us fails to provide the resources \nneeded to meet these demands. It even fails to meet the level of \nfunding that the administration's own Department of Transportation \nbelieves are necessary if one reads the DoT's report on the conditions \nand performance of our Nation's highways and transit systems.\n  Fortunately, the bipartisan amendment offered by the Senate's leaders \non transportation policy would ensure that we have the resources to \nmaintain and modernize our roads, bridges, and transit systems.\n  By providing a total of $255 billion for highways and $56.5 billion \nfor transit, this amendment makes sure we have the resources to repair \naging bridges and improve transit service.\n  Last year, as the chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over \nour Nation's transit programs, we heard repeatedly from witnesses who \nrepresented transit systems of all sizes from all over the country \nabout the success of TEA-21. When I asked why TEA-21 was successful, \nevery witness had the same answer: resources. It was the resources that \nbrought fast, environmentally sound transit to growing cities like \nDenver and helped transit attain the highest growth rate of any mode of \ntransportation. This amendment will ensure that we continue this \nsuccess.\n  In addition, during a time of economic uncertainty, this amendment \nmeans jobs and a great stimulus to our economy. Indeed, an estimated \n47,000 well-paying jobs are created for each $1 billion we invest in \ntransportation.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Bond, Reid, Shelby, and \nSarbanes, for their leadership on this amendment. I look forward to its \npassage and preservation in conference with the House.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, a few days ago I spoke about the serious \nconcerns I had with the budget resolution that was proposed by the new \nmajority. One of the areas where the resolution before us falls \nwoefully short is transportation funding. We have an opportunity before \nus to increase funding for Federal highway and transit programs by \nadopting the Bond/Reid amendment.\n  As all Senators know, this year the Congress is scheduled to \nreauthorize the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century also \nknown as the TEA-21. This bill includes resources not just for \nhighways, but for highway safety and mass transit. This will be an \nenormous task for four separate Senate authorizing committees and will \nrequire a great deal of resources if we are to be able to develop a \nconsensus package that will get on and off the Senate floor.\n  What we do in this budget resolution will set the stage for TEA-21 \nreauthorization and demonstrate to the American people just how \ncommitted we are to investing in our nation's transportation \ninfrastructure; to reducing congestion and improving the environment in \nour cities; to making our transportation system safer; and to putting \npeople back to work. Simply put, the budget resolution as currently \nwritten simply doesn't do enough.\n  The amendment before us would increase the highway program to $255 \nbillion and the transit program to $56.5 billion over the next 6 years. \nThe Federal Highway Administration's own ``Conditions and Performance \nReport'' states that in order to improve our aging transportation \ninfrastructure we should be investing an additional $42 billion in \nhighways and bridges and $20 billion in mass transit each year.\n  The benefits of increasing transportation funding are multifaceted. \nFirst and most importantly, increased transportation investment will \nhelp stimulate our struggling economy since every billion dollars of \nhighway funding generates 47,500 jobs and every dollar in transit \ninvestment generates $6 more in economic returns. I don't know about \nyour State, but in my home State of Washington, we can use every bit of \neconomic stimulus that we can get because Washington State was ranked \neither first or second in the Nation's unemployment rate for much of \nthe last two years and we have lost a staggering 74,000 jobs in the \nlast 18 months.\n  Second, improving our nation's highways and transit systems will also \nmean that Americans will spend less time in traffic and more time with \ntheir families and loved ones. And the people of Washington State--\nparticularly in the Everett to Seattle corridor--know something about \ncongestion and the toll it takes on family life and the pocketbook \nsince this area is ranked third in the nation in congestion. \nNationwide, the value of travel delay and wasted fuel that occurs in \ncongested traffic is estimated at over $67 billion annually.\n  And finally, every year over 40,000 Americans die on our Nation's \nroads and highways--we need to continue to invest in transportation to \nmake sure our infrastructure is safe; that trucks and vehicles meet \nsafety standards; and that Americans drive responsibly by wearing their \nseatbelts and without the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n  We have much work ahead of us as we move forward with TEA-21 \nreauthorization. We have an opportunity to\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\nhelp our economy by creating good transportation jobs and to improve \nthe quality of life for millions of Americans by ensuring that we have \na transportation system that is safe and efficient. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Bond-Reid amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ben Nelson be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont is seeking time. \nI propose that he take 15 minutes off the amendment of the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont off of which \namendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Bond amendment is not pending.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I don't think it makes much difference. Does it make a \ndifference to you, Mr. Chairman? I took Senator Bond's time off the \nresolution. I am not sure it makes much difference, whichever one is \ntop on your list there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bond-Reid \ntransportation amendment. This is probably the most important amendment \nwe will vote on in the next few days, as far as really doing something \nmeaningful to our economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bipartisan Bond-Reid \namendment on transportation offered by the chairman of the \nTransportation Subcommittee--Senator Bond--and the ranking member, \nSenator Harry Reid and myself.\n  I appreciate the strong leadership in this effort provided on the \nRepublican side by Senators Inhofe, Bond, Shelby and many others.\n  On the Democrat side, Senator, Harry Reid has done a tremendous job. \nI want to note that Senator Sarbanes has taken the lead on transit with \nSenator Shelby.\n  The Bond-Reid amendment will allow the Congress to write a strong \ntransportation bill which, in part, can address many of the \nadministration's ideas for enhancing the mobility and security of our \ntransportation modes.\n  The chairman of the full EPW Committee, Chairman Inhofe, supports \nthis effort, as do I as ranking member of the EPW Committee.\n  The chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senators \nShelby and Sarbanes, with jurisdiction over transit issues, also \nsupport this amendment.\n  This amendment allows us to enhance the security of our vital \ntransportation networks, to better protect against the unexpected, and \nto enhance the mobility of our citizens and commerce.\n  This amendment will also create hundreds of thousands of jobs and \nallow Congress to fund important transportation components--such as \nintelligent transportation systems--to better monitor and move people \nduring rush hours, and during emergencies. This is real economic \nstimulus. More than anything else we are doing.\n  These funds can also be used to facilitate secure and efficient \ninternational border crossings and fund administration security \nproposals.\n  This will be important for States sharing borders with Canada or \nMexico, such as my home State of Vermont.\n  President Eisenhower saw our highways as important to the national \ndefense--and the economy--and it appears that this Administration will \nrecommend provisions to the Congress which they see as critical.\n  A report by the Nation's State transportation official found that \nFederal, State, and local governments must significantly increase \ninvestment in highways and bridges to improve safety enhance security \nrelieve congestion, and protect bridges and harbors.\n  According to that national study, we must invest $92 billion annually \nto just to maintain current conditions, and improving the system's \nconditions and performance would cost $125 billion annually.\n  This bipartisan amendment will increase the highway program to $255 \nbillion over the next 6 years and will proportionately increase transit \ninvestments to $56.5 billion.\n  This amendment will thus significantly increase the number of well-\npaying construction jobs and improve the safety and security of our \ncitizens.\n  This amendment is the first step toward a strong bipartisan effort to \nrevitalize our Nation's economy through investments in transportation.\n  The spending that we authorize today will help Vermont and all our \nStates, keep pace with road and bridge repair, transit demand and \nimproved safety and security needs. We will supplement this spending by \nattracting private capital to expand freight capacity and relieve \ncongestion.\n  I hope we can pass this amendment with the support of all of my \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, which was jurisdiction \nover the Federal transit program, I am pleased to join in this effort \nwith Chairman Shelby and Senator Jack Reed, ranking member of the \nHousing and Transportation Subcommittee, as well as my colleagues on \nthe Enviroment and Public Works Committee, Senators Bond, Reid, Inhofe, \nand Jeffords, and my other colleagues who support this important \namendment.\n  As has already been noted, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury, known as TEA-21, will expire on September 30 of this year. \nThis Congress will have the opportunity to craft legislation that will \nshape America's surface transportation system for the next decide and \nbeyond. The decisions we make will be critically important to our \nNation's future economic strength, the quality of our environment, and \nour national security. Therefore, as we consider this budget \nresolution, and engage in the debate about how best to use our limited \nFederal resources, I believe it is appropriate to take a few moments to \nconsider what is contained in this budget resolution, what this \namendment seeks to accomplish, and the importance of our surface \ntransportation system for America's future.\n  Unfortunately, the budget resolution before us does not come close to \nmaking the necessary investment in surface transportation. Instead, the \nbudget as written would actually cut the highway program next year, \ngrow funding somewhat the following year, and then flat-line the \nprogram for the remainder of the authorization period. The budget's \nnumbers for transit call for annual increases below the President's \nprojected rate of inflation, not to mention the projected ridership \ngrowth. This budget calls for only $206 billion for highways and $46 \nbillion for transit over the next 6 years, far less than what is \nneeded. I am deeply concerned that this budget would move us backward, \nnot forward, in our efforts to meet the mobility needs of the Nation.\n  This amendment would grow these programs by $49 billion and $10.5 \nbillion respectively over what is included in the budget resolution, \nincreasing investment in our highway program to $255 billion over the \nnext 6 years, and our transit program to $56.5 billion. By growing our \ninvestment, we will not only help to preserve and maintain the systems \nthat we have in place, we will begin to make progress toward \nimprovement. Further, by the end of the next reauthorization cycle, \nsurface transportation investment will reach its goal of a 4 to 1 \nbalance between highways and transit. This goal was established in TEA-\n21, and this amendment reaffirms that decision.\n  The transportation needs of this Nation are significant, as more and \nmore communities find themselves confronting the problems of traffic \ncongestion and delay. According to the Texas Transportation Institute, \nin the year 2000, Americans in 75 urban areas spent 3.6 billion hours \nstuck in traffic, with an estimated cost to the nation of $67.5 billion \nin lost time and wasted fuel. As these figures show, congestion has a \nreal economic cost to the nation, in addition to the psychological and \nsocial costs of spending hours each day sitting in traffic. It is clear \nthat we must increase the capacity of our transportation infrastructure \nto handle the growing demands for mobility of both people and goods to \nkeep our economy moving.\n  Investment in our transportation infrastructure has other economic \nbenefits as well. According to the U.S.\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\nChamber of Commerce, each $1 billion invested in transportation \ninfrastructure creates 47,500 jobs. At a time when our economy is \nstruggling, investing in transportation is one of the smartest actions \nthat government can take. Increased investment creates jobs today and \nleads to economic growth tomorrow.\n  Let me take a few moments to focus on the transit program, which I \nhave a particular interest in as the ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee. During the last Congress, that Committee, along with the \nHousing and Transportation Subcommittee, chaired by my colleague \nSenator Reed, held a series of eight hearings to begin laying the \ngroundwork for the reauthorization. What those hearings clearly \ndemonstrated is that investing in transportation, particularly public \ntransportation, pays off in terms of economic, environmental, and \nmobility benefits for our nation.\n  TEA-21's increased investment in transit stimulated a surge in \ntransit ridership. As Federal Transit Administrator Jennifer Dorn \ntestified last April: ``Transit has experienced the highest percentage \nof ridership growth among all modes of surface transportation, growing \nover 28 percent between 1993 and 2001.''\n  Of course, the benefits of TEA-21's investment are broader than \nincreased ridership. The economic development impact of transit is \nbecoming more and more apparent as new systems have come into service \nunder TEA-21. For example, the Banking Committee heard testimony that \nover $1 billion has been invested in private development along Dallas's \nexisting and future light rail lines, raising nearby property values \nand supporting thousands of jobs. We learned that BellSouth relocated \nalmost ten thousand employees from scattered sites in suburban Atlanta \nto three downtown buildings near MARTA rail stations, in part because, \nin the words of BellSouth Vice President Herschel Abbott, commuting by \ntransit ``saves employees time. It saves employees money. It saves wear \nand tear on the employees' spirit.'' And that has real returns for \ntheir employer.\n  Transit is about more than our economic life; it is also about our \nquality of life. During the Committee's hearings, we heard a great deal \nabout the importance of transit to our senior citizens, young people, \nthe disabled, and others who rely on transit for their daily mobility \nneeds. Several of our witnesses observed that the increased investment \nin transit and paratransit services under TEA-21 has provided the \ncrucial link between home and a job, a school, or a doctor's office, \nfor millions of people who might otherwise have been unable to \nparticipate fully in the life of their communities.\n  And transit can be a lifetime in other ways as well, as we discovered \non September 11, 2001. We heard testimony during our hearings about the \nefforts made by transit operators on that day to move thousands of \npeople quickly and safely out of city centers. As more and more \nAmericans are using public transportation, it is clear that transit \nmust be a vital component of any city's evacuation plan.\n  While September 11 showed the importance of transit in responding to \nan emergency, it also raised our awareness of the unique challenges \ntransit faces in the safety and security area, as several witnesses \ndiscussed. Transit agencies are taking great pains to improve the \nsecurity of their systems, but these efforts are not without cost.\n  It is clear to me that we will have to greatly increase Federal \nsupport for transportation to help local communities make the \ninvestments in infrastructure and system preservation that will be \nrequired to move America into the 21st century. The Department of \nTransportation has identified $14 billion per year in capital needs \nsimply to maintain the conditions and performance of our transit \nsystems--$20 billion is needed to improve conditions and performance. \nOther estimates show an even greater need. A report by the Nation's \nState transportation officials estimated that an annual investment of \n$19 billion is needed just to maintain our transit systems at their \ncurrent levels, and $44 billion would be needed to improve conditions \nand performance. According to the same study, almost $100 billion is \nneeded annually just to maintain the current condition of our nation's \nroads and bridges. Failure to make the needed investment will result in \nthe continued deterioration of our existing infrastructure.\n  As we debate the priorities of this Nation in the context of this \nBudget Resolution, I urge my colleagues to be mindful of a comment that \nDr. Beverly Scott, then General Manager of the Rhode Island Public \nTransportation Authority, made before the Banking Committee on April \n25, 2002, regarding the reauthorization of TEA-21. Dr. Scott said: ``As \nAmericans, mobility is one of the greatest and most precious freedoms \nthat we enjoy. This basic cornerstone of American life--who can or \ncannot get from place to place, how we plan and conduct our daily \nlives, the choices we make about what we do, and even more importantly, \nwhat we can do--are hanging in the balance.'' That is what is at stake \nhere. This Congress will shape the future of transportation in \nAmerican, which will have a very real impact on every one of our \ncitizens. Passage of this amendment is essential if we are to keep \nAmerica moving. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment to \nincrease highway and transit spending levels in the budget resolution.\n  Increasing transportation spending is an important objective. Highway \ninvestments create jobs, increase the productivity of our economy, and \nimprove the quality of life for all Americans. In Montana, its our \nlifeblood. We count on highway money for our economic development and \nwe count on transit money to give our rural areas access to goods and \nservices and people.\n  In 1998 Congress passed one of the most successful and bipartisan \nbills in recent memory--the ``Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury'', better known as ``TEA-21.'' I am honored to have been an \nauthor of that piece of legislation and I look forward to working on \nthe next reauthorization act.\n  TEA-21 passed overwhelmingly in 1997 because there was a 40 percent \nincrease, on average, in funding. So, even if some states got a lower \npercentage of funds than their neighbor, everyone brought home more \ndollars than under ISTEA. That 40 percent increase was primarily \nderived by the transfer of the 4.3 cent gas tax from the general fund \nto the Highway Trust Fund, the new budgetary treatment for highways and \nthe ``protected'' status of the Highway Trust Fund.\n  We are hoping to build on the success of TEA-21 by ensuring that our \nBudget Resolution can accommodate higher levels of spending for \nhighways and transit. These higher levels of spending will enable the \nsuccessor to TEA-21 to become law.\n  In order to pass a TEA-21 reauthorization bill, we will need more \nmoney. Increasing funds into the Highway Trust Fund is the sole \nresponsibility of the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Grassley and I \nhave been working very hard to find ways to increase funding for both \nhighways and transit. We are absolutely committed to growing the \nprograms without raising taxes.\n  I can't emphasize enough that the single principal feature of any new \nhighway reauthorization bill has to be its increased funding for the \nprogram, something that will help all States and all citizens. Our \nfirst step is this blueprint for our budget.\n  The Finance Committee believes that the levels included in this \namendment to the Budget Resolution can be reached. $255 billion for \nHighways and $56.5 billion for transit over 6 years can be achieved \nwithout raising taxes. I know this because over the past 3 months \nfinding this money has been a priority for myself and my chairman, \nSenator Grassley.\n  Let me sum up by saying that the Senate Finance Committee has the \nresponsibility to figure out how to grow the highway and transit \nprograms. We believe that we can come up with increased funding for \nboth highways and transit. We can do it without raising taxes. This \namendment gives us the room to achieve that.\n  I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote yes for \nincreased investment in infrastructure. I say both sides of the aisle \nbecause, as I've said in the past, there are no Democratic roads or \nRepublican bridges. We will all benefit from this investment. We should \nall support it.\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, being authorized by the ranking member of \nthe committee, I will speak on the amendment that is almost pending, we \nthought it was pending, whatever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. The Bond amendment.\n  This is a really fantastic proposal of the Senator from Missouri. It \nis sponsored by the chairman of the committee, Senator Inhofe; the \nranking member, Senator Jeffords; the chairman of the subcommittee on \ntransportation, Senator Bond; the ranking member of the subcommittee, \nthe Senator from Nevada; the chairman of the full Banking Committee \nwhich handles transit matters, Senator Shelby; the ranking member of \nthe Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes; and many others.\n  I thank my friend from Missouri, Senator Bond, for his work on this \namendment. He has shown great leadership. I am pleased to join him in \nsponsoring this bipartisan highway and transit amendment.\n  This amendment represents an important step in the reauthorization of \nthe country's surface transportation system. We made significant gains \nover the life of TEA-21, and we must keep this momentum as we move \nforward. Despite these gains in TEA-21, there is much that remains to \nbe done.\n  This budget debate is about choices, and I understand that. I also \nunderstand that we need to prioritize given these perilous times. I \nfirmly believe that a well-maintained transportation infrastructure is \na foundation for a healthy, vibrant national economy.\n  Our Nation's surface transportation system is critical to the free \nflow of citizens and the free flow of commerce.\n  This amendment adds an additional $50 billion for highways and $10 \nbillion for transit over the next 6 years. The Federal Highway \nAdministration's 2002 Conditions and Performance Report estimates that \nthe annual Federal investment in roads must increase by 17 percent per \nyear simply to maintain the Nation's existing highway and bridge \nsystem.\n  I will not take a lot of time, but the Senator from Louisiana, who is \non the floor, has brought to my office on two separate occasions people \nfrom Louisiana who have desperate needs for transportation improvement. \nIt is critical that we get more money for programs that can meet the \ndemands of the folks from Louisiana and the folks from Nevada. It can \nonly be done if this amendment is adopted. I hope it does.\n  Improving the system will cost more than the report of the estimates \nof Federal investment of roads needing to be increased by 17 percent. \nThis administration calculates current Federal investment must increase \nby as much as 65 percent to basically improve our Federal \ninfrastructure as it relates to highway.\n  As the Senator from Missouri has indicated with his charts, safety is \nstill a serious problem. When 45,000 people a year are being killed on \nthe roads, I think that says it all. In addition to the people who are \nkilled, we have people who are paraplegic, quadriplegic, people who are \nhurt in many different ways in automobile accidents that are caused \nbecause of unsafe highways.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, our Nation's fatality \nrate per million vehicle miles traveled has decreased, but the number \nof fatalities has increased, with the disproportionate share of these \noccurring on rural roads. We really do not give any attention to speak \nof to rural roads.\n  In addition to the personal tragedy associated with traffic \naccidents, accidents cost an estimated $137 billion per year in \nproperty losses, losses in productivity, and medical costs.\n  System maintenance costs do not include the cost to improve the \nsystem's access and mobility to allow for the efficient and timely flow \nof citizens and commerce throughout the country.\n  America's congestion problems continue to get worse. The Texas \nTransportation Institute estimates this year residents in the top 75 \nmetropolitan areas will lose more than 3.6 billion hours due to traffic \ncongestion and $67 billion in wasted time and fuel.\n  The problems in Washington, DC, are legendary, but as a result of the \nman with the tractor in the reflecting pool, it took one of my friends \ntraveling from over the bridge in Virginia 2\\1/2\\ hours to get to work \nbecause of the added congestion because of the tractor in the \nreflecting pool. Traffic in Washington, DC, and the rest of the country \nis in deep trouble.\n  The Governor of the State of Nevada, a friend of mine by the name of \nKenny Guinn, has written a letter dated yesterday. He is a Republican \nGovernor. He supports this amendment. It is important because the \npopulation of the State of Nevada has increased during the past 10 \nyears by 64 percent, and this problem is going to continue to grow.\n  We in Nevada are not depending on the Federal Government alone to \nsatisfy the needs of highways. In fact, the State of Nevada spends more \nby some $40 million than the Federal Government. This is very rare. The \nGovernor of the State of Nevada fully endorses this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter dated March 19 from Gov. \nKenny Guinn, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                    Las Vegas, NV, March 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Assistant Minority Leader, S-321, The Capitol, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: I am writing to express my support for \n     your efforts to increase funding for the federal highway and \n     transit program to $255 billion and $55 billion over the next \n     five years. The amendment you along with a bipartisan group \n     of eight senators have proposed to the Senate Budget \n     Resolution is critical to Nevada's continued economic \n     vitality.\n       As you know, our state has experienced the largest growth \n     rate in the nation. The population of Nevada is currently \n     estimated to grow to 2.44 million residents by 2005, a 64% \n     increase from 1994. These new residents have put \n     unprecedented demands on Nevada's transportation \n     infrastructure.\n       The federal highway and transit programs have been critical \n     in our ability to meet these demands. While we could not have \n     kept pace with our transportation needs without the federal \n     program, Nevada has not shirked its responsibilities either. \n     Nevada's revenue derived from our own citizens has risen from \n     $279.5 million to $365.7 million in 2002. This 31% increase \n     in revenue from state sources is in addition to the $234.7 \n     million Nevada received in federal funds in 2002. Nevada's \n     local jurisdictions have stepped up to the plate with self-\n     imposed taxes to supplement the state and federal \n     contribution, as well. Just this past year Washoe and Clark \n     County voters approved increased local taxes to pay for \n     transportation needs.\n       Under TEA-21 Nevada has experienced a steady increase in \n     federal funds that has kept pace with our own contributions. \n     Without similar expansion under the coming reauthorization \n     bill we will fall behind, endangering our economic future \n     with clogged highways, compromised traffic safety, and \n     decreased air quality.\n       Thank you again for your support of Nevada's transportation \n     needs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kenny C. Guinn,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I indicated that the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Shelby, and the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, \nhave also approved this legislation. The reason they do so is because \nthey are responsible for the transit aspect of the highway bill.\n  In years past, we divided the money we get on highways; 20 percent of \nit basically goes to transit. Why? For every person who is riding on a \ntrain, that is that much less traffic congestion and burden on our \nhighways. It has worked well for decades. We need to continue that.\n  This amendment recognizes additional highway capacity alone will not \nsolve the problems of congestion; therefore, we should provide \nAmericans with other transportation options such as transit. It is part \nof important congestion relief. It is also a lifeline for millions of \nAmericans to health care, to jobs, and to schools.\n  Nevada is an example. Ten years ago, for us to talk about needing \ntransit money would have been unheard of. But now we are badly in need \nof it. We are building the only commercial monorail that will go from \nthe airport up and down the strip which will save millions of hours in \ntravel time and make it a much easier trip from the airport to the many \nvacation spots along the Las Vegas strip and downtown.\n  We have duty to every American to invest in a balanced transportation \nsystem. That is what this amendment is about. I ask for the support of \nthe Senate. This is a bipartisan measure,\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\nand I hope it has a strong bipartisan vote tomorrow. I appreciate very \nmuch the Senator from North Dakota yielding me the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to speak on both the economic \npackage and the highway bill, but I see my friend and colleague from \nLouisiana. Does she wish to speak?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We will be happy to have you discuss it, but prefer you \nnot send it to the desk immediately.\n  I yield to my friend and colleague before speaking.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a moment so I can thank the \nSenator for his courtesy in doing that? That is a gracious act, \nespecially at this time of night. I appreciate it very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Louisiana?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an \namendment I plan to offer. First, I thank the leadership, particularly \nthe Senator from Oklahoma for his gracious yielding because the time is \ngetting very late tonight and there are other colleagues on the floor \nwho wish to speak briefly on some amendments about which they feel \nstrongly. As we try to offer these amendments and state our case, we \nrealize these votes will take place tomorrow. I thank my colleague from \nOklahoma for his leadership and my colleague from North Dakota.\n  First, I have somewhat mixed feelings about offering this amendment \nor any amendment tonight. I was in the minority of Senators who \nbelieved we should have taken a break from this discussion at least for \nthe next couple of days as this war is raging in Iraq. Literally, as we \nspeak, all, I would venture to say, of the television sets in this \nNation and many around the world and radios and Internet communication \nare focused on this extraordinary undertaking that is underway as we \nspeak and 250,000 of our finest citizens are mobilized and en route--\nland forces, air forces--in the battle. I was hoping we could take some \ntime and come back to this early next week when we had a better sense. \nBut as the Senate, in its will, decided to move forward, I wanted to \ncome forward and at least offer one amendment, not that all the others \nare not significant and relevant and most certainly part of this \ndebate, but this particular amendment actually affects the lives, \nsafety, equipment, and strategy of the war we are fighting.\n  The amendment I hope to have voted on tomorrow and will discuss just \nbriefly is very simple. It will add $1 billion to the underlying budget \nresolution providing an extra billion dollars of the $400 billion that \nis in the budget for defense. So it is a minor increase in the scheme \nof things but very important to the beneficiaries of this amendment.\n  Those beneficiaries, of course, are all the citizens of the United \nStates, the citizens of Iraq, and the citizens of our coalition, as \nwell as the people it directly affects, which are the Guard and \nReserve, Guard and Reserve members who have been called up to stand \nalongside the Active Duty.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have several letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Ike Skelton,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Skelton: In response to your letter of 29 \n     January 2003, we are providing a combined Navy and Marine \n     Corps list of our unfunded ``Naval'' programs to which \n     additional funding could be applied. While we are grateful \n     for and have benefited from the increased resources recently \n     provided by the President and the Congress, there still \n     remain additional shortfalls that are detailed herein.\n       The Department's FY 2004 Budget continues to focus on our \n     new defense strategy and emergent challenges of the 21st \n     Century. The resources contained in this budget go far in \n     helping both services to maintain heightened readiness in \n     uncertain times, to provide further investment in \n     transformational programs, and to take care of our Sailors, \n     Marines and their families. However, the road to attaining \n     our shipbuilding and aircraft procurement program goals \n     remains exceptionally challenging. Additionally, the Global \n     War on Terrorism and current operations incident to the Iraqi \n     question continue to stretch our resources in many areas.\n       For FY 2004, Naval unfunded programs total $6.5 billion. \n     These unfunded items are listed under Enclosure (1) for Navy \n     programs and Enclosure (2) for Marine Corps programs. As you \n     know, the items identified on these lists are important to \n     the long-term efficacy of our Navy/Marine corps Team.\n       If we may be of any further assistance, please let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n     Vern Clark,\n       Admiral, U.S. Navy, Chief of Naval Operations.\n     Michael w. Hagee,\n       General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The Army National Guard (ARNG) plays a key role in the \n     defense of our Nation. Whether responding to Combatant \n     Commander's requirements worldwide, answering our Nation's \n     Homeland Security requirements, or helping communities \n     respond to natural disasters, the Army National Guard remains \n     an integral part of our Nation's defense strategy. Citizen-\n     soldiers of the ARNG are trained, experienced, and motivated. \n     Within our ranks are some of the finest Americans the country \n     has to offer. In order to keep them trained and ready they \n     require Full Time Support (FTS), modernized equipment that is \n     compatible with the active Army, up-to-date facilities to \n     maintain equipment and train at, and additional training time \n     and resources to remain relevant as a viable force in the \n     full Spectrum of Operations. Readiness is our focus as we \n     stretch every dollar to maximize efficiency and \n     effectiveness.\n       The Fiscal Year 2004 Budget Request supports peacetime \n     operational levels and provides $5.514B to train, educate, \n     and prepare military personnel (MPA Budget Activity 8); \n     $4.211B in operations and training support; and $168M for \n     construction acquisition, and rehabilitation of facilities. \n     This request represents a program (above cost and price \n     increases) of $102.2M or 1.9% in the MPA BA 8 appropriation; \n     a program decrease of $125M or -3.0% in the Operations and \n     Maintenance Army National Guard (OMNG) appropriation; and a \n     program decrease of $73M or -30% in the Military Construction \n     Army National Guard (MCNG) appropriation.\n       The Department has focused resources on Operations & \n     Maintenance, Collective Training and Sustainment Restoration \n     Maintenance (SRM) and has taken risk in Base Operations. \n     Within Pay and Allowances the budget provides for the \n     statutory requirements for Inactive Duty Training and Annual \n     Training, continued progress towards the goal of 85% Duty \n     MOSQ, and Special Training to bring ARNG capabilities in \n     support of the Combatant Commanders.\n       The Army National Guard has received recent increases in \n     our Total Obligation Authority. We are grateful to the \n     Congress and to the Army for these increases, proving that we \n     are all part of the same team. However, much remains to be \n     done. There are several specific requirements that must be \n     met in order to continue to keep our soldiers ready as the \n     Global War on Terrorism continues. Attached are lists of our \n     top personnel, readiness and transformation shortfalls and \n     our top twenty-five equipment needs.\n       The nation asks a grant deal of its citizen-soldiers. \n     Before we put them in harm's way, it is our responsibility to \n     ensure that our soldiers receive the best possible training, \n     are maneuvering in the most current aircraft and armored \n     combat vehicles, and are armed with the most lethal weapons \n     systems. Our ability to be ready when called upon by the \n     American people is, and will always be, our top priority and \n     our bottom line.\n\n                                             Roger C. Schultz,\n\n                                               Lieutenant General,\n     Director, Army National Guard.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Secretary of the Air Force,\n\n                                    Washington, February 21, 2003.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Department's FY04 budget reflects an \n     efficient and effective investment of resources designed to \n     sustain our forces and enhance our capabilities for the \n     future. The budget will help fight and win the war against \n     terrorism, continue transforming the service to meet the \n     challenges of this century, and provide for recruiting and \n     retaining of a quality fighting force to meet the commitments \n     of this nation. We need your support for these objectives and \n     for the budget we have proposed to achieve these goals. The \n     Unfunded Priority List (UPL) that I forward today complements \n     these objectives, but in no sense is an alternative to the \n     fundamental priorities of our President's Budget request. We \n     ask that, as you consider the list, you remain mindful of the \n     context in which it is presented.\n       Our list emphasizes programs already planned that can be \n     brought forward plus a number of areas where additional \n     investment can be helpful. In any budget there is a need to \n     balance investment and thus to balance risk, so there will \n     always be areas where additional funding can be effectively \n     applied. With this in mind, we have been careful to\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\n     assure that the list consists of proposals that can be \n     executed in a timely manner and that will not disrupt the \n     program we have laid out in the President's Budget or the \n     Future Years Defense Plan. For the military construction \n     entry, we have included an additional list which provides the \n     project detail. However, we do not address unbudgeted costs \n     related to Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Enduring Freedom, \n     or other emerging costs of the Global War on Terrorism, \n     recognizing that a supplemental request which brings together \n     a Department-wide estimate is the more appropriate vehicle \n     for presenting these requirements. Finally, we have included \n     two items that address the need we have to recapitalize our \n     aging tanker force. We are in the process of working issues \n     associated with a potential lease of tankers and will inform \n     the Congress of that outcome as soon as it is decided. The \n     list reflects the costs required to implement that lease and \n     an alternative, if the lease is not approved, that brings \n     forward dollars to accelerate a buy of new tanker aircraft.\n       We thank you for the opportunity to provide you our UPL. \n     Our Armed Forces are winning the war on terrorism and through \n     your diligence and assistance we eagerly look forward to \n     launching into the 2nd century of powered air and space \n     flight.\n       A similar letter has been sent to the Ranking Minority \n     Member of your Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James G. Roche.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It is shocking what has come to my attention as a \nformer member of the Armed Services Committee and now as a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee: The lack of equipment, the lack of money \nin this budget to fund their current operations.\n  This amendment asks to take a billion dollars away from a tax cut \nthat I think could give an extra billion dollars and transfer that room \nin this budget to add a billion dollars for the Guard and the Reserves.\n  I have a couple of facts that might help people understand why this \nis so critical and why I really believe we should--and hope we can do \nthis in a bipartisan way--take this positive step. In 1990, there were \n2.5 million men and women in the Active Forces of the United States. \nToday, there are only 1.4 million. The Reserve and Guard make up a \nlarger portion of our fighting force than ever before in the history of \nthe world. There are 860,000 men and women in the Guard and Reserve. \nThey are from the States of my colleagues, as well as my own State. We \nall know and have people on our staffs, in our families, our neighbors, \nwho signed up basically to be weekend soldiers and weekend warriors, \nbut they have ended up being regular warriors because of the \ntransformation that is occurring. The transformation is that the Active \nand Reserve units of this Nation are playing a vital role in our \nprotection, not just on the weekends, not just in training but in the \nreal-life battles. They are as much a part of this war that is underway \ntonight as our actives.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am mindful that we are \ngoing through a great transformation in our military. It is something \nthat is supported in a bipartisan way and that this country supports. \nIt is like trying to turn a large aircraft carrier around. It cannot be \ndone right away. It cannot be done quickly, but if directions need to \nbe changed, that directional change needs to be ratcheted so you can go \nin a different direction. We are trying to move our forces in a \ndifferent direction because we are no longer fighting World War II. We \nhave done that. We have been there. We did it and we won. We are now \nfighting an international war on terrorism and it takes quick mobility, \nlethal action, smart bombs, strategic guidance missile systems, \nstealth, unmanned vehicles. It takes a different makeup of our Armed \nForces.\n  When we fought World War II, we had months to get ready to fight. We \nhad months to build up. Today, we do not know where the attack is going \nto come. It came to New York City on September 11. It might come to \nWashington, DC, tomorrow morning. It might come to San Francisco next \nweek. We have to move immediately. So we do not have the luxury of \nbuilding up for 12 months or 18 months as we did in New Orleans when \nfor 2 years we built the best boats that were built that won World War \nII, the Higgins boats. We do not have that luxury.\n  So we are restructuring our force in a wise and smart way, which is \nto say that we will count on our Reserve units. They are not in the \nActive, so it is a cost-effective way to keep our strength up. We have \nto give them helmets and rifles. We have to give them helicopters that \nfly.

There is an EC-2 squadron out of Virginia that is in \ntransit, and an F-18 squadron out of Georgia in transit. In the current \nbudget, they have been decommissioned because there is no money in the \ncurrent budget for these troops that are en route to fight the battle \nthat is being waged.\n  There is something wrong, and what is wrong is we are underfunding \nour Guard and Reserve. Perhaps we are putting too much of an emphasis \non tax cuts and not enough of an emphasis on the strength that this \ncountry needs at this time, and sharing those resources with the Guard \nand Reserve and plussing them up.\n  In addition, when the Guard and Reserve members go, they leave their \njobs behind, they take a cut in pay, and unfortunately they do not get \nthe same benefits that many of our Active do. This has to change if we \nare going to ask them to serve not just on the weekends, not just once \nevery couple of years, these units have been out there--some of them \nare on their fourth rotation.\n  I just want to discuss my amendment, to vote on it at the appropriate \ntime, whenever the leadership thinks we can take a few minutes. I hope \nwe can take quite a long time to discuss this, but I know there are \nother important amendments. I do not know what could be more important \nthan trying to make a few tweaks to this major budget resolution that \nmight send not only a positive signal, but it would actually back up in \nreal meaningful terms the resolution that we voted on 99 to 0 a few \nhours ago that said we love our troops, we support our troops, our \nprayers are with our troops. Then let us send some money to our troops, \nparticularly to our Guard and Reserve. This billion dollars would go a \nlong way.\n  We went through the unfunded list. This is a list that the Guard and \nReserve say, look, we desperately need this money. We have listed it in \na priority. This is not luxury. These are things we actually need. To \nupgrade the Air Force Reserve, let me give an example. This is a $48 \nmillion item to provide the Reserve tactical fight territories, the \nfighters that we see in the battle as we are watching the televisions, \nthey need the same radar upgrades as the Active Forces. The fighter \nplanes for Active have one kind of radar, and then the Reserve fighters \ndo not have the same radar. So when we say let's keep our troops out of \nharm's way, one thing that would help is to have the same sophisticated \nradar that our Reserve and our National Guardsmen are using as are the \nActives. That would be one smart way to keep them out of harm's way.\n  If we were talking about $100 billion, if we were talking about $50 \nbillion, if we were talking about a lot of money, I would say maybe we \ndo not have it. But, most certainly, if we are talking about trillions \nof dollars of tax cuts, we could find $1 billion to make a slight \nadjustment to pay and put some money up for our Guard and Reserve.\n  I know the leadership is probably going to come back and say we have \nplans, we are going to put this money in the supplemental. I realize \nthere are other times that we could potentially do this, but I would \nmake two arguments: One, in the past, the rule has been that we do not \nput new items in the supplemental. This is sort of ongoing items that \nare funded. You run out of them so you are sort of supplementing it \nbecause you are not going to make it through the end of the year. While \nwe anticipate a very large supplemental, I think it would be very \nmeaningful if we would think about making an adjustment right now for \nthe thousands of Guard and Reserve that need this help and support.\n  I finish by asking my colleagues to look at this chart. These are two \nof our young men. In this list I am holding up of things that are \nunfunded, some of our units need helmets. Some of our units need \nbiological and chemical covering. Because of the way we have designed a \nlot of these suits, if they are used once they have to be thrown away. \nThen they need a new one.\n  If they get attacked and one is contaminated, they are going to have \nto come home because we cannot leave them out there without suits. So \nthis is not only about doing what is right and fair, this is about \nkeeping our strength in the battlefield, funding the items that help \nprotect them and keep our forces safe and being true to the amendments \nthat we speak about on the floor.\n\n  For too long, the Guard and Reserve have received hand-me-downs from \nthe Active component. Maybe there was a time that was appropriate \nbecause they served as supplemental, but now they are carrying a big \nweight, and they are doing it magnificently and at great personal \nsacrifice to their businesses, to their communities, and to their \nfamilies, because in many instances their pay goes down.\n  Let us invest in our Guard and Reserves and make sure we are giving \nthem what they need and to honor our commitment to them and to win \nfuture battles. We need the Guard and Reserve. Let's give them their \nrifles, their helmets, and their tactical equipment so we can, as we \nknow we will, win this war.\n  Let's remember that when the fighting is over in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, the Guard and Reserve will be there for us, protecting us. \nLet's give them the tools they need to succeed.\n  Before I yield the floor, let me spend 1 minute supporting my \ncolleague who will be coming up next, the Senator from Delaware, who is \nabout to offer what I think might be the best amendment of all in terms \nof balancing the needs to boost our economy, to restrain spending, as \nwell as to give the people of this Nation the tax relief that will help \nget this economy moving again. The Senator from Delaware will offer an \namendment. I am proud to add my name as a cosponsor. The Concord \nCoalition has looked at all the proposals--the President's proposal, \nthis proposal, that proposal, the leadership proposal--and today they \ncame out and supported Senator Carper's amendment. I think he should be \nvery proud of that. They said this would put us on the path back to \neconomic development, restraint on spending, fiscal discipline, and \nhopefully prosper, giving us the strength we need to win the wars \nahead.\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\n  This may not be the only one we have to fight and win in the next few \nmonths and years ahead. We should reserve our financial strength to be \nable to make sure we win the war first and then do that which is \nnecessary to protect our freedoms and give us strength.\n  I yield the floor and I add my name as a cosponsor to the next \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself such time on the Breaux \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Most agree we need to do something to grow the economy. \nThere are different ideas, and I compliment my colleagues for some of \nthe ideas. We have some very good ideas on both sides. Maybe we can \ncome up with some of the best. I wish to talk about our plan a little \nbit and also make a couple of comments on the highway bill, as well.\n  We are dealing with a budget. We have a deficit, and a lot of people \nask, why do we have a deficit? Revenues have declined, and declined \nsubstantially. In the year 2000 revenues were over $2 trillion, and \nlast year they were $1.85 trillion. That is a reduction of $175 \nbillion. If you look at the history of the United States, almost every \nyear there has been some increase. Hardly ever have we seen a decrease \n2 years in a row. That is a decrease together of 9 percent. That is a \nreason we have a deficit, coupled with the fact expenditures are up. \nRevenues went down 9 percent and expenditures went up by 12 percent. I \nam not casting blame. That is the situation and where we are today.\n  Right now we spend more than we take in. That is a $160 billion \ndifference and the projection is worse for this year.\n  How do we get this number to grow? This is a real reduction. What \ncaused that? We look at gross domestic production and the economy \nreally declined. It started declining in the year 2000. We had robust \neconomic growth through the mid-1990s. In 1997, when we reduced the \ncapital gains tax from 28 percent to 20 percent, that created an \neconomic explosion that helped the stock market and helped the economy \ngrow. More companies were paying more bonuses and the economy had a \nrobust growth.\n  Chairman Greenspan said it is irrational exuberance because the \nmarket climbed precipitously. It started falling in the year 2000 and \nwe had negative three quarters which is called a recession, the last \npart of 2000; it fell down in the first three quarters of 2001. It was \nnegative so we had recession. It bounced up in 2002, but still very \nsoft.\n  If you look at what happened in the stock market, there was a lot of \nreduction of wealth in NASDAQ which was up to 5,000 in March of 2000, \nand by December of 2000 it was half that amount, less than 3,000; 2,800 \nI believe. NASDAQ fell about half in the last 9 months of 2000.\n  Again I am not faulting anyone, but there was a precipitous decline \nin wealth, precipitous decline in market value and, to some extent, \nthat continued in the year 2001, particularly after September 11.\n  Add those things together and the market falls, revenues fall, we \nhave a big deficit. 2001 caused a lot of increase in expenditures, \nhelping those people who needed help and rebuilding our cities and the \nPentagon, and so on, the war on terrorism. A lot happened to cause \nenormous deficits.\n  Most of us ask, what can we do to improve this? How can we turn the \neconomy around? I mentioned in 1997 we reduced the capital gains rate, \nwe had a very positive increase of revenues to the Government even when \nwe reduced taxes. So we are trying to think, what can we do now to help \nthe economy? That certainly worked in 1997. I don't think anyone \ndisputes that. What can we do in the year 2003 that might help the \neconomy?\n  I think we should eliminate the double taxation of dividends. People \nsometimes who maybe do not follow the economic markets, tax policy, and \nso on, are shocked when I say, did you know we tax dividends twice? We \ntax dividends higher in the United States than any other country in the \nworld but Japan, and Japan and the United States are taxed about the \nsame. Higher than anyone. The effective rate is about 70 percent. The \ncorporate rate is 35 percent. Individual rates could be 38.6 or 35 \npercent or 27 percent, but the combined rate, if it is 35 percent and \nthe individual rate is 30 percent, is 65 percent. That is two-thirds of \nthe money going to Government. So if a corporation makes money and they \nwant to distribute to their owners, the Government gets two-thirds and \nthe owners get one-third. That is not a big deal. That discourages \ninvestment. Who wants to invest in a company if that is what they get \nback? I owned and operated a company. It does not make sense to \ndistribute earnings in the form of dividends. The Government would be \nthe primary beneficiary, the owner would be the secondary beneficiary. \nThat did not make good sense.\n  The President is proposing eliminating double taxation of dividends. \nThat is exactly right. We would be closer to other countries. It is \nembarrassing to me to see we tax dividends at a rate greater than the \nFrench, greater than Hungary, greater than the Czech Republic, greater \nthan Greece. It is time for a change.\n  People whom I respect, what do they say? Charles Schwab says:\n\n       I can't think of any other tax policy that would, at one \n     stroke, be more beneficial to ordinary investors. The impact \n     [of dividend relief] would be enormous.\n\n  I think he is right. I don't think he was doing that for personal \ninterest.\n  Here is the analysis by several analysts in their projection of what \nthey think, by eliminating double taxation of dividends, how much the \nmarket might rise. A lot of well-respected individuals--Lehman \nBrothers--say anywhere from 5 percent to about 15 percent. Most said it \nwould be a positive benefit to the market.\n  Alan Greenspan testified:\n\n       In my judgment, the elimination of the double taxation of \n     dividends will be helpful to everybody. There is no question \n     that this particular program will be, net, a benefit to \n     virtually everybody over the long run, and that is one of the \n     reasons I strongly support it.\n\n  That was in his testimony before the House on February 12 of this \nyear.\n  So I just make those comments. I hate to see a proposal that is \nbefore us--I should not say that. I welcome the alternatives that are \noffered by my friends and colleagues, that are supporting the so-called \n$350 billion proposal. The tax reduction in the 350 proposal is really \n$323.3 billion. The balance of that is additional refundable tax \ncredits; in other words, the Government is writing a check.\n  I am afraid, if that amendment is agreed to, and we will be voting on \nit tomorrow--I have great respect for my colleagues, Senators Breaux, \nVoinovich, Snowe, who offered this amendment, Senator Baucus. I have \ngreat respect for them and served with them for many years in my Senate \ncareer and have the pleasure of serving with them on the Finance \nCommittee. The Finance Committee will take whatever number we give them \nout of the budget, and they will fashion together a growth package.\n  I am afraid if we went with a growth package that is limited to tax \nreduction of $323 billion, we will not be able to do this dividend \nproposal, we will not be able to follow the advice of Mr. Greenspan and \nMr. Schwab and many others who really think this would help grow the \neconomy. I don't want to take the growth out of the growth package. I \ndo want us to be innovative enough to say, wait a minute, if we can \nchange tax policy and grow the economy, let's do it. If you find \neffective tax rates anywhere above 60 percent, that is very suffocating \nto economic growth. It dampens it to such an extent, a lot of people \nsay, why make the investment? Why would people invest, if they are \nprimarily interested in dividends, if they realize the complicated and \nvery heavy burden of taxation that is in the present law? Especially \nwhen you can invest in other countries and the taxation rate is not \nnearly as high.\n  Now we have such an international investment system, with the home \nPC, you can invest anywhere in the world any time of the day you want. \nIt is wonderful, the opportunities we have in the United States. You \ndon't have to invest in the United States.\n  What has really happened as a result, people realize the economic \nconsequences of investing in companies that pay large portions of their \nproceeds in dividends, so they shy away from those companies, in many \ncases, and go towards what we would call\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\ngrowth stocks, stocks that do not pay dividends but they have greater \ngrowing potential. They may be more volatile, may be a little more \nrisky, but the taxation rate on those companies--not on distribution of \ndividends, it is on capital gains--taxed at 20 percent. It is not \ndouble taxed. Capital gains would be capped at 20 percent, about half \nthe rate of dividends. So you have a real encouragement. Frankly, you \nhave had an explosion in growth of those companies vis-a-vis the \ncompanies that pay dividends.\n  Why should we disadvantage companies that distribute the benefits of \ntheir earnings to their owners through the form of cash?\n  I think the administration is right on target. I think they have come \nup with a good proposal that would benefit, not just investors, not \njust the people who own a lot of stock, they would benefit the fireman, \nbenefit the policeman, the teacher, the civil servant, they would \nbenefit anybody who happened to have money in a retirement fund that \nhappens to invest in stocks. And most all retirement funds do.\n  So, let's do something to help the teachers and the firemen and let's \ndo something that would help government employees and other people, \nindividuals, to help grow the economy. When we do that, we will see the \nstock market grow and we will see capital gains being paid again; we \nwill see more revenues coming into the Government; we will see more \ninvestment, more jobs created.\n  It is estimated that this proposal on dividends alone would create \nwell over a million jobs--I think 1.4 million jobs just in the first \nyear.\n  Also, on family relief, there are a couple of packages we have. We \nhave the investment proposal, and I want to talk about that primarily. \nAlso, the package we have that the administration proposed and that we \nare hopeful will be reported out of the Finance Committee--again, we \ndon't write the bill on the floor. I think some people think we do that \nin the budget. We do not, unless Senator Conrad and I can come up with \nan amendment and change the way we do business. We just give the \nFinance Committee an instruction. But the instruction we are hoping to \ngive would allow them to eliminate double taxation of dividends and \nalso provide what I would call small business and family relief. We \nwould do, I think, some wonderful, long overdue things that would help \ngrow the economy. We would tax individuals no more than we tax \ncorporations.\n  Why in the world would we tax individuals at a rate about 10 percent \nhigher than we tax corporations? We do that today. We will not if we \nare able to pass this package.\n  Why in the world would we have heavy taxes on families? The proposal \nwe have before us would provide tax relief to 92 million taxpayers. It \nis very profamily.\n  We would have marriage penalty relief that would benefit 42 million \ncouples. Marriage penalty relief--somebody says, what are you doing? We \nare taking the individual tax rate of 15 percent--and individuals who \nhave taxable income of $28,000 pay 15 percent. Above that, they pay 27 \npercent. We are saying, why don't we double that for a couple. The \npresent law doesn't do that. So we expand the 15 percent bracket for \ncouples from about $46,000 to $56,800. What is the impact of that? That \nmeans that for a couple, a married couple, if they have a combined \nincome up to $56,800, their tax rate is 15 percent. That will save them \nabout $1,222.\n  Think about that. I heard somebody say about the tax proposal, I know \nthe bulk of this goes for the wealthy. That is not correct. That is \nvery significant tax relief for a lot of married couples today, $1,200, \nif they have combined income up to $56,000. If they have two kids, they \nget an additional tax credit per child. The present law is $600; we \nwould accelerate that to $1,000 per child.\n  My daughter just gave birth to a new son, my grandson Nicholas. They \nwill be able to get a $1,000 tax credit for Nicholas and that's true \nfor every child in America--$1,000. That is significant. If you have \nfour kids, that is $4,000 somebody wouldn't be paying taxes on. They \nwill be able to use that money for their education, for their health \ncare, for taking care of them. This is very family friendly. I think it \nis also very friendly for growing the economy.\n  We also provide expensing for small business. I used to own and \noperate a small business. I had a janitorial service with my wife, and \nthat was a small business. We would be able to expense things, not \namortize them. That is a positive thing. That means you get to recoup \nyour investment over a very short period of time--actually, \nimmediately. Up to $75,000 you get to expense it, not write it off over \nyears. It makes sense to write it off in the year you write the check, \nrather than spread it over several years. It makes you more likely to \nmake the investment, which means you would make more investments and \ncreate more jobs. It is a very positive, progrowth, probusiness change.\n\n  If you look at several of these provisions in the President's \npackage, I think they would help the economy, help the stock market, \nhelp small businesses, help American families. They would help \ntaxpayers.\n  If we cut it in half, I am afraid we will not be able to do the \nthings either for the family or do the things for investment. We will \nnot be able to grow the economy. We won't be able to create jobs. I am \nafraid if we cut the package in half, we would basically be taking the \ngrowth out of the growth package. It might be some tax relief, but the \nnet result would be, I am afraid, you wouldn't get much growth.\n  You say: Why is that, $350 billion sounds like a lot of money. Over \nthis 10-year period--and that is what we are talking about--the Federal \nGovernment is estimated to take in $28 trillion. So if you talk about \n$350 billion over $28 trillion, that is a very small percentage. We are \nproposing you need to have a little more if you are really going to \nhave an impact on the economy.\n  Is it too much? Is 725? Well, $725 billion is really not the tax cut. \nThe real tax cut portion is $698 billion--again, spread out over 10.\n  Somebody will say, Wait a minute, your budget proposal is more. The \nPresident had $1.5 trillion; you have $1.3 trillion. What we are \nreconciling is this $698 billion. By reconciling, for those who are not \nfamiliar with Senate language, that means we are telling the Finance \nCommittee: Report out a bill that would do such-and-such. We didn't say \nput the entire package over the next 10 years, this $1.3 trillion in \nthe package. We are telling the Finance Committee, take about half of \nit and make it law this year because we want to grow the economy this \nyear; we want to do it now. Part of the tax cut could be done anytime \nup to the year 2010. Because we are basically just extending present \nlaw.\n  We have several years to do that. This needs to be done now. This \nneeds to be done now because we need to create jobs now.\n  So I just mention that. I have the greatest respect for my \ncolleagues, some of whom are sincere deficit hawks, and they believe \nmaybe if we did this, we might not be good for the deficit. I think we \nneed to do something more aggressive to help grow the economy.\n\n  We have a legitimate difference of opinion. I have great respect for \ntheir opinion. I have great respect for colleagues who have different \nideas. We have had proposals that will be considered tomorrow, or we \nhave already had them on the floor, from $100 billion, to more than \nthat, $350 billion, $700 billion--you name it. There may be someone who \nhas it for more.\n  I think the President has a pretty good balance. I encourage my \ncolleagues to not vote for the amendment which would cut the growth \npackage in half.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of other comments.\n  My friend and colleague, Senator Bond, discussed an amendment dealing \nwith transportation. He talked about highways. Frankly, every Member of \nCongress--probably every elected official in any elected capacity--\nhappens to be a friend of highways.\n  If you are in a city council, someone is talking to you about roads; \nif you are the mayor of Minneapolis or St. Paul, people are talking to \nyou about roads. If you are in State government, you spend half your \ntime talking about highways.\n  I used to be in the State senate. They ran me off. But everybody is \nconcerned about highways. Everybody is concerned about infrastructure. \nAnd they\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\nare right. And particularly after a harsh winter, roads are \nparticularly bad.\n  We are all concerned about bad roads. Somebody was talking about the \ncommutes take too long. Part of it is because of the bad roads. There \nis a lot of truth in everything that is said. We have a lot of \ncompelling infrastructure needs.\n  But I have some reservations about the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Missouri, and, frankly, my colleague from Oklahoma, for \nwhom I have the greatest respect, and other people who are supporting \nthis. I think they are as well intended as anybody you will find. But I \nam concerned about what I am afraid the amendment would do.\n  It would move us away from the idea of user taxes to pay for roads. \nThat is a tradition that we have had certainly since Eisenhower, since \nwe started building the Interstate System. Since we have had a Federal \nhighway program, we have had gasoline taxes pay for highways. And then \nwe take off a percentage of gasoline taxes to pay for mass transit. But \nbasically it is the user fees that pay for the expansion of the \nprogram.\n  And looking back, I remember debating, in 1982 or 1983--I think there \nwas a nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax, and we had a filibuster that lasted \nright before Christmas. It was over whether or not there would be a \nnickel-a-gallon gasoline tax increase. I was opposing it at that time, \nthinking the States should have to have the right if they wanted to do \nit, the State should have the option, not a Federal mandate. I lost \nthat debate, but it was a long and interesting debate. But I can see \nthe demand by people who want to have more highways built, and maybe a \nFederal gasoline tax, and so on.\n  I am a lot more sympathetic now to listening to the demands. People \nsay: We want more for highways. I certainly want to listen to them, but \nI think they should be paid by gasoline taxes.\n  Some people are proposing that we now have a significant infusion of \ngeneral revenue funds to pay for highways. You might say: Why are you \nopposed to that? Because there is no limit as to how much that would \ncost the Federal Government. There is no limit to the demand for more \nmoney for highways, absolutely no limit, no limit whatsoever.\n\n  You could take any program before us, and you could multiply it by \nfive, and somebody could legitimately say that is not enough--\nlegitimately because there are a lot of demands. You can take these \nfigures and multiply them. There are a lot of demands for more \nhighways.\n  But, to me, it is a serious mistake and maybe a budget breach. If you \nsay we are going to use general revenues to pay for highways, then a \nlot of people think, if it comes from the Federal Government, it \ndoesn't cost anything. It doesn't cost you anything because it is from \nthe Federal Government--especially if you have a highway formula that \nsays 80 percent of it comes from the Federal Government and only 20 \npercent comes from the State.\n  So the States may decide: let's raise gasoline prices because we want \nto get four times as much from the Federal Government. You think about \nthat. We have not done that in the past.\n  Now, we made some changes. I look back. In 1990--guess what--the \nFederal program for highways was $10 billion. Today, it is over $30 \nbillion. This is 12 years later, and we are spending three times what \nwe spent in 1990.\n  In 1997, we were spending less than $20 billion, $18.7 billion. \nToday, we are spending over $30 billion. That was just about 5, 6 years \nago that we were spending $18.7 billion. Now we are spending over $30 \nbillion.\n  Congress even changed the formula when we had gasoline revenues going \nup. We did, and the economy was really going well. Frankly, when the \neconomy is going well, you have more highway usage, and you have more \nmoney coming into the trust funds. So the fund formulas were altered to \nallow the highways to get more of that money more immediately. I \nsupported that. It seemed good. More money was coming in, so let them \nhave it. It is a user fee. Let the user fee apply.\n  But the formula also said, if the highway funds decline, they will be \nreduced. That was agreed to. That is part of law. That was part of the \nagreement. Well, guess what? Revenues declined, and then everybody \nsaid: No. Whoa. We can't take a decline. And so, in the last year's \nappropriations bill--actually this year; we just passed it in January--\nit said, instead of going down, according to law, what, to $24 billion, \nit came in at $31.6 billion. It was supposed to go down to $24 billion. \nCongress said: No, no, no. We don't want to have a reduction of that \npercentage even though we agreed to it. We decided to put more money in \nmore quickly, but we were supposed to reduce it if it started falling.\n  Highway revenues started falling because of different reasons, maybe \nbecause of terrorism or gasoline prices, but the total money coming \ninto the fund went down. But Congress said: No. Let's spend more money. \nSo we went from $31.3 billion.\n  The administration requested $29.3 billion in 2004. And I will tell \nyou, as the chairman of the Budget Committee, we squeezed every way we \ncould. We came up with: Can we squeeze the trust fund down quicker? Can \nwe move some money into the trust fund that should have been in there? \nYes, we found some gasohol money going into general revenue funds. We \nput that in. That was about $700 million per year. We did some other \nthings.\n  If it is a legitimate user fee concept, I am willing to consider it. \nI think there are vehicles driving around today that are tax exempt, \nthat do not pay taxes, and, by golly, they ought to pay a tax. They are \ntearing up the road like everybody else. Some of them Senator Bond \nalluded to that I agree with. Some have new technology and maybe \nCongress tried to encourage that by saying they will be tax exempt. But \nI don't think they should be, if they are tearing up the road.\n\n  We have some cases where maybe even some groups do not pay highway \ntaxes and they are on the highway. Let's stop that. They are using the \nhighways. They should pay for them. Some people in my State will not \nlike me saying that because we have a lot of individuals who are doing \nthat today. So let's close whatever loopholes we can and get whatever \nmoney could come into the highway fund as a result.\n  But the proposal that is before us now, that we will be voting on--\nand it may well pass; I can count votes around here probably as good as \nsome--would increase that $31 billion program. The President's request \nwas $29 billion. We were able to scrape it around and come out with, \nwhat, $32.1 billion. That is about the best we can do out of the money \nthat is coming into the fund.\n  I am open to ideas. If we can do better, I am happy to consider that. \nWe put in language that says, if we in the Finance Committee raise more \nmoney one way or another through a user fee, whatever they would do, \ngreat, they get the money. Power to them. If they raise gasoline \nprices, they index gasoline prices, they put on an excise tax on tires, \nwhatever the committee might do, if they close the loophole because \nthey find out certain groups are on tax-exempt vehicles that ought to \nbe paying taxes, power to them. Whatever they can get, they should come \nin. And maybe we have underestimated it. The Finance Committee does a \ngreat job or the Ways and Means Committee. If they can find more ways \nof closing loopholes, power to them; they get 100 percent of the money.\n  But the proposal we have before us now just basically let's you \nincrease that by about $8 billion. Let's take that $32 billion and make \nit a $40 billion program. It increases costs over what we have proposed \nin the first 6 years of our budget, about almost $60 billion for 6 \nyears. Our budget is a 10-year budget. But for the first 6 years, it is \nabout $10 billion a year.\n  Now, that is a big increase: $10 billion a year being highways and \nmass transit. That is a big increase. And it is not paid for by \ngasoline taxes. It is basically paid for by an increase in the deficit. \nAnd maybe even worse than that, it breaks this tradition of paying for \nroads and highways through user fees.\n  I will say again, the reason why I am speaking very strongly about \nthis is that I think that is a terrible precedent to set. If we are \ngoing to be general funding highways, we are opening ourselves up to \nunlimited demands on Federal money, especially if you stay with\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nthe 80-to-20 ratio. The 80-to-20 ratio is 80 percent the Federal \nGovernment and 20 percent States. And there is no limit to the demands \nat that kind of ratio.\n  If we are going to be paying 80 percent of the cost, you are going to \ndo general revenue funds, I will tell you right now, Congress will be \nbesieged with more requests and put in more general revenue funds.\n  I understand the highway lobby is powerful. I understand they are out \nin the Halls. I understand they have lots of cosponsors. I understand \nthey are making phone calls: We need this to get our road; we need this \nto get a better ratio for our State, our State has been a donor State \nfor years.\n  I want to see that corrected. Some people see this as a solution for \ncorrecting it. If you go general revenue funds, we will regret it. At \nleast if you have a user fee concept, it is limiting the growth of the \nprogram because there is a negative on raising gasoline taxes. People \ncan see it, and they are having a hard time paying their gasoline \nprices right now, with gas line prices at $1.75 and $2, in some cases.\n  Maybe the war in Iraq will go well and can be over soon. I hope and \npray that it does. God bless our troops and our leaders. They are doing \na fantastic job. If that happens, my guess is oil prices will come \ntumbling down as will gasoline prices, and maybe then it will be more \npalatable to be raising gasoline taxes.\n  If my colleagues vote for a gasoline tax increase, power to them. I \nhope every dime of it goes into highways. But to get something started \nwhere you end up having about 25 percent of highways being built with \ngeneral revenue funds, I think would be a mistake. I also don't think \nthe President will sign the bill. So I mention these things. It is \nimportant for us to pass a highway bill and to get it passed.\n  I make a commitment to work with my friends and colleagues, Senator \nInhofe and Senator Bond, others who have a very strong interest in \nthis. I want to work with them. I want a good highway bill to be signed \nby the President, and I would like to think that we would put one on \nhis desk that would be responsible as well.\n  I am afraid that the bill we have before us, going from basically $10 \nbillion in 1990 to $18 billion in 1997 and now we are at $31, $32 \nbillion, to try to jump that up immediately at 40 with general revenue \nfunds is wrong. If we do it through some other type of a user fee, that \nmight be more palatable.\n  I encourage my colleagues. I don't think this is really sustainable, \nif we don't do something different. I know there is some flexibility \namong some of the proponents. I commit that I will work with them to \ntry to come up with something that will be agreeable, sustainable, and \nsomething that can be signed.\n  I mention those reservations with the greatest respect to the \nproponents. I will urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment \ntomorrow.\n  I apologize to my colleague from Delaware because he has been waiting \nfor a few minutes. I didn't mean to speak at that length, but I thank \nthe Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes. I \napologize for this, but it is important for the Record that we address \nthe famous chart my colleague has shown over and over on the comparison \nof corporate tax rates. We have seen several references to this chart \nthat is entitled ``United States, Second Highest in the World Combined \nCorporate and Dividend Taxes.''\n  The chart says that the U.S. has a tax rate of 70 percent, second \nonly to Japan. My colleague and my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma, \nhas referred to this chart so often that I decided to go off and do a \nlittle independent research on that chart.\n  Let me tell you what I found. First, let's look at corporate taxes \nalone. When we look at corporate taxes alone this is for 2000 as a \npercentage of GDP, which Senator Bennett said is the appropriate way of \nlooking at it--a much different picture emerges about where we fit in.\n  This is from OECD, the international scorekeeper. What they have \nfound is the United States ranks 22nd out of 29 in effective corporate \ntax rates. The Senator from Oklahoma shows nominal tax rates, the tax \nrate that appears in the Tax Code. We all know that is not what people \nactually pay. When you look at what they actually pay, you see a much \ndifferent picture: 22nd out of 29 in effective corporate tax rates as a \npercentage of gross domestic product. We are down here, 22nd out of 29.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is percentage of GDP. We have a much bigger percent \nof GDP, but a tax rate is a tax rate.\n  I ran a corporation. When I made profits, I paid that rate. Maybe \nsomebody was able to figure out some Enron-type schemes and things. \nThis corporation didn't. Most corporations, a lot of corporations do \nnot. I wanted to make sure, the percentage GDP, because we have the \nlargest GDP in the world, I don't think is the relevant type of \nanalysis to use.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, I respect my colleague's view. Let me just say, \nthis is how OECD does the scorekeeping on effective tax rate \ncomparisons, what people are actually paying. This is their conclusion \nabout where the United States fits in.\n  Let me continue because the Senator raises an important point. There \nis an implication that we have a competitive problem because our tax \nrate is so high.\n  The fact is, as this chart shows, over 40 years, corporate taxes have \nfallen as a share of our economy but risen for other industrial \neconomies. This line shows the United States. We have gone from an \neffective rate as a percentage of GDP of 4 percent, which is a way of \ngiving an accurate comparison between countries with different levels \nof GDP. Ours has gone down dramatically. Other OECD countries have gone \nup over the 40 years.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma's chart and the arguments he made suggest \nthat all corporate income is taxed at the maximum corporate and \nindividual tax rates. This goes to the Senator's question. I hope the \nchairman will listen to this. At least a quarter of corporate profits \nare not taxed at all because of various tax preferences. That \ntranslates into a zero-percent effective tax rate. Another half of \ncorporate income is taxed once at the corporate level, but not taxed \nagain because it goes to pension funds and other stockholders who do \nnot pay individual income taxes. That again lowers it. The Senator is \nshowing nominal tax rates, not effective tax rates.\n  Finally, the chart being used assumes that all corporate income goes \nto individuals in the top individual tax bracket at the Federal, State, \nand local level. In recent years, corporations have used stock buybacks \nto convert their profits into individual capital gains which have an \neffective tax rate of less than 10 percent.\n  How can it be at 10 percent when the capital gains rate we all know \nis double that? The reason for that is the deferral that is inherent in \ncapital gains which gives you a much lower effective tax rate than the \nnominal tax rate.\n  I say this because it is important to have in the Record that this \nnotion that we have a 70-percent rate on corporate profits is not \naccurate. That is not the effective tax rate. It is nowhere near that. \nAnd if one compares corporate taxes in this country to other countries \non a fair comparison basis, we are not a high tax jurisdiction. We just \nare not. I offer that for the Record.\n  The Senator from Delaware has been extraordinarily patient. How much \ntime would he like?\n  Mr. CARPER. Two hours? Ten minutes would be just fine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago Senator Blanche \nLincoln of Arkansas invited several of us Democratic Senators to a \nbriefing in her office on Capitol Hill. She also invited several \nMembers of the House of Representatives who are Democrats. There were \nseveral of them in the room. They call themselves Blue Dog Democrats.\n  The Blue Dog Democrats, for those who have not heard that term \nbefore, tend to be budget hawks. They believe balanced budgets do \nmatter, and the idea of running chronic budget deficits year after year \nis not good for this country. In fact, it is very troublesome for this \ncountry. Blue Dogs are willing to take tough votes on defense spending, \nnondefense spending, entitlement\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\nspending, and taxes as well to get us closer to a balanced budget.\n  I served for 10 years in the House of Representatives and as Governor \nof Delaware. I guess I was a Blue Dog before we had Blue Dogs. I \nbelieve I am today.\n  Tomorrow a number of us, including a Republican, Senator Lincoln \nChafee, Senator Mary Landrieu, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and I will \noffer a budget alternative that is modeled after the approach offered \nby the Blue Dog Democrats in the House of Representatives which was \nvoted on earlier this evening and I understand received about 170, 175 \nvotes. It fell short, but it was a respectable showing. I want to talk \nabout the provisions of that approach and why I think it makes sense.\n  A number of my colleagues talked tonight about the need to stimulate \nthe economy and the need to do so in part with tax policy. In the \nalternative we will propose tomorrow, we do just that. Those who want \nto effect the 10-percent rate cut to accelerate it, we do that, in \nfact, this year. Those who want to accelerate the 27-percent tax \nbracket cut, we accelerate that this year. Those who want to expand and \nincrease the child credit, we do that this year.\n  To those people who would like to allow small businesses to expense \nnot just $25,000 in investments they make but $75,000, we let them do \nthat this year to encourage that kind of investment.\n  To those who want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty--we did that \nin Delaware when I was Governor--we would do that immediately under the \nproposal that will be before us.\n  We raise the exclusion for the estate tax to $6 million for a couple, \nand we do that this year, effective immediately, and leave it at that \nrate.\n  Those are some of the provisions we do right now. It would have an \nimmediate impact, and I think a very positive impact on the economy at \nthis time.\n  For those people who happen to be in the 10-percent bracket, they \nwould realize some tax savings, but so would those people whose income \nis not just $15,000 or $20,000 but $150,000. They would realize a \nsavings, too, by accelerating the tax cut for those in the 27-percent \nbracket. We are not just helping people in the middle-income portion of \nthe spectrum, but it also helps people at the top of the income \nspectrum.\n  What we do not do in our approach is reduce further the 35-percent \nrates and the rate to the 38.6 rate, the top two rates. We defer those \ncuts until two things happen: One, we pay for the war in Iraq; and, \ntwo, until we have actually balanced the budget. That is what we do on \nthe taxing side. That is what was offered in the House of \nRepresentatives this evening as well.\n  On the spending side, what we have done is to essentially embrace the \ndiscretionary spending numbers proposed by the President. In the House \nof Representatives, the Blue Dogs took the President's defense \ndiscretionary numbers and put that in their proposal. In the Senate, we \nelected in our version of our budget alternative to take the defense \nnumbers proposed by the Budget Committee. They are a bit less than the \nPresident's proposal, I think, by about $85 billion over a 10-year \nperiod of time. But we embrace the numbers from the committee itself.\n  We then take that roughly $85 billion and use those moneys to add to \nthe domestic discretionary spending side to help pay for No Child Left \nBehind, to help meet some of the health care needs in this country, and \nto help meet some of the agricultural needs in this country. It is \nroughly $80 billion to $85 billion. It would shift from the defense \nside to the nondefense discretionary side.\n  Even at the end of that, we would still be spending above the \nbaseline of more than the rate of inflation over the next 10 years for \ndefense and a little less than the baseline in our domestic \ndiscretionary spending. But I like the balance a little bit better than \nwhat was debated and voted on in the House earlier tonight.\n  The third piece we address is budget controls. I will focus on one, \nbut there are actually several others that are included in the measure \nwe will offer tomorrow.\n  Pay-go: The concept is if a Senator or a House Member wants to cut \ntaxes, or a Senator or House Member wants to raise spending in a way \nthat makes the deficit larger, they have to figure out a way to pay for \nthat so it is budget neutral starting now, not starting next week or \nnot starting next month but starting now.\n  In our alternative, in our substitute, pay-go provisions become \neffective now. They are reinstated now. If anyone wants to increase \nspending, they are free to have at it. If they do, they have to offset \nit by cutting spending somewhere else, or if they cut taxes in one \narea, they have to raise taxes in another area or do something on the \nspending side to offset that.\n  We have budget controls that address issues of emergency spending and \nother provisions as well. I will not go into all those tonight because \nit is late. That is an important component of what we are trying to do.\n  Let me sum up. We reduce taxes, we do a number of things that have an \neffect immediately this year, but we pay for them. The overall effect \nof the tax reduction over 10 years is roughly $100 billion, $115 \nbillion. Most of that is loaded in the first year or two.\n  We provide real spending restraint both on the defense side and on \nthe nondefense discretionary side, and we put in place budget controls, \nsome of which have been allowed to lapse. We put them back into effect \nto strengthen in the way they ought to be effective.\n  Today it is March 20. The day is almost over. During the course of \nthis day, we will pay as a nation in interest on the national debt \nroughly $1 billion. That is not principal; that is interest on our \ndebt, $1 billion. We will pay that tomorrow, the next day, and the next \nday after that.\n  We are a nation marching off to war. Tonight we have tens of \nthousands of young men and women on the march in a war I hope is \nmercifully brief for both sides. There is a great irony here as we are \nsending tens of thousands of our young people marching off to war. We \nare actually talking about reducing the revenues available to finance \nthat war, to mobilize the troops, the cost of the war, the postwar \noccupation, and instead of raising the revenue and the means of \nfinancing the war, we are taking away those resources, which sits logic \non its head, at least for me.\n\n  As we send those tens of thousands of young men and women marching \noff to war, their parents and grandparents are on a different kind of \nmarch, but a march nonetheless, with a different destination. It is \ncalled retirement, and the baby boomers, which I am one, are on the \nmarch and starting at roughly the end of this decade and throughout the \ncourse of the next decade.\n  The impact that is going to have on Social Security, Medicare, and \nother spending is the boomers, as they march off into their golden \nyears, will create a financial burden that we are not even a little bit \nprepared to address.\n  My fear is if we take the course that has been proposed by the \nadministration and is incorporated in this budget resolution, we will \nhave not really been consistent with what the President said in his \nState of the Union Message.\n  I think one of the finest statements he said in his State of the \nUnion Message is when he said the American people, our Government, \nshould not pass on the problems of today to the next President, to the \nnext Congress, or to the next generation.\n  I am afraid this is exactly what we are prepared to do with respect \nto the way we spend our money and the way we meet our financial \nobligations. We do not have to do that. We can do the right thing.\n  I have been looking for months for an approach that I could believe \nin and say let's do this because it is the right thing to do. This is \nthe right thing to do.\n  I thank those who join me in offering this substitute tomorrow. I \nespecially thank the Concord Coalition for embracing it today and the \nBlue Dog Democrats for giving us the inspiration in the first place. I \nyield back my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of a bipartisan, \nfiscally responsible budget amendment, which I have sponsored with \nSenators Tom Carper and Lincoln Chafee.\n  Our amendment would provide immediate tax relief to every taxpayer in \nthis country, while balancing the budget 4 years earlier than the \nresolution currently being considered.\n  Instead of driving the Nation further into debt, our budget would \ncost $50\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nbillion over 10 years--a fraction of the $1.7 trillion the underlying \nresolution would add to the deficit over the next decade.\n  Our budget corrects for the Budget Committee's low discretionary \nspending limits after 2008 by recognizing the need, at a minimum, to \nincrease domestic discretionary spending with inflation. In contrast, \nthe Budget Committee's mark would increase those limits by an average \nof only 1.5 percent after 2008, a rate of increase which is simply \nunrealistic.\n  Were it not for that needed adjustment to discretionary spending, our \nbudget would actually increase revenue due to a 10-year net surplus on \nthe tax side.\n  Many members of this Chamber have expressed concerns about pursuing a \n$726 billion tax cut at a time of massive projected budget deficits and \nrising uncertainty about the cost of the war with Iraq.\n  In fact, neither the administration's budget, nor the one currently \nbeing considered, nor our budget for that matter, includes funding to \ncover the cost of a war with Iraq, despite estimates that range from \n$60 billion to $100 billion or more.\n  The added cost of this conflict could push our budget deficit this \nyear to over $500 billion, if the surplus in the Social Security Trust \nFund is not included. Although no proposed budget accounts for the cost \nof the war in Iraq, our budget proposal faces the reality of \nsignificant new costs head-on by bringing us back to balance quickly.\n  I share the concerns of many of my colleagues, and I believe our \nprimary responsibility is to pass a budget that meets our nation's \nlong-term needs. And this is what our amendment seeks to do.\n  Why do I support this amendment? Our budget accepts the discretionary \nspending limits laid out in President Bush's budget proposal. Despite \nconcerns about the impact of those limits on many critical priorities, \nI have agreed to those spending limits in an effort to support a \nrealistic compromise which addresses our fiscal needs conservatively.\n  I believe that without real bipartisan compromise, it will prove \nimpossible to return to a balanced budget.\n  Therefore, I join with Senators Carper and Chafee today, because we \nall value fiscal responsibility and recognize the need for balanced \nbudgets.\n  I must state clearly, however, that this budget does include a $10 \nbillion reserve fund for homeland security in fiscal year 2004, and \ndoes not commit to the specific programmatic cuts detailed in the \nPresident's Budget.\n  The Carper/Chafee/Feinstein budget keeps those elements of the \nPresident's proposed tax cut that would benefit all Americans and \nstimulate the economy. It would:\n\n  Immediately expand the 10 percent income tax bracket from $6,000 to \n$7,000; Accelerate cuts to the 27 percent tax bracket from 2004 to \n2003; Increase the child tax credit from $600 to $700; and Accelerate \nmarriage penalty relief from 2005 to 2003.\n  Our budget also includes:\n  Immediately increase the individual estate tax exemption to $3 \nmillion per individual and $6 million per couple--something not \nincluded in the budget which was reported out of Committee. This would \nexempt all but one percent of estates from any tax liability \nwhatsoever.\n  Increase small business expensing limits from $25,000 to $75,000, \nallowing them to make needed capital improvements and expand their \noperations.\n  All of those cuts are retroactive to January 1, 2003, and would \nimmediately put money in every taxpayer's pocket.\n  This budget amendment would pay for these tax cuts in part by \nfreezing planned reductions to the top two tax rates--the rates that \napply to adjusted gross incomes above $143,500 for individuals.\n  Yet even those who pay taxes at this rate would receive tax relief--\nfrom the expansion of the 10 percent bracket, marriage penalty \nreduction, a larger child tax credit, and a cut to the 27 percent \nbracket.\n  This budget does not increase taxes for any American, but instead is \na balanced blueprint designed to promote fiscal responsibility.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1992, we faced a record budget deficit \nof $290 billion, a record which we will almost certainly surpass this \nyear.\n  After securing commitments from Senate moderates in the Centrist \nCoalition, we were able to hold the line on new spending and further \ntax cuts. Those efforts paid off in 1998, when the Federal Government \nreturned to surplus for the first time since the Johnson \nAdministration.\n  It was no coincidence that the path back to surplus, and the \nfollowing three years of consecutive surpluses, coincided with the \ngreatest period of economic expansion in American history.\n  The single biggest impediment to returning to similar rates of \neconomic growth, however, is the tremendous uncertainty facing the \nUnited States.\n  While we now face a war in Iraq and ongoing stand-off in North Korea, \nwe can do a better job in managing our domestic economy.\n  Pushing through a $726 billion tax cut now would only increase \ndeficits and uncertainty, and would lead to a spike in long-term \ninterest rates as we take on trillions in new debt.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this budget. It is a compromise which \nmakes sense.\n  By adopting this budget amendment, we can bring the budget back into \nbalance in six years, stop raiding the Social Security Trust Fund in \nten, and forego nearly $2 trillion in new debt by 2013.\n  The alternative, which does not recognize our current fiscal crisis, \nwill only make future compromises all the more difficult.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I yield myself up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I had a statement earlier today, but I \nwould like to briefly say that I am pleased my colleagues passed the \nsupporting resolution today for our troops. We need a strong and \nunequivocal expression of support for the courageous men and women who \nare fighting for our values and defending America tonight in the \nPersian Gulf. It is important to say that this is an expression that is \nfar more than just a personal expression. It is an expression of \nfeelings that the people of New Jersey--I see my colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg, is in the Chamber as well, and I know both \nof us feel powerfully for the mothers, the fathers, the brothers, the \nsisters, the spouses all of those who have loved ones in harm's way, \nthat we strongly stand with them, and the people across this country do \nas well.\n  The gist of my statement is that no matter how we may have felt and \ndebated and deliberated these issues, our united view is unshakable as \nwe go forward.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment I would like to \nbring up tomorrow. It would increase funding for environmental \nprotection and natural resource conservation, reduce pollution, and \nimprove America's quality of life.\n  If I had my druthers, we would all be dealing with a ``patriotic \npause,'' as far as I am concerned, until we were able to get a better \nhandle on some of the costs. It seems incongruous to me that as our men \nand women are sacrificing on the ground in the Middle East, we are \nunwilling to think about and factor in those costs in this budget \nprocess as we go forward. I think it is particularly unusual to \nunderstand that maybe as soon as next week we will get a supplemental \nthat covers this, and it may be literally hundreds of billions of \ndollars of expenditures that are not considered in the context of a \nbudget that is already estimated at $300 billion on a unified basis, on \nan on-budget basis, and on an off-budget basis $400 billion.\n  It is hard for me to understand, but I am a realist. It is a quarter \nof 11 at night, and we will be debating amendments that make a real \nexpression about what our budget is about, our priorities. I think it \nis absolutely essential that the budget process be about difficult \nchoices and an expression of those choices.\n  For millions of Americans, and certainly for myself, I strongly \nbelieve we cannot neglect the environment and our natural resources, \nand our budget should reflect that importance. I ask my colleagues to \nconsider in that vein\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\nthat the President's fiscal year 2004 budget request increases \ndiscretionary spending at an average rate of 4 percent for all \ndiscretionary spending. But with respect to his requests with regard to \nthe environment and conservation issues, the President's budget \nactually cuts spending on the environment.\n\n  By the way, in the House budget resolution--that is where we will be \nnegotiating when we go to conference--that is a cut of $1.3 billion \nrelative to the enacted levels in fiscal year 2003.\n  Fortunately, the Senate resolution does restore some of that, but in \nmy view we could do a lot better, and we should do a lot better. My \namendment is a simple 1-year amendment to improve that, to meet that 4 \npercent discretionary standard that might be how we are looking at \nother spending.\n  In dollar terms, my amendment would increase our investment in \nenvironmental protection and resource conservation by up to $30.4 \nbillion. That is $2.4 billion above what the President has asked for \nand $1.1 billion over the Senate resolution. The spending is offset by \na corresponding reduction in the size of the tax cut.\n  By adopting this amendment, the Senate would make a strong statement \nthat even in these difficult times we have not lost the desire, the \nfaith, the will, to provide for environmental protection and natural \nresource conservation. They are really continuing important priorities \nof the American people.\n  By adopting this amendment, the Senate would make it possible to fund \na number of very vital environmental programs. I will itemize a couple. \nThe amendment funds clean water and drinking water State revolving \nfunds--something that is important for economic expansion--at a \ncombined level of $3 billion. It is only about $800 million over the \nlevel that is asked for in the budget resolution. This money flows \ndirectly to the State loan funds and will be used to build sewage \ntreatment plants and water purification facilities, an important part \nof our infrastructure.\n  Forty percent of our Nation's lakes and rivers still do not meet the \ngoal of the Clean Water Act of being fishable and swimmable. It is \nabout 80 percent in New Jersey.\n  While my amendment will not get us all the way there, it goes a long \nway to close the gap between where people estimate we should be over \nthe next 25 years and the $535 billion expenditure it will take to get \nus there.\n  Second, my amendment will also fully fund efforts to enforce \nenvironmental laws, clean up toxic waste dumps, and redevelop abandoned \nbrownfield sites. Superfund is critical to my home State. My colleague \nfrom New Jersey has been one of the most articulate advocates in making \nsure we fully fund Superfund. He was one of the original authors of \nbuilding this law in our Nation. We have 111 Superfund sites in New \nJersey, most of any in the Nation. Forty-nine States have Superfund \nsites. One in four Americans lives within a mile of a Superfund site. \nThat is a real health issue, a quality of life issue, and it is one \nthat needs to be addressed.\n  There are lots of ways to go. We are cutting down the number of \ncleanup sites. Two years ago, we had 87 Superfund cleanups in a year. \nIt has dropped below 40 now. We need to do better. We need to work at \nthis now.\n  Of course, there are brownfield sites in every State in the Nation. \nWe were all very proud that we passed the Brownfields Revitalization \nand Environmental Restoration Act of 2001, but getting around to \nfunding that at authorized levels has not happened. My amendment would \nmake this possible in fiscal year 2004. The amendment would fund \nimportant natural resource conservation programs, conservation programs \nthat fight sprawl, protect open space, and improve quality of life for \nall Americans.\n\n  We have a long tradition of valuing and fighting to protect parks, \nwildlands, wildlife, open spaces, recreation resources, and cultural \ntreasures. This is important to the heart and soul of this country, \nspecial places that need to be addressed.\n  Several years ago, as we entered the 21st century, we started the \nConservation Trust Fund that would fund land and water conservation \nprograms in a way that the toolbox would be available across the \ncountry to work on these issues--the sprawl, taking in parklands, and \nprotecting our shorelines. It is unfortunate that we are not adequately \ndealing with this issue that will impact every American's life.\n  So I hope we can consider this amendment. It is funded, as I \nsuggested, out of the tax cuts, and we can do a lot to really improve \nour society with relatively minimal expenditures in such an \noverwhelmingly large budget.\n  By adopting my amendment, the Senate will boost vital environmental \nprotection and natural resource conservation programs. It will mean \ncleaner water, more Superfund sites and brownfields cleaned up, and \nmore acres of open space and wildlife habitat protected. I hope the \nSenate will affirm this commitment to the environment as an important \nfunding priority in our budget. I look forward to bringing up this \namendment for debate tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, probably less than 20 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe given that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I rise to talk now about an amendment I intend to \noffer with Senators Boxer, Corzine, Reed of Rhode Island, Sarbanes, and \nMurray as cosponsors. This amendment would add funding that is critical \nto the Superfund program. My colleague and friend, Senator Corzine, \njust talked about his intention to offer an amendment that is going to \nhelp us maintain a quality of environment that he and I feel is \nnecessary for America.\n  I appreciate one part of that because this budget falls short of \nprotecting Americans from deadly toxins in their communities. Too many \ncommunities in this country live near toxins left behind by polluting \nindustries. Each day we delay cleanups is another day we expose \nfamilies to poisonous chemicals. The numbers are alarming: 70 million \npeople in this country live within 4 miles of a Superfund site and 10 \nmillion of the people exposed to the chemicals at those sites are \nchildren, the most defenseless among us. Ten million children who must \neat their meals, brush their teeth and sleep within a few miles of \nharmful poisons that will persist in their soil and ground water for \ndecades and longer. Children are the most vulnerable among us to \narsenic and DDT and brain-damaging heavy metals such as lead and \nmercury found at the contaminated sites.\n  On March 3, just 2 weeks ago, the EPA announced the latest scientific \ndata that show small children have a tenfold higher risk of developing \ncancer when exposed to chemicals than do adults. Across the Nation, \neach site cleanup--and we have successfully cleaned up over 800 so \nfar--reduces those threats to our children: threats of cancer, learning \ndisabilities, and other chronic and painful health problems.\n  This amendment enables the equivalent of 28 additional sites a year \nto be cleaned up, allowing thousands more families to get out from \nunderneath the shadow of living next to a toxic dump. An extra 25 sites \nmay not sound like a lot unless you and your family live next door to \nan empty lot laced with arsenic and dioxin.\n  This amendment would eventually close the gap between the program's \nneed and what has been budgeted. This amendment assumes reinstatement \nof the original structure and guiding principle of Superfund and \nassumes the restoration of minimal taxes to get that job done. For \nexample, in the case of the oil industry, the tax would be less than 10 \ncents a barrel for every 42 gallons of oil. This is a small investment \nfor the large dividends it would pay. The end result would be measured \nin thousands of happier and healthier children and families.\n  The amendment will permit the addition of $300 million to the \nSuperfund reserve each year for 10 years. That is less than the \napproximately $350 million the Congressional Research Service estimates \nthe budget will fall short of when it tries to meet next year's \nprojected needs for Superfund cleanup, but it is close.\n  At the same time, by making the polluter pay, this amendment \nincreases\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\ntotal Federal revenues by well over $1 billion a year for the next 10 \nyears, contributing to the deficit reduction and helping to lower the \npublic debt.\n  The Superfund needs new life injected into it because this \nadministration has significantly slowed the pace of cleanups, cutting \nthe rates in half. It is time Congress and the administration stopped \nrefusing to force polluters to pay. They are the ones who ought to pay \nfor it. They did it. They spoiled the Earth and the area, and they \nought to pay for this.\n  No other American President, Democrat or Republican, has ever said \nthat taxpayers, not polluters, should pay to clean up their toxic mess, \nand neither should this one. President Ronald Reagan understood the \nimportance of the Superfund trust fund in making the polluter pay. In \n1986, not only did he reauthorize the original Superfund tax, he \napproved two in Superfund taxes, a tax on imported chemical \nderivatives, and corporate income tax of .12 percent on taxable income \nabove $2 million.\n  Reinstating the polluter-pays principle is fair, it has a proven \nrecord of working, and I would urge my colleagues to support this good \ngovernance amendment.\n  I have one more short amendment to discuss, an amendment I will offer \non behalf of myself and Senator Robert Byrd to adequately fund our \nnational passenger rail system, Amtrak, at $1.8 billion.\n  As it stands now, the budget before the Senate assumes that funding \nlevel of only $900 million for Amtrak. That is about half of what the \nrailroad needs. That would be a devastating cut. The funding in this \nfiscal year 2004 budget is nearly 22 percent lower than this year's \nlevel. Without question, it would result in the bankruptcy of our \nnational passenger railroad system halfway through the fiscal year \n2004.\n  This Senate cannot stand idly by and allow this budget to bankrupt \nAmtrak. Amtrak is critical to our Nation's transportation system. We \nhave a new president, an impressive fellow, CEO at Amtrak, David Gunn. \nDavid Gunn has demonstrated his ability to find commonsense solutions \nto tough problems, particularly around rail and transit. We should give \nMr. Gunn the tools he needs to put Amtrak back on the track. Everyone \nfeels confident he has the capability of doing that if we give him the \ntools.\n  In many areas across the Nation, rail is as important to the \ntransportation system as aviation. Amtrak is critical to business and \nthe economy in many communities and improves the quality of life for \nmany Americans who use rail as an alternative to traffic jams on \nhighways and the headaches we find now at the airport.\n  In the days following the September 11 attacks, our entire aviation \nsystem was shut down. The unbelievable took place. It was never \nconceived something could happen in our aviation system that would shut \nthe whole thing down across the country. But it did. Rail served as a \ncritical alternative for those who otherwise would have been stranded.\n  Now, many passengers have shifted to rail on a more permanent basis. \nIn fact, more people take the train to New York from Washington than \ncatch a flight each day. September 11, 2001, showed us we need to \nmaintain an intermodal transportation system. We cannot put all our \nresources into aviation, and we cannot put all of our resources into \nhighways. If we want a 21st century transportation system, we must \ninvest in Amtrak and passenger rail. My amendment would provide Amtrak \nwith the $1.8 billion that has been requested by the Amtrak board of \ndirectors. This is the funding level that will ensure the trains run in \n2004 and beyond. This is also the funding sorely needed for capital \ninvestments to improve infrastructure and improve the system's \nreliability. These capital investments are also needed to help Amtrak \nlower its operating costs. We cannot continue to let them run a \nrailroad held together by duct tape. Without Amtrak, congestion on the \nroads and in the skies would be substantially worse. Amtrak helps to \nremove 18,000 cars a day from the congested Northeast corridor between \nPhiladelphia and New York, and 27,000 cars a day between New York and \nBoston. Everyone knows if there were that many more cars on the road, \nit would be impossible to travel on these highways.\n\n  But Amtrak does more than alleviate congestion in densely populated \nhighway and air corridors. In many cases, Amtrak also provides \nresidents of small rural towns with their only form of intercity \ntransportation. Each year, some 22 million passengers depend on Amtrak \nfor transportation between urban centers and rural locations. Amtrak \nprovides service in 45 of the 50 States. This country of ours, this \nmost advanced Nation in the world, needs a world-class passenger rail \nservice. We can already board a high-speed train from New York's Penn \nStation and arrive in Washington in less than 3 hours. That is city to \ncity. It is without the hassle and the problems one takes going to the \nairports these days.\n  But we should also be able to take a high-speed train from Atlanta to \nCharlotte or Miami. We should be able to travel from Los Angeles to San \nFrancisco or St. Louis to Chicago by high-speed rail.\n  September 11 and the lingering terrorist threat shows us that we need \na viable alternative to aviation for intercity travel. But the budget \nbefore us would cripple our Nation's passenger rail system.\n  Once again, I look to my colleagues to think the problem through \nthoroughly, to recognize even if Amtrak is not a primary mode of \ntransportation in their State, that it is part of the national network \nthat we have to have in a society as advanced and as crowded as ours \nhas gotten to be.\n  I hope we will have the support for passenger rail and support for \nAmtrak.\n  I thank the President, the occupant of the chair, for his indulgence \nof this wee hour of the night. I thank my colleague from Washington, \nalso, for permitting me to talk about my amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise at this late hour to address an \namendment that will be offered tomorrow dealing with the issue of \nworkforce training. I applaud both of my colleagues from New Jersey for \nbeing here at this late hour to articulate a variety of needs in \nSuperfund cleanup and infrastructure.\n  I would like to address an issue about our human infrastructure and \nour investment in job training and education at a time when we have in \nthe Northwest are experiencing some of the highest unemployment in the \ncountry, over 7 percent in the States of Washington, Oregon, and \nAlaska, and a very high average national unemployment rate.\n  The question we are debating on the floor this week is how do we move \nforward with a budget resolution and what should our priorities be? I \nam here tonight to advocate that our priorities should be about a \nprogram that will help put people back to work by making sure they have \nthe skills that are necessary in today's economy.\n  While we hear a lot about the high unemployment, we also know from \nemployers that they can't find the skill level that they are looking \nfor in the workplace among the employees out there today. Why do they \nsay that? We know for a fact that there are thousands of jobs in our \nState in the health care field that cannot be filled. There are \nthousands of jobs in the Information Technology field, but people can't \nbe hired because the skill level just isn't there. Yet we have 110,000 \ndislocated workers in my State of Washington who would love to have \nthose jobs.\n  It is about matching those unemployed workers with job opportunities \nthat employers would like to give them. The missing ingredient is \nfunding, as we have in the past, adequate levels of job training \ndollars to train workers to meet the skills gap.\n  People consider this issue and think: Isn't this about whether we \nhelp an individual worker? And it is. It is about retooling the \nAmerican workforce. It is about retooling our workforce in an \ninformation age economy. But it is also about helping our national \neconomy. Think of it for a second. What happens when you help re-train \nsomebody and they upgrade their skills, as we have done in Washington \nState?\n  I know a woman who was working, employed in the timber industry. She \nwent back to a community college, was re-trained, got an Information \nTechnology job, and made twice as much money. That was good for her but \nwhat was also good was that firm that hired\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\nher found a needed employee to help improve the productivity and bottom \nline of that company. That bottom line productivity and improvement in \nthat company also helped our local economy. It produced a better output \nand a better general economy for the State. So by investing in \nworkforce training we are actually helping our entire national economy.\n  Why at a time with high unemployment, why at a time when our economy \nis transitioning and we are trying to come up with a budget that will \nstimulate growth for the future, would we cut such an economic \ndevelopment tool as job training? I know there will be some people \ntomorrow who will say we are not really cutting programs, instead we \nare actually just moving the dollars around.\n  Earlier in this year we also heard that there were carryover funds to \nfund these job training program. However, my State has spent those \ndollars. They have actually committed those dollars to retrain people \nand upgrade their skills. We will hear tomorrow that, no, the money is \nthere. But, what is really happening is that we are actually decreasing \nthe money to fund important programs like the dislocated worker program \nor adult training program by as much as $678 million dollars. The \nPresident FY 04 budget proposal simply transfers dollars from other \nexisting job training accounts and consolidates them into one adult \ntraining account under the Workforce Investment Act and calls that an \nincrease. We are really robbing Peter to pay Paul. What I would like to \nbe advocating is that those job training dollars need to be increased \nbeyond prior years. What we should be talking about is, not the 2002 \nlevel, but a much higher level in 2004, if we want to reap the benefits \nof having a fully employed workforce. That should be our goal.\n\n  I would even advocate we ought to be looking at the GI bill for job \ntraining and education this year as we reauthorize WIA and the Higher \nEducation Act. That is the best way for us to keep our competitive edge \nin a global economy.\n  Think about it. What is going to happen? I have been in the private \nsector. I hired lots of people for a high-tech firm. What is going to \nhappen when you as an employer can't find the workforce because they \nare not skilled? You don't stop looking. You can't. You have to ship \nproducts. You have to develop your services. You go find the workforce \nwherever they exist. In this case they might be foreign workers.\n  What we are really saying tomorrow is this: By cutting the workforce \ndollars by this budget proposal, we are really saying we would rather \nhave foreign skilled workers in nursing, in Information Technology and \nother professions. Let foreign workers take these jobs rather than \nhelping American workers to fill these jobs.\n  I don't think that is what we want. We want to put the best foot \nforward in an economy that is changing, where companies have to compete \nin a global environment. Any company will tell you that their workforce \nhas to be robust. By robust they mean well educated and ready to shift \nto new products and services as they meet the competition from other \ncompanies in a world that is changing much more rapidly.\n  Even in the best of economic times, I would say we should be greatly \nincreasing our investment in the workforce. In bad economic times, we \nought to be filling that gap in an even much more aggressive fashion, \nto make sure we do not fall behind and that more of these jobs do not \ngo, either overseas internationally because the skill level isn't here, \nor to foreign workers who are coming into our country on green cards \nand filling these jobs because they are the skilled workers.\n  Tomorrow we have an important opportunity, with this workforce \ndevelopment amendment I will be offering, to say to people in this \ncountry that it is not just a tax cut to the wealthiest Americans that \nwill get our economy growing. I disagree with that. But even if you do \nmake some of those tax cuts to those brackets, you have to be saying to \nAmericans who are unemployed and unable to find work at a time when \nemployers are saying I can't find the workers either, when the health \ncare industry is saying there are thousands of nursing jobs to be \nfilled or there are thousands of Information Technology jobs, just give \nme the skills and we will hire them. We need to be making that \ninvestment.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will join me tomorrow in supporting this \nvery important amendment, to make the right priorities and the right \ndecisions about where our workforce, our economy needs to go in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a sense-of-the \nSenate amendment regarding the uninsured. Last week was Cover the \nUninsured Week, a week dedicated to focusing attention on the plight of \nthe millions of uninsured Americans. This week, I want to continue the \nmomentum from this historic event by talking about the uninsured in the \ncontext of the Federal budget.\n  We have all heard the statistics: more than 41 million Americans do \nnot have health insurance. Forty-one million people. We have heard the \nnumber so many times that it seems to have lost its impact. But let's \nlook at that number more closely. Forty-one million people--that is \nabout one in six nonelderly Americans from every conceivable walk of \nlife: children, pregnant women, parents, single adults, full time \nworkers, self-employed individuals, and students.\n  These 41 million people include those who have lost their jobs as the \neconomy has worsened. It includes people who work hard for small \ncompanies that can't afford to offer health benefits to employees. It \nincludes people who work for companies that offer health benefits, but \nwho can't afford their share of the premium. I think most Americans \nwould be surprised to know that more than 80 percent of all uninsured \nchildren and adults live in families where there is at least one \nworking adult. Most of the uninsured--two thirds of them--go without \nhealth insurance for more than 6 months.\n  I learned another sobering statistic last week: almost 75 million \nAmericans were insured for at least some time over the past 2 years. \nThat is almost one of every three Americans under age 65.\n  I don't know about what all this means to you, but to me, this spells \ncrisis. Our health care system is in crisis, and it is up to us to fix \nit.\n  Last month, Senator Clinton and I called on our colleagues on the \nBudget Committee to provide real dollars to cover the uninsured. While \nin the end the Senate Budget Committee did set aside a reserve fund of \n$50 billion to cover the uninsured over the next 10 years, I just don't \nthink this is enough to make a sizeable dent in a problem of this \nmagnitude.\n  The sense of the Senate before you today asks the Senate to make it a \npriority to expand access to health care coverage in the United States. \nIt asks that, to the extent that additional funds are made available, a \nsignificant portion of these funds should be dedicated to expanding \naccess to health care coverage so that fewer Americans have to live \nwithout health care coverage, and the safety net is protected and \nstrengthened.\n  Americans are losing their jobs as the economic downturn continues, \nwithout the benefit of any economic stimulus legislation from us in \nCongress. There can be no doubt what will happen this year--it has \nalready begun. Through no fault of their own, many employers will have \nto raise copayments and premiums, while reducing benefits . . . if they \nare able to continue to offer insurance to their employees at all. The \nbottom line is that this year, more people will lose their health \ninsurance.\n  These facts and figures should disturb all who see them. But behind \nevery single one of those 41 million people is a face and a story. And \nas I travel around Oregon for townhalls with my friend and colleague \nRon Wyden, we look into the faces of the uninsured, and we hear their \nstories, and we see their pain.\n  While the stories are always different--and many of them are tragic--\nthe circumstances that have brought them to these places are often \nsimilar. The loss of a job. An increase in insurance premiums. A \nserious illness. Unavoidable circumstances that could happen to any one \nof us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and ask you to join \nthe growing coalition as we struggle to cover the uninsured.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment \noffered\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\nby the Senator from South Carolina to increase funding to our Nation's \nports.\n  This amendment will provide more funding to help all ports prevent a \nfuture terrorist attack. It will provide $1 billion annually for the \nnext 2 years--an increase of $2 billion total.\n  We all know U.S. seaports are a gaping hole in our Nation's system of \ndefense against terrorism. We have beefed up security at our airports, \nbut as our Nation fights a war in Iraq, we are not doing enough to \nincrease the security of our seaports.\n  Last year, Congress approved legislation, the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act, sponsored by Senators Fritz Hollings, Bob Graham, and \nothers designed to increase security at our ports.\n  In my view, this legislation was a good first step, but our ports \nremain extremely vulnerable to attack. One reason our ports are still \nvulnerable is that the Federal Government has not provided them with \nenough money to enable them to increase security.\n  For example, the Coast Guard has estimated that the present value \ncost of complying with existing and upcoming international and national \nsecurity requirements will be about $6 billion over 10 years. The 10-\nyear present value cost for facility security will be $4.4 billion and \nthe cost to comply with section 102 of the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act alone will be $477 million.\n  These figures do not account for the funds that will be needed to pay \nfor additional security measures that can and should be taken to \nprotect against a terrorist attack at or through our ports.\n  Thus, I am very concerned that, apart from some specific projects and \nearmarks, Congress has appropriated less than $400 million for seaport \nsecurity grants since September 11, 2001. I was disappointed to see \nthat President Bush has not requested a single dime for seaport \nsecurity grants in his fiscal year 2004 budget.\n\n  We also need to provide greater support to the Federal agencies \nenforcing our border security laws. Coast Guard, Customs, and TSA need \nadditional funds for port security vessels, new screening and detection \nequipments, and cargo security programs, and to implement an \nidentification card program.\n  Port security is a crucial national security issue--like immigration \nand other border security functions. We need to ensure that more of the \nmoney to protect our borders is used to safeguard our ports. We simply \ncannot leave the Nation's ports in the lurch, forced to pay the bill to \nprotect our citizens from terrorism.\n  I am particularly concerned that California's ports are not getting \nenough funds to help prevent a terrorist attack.\n  For example, California ports have received about $16.405 million \nfrom the seaport security grant program established by Congress after \nthe September 11 terrorist attack--about 18 percent of the money \navailable. However, according to the Bureau of Transportation \nStatistics, California ports handle almost 50 percent of maritime \ncontainer imports.\n  In other words, if international terrorists overseas put a ``dirty \nbomb'' in a container, the odds are 50-50 that this container would \npass through a California port. Mr. President, $16 million is simply \nnot enough to stop such an attack--especially now when we are on the \nbrink of war.\n  I hope the Department of Homeland Security will ensure that \nCalifornia ports receive their fair share of port security grants in \nfuture allocations. However, this Congress can and must do more.\n  I will soon be introducing legislation that takes a comprehensive \napproach to port security and focuses our limited resources where they \nare needed most. Among other things, the bill would do the following:\n  Update our criminal code to ensure that terrorists who strike at us \nat or through our seaports can be appropriately prosecuted and \npunished;\n  Create a container profiling plan that would concentrate on \nidentifying high-risk cargo early in the shipping process; and\n  Secure the international supply chain by requiring the government to \ncome up with a plan to inspect containers overseas, before they arrive \nin the United States--once a weapon of mass destruction in a container \nreaches the United States, it is too late.\n  Mr. President, I visited two ports last year, Hong Kong and Los \nAngeles/Long Beach, and I learned firsthand how difficult it is to \nprotect our Nation from an attack through a seaport.\n  According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, about 13 \nmillion containers, 20-foot equivalent units, came into U.S. ports in \n2002. However, only about 2 or 3 percent of these containers are \ninspected. This translates into millions of tons of cargo moving \nthrough our ports with no real scrutiny, any one of which could contain \nan explosive or weapon of mass destruction.\n  If attacked, casualties at our ports and surrounding cities could run \nin the thousands and our Nation's economy could be brought to a \nstandstill. Just imagine if a container holding up to 60,000 pounds of \nexplosives slips undetected into a harbor and is detonated--blowing up \na ship, a bridge, or even an entire seaport.\n  Or worse, picture a nuclear device or radiological ``dirty bomb''--no \nbigger than a suitcase--installed in a container, shipped to the United \nStates, and exploded at a port or somewhere within the interior of our \ncountry.\n  Beyond the human toll, such an attack would mean that every container \nin the system would have to be inspected to ensure that there wasn't \nanother bomb out there--grinding our economy to a halt. One estimate \nsuggests that it would take 6 months to screen all of the containers in \nthe system on any given day. So we must do everything in our power to \nprevent an attack from happening in the first place.\n  Simply put, more funding is of critical importance when you consider \nthe October 2002 report by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman. \nThe followup Hart-Rudman report points out, ``Only the tiniest \npercentage of containers, ships, trucks, and trains that enter the \nUnited States each day are subject to examination--and a weapon of mass \ndestruction could well be hidden among this cargo.''\n\n  The report recommends revising transportation security because ``the \nvulnerabilities are greater and the stakes are higher in the sea and \nland modes than in commercial aviation. Systems such as those used in \nthe aviation sector, which start from the assumption that every \npassenger and every bag of luggage poses an equal risk, must give way \nto more intelligence-driven and layered security approaches that \nemphasize prescreening and monitoring based on risk-criteria.''\n  The bottom line: We must do a better job of profiling and inspecting \ncargo that could put our Nation and our citizens at risk. This will \ntake time, money, and cooperation from industry--but it is a necessary \nand critical part of our homeland security effort.\n  A year and a half has passed since our Nation was struck by \nterrorists from the sky. We can't afford to wait for a similar--or \npotentially greater--tragedy to provide adequate funds for port \nsecurity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I start by congratulating the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, on his fine work.\n  One of the reasons for the problems of last session was the absence, \nfor the first time in a generation, of a budget resolution. Chairman \nNickles has carried the President's budget to the floor and been a \nloyal lieutenant for our Commander in Chief. It looks as if much of the \nPresident's budget may remain intact, but it is also true that the \nbudget will change somewhat.\n  Let me make it clear. I support the President's budget, including the \ntax cut number and the growth package.\n  I believe we need a bold response to the flagging economy. It is our \nobligation to the folks that sent us here. We need to respond. Both \nsides agree on that need, as do the centrists, led by Senators Breaux \nand Snowe. Where the Democratic caucus, the Republican caucus, and the \ncentrists differ is on the number we allocate for growth proposals.\n  The debate we have this afternoon is about that number. Really, \nthough, the debate is about whether we should be bold, cautious, or \ntimid. The President and most of the Republican caucus want to be bold. \nWe want American\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\nbusinesses, small and large, to grow. We want every American who wants \na job to be able to get a job. We don't want to take any chances.\n  The Democratic leadership's proposed growth package yields a net tax \nincrease of $11.7 billion. That package also contains new spending of \n$118.7 billion. I call that a timid response to the flagging economy.\n  Now, let's turn to the Breaux-Snowe-Baucus-Voinovich amendment. I \nunderstand the concerns of my friends from the Centrist Coalition. They \nare worried about long-term deficits. I am too.\n  I am more worried about the spending side of the ledger. The \nCentrists are focusing on the tax cut side only. It is important that \nthe Centrists' amendment does place the tax cut reduction into deficit \nreduction. There is, however, no guarantee that the $375 billion will \nnot be spent in subsequent amendments on this resolution.\n  Senators Breaux and Snowe have a long history of trying to secure \nbipartisan consensus. In 2001, they, along with Senator Baucus, were \ncritical supporters of the bipartisan tax relief package. They are \nwidely known for their efforts to find bipartisan consensus on \nMedicare. I will be looking to this group when we take up Medicare \nlegislation later this year.\n  Senators Breaux and Snowe suggest that the middle ground is splitting \nthe difference between the President's number of $726 billion and the \nDemocratic leadership's position.\n  I am opposed to this amendment because we need more than $350 billion \nto do the job the right way. Don't get me wrong. If $350 billion is the \nnumber, that is the number the Finance Committee will work with. The \nFinance Committee will develop the best package we can.\n  My point is that the Finance Committee can do more growth incentives \nwith a number above $350 billion.\n  Now, some view the net $350 billion as a vote against the President's \nproposal to eliminate the double taxation of dividends.\n  I support the President's proposal to eliminate the double taxation \nof dividends. It is good tax policy and it is good economic policy.\n  This vote is not about the dividends proposal. The Finance Committee, \nin its bipartisan way, will decide the composition of the growth \npackage.\n  To my moderate friends, let me say something in conclusion. No matter \nwhere the number ends up, I expect Senator Baucus and I will produce a \nbipartisan growth package.\n  The Breaux-Snowe amendment, while well intentioned, does not provide \nthe Finance Committee with the tools necessary to do the job of \ndelivering a bold growth package to the American people.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 363\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the \nSenate the critical shortfall in funding for the Indian Health Service, \nIHS--a shortfall addressed by an amendment I intend to offer tomorrow.\n  Through treaties and Federal statute, the Federal Government has \npromised to provide health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives. \nIn the Indian health amendments of 1992, Congress specifically pledged \nto ``assure the highest possible health status for Indians and urban \nIndians and to provide all resources necessary to effect that policy.''\n  Sadly, we haven't even come close to honoring this commitment. The \nIHS is the only source of health care for many Indians, and is required \nto provide it, yet funding has never been adequate. The chronic \nunderfunding has only grown worse in recent years, as appropriations \nhave failed to keep up with the steep rise in private health care \nspending.\n  The results are startling and disturbing. While per capita health \ncare spending for the general U.S. population is about $4,400, the \nIndian Health Service spends only about $1,800 per person on individual \nhealth care services. The Government also spends considerably less on \nhealth care for Indians than it spends for Medicare beneficiaries, \nMedicaid recipients, and veterans.\n  This level of funding is woefully inadequate to meet the health care \nneeds of Native Americans--who have a lower life expectancy than other \nAmericans, and disproportionately suffer from a number of serious \nmedical problems. Indians have higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, \nsudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and tuberculosis. There is also a \ngreat need for substance abuse and mental health services.\n  More funds are needed if the IHS is to provide necessary health care \nservices to Indians. The current shortage of funds is having serious \nconsequences. Native Americans are often denied care that most of us \ntake for granted and, in many cases, would consider essential. They can \nbe required to endure long waits before seeing a doctor and may be \nunable to obtain a referral to see a specialist. Sometimes lack of \nfunds means care is postponed until Indians are literally at risk of \nlosing their lives or their limbs. Other Indians receive no care at \nall.\n  This rationing of care means that all too often Indians are forced to \nwait until their medical conditions become more serious--and more \ndifficult to treat--before they may access health care. This is a \nsituation none of us would find acceptable, yet this is the reality in \nIndian country.\n  Last year, Gregg Bourland and Harold Frazier, then the chairman and \nvice chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, sent a \nletter to the IHS. This is how they described the situation in Eagle \nButte:\n\n       In January and February 2002, the Eagle Butte Service Unit \n     on the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation has been swamped with \n     children with Influenza A, RSV [Respiratory Syntactical \n     Virus], and one fatal case of meningitis. There are only \n     three doctors on duty, one Physician Assistant, and one Nurse \n     Practitioner. The only pediatrician is the Clinical Director \n     who will not see any patients, even though there is a serious \n     need for the services of a pediatrician. Several of these \n     children have presented with breathing problems, high fever, \n     and severe vomiting. The average waiting time at the clinic \n     has been four and six hours. The average time at the \n     emergency room is similar. Most babies have been sent home \n     without any testing to determine what they have and with \n     nothing but cough syrup and Tylenol. In at least three cases, \n     the baby was sent home after these long waits two or more \n     times with cough syrup, only to be life-flighted soon \n     thereafter because the child could not breathe. The children \n     were all diagnosed by the non-IHS hospital with RSV \n     [Respiratory Syntactical Virus]. No babies have died yet, but \n     the Tribe sees no justification for waiting until this \n     happens when these viruses are completely diagnosable and \n     treatable.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. It is absolutely unacceptable to put the lives \nof these children at risk. And we can do something to help. On more \nthan one occasion, I have heard horror stories of pregnant mothers \ndelivering children in circumstances that no expectant mother or child \nshould have to endure.\n\n  For example, right now the Service Unit at Eagle Butte in South \nDakota does not have an obstetrician. The Eagle Butte Service Unit is \nfunded at 44 percent of the need calculated by the Indian Health \nService. The facility has a birthing room and 22 beds, but there are \nonly two to three doctors to staff the clinic, hospital and emergency \nroom. Naturally, as a result, many children and expecting mothers do \nnot receive the care they need and deserve. Due to budget constraints, \nthe IHS policy is to allow only one ultrasound per pregnancy. The \nvisiting obstetrician is available only every couple of weeks.\n  The story of Brayden Robert Thompson points out how dangerous this \nsituation is. On March 3, 2002, Brayden's mother was in labor with a \nfull-term, perfectly healthy baby. Brayden's umbilical cord was wrapped \naround his neck, but, without ultrasound, that went undetected. The \navailable medical staff didn't know what to do about his lowered \nheartbeat, abnormal urinalysis or the fact that his mother was not \nfeeling well. Despite the symptoms, IHS refused to provide an \nultrasound or to send her to Pierre to see an obstetrician. Brayden was \nstillborn. This tragic death was completely preventable, but tough \nchoices are being made every day at IHS facilities throughout the \ncountry because there simply isn't enough money to provide the care \nthat every American deserves.\n  The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in my State of South Dakota built a \nbeautiful new hospital and health care center. In many ways, they are \nequipped to provide state-of-the-art, coordinated care. But they cannot \nretain health care professionals because of low payment schedules and \ninadequate training opportunities for local people. Their shiny new \nlabor and delivery rooms, surgery rooms and even\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\ndental chairs stand empty, and individuals on the reservation are \nforced to travel long distances to receive these vital services. This \nalso is the case on the neighboring Rosebud Indian Reservation.\n  This is not solely an Indian issue. This is a community issue. It \naffects surrounding rural community hospitals, ambulance services, and \nother health care providers who work with IHS. For example, the Lake \nAndes-Wagner ambulance district in northeastern South Dakota is facing \nfinancial disaster, in part because they have not been reimbursed \nproperly by the Indian Health Service. This ambulance service offers \nemergency transport for citizens of Charles Mix County and Yankton \nSioux tribal members, since the Wagner IHS hospital cannot afford to \noperate its own service. If this ambulance service shuts down, what \nwill these residents--Indian and non-Indian--do when they face an \nemergency?\n  Bennett County hospital in the southwestern part of the South Dakota \nis located between the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Indian Reservations, and \nsuffers similar IHS reimbursement problems, as do other non-IHS \nproviders in South Dakota and throughout rural America. From 1998 to \n2001, the most recent year for which IHS has data, IHS contract denials \nhave increased 75 percent.\n  In his budget request for the next fiscal year, the President \nrequested only $1.99 billion for clinical services for Indians. This \nrepresents only a small increase over what the President requested for \nfiscal year 2003, and virtually no increase over what was finally \nincluded in the omnibus appropriations bill. We can and must do better.\n  The amendment I am proposing would increase funding for clinical \nservices by $2.9 billion over the President's request for fiscal year \n2004. It is the minimal amount that is necessary to provide basic \nhealth care to the current IHS user population. The full cost over the \nnext 10 years would be $38.7 billion. The amendment also devotes an \nequal amount to deficit reduction, all offset by a corresponding \ndecrease in the top tax rate reduction.\n  The amendment is cosponsored by Senators Inouye, Bingaman, Dorgan, \nMurray, Wyden, Johnson, Leahy, Cantwell, Reid, and Kennedy. It is also \nsupported by a wide range of health organizations, native and non-\nnative.\n  This budget resolution is a test of this Nation's priorities. Some \nwill say that it doesn't matter, that it is purely symbolic. But the \nwhole point of the budget resolution is to establish an enforceable \nfiscal framework and make room in our budget for needs that we believe \nare worthy of our national attention.\n  I know there are some in this body who honestly believe that it is \nmore important to eliminate the taxation of stock dividends--or \naccelerate huge tax cuts for our Nation's wealthiest citizens than to \nprovide Native Americans the health care they have been promised but \ndenied. Some defend that position by saying that someday, somehow, \nthese Native Americans will benefit from the tax cuts extended to \nothers, that the benefit will ``trickle down'' to them. It is their \nright to take that position, but they could not be more wrong.\n  A woman going into labor cannot wait for economic benefits to trickle \ndown to her. A child in respiratory distress cannot wait, either. How \nis it possible that we can afford to delve deeper into debt to fund \nadditional tax cuts for those doing relatively well in this country, \nbut we cannot afford to dedicate a small fraction of that amount to \nfund the most basic health care services for some of the poorest people \nin America who have been guaranteed that care?\n  We must not tolerate this situation any longer.\n  The problem is real; the solution is simple. Give the Indian Health \nService the funds it needs to provide Native Americans the health \nbenefits they were promised. Yes, it will require a slight decrease in \nthe reduction of the top tax rate. But those top-bracket taxpayers will \nstill get the benefit of every other rate reduction and every other tax \nbreak available to them, and almost 2 million Native Americans will \nhave health care coverage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the National Indian Health \nBoard and Friends of Indian Health be printed in the Record at the \nclose of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 national Indian Health Board,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2003.\n       Dear Senate Member: On behalf of the National Indian Health \n     Board, we are writing to urge your support of a floor \n     amendment providing a $2.9 billion increase over the \n     President's FY 2004 funding request to enhance the Indian \n     Health Service (IHS) clinical services budget. Further, we \n     urge you to participate in the floor discussion and join \n     other American Indian and Alaska Native health advocates on \n     both sides of the aisle as we work together to educate other \n     Senate members about the health needs in Indian Country and \n     how the $2.9 billion increase to IHS clinical services would \n     save many lives.\n       While we understand the difficult decisions the United \n     States government is facing regarding the FY 2004 budget due \n     to military action in Iraq, a sluggish economy and the war on \n     terrorism, it is equally important that the federal \n     government honor its trust responsibility to American Indians \n     and Alaska Natives by ensuring that IHS has adequate funding \n     to meet basic health care needs. Adoption of an increase in \n     the clinical services budget of the Indian Health Service of \n     $2.9 billion for FY 2004 will move us one critical step \n     closer to that goal.\n       Medical care for American Indians and Alaska Natives is \n     currently rationed, which has created a health care crisis. \n     Patients are faced with a ``life or limb'' test that dictates \n     whether they may or may not receive IHS health services. In \n     most situations, unless their lives are immediately \n     threatened or they risk the loss of a limb, their treatment \n     is deferred for higher priority cases.\n       Additionally, local health care providers outside of the \n     IHS system feel the consequences of this lack of funding. \n     Because IHS is so under-funded and is often unable to offer \n     the full range of necessary care, the agency contracts with \n     local hospitals and other health care facilities and often is \n     unable to reimburse these non-IHS facilities for the services \n     they provide, resulting in serious budget shortfalls for the \n     contract facilities.\n       Once again, we urge you to join members on both sides of \n     the aisle in supporting this $2.9 billion increase as we work \n     towards eliminating the health disparities plaguing Indian \n     Country. I hope I can count on your support, and should you \n     require further information, please contact J.T. Petherick, \n     National Indian Health Board Deputy Director of Legislative \n     Affairs at (202) 742-4262 or by e-mail at \n     jpetherick@nihb.org. We look forward to working with you to \n     address the health challenges facing American Indian and \n     Alaska Native communities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Julia Davis-Wheeler,\n                        Chairperson, National Indian Health Board.\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                     Friends of Indian Health,\n\n                                                   March 20, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: Our organizations are writing to urge you to \n     support the Daschle budget amendment to S. Con. Res. 23 that \n     calls for increasing funding for FY 04 for Indian Health \n     Services clinical services.\n       The state of Indian health is at a crisis level and appears \n     to be worsening compared to all other races in the nation. \n     According to mortality data collected by the IHS, between FY \n     1997-1999, death rates for American Indians/Alaska Natives \n     (AI/AN) from diabetes, cancer, suicide and injuries rose \n     significantly. These increases have resulted in an overall \n     increase in the death rate for AI/ANs while rates for all \n     other Americans have been dropping. This health disparity gap \n     will likely continue unless access to treatment and \n     preventive services are significantly improved.\n       An increase of $2.9 billion would allow the IHS to restore \n     lost services. Since 1992, due to budget shortfalls, the IHS \n     has experienced an almost 20% loss of spending power. \n     Repeated failures to fund mandatory costs for population \n     growth and inflation, have resulted in the tribes, urban \n     Indian programs and the IHS absorbing close to three-quarters \n     of $1 billion in program costs. As a result our organizations \n     have seen decreases in important primary care services \n     including:\n       A 37% decline in well child services between FY 1992-97\n       A 35% decline in physical exams between FY 1994-97 and,\n       A 26% reduction in people receiving dental services between \n     FY 1992-99.\n       We believe that in order to meet the health care needs of \n     the AI/AN population, the FY 2004 budget resolution must \n     include realistic funding levels to restore clinical and \n     preventive services and attract a viable workforce of health \n     care providers.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter of vital \n     importance to America's Indians.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \nproposed by my leader, the Senator from South Dakota.\n  I think it is important to review briefly the history that brought us \nto this point today.\n  A few hundred years ago, before the first Europeans landed on the \nshores of what is now the United States, the Indian nations exercised \ndominion and control over 550 million acres of the land which became \nAmerica.\n  By the time of the Revolutionary War, relations with the Indian \ntribes were well established, and it was the Native people of this land \nwho provided food to General George Washington and his troops that \nsustained them throughout the harsh winter at Valley Forge.\n  Native warriors fought beside the revolutionary soldiers, and their \nvaluable contributions to the success of the war for independence was \nwidely chronicled.\n  Later, as our Founding Fathers undertook the task of developing a \nconstitution for a new Nation, it was the governmental structure of the \nIroquois Confederacy that they chose as the model for our democracy and \nthe foundation of our government.\n  In contemporary times, more Indian men and women, on a per capita \nbasis, have put on the uniform of our country and placed themselves in \nharm's way in defense of our country than any other ethnic group.\n  This dedication to a nation that has many sad and sorry chapters in \nits history of relations with the Native people of this land is \nremarkable.\n  Nonetheless, Indian people have served in the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States in greater numbers than any other segment of the \npopulation, on a per capita basis, in World War II, the Korean War, the \nVietnam War, the Gulf War and Desert Storm, and in every military \naction in which our country has been engaged in modern times.\n  These are the people whose ancestors ceded 500 million acres of land \nto America, in exchange for certain fundamental commitments on the part \nof the United States, including the provision of health care.\n  So, as has been observed more than once in this Chamber, the Native \npeople of the United States has paid their dues.\n  They have sacrificed their sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, \nuncles and aunts in the defense of our Nation.\n  And through their treaties with the United States, and their cession \nof millions of acres of land to the United States, the Native people of \nthis land purchased the first prepaid health plan in America.\n  The question that we are confronted with today is: What promises did \nthe United States make to the Native people of America in treaties and \nwhat responsibilities did the United States undertake in subsequently \nenacted Federal laws, and how do those commitments measure up to what \nis provided to other Americans today in the arena of health care \nservices?\n  I believe that the reason my colleague from South Dakota has come \nforward today with his amendment is that he sees in his home State of \nSouth Dakota the same dynamic that we see across Indian country--a \nhealth care system that is woefully underfunded and alarmingly \nunderstaffed, with facilities that are in such a state of disrepair \nthat many of them have been condemned.\n  As a veteran and as ranking member of the Defense Appropriations \nsubcommittee, I have had the opportunity to compare the investments our \nNation makes in the health care provided to our veterans, to our men \nand women in active duty service and their dependent, and to our \nFederal employees.\n  I think these comparative expenditures should interest our \ncolleagues--for they tell the story and paint a dramatic picture of \ndisparities that are so large and frankly, so shocking, that we would \nbe negligent and irresponsible were we to fail to address them.\n  Let's look at veterans. The Veterans' Administration expended $5,214 \nfor medical care for each eligible veteran in 2001. In 1999, Medicare \nexpended $5,915 per eligible Medicare enrollee.\n  The average medical expenditure in the United States on a per capita \nbasis in 1999 was $5,065 per patient.\n  For Medicaid enrollees, $3,879 was expended for each eligible \nMedicaid patient in 1998.\n  For inmates in Federal prisons, $3,803 were expended for health care \nservices provided to each inmate in 1999.\n  Just a little less--$3,725--was provided to Federal employees in 1999 \nfor health care services under an eligible Federal health care plan.\n  Compare all of these figures with that provided to patients of the \nIndian Health Service in 2002--a shocking $1,914 per patient for \nmedical care and $619 for nonmedical care such as preventive health \ncare services.\n  So if you are an Indian person and you are in need of health care \nservices, you would have twice as much provided for your health care as \na Federal prison inmate than you would as a law-abiding Native citizen \nof the United States.\n  If you were a veteran, 60 percent more would be dedicated to \nproviding health care to you, and if you were eligible for Medicare, \nthe percentage would be even higher.\n  This is the relative nature of the manner in which we carry out our \ncommitments to the Native people of this land.\n  Now let's look at some health statistics of the Native American \npopulation. If you are an Indian or an Alaska Native, the likelihood \nthat you will die from diabetes is 390 percent higher than for other \nAmericans.\n  As a Native person, your chances of dying from tuberculosis are 500 \npercent higher than other Americans.\n  And if you are a newborn or an infant Native child, your mortality \nrate is 25 percent higher than other infants.\n  Rates of cardiovascular disease are twice those for the general \npublic and they continue to increase while the incidence of \ncardiovascular disease is going down amongst the general population.\n  To complete this picture, we also need to look at the health care \nsystem that is designed to serve the needs of Native people.\n  Health care in Native America is provided through the Indian Health \nService system of hospitals and clinics, through tribally operated \nhospitals and clinics, through urban Indian health care programs, and \nthrough government contracts with private hospitals and health care \nproviders.\n  In some of the most heavily populated areas of Indian country, \nparticularly California, Oregon, and Washington State, there are no \nIndian Health Service hospitals and clinics, so Native people in those \nstates must rely on either a tribal health care system or on contract \nhealth care services.\n  But because of the severe constraints that have been imposed on funds \navailable for the purchase of contract health care services, those who \nmust seek care outside the Indian Health Service system have to prove \nthat their condition is either life-threatening or that they may lose a \nlimb in the absence of treatment.\n  So if you have severe diabetes and resultant kidney damage, for \nexample, as a Native person you wouldn't be eligible for kidney \ndialysis until you were at death's door. Physicians would instruct us \nthat by that time, it is often too late to save the life of a patient.\n  In this category alone, there is a shortfall of $20.6 million of what \nis needed for contract health care services.\n  To bring the 55 most poorly funded tribal health care systems up to \n40 percent of the identified health care needs, it would require $34 \nmillion.\n  And to bring tribal communities across the Nation up to just 60 \npercent of the identified health care needs, it would require $388 \nmillion.\n  The Indian Health Service is also charged with providing safe water \nand sanitation facilities for Indian communities, but there is a $1.753 \nbillion backlog in sanitation facilities.\n  For basic primary health care services--services which most Americans \ntake for granted because their access is unlimited--for Native people \nthe need that is unmet is $6.336 billion.\n  For Indian people suffering from cancer, the health care service need \nthat is currently unmet is $294 million.\n  For those Native patients with heart disease, the unmet need for \nhealth care services is $369 million.\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\n  Native Americans with diabetes have an unmet need for health care \ntreatment of $452 million.\n  I could go on and on with such tragic statistics--and if they were \njust numbers it might be a different matter--but each of these \nstatistics represents thousands of Native people who are going without \nthe most fundamental health care.\n  These are the people who have given this country their land so that \nwe could build a new nation.\n  These are the people who have sacrificed their lives in the defense \nof our country.\n  These are the people who have given the most and who are in turn, \nprovided the least.\n  Most of the Indian Health Service hospitals are over 30 years old. \nThey are so badly in need of repair and replacement that the minimum \nunmet need is $610 million.\n  Year after year, the costs associated with providing care--salaries \nof doctors and nurses and other health care professionals serving \nIndian country--fail to keep pace with those employed in the Department \nof Defense and Veterans' Administration health care systems, or with \nmedical inflation rates.\n  Not surprisingly, these valued professionals leave Indian country for \nmore pay, better working conditions, and as caring people--for the \npromise that the patients they see on a daily basis won't have to wait \nuntil their lives are hanging in the balance before they can receive \ncare.\n  If treaties mean anything--and the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly \nheld that treaties are the highest laws of the land--then this Nation \nhas not only a moral duty but a legal obligation to fulfill its treaty \ncommitments to the Native people of this land.\n  And I think that these numbers make it abundantly clear why the \namendment proposed by my friend from South Dakota is conservative.\n  It won't meet all of the health care needs in Indian country, but it \nwould be a good beginning in addressing conditions that are devastating \nand tragic by any measure--conditions which portray a shameful picture \nthat a benevolent and prosperous nation appears to care so little about \nits First Americans.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Daschle's \namendment to increase funds for the Indian Health Service's clinical \nservices by $2.9 billion. I believe access to good health care services \nis a basic human right. This is especially true for Native Americans, \nfor whom the Federal Government has the trust responsibility to deliver \nhealth care services. But statistics tell us that when it comes to \nensuring good health for Native Americans, we are failing.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act, S. 212, which I cosponsored \nlast year, includes some sobering statistics. The bill reads, ``In \ndeath rates for example, Indian people suffer a death rate for diabetes \nmellitus that is 249 percent higher than the death rate for all races \nin the United States, a pneumonia and influenza death rate that is 71 \npercent higher, a tuberculosis death rate that is 533 percent higher, \nand a death rate from alcoholism that is 627 percent higher.'' This is \nunacceptable.\n  When I meet with tribes from Washington State and around the country, \nimproving access to health care for underserved populations--from neo-\nnatal care for pregnant women to care for elders--almost always comes \nup. I understand that narrowing the health gap that exists between \nNative Americans and non-natives is a complex challenge. Good health \ncare for Native Americans depends in part on decreasing poverty and \nunemployment, improving education, strengthening economic development, \nand overcoming physical and cultural barriers to accessing good health \ncare.\n  But it also depends on adequate resources, and I believe we must do \nmore in this area. In 2003, medical inflation exceeded 12 percent in \nthe Pacific Northwest. With medical inflation in the double digits and \ngrowing Native American populations, we cannot accept cuts to the \nIndian Health Service. Nor can we accept only minimal increases in \nfunding for IHS programs year after year.\n  But that is what this Budget Committee has proposed, in keeping with \nPresident Bush's 2004 budget request. This Budget Resolution assumes no \ndiscretionary increases in funding for IHS. The Bush Administration has \nasked for an increase of only 2 percent for IHS clinical services. This \nis woefully inadequate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to increase funding to \nensure good health care for Native Americans. This amendment to the \nbudget resolution will provide an increase of $2.9 billion for IHS \nclinical services in fiscal year 2004 and a $40 billion increase over \nthe next ten years. The cost of these increases for the Indian Health \nService is paid for by a decrease in the proposed tax cut.\n  The Daschle amendment provides a crucial first step towards securing \nincreased appropriations for Indian health care. Over 90,000 Indian \npeople in the Northwest, and more than 1.5 million Native Americans \nnationwide, depend on IHS funds and services. We can no longer let down \nAmerican Indians by continuing to under-fund vital health care \nservices. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nbudget resolution.\n  First I would like to say that it is nice to actually have a budget \non the floor in the Senate. We didn't ever get to vote on one last \nyear, and I would like to compliment Chairman Nickles on moving this \nresolution swiftly through the budget committee and to the Senate \nfloor.\n  We have to remember that part of our responsibility to our \nconstituents is not to just listen to and be their voice in Washington.\n  We also have to respect and follow the traditions, rules and \nprocesses of our duties that have been entrusted to us.\n  Whether it is following the committee process to get a bill to the \nfloor, or allowing an up or down vote on a president's judicial \nnominee, we have to remember that the Senate is only as great as those \nwho serve in it.\n  I think the Senate suffered last year when for the first time in \nnearly three decades we did not even consider a budget resolution.\n  It then took us almost a full year to get all of our work done. We \ndidn't pass last year's appropriations bills until just 2 months ago.\n  Last year we failed and we have to improve. The result was a broken \nprocess that limped along for months and months. This year we have to \ndo better and I believe we will.\n  We face a tough budget for 2004. While I am happy the budget \nresolution before us balances the budget within 10 years, we do face \nsome large deficits in the near term.\n  These large deficits primarily occur because we have had a steep \ndecline in revenue.\n  Contrary to what some of my colleagues try to argue, our revenue \nproblems are caused by a weak economy and not tax cuts.\n  The evidence is overwhelming that tax cuts stimulate the economy. \nThey create jobs, and increase economic activity, that leads to more \nrevenue.\n  And that is why we need tax cuts now--to get the economy out of a rut \nand to help improve the budget forecast.\n  If American businesses are not generating profits, if American \nworkers are not working, the result is a lot less money coming into the \nFederal Government through various taxes.\n  Decreased tax receipts do not mean taxes are too low; they mean the \neconomy is too slow. We cannot make these budget numbers look better in \nthe long term without a strong economy.\n  Many of my friends argue against tax cuts and at the same time \ncomplain about falling revenues.\n  If they really want to increase federal receipts and provide more \nfunding for their favorite programs, tax cuts are the answer.\n  Our budget committee, under the leadership of chairman Nickles, has \ncrafted a strong budget.\n  Besides this budget outlining our federal spending priorities, it \nalso addresses one of the most important challenges facing our country \ntoday--strengthening the economy.\n  At its core, this budget recognizes that we must grow our economy. \nThat is why the budget committee chose to include a jobs and growth \npackage at the very core of this budget and to include that package in \nreconciliation.\n  We have a fundamental responsibility to the American people to make\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\nthis economy stronger and to return it to a growth pattern we have \nenjoyed in the past.\n  Many here have expressed concerns for our men and women who are \nfighting for our freedoms and to liberate the people of Iraq.\n  We all pray for their safety and their quick return home to their \nloved ones. But in addition to our responsibility to do what we can to \ninsure their safety overseas, we must also focus upon our \nresponsibilities to them when they return.\n  While we continue to pray for a quick and decisive end to this war, \nwe have to think about what our soldiers and sailors will have to come \nhome to.\n  An economy with an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent is not good \nenough. An economy that's barely growing is not good enough.\n  We have to do better. We have to make sure they have choices and \nopportunities in the American job market that will allow them to \nsupport themselves and their families.\n  It is not going to do us any good to win the war and lose the \neconomy. We have to do both at the same time.\n  We have to get this economy moving and Americans working. And the \njobs and growth package included in this budget resolution is the \nanswer to our economic troubles.\n  The council of economic advisors estimates that this economic growth \nplan will create 510,000 new jobs in 2003 and another 891,000 new jobs \nby the end of 2004.\n  The business roundtable estimates that around 3.5 million jobs will \nbe created over that same time frame.\n  Between these two estimates, that is 1.5 million to 3.5 million \nAmericans that will not be working over the next two years if we \neliminate the President's growth package from this budget.\n  The majority of the Budget Committee believe strongly in the wisdom \nof this jobs and growth package. And that is why we provided for the \npackage under the special procedures of reconciliation.\n  Through the accelerated procedures provided by reconciliation, we \nwill be able to enact changes to help our economy sooner rather than \nlater. The faster we can implement these policies, the better it will \nbe for all of us.\n  While the details of any growth package will be determined by the \nSenate Finance Committee, I hope that any bill that comes out of that \ncommittee, on which I serve, will include many, if not all, of the \nproposals that have been put forward by President Bush.\n  High on the list are the acceleration of a number of proposals we \npassed in 2001 which are scheduled to totally phase-in and become \neffective in later years.\n  The President's plan will immediately increase the child tax credit \nto $1000. This will benefit over 25 million American families--342,000 \nof them in Kentucky.\n  The President's plan will accelerate the expansion of the 10 percent \ntax bracket--which benefits all American taxpayers. Over 69 million \ntaxpayers will benefit from this provision, including 879,000 \nKentuckians.\n  Over 35 million married couples--almost 500,000 of them in Kentucky--\nwill benefit from the President's acceleration of marriage penalty \nrelief.\n  We also accelerate the reduction of the marginal tax rates. It is \nestimated this will provide 28 million taxpayers with a tax cut--\nincluding the 85 percent of America's small businesses which pay \npersonal income taxes rather than corporate taxes.\n  Approximately 79 percent of the tax relief provided by accelerating \nthe reduction in the top bracket to 35 percent would go to small \nbusiness owners. As my colleagues are aware, it is the entrepreneurs \nand small business owners which create two-thirds of the new jobs in \nthe United States.\n  Another component of the President's jobs and growth package is the \nelimination of the double taxation of dividends.\n  This could be the most effective provision of all of the President's \nproposals contained in the President's budget. But because of the usual \nclass warfare mantra from its opponents, it may be the toughest to \nsell.\n  Half of all households in America own stock and 50 percent of all \ndividend income goes to our country's seniors. So a reduction in the \ntax rate that dividends face--currently in the range of a 60 to 70 \npercent marginal rate--could have a real impact on our economy by \nallowing more dollars to be spent by consumers.\n  This reduction in the double taxation of dividends not only assists \ncurrent dividend recipients, but it assists all who own stock.\n  Some private-sector estimates indicate that market increases from \nthis proposal could be up to 20 percent. This would be welcome news to \nAmericans who have been hard hit by the loss of about $7 trillion in \nthe value of U.S. stocks since March 2000.\n  An added bonus to eliminating the double taxation is the change it \nwill have on the debt-to-equity ratios of American businesses.\n  Treasury Secretary Snow estimates we could see changes in the debt-\nto-equity ratios in the range of 5 to 8 percent. This movement of \ncorporations toward the use of more equity and less debt would leave \nthem less vulnerable to economic downturns.\n  And before we hear the usual cries from the opponent's of the \nPresident's tax relief package--who say we are raiding the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund to pay for tax cuts for the rich--let me set the \nrecord straight.\n  As the law requires, we invest social security funds in government \nbonds which are the safest and most reliable investment out there.\n  These bonds are kept in a secure facility in Clarksburg, WV. And no \none has shown up there to grab these bonds and hand them out to the \nrich. That is just a bogus claim.\n  The President's growth package is just that--an economic growth \npackage. We recently passed an extension of unemployment benefits and \nPresident Bush signed that into law. While this may provide a quick--\nyet short--stimulus to the economy, what we really need is a long-term \njobs and economic growth plan.\n  We cannot spend our way into prosperity. We have seen governments try \nthis and fail. It may make some of us feel good to write check after \ncheck from the government, that is simply the wrong approach.\n  Governments don't create jobs and wealth. Free individuals with an \nidea and a source of capital create jobs and wealth.\n  We can grow ourselves into prosperity. We have done it before. The \nfundamental question is: Who knows better what is good for Americans--\nthe Federal Government or the American people?\n  The strength of the American economy is not from the government and \nmore Federal programs. It is the American people--the workers, \nentrepreneurs, investors, and risk takers--who keep the American dream \nalive.\n  It is better to allow Americans to keep more of their money to make \nspending, savings and investment decisions. We cannot decide here what \njob skills different people need, or what new equipment companies \nshould purchase, or how to organize a small business' growth plan.\n  The Federal Government cannot make these investments for them. Big \nbrother does not know best. We in Congress do not know what investments \nwill best suit the particular interests of American families, \nentrepreneurs and business owners.\n  But what we can do is allow Americans to have access to more of the \nmoney they work for and earn. And then we have to trust them to make \nthe necessary decisions within the economy to invest and create more \njobs.\n  But to do this, we need to pass this budget resolution with its jobs \nand economic growth package in tact. And therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution as it was passed by the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Finally, I want to say a few words about the Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit provision in the resolution.\n  We all agree that Medicare is an important program. It provides \nhealth coverage to 41 million Americans, including almost 630,000 \nKentuckians.\n  When Medicare was created back in 1966, it ensured that seniors would \nbe able to receive health care coverage. However, medicine has advanced \nso rapidly and prescription drugs play a major role in the health care \nof many. For years, Congress has debated various proposals for adding a \ndrug benefit to Medicare. So far, we haven't gotten\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\nthe job done. I am hopeful this year will be different for several \nreasons.\n\n  First, our seniors need our help now more than ever. They shouldn't \nhave to make tough decisions about which prescriptions they can afford \nto fill each month, or whether or not they should divide pills or skip \nmeals.\n  This is one of the biggest issues we hear about from our \nconstituents. There are a lot of Kentuckians who would benefit. Almost \n144,000 seniors in Kentucky are below 200 percent of poverty, and \nalmost 58,000 are below the poverty level.\n  Second, this budget resolution sets aside $400 billion over the next \n10 years to create a medicare drug program. This is a great increase \nover what the President proposed before and shows his dedication to \nthis issue.\n  In fact, the President proposed $153 billion for Medicare \nprescription drugs in his fiscal year 2002 budget.\n  For fiscal year 2003, this number increased to $190 billion.\n  And for fiscal year 2004, President Bush has more than doubled last \nyear's amount to $400 billion.\n  For Congress's part, this $400 billion figure is also a substantial \nincrease.\n  In the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution, we set aside $40 billion \nover five years for a Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  In the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution, Congress allocated $300 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  Of course, last year, we didn't pass a budget. And, this year, we \nhave set aside $400 billion over 10 years.\n  Third, the finance committee will be allowed to consider and report a \nbill to the floor this year. And I am hopeful we can avoid many of the \nproblems we encountered last year.\n  Last year we voted on four prescription drug proposals. But because \nthe bill didn't come from the finance committee as it should have, all \nthese proposals required 60 votes to pass. Needless to say, none came \nclose.\n  Also, these four proposals ranged widely in price from as low as $295 \nbillion to over $600 billion. The tri-partisan plan, which I and many \nof my colleagues voted for, was estimated to cost $370 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  We have a real chance for a bipartisan effort this year. An \noverwhelming majority in this body have indicated their support for a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution. It will create jobs \nif we can pass it with the President's job and tax package in tact. And \nthe Medicare prescription drug benefit package it includes is what \nseniors not only need, but what they deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague from North Dakota.\n  We have now completed the debate and discussion time for \nconsideration of the budget resolution. The statute calls for 50 hours. \nWe have yielded back a few hours, but for the most part we have \nprobably spent some 40-odd hours on the floor of the Senate debating \nand discussing various amendments. It has been a very high level \ndebate. We considered several amendments. We have adopted amendments. \nWe have agreed to adopt additional amendments.\n  Unfortunately, as sometimes happens in budget resolutions, when we \nconclude the scheduled time for debate, the 50 hours, we have not dealt \nwith all the pending amendments. We still have many amendments. \nSometimes that leads to a lot of votes. So tomorrow we will begin that. \nWe will begin it at 9:45.\n  I urge all my colleagues to be here and, for the most part, to stay \non the floor. We will work with all of our colleagues who have \namendments filed or pending or feel that they are compelled to offer \namendments. We encourage them not to. But knowing a little history, I \nwould expect a lot of rollcall votes tomorrow. I will say on behalf of \ncolleagues on my side and others, we will be happy to work with \ncolleagues. I would hope that maybe we could get some amendments \naccepted by voice vote, or maybe the sponsors of the amendment might \ndecide it might be a better time to offer their amendment at another \ndate for which we would give them great credit and applause. \nRegardless, I expect that we would have a lot of votes beginning at \n9:45 tomorrow morning.\n  I expect the time for the votes will be limited to 10 minutes for the \ninformation of our colleagues. We will provide periodic breaks for \nindividuals so they can have maybe some chance for us to regroup and \nreconsider the order and priority of amendments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 9:45 the Senate proceed \nto votes in relation to the following amendments in the order \nmentioned: Schumer amendment No. 299; Cochran on homeland security; \nFeingold on war reserve; Lautenberg on defense; Hollings on no tax cut; \nSarbanes on a water related amendment; Crapo on a water related \namendment; Conrad on IDEA, Gregg on IDEA; and Senator Mikulski on long-\nterm care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague, Senator Conrad. He has been a \npleasure to work with through the first several days of this \nresolution. I expect that we might have a long day tomorrow. I hope \nnot. But we will be in as long as necessary to complete this \nresolution, and I encourage all of our colleagues, tomorrow is a good \nday to attend if you want to improve your voting record. It is not a \ngood day to miss if you want to have a good voting record for the year.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague, the chairman of \nthe committee. He has been gracious throughout this process and a \ngentleman. I have very much enjoyed working with him.\n  The fact is, now we have over 90 amendments pending at the desk--I \nthink 93. At 10 minutes apiece, that is over 15 hours of voting, and \nthat is if we voted every 10 minutes. We all know that won't occur. So \nwe would be talking about a very long day tomorrow.\n\n  I will just send a message out to any of our colleagues or any of \ntheir staffs who are listening, to those who have amendments pending: \nIf this is something that you think is a good idea but you really don't \nneed to do now, that you could offer on an appropriations bill or some \nother vehicle, we encourage you to do that.\n  This is a very difficult process. I think the record is 34 votes in a \nday. I remember that day. I think the chairman remembers that day. It \nwas not pretty. I don't look forward to a replication. But that is what \nthe rules are. That is where we are. The only way it is going to be \nbetter is if we use restraint. I just hope colleagues and staffs are \nlistening and that tomorrow restraint is demonstrated. We don't need to \nvote on every one of these 93 amendments.\n  The chairman and I will work diligently to try to clear amendments, \nto get agreement on amendments, to work through amendments that could \nbe accepted. We ask our colleagues, we implore them to work with us \ntomorrow, to avoid this being an unpleasant and unproductive \nexperience.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and our colleagues who have worked \ncooperatively today to make progress.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \nranking member of the Budget Committee. He is exactly right. There are \n90-some amendments. I would hope most of them would not be called up, \nand I hope the balance will be voice voted, and maybe we will have a \ncouple rollcall votes and finish at decent hour.\n  I would like the Senate to conduct itself in a way that we would be \nproud. In years past that has not always been the case, when we are \ndoing these rapid fire amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4152-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about my cosponsorship, \nwith\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n\nSenator Lieberman, of the bipartisan Biological, Chemical, and \nRadiological Weapons Countermeasures Research Act of 2003. Senator \nLieberman and I also offered similar legislation, S. 3148, in the 107th \nCongress.\n  I think that when our colleagues, the administration, academic \nbiomedical researchers, patient advocacy organizations, and the general \npublic study the ambitious set of incentives contained in the \nLieberman-Hatch bill, they will conclude that this measure can \nmaterially improve our national security. If adopted, this legislation \nwill allow the families of Utah and in our sister states across America \nto live with a greater measure of safety.\n  Although this is a complex piece of legislation, its goal is simple. \nThe Lieberman-Hatch bill will establish a unique public-private sector \nrelationship that will result in stimulating the private sector to \nincrease its scope and pace of research and development activities for \na wide range of medical products intended to deter and respond to acts \nof biological, chemical, or radiological terrorism.\n  Senator Lieberman and I believe that the best way to discourage and \nprevent acts of bioterrorism is to be able to demonstrate our capacity \nto develop, produce, and distribute biological, chemical, and \nradiological weapons countermeasures.\n  In short, if our medicine chest is full and we show the world that we \nhave the ability to rapidly discover new countermeasures, we will \ndecrease the likelihood of ever having to deploy these countermeasures \nin the first place. For example, in the last 18 months we have made \ngreat strides in ramping up production of, and our capacity to \ndistribute, smallpox vaccine. In fact, few, in any, countries could \nrespond more effectively than the United States to the introduction of \nsmallpox. Our enemies in Baghdad and those hiding in mountains of \nAfghanistan might do more harm to themselves and their neighbors if a \nworldwide smallpox outbreak occurs.\n  Unfortunately, there are dozens, and perhaps many more, biological \nand chemical threats for which we have no adequate response. As well, \nthis latest outbreak of antibiotic- and antiviral-resistant pneumonia \npoints out the need to develop responses to new public health threats \nwhether they are spread intentionally or naturally. This bill tries to \ncreate a new paradigm for the development of vital bioterrorism \ncountermeasures that could also serve as a model for stimulating \nprivate sector drug discovery activities in other important areas such \nas cancer, heart disease, and infectious and rare diseases.\n  Senator Lieberman and I praise the work that has already been done to \nhelp our nation meet this new type of threat. Senators Byrd, Stevens, \nSpecter, and Harkin made available a substantial amount of new \nresources immediately in the aftermath of the September 11th and the \nOctober, 2001 anthrax attacks.\n  Last year, Senators Gregg, Kennedy, and Frist led the effort to pass \nimportant bioterrorism legislation to improve the public health \ninfrastructure so that our country can better respond to public health \nemergencies.\n  The Bush administration is currently working closely with Congress on \nthe Project BioShield program. We salute these efforts. We are pleased \nthat the Administration is now embracing the concept of a guaranteed \nmarket that was part of last year's Lieberman-Hatch bill, S. 3148. We \nurge the Administration and Congress to adopt other critical features \nof Lieberman-Hatch.\n  The Lieberman-Hatch bill is a bold attempt to move the ball closer to \nthe goal line. Our bill attempts to complement all the previous efforts \nto build up the capacity for public sector responses with a set of \nincentives designed to unleash the creative genius and substantial \nresources of the private sector actors within our Nation's biomedical \nresearch enterprise.\n  Let me quickly summarize the major features of the bill.\n  The Department of Homeland Security sets the countermeasures research \nagenda so that firms know beforehand the research targets. Interested \ncompanies register with DHS and become obligated to report their \nactivities and subject their plants to inspection.\n  The legislation allows a participating company seeking to fund \neligible research to elect from among four types of tax incentives. \nFirst, we provide for the establishment of R limited partnerships. \nSecond, we create the authority for qualified firms to issue a new \nclass of stock that would be subject to no capital gains tax. Third, we \ncreate a new tax credit to help fund the research. Fourth, we allow for \na special tax credit for research conducted at non-profit and academic \nresearch institutions.\n  Anyone familiar with the current dismal financial state of affairs \nwithin the biotechnology industry will understand the attraction of \nthese tax provisions. Many struggling firms might find it prudent to \nexplore the benefits of adjusting their research portfolios to include \ncountermeasure research and development.\n  The legislation authorizes funding for a program whereby companies \nsuccessfully developing countermeasures that secure FDA approval can be \nguaranteed a market at a pre-negotiated price and pre-negotiated \nquantities.\n  Our legislation also contains some fundamental revisions in \npharmaceutical intellectual property laws. As author of the Drug Price \nCompetition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, I hold these \nprovisions near and dear.\n  Essentially, the bill adopts a policy of day-for-day patent term \nrestoration for each day lost during FDA review. Under the current \nprovisions of the 1984 Hatch-Waxman law, no patent may be restored by \nmore than five years and then only if the effective patent term does \nnot exceed 14 years regardless of whether the FDA review takes longer \nthan five years.\n  The legislation also grants a ten year period of marketing \nexclusivity for any approved countermeasure, regardless of a product's \npatent status. This means that FDA could not approve a competitor \nproduct until that period expires. This provision operates in parallel \nwith patent protections and serves as a floor time period during which \ngeneric versions of the pioneer countermeasure product could enter the \nmarket. Current U.S. law only provides for a five year marketing \nexclusivity period while most European Union countries and Japan \nalready provide a ten year marketing exclusivity period.\n  The Lieberman-Hatch bill also allows certain types of biotechnology \ncompanies, specifically those with less than $750 million in paid-in \ncapital, to extend any patent by two years if the firms successfully \ndevelop a countermeasure.\n  I can tell you that these substantial changes in the area of \nintellectual property will get a positive reaction in corporate \nboardrooms; resources will flow in the direction of products eligible \nfor these new intellectual property protections and products will be \ndeveloped to help our country respond to bioterrorist threats.\n  In addition to the guaranteed market provisions, targeted tax breaks, \nand intellectual property incentives, the Lieberman-Hatch legislation \nalso contains liability provisions; accelerated FDA approval \nprocedures, and a limited antitrust exemption.\n  In summary, the Lieberman-Hatch bill contains an array of incentives \ndesigned to spur a robust response from the private pharmaceutical \nsector. If we are going to increase our ability to defend the American \nhomeland, we need to be certain that both the public and private \nsectors' are fully engaged. That is exactly what our bill will help \naccomplish by unleashing the energy and resources of those private \nsector firms engaged in biomedical research and development.\n  I urge all of my colleagues and others with an interest in homeland \nsecurity to study the bipartisan Lieberman-Hatch Biological, Chemical, \nand Radiological Weapons Countermeasures Research Act of 2003. I \nbelieve that when our legislation is examined, it will attract broad \nand strong bipartisan support.\n  Let me close by commending my friend from Connecticut, Senator Joe \nLieberman, for his vision, energy, and leadership in this critically \nimportant area. I would also like to commend the efforts of our \nbipartisan group of partners in the House, Congressmen Tom Davis, Cal \nDooley, Curt Weldon, and Norm Dicks.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4154-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4154-S4155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n                          HONORING FRAN AGNES\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, at this hour, the men and women of our \nArmed Forces face great dangers in the Middle East. We are thinking of \nthem and praying for them in the challenges they encounter. As a \nnation, we have faced many conflicts before, and we have relied upon \nthe bravery, skill, and honor of our military personnel.\n  Today I am honored to share with my colleagues and with the American \npeople the example of a remarkable man named Fran Agnes, who served his \ncountry and his fellow veterans and their families for many decades.\n  I know his name is familiar to many of my colleagues and to anyone \nwho has worked on veterans issues. I am sad to report that Fran Agnes \npassed away on February 9 of this year. He was surrounded by his loving \nfamily.\n  I suspect that if Fran were here today at the start of this new war, \nhe would say, ``Make sure we are prepared to take care of the soldiers, \nsailors, and airmen we send over there. They need to know, and their \nfamilies need to know, that we will be there for them.''\n  Today, I want to pay tribute to Fran Agnes and discuss a bill that \nbears his name. I am especially honored that Fran's family members and \nfriends are here in Washington, DC, today.\n  I don't recall exactly when or where I met Fran, but it is a sure bet \nthat he walked up to me, shook my hand, smiled, and said: ``You don't \nknow me, but I'm Fran Agnes and I want to help you help veterans.''\n  Boy, he wasn't kidding. As I look at the things Fran worked on over \nthe years, that is exactly what he did.\n  For example, 7 or 8 years ago Fran started talking to me about the \nimportance of making honor guards available at the funerals of \nveterans. We talked about the nearly 30,000 World War II veterans who \npass away every month--who take with them an important part of our \nhistory. Fran was upset that we as a nation were allowing veterans to \nbe laid to rest without the appropriate honors.\n  We discovered that the military was relying more and more on \nvolunteers to perform funeral honors. And more often than not, the \nvolunteers themselves were older veterans who struggled to meet the \ndemand. We found case after case of families all across the country who \ncouldn't find an honor guard to present a flag with the words ``On \nbehalf of a grateful nation'' at the funeral service of a veteran. We \neven had a case at Arlington National Cemetery where a local family \ncould not secure an honor guard for a veteran.\n  Fran asked me to get involved in the issue. We worked together to \ncome up with legislation to require the Department of Defense to \nprovide honor guards for veterans' funerals. We worked with the \nAmerican Ex-Prisoners of War. Fran was an enthusiastic member of the \norganization and served as its national commander. We built a coalition \nof veterans service organizations in support of the legislation. \nSenator Paul Sarbanes, Senator Frank Murkowski, and Congressman Lane \nEvans joined the effort and provided important leadership.\n  The Department of Defense opposed our legislation. With Fran's \nencouragement, we set out to address the DoD's concerns. Ultimately, we \noffered an amendment to the Defense authorization bill, and it was \nagreed to unanimously. Similar legislation passed the House of \nRepresentatives. Together, we succeeded in changing the law and \nensuring the Department of Defense would provide honor guards when \nrequested by a veteran's family. Fran Agnes raised this issue and \ntouched a nerve all across our country. And he helped change the law \nfor veterans. That is just one example of Fran's service.\n  Fran was also the visionary leader behind the campaign to create the \nTakoma National Cemetery for Washington's veterans. He was its greatest \nchampion, and I worked closely with him to authorize and build it. Fran \nloved Takoma. Washington State veterans are proud that when Fran was \ntaken from us last month, the Takoma National Cemetery was there to \nwelcome him home with full military honors.\n  Fran Agnes lived a life of service to his family, to his fellow \nveterans and to his community. He coached Little League baseball for 20 \nyears. He was responsible for building ballfields for young \nWashingtonians in both the Spokane and Everett areas. He was involved \nin both the Elks and the Eagles.\n  I was fortunate to know and work with Fran Agnes. I was blessed by \nhis support and friendship. Washington State is a stronger community \nbecause of Fran Agnes, and veterans in my State had no greater friend \nor advocate than Fran.\n  As I mentioned, Fran passed away on February 9, 2003, with his loved \nones at his side. At his service a few days later, his family was \njoined by the veterans community, the State of Washington, and a truly \ngrateful nation to pay tribute to Fran as he was laid to rest in his \nbeloved Takoma National Cemetery.\n  Secretary of Veterans Affairs Tony Principi sent a moving letter to \nFran's wife Marlene Agnes. The letter from Secretary Principi states, \n``Fran's service to America is legend in the veterans' community. He \nand all the men and women of his generation will long be remembered for \ntheir monumental struggle and decisive victory. However, Fran's service \nand sacrifice at Bataan, and later as a prisoner of war, were as great \nas any American has ever been asked to endure.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full letter appear in the \nCongressional Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Several years ago, my father passed away. He, too, was a World War II \nveteran. It wasn't until after my father's death that we discovered his \nletters and writings from the war. My father was like most veterans of \nhis generation who did not talk about their experiences. Fran was like \nthat, too. I saw Fran many times over the years. He came to Washington \nwith the American Ex-Prisoners of War. I saw him at veterans events all \nover my State. If I attended a veterans event, you can bet Fran would \nbe there--proudly wearing the maroon coat of the American Ex-Prisoners \nof War.\n  In all the time Fran and I spent together, he never asked me to do \nanything for himself. It was always things for other veterans and their \nfamilies. He asked me to help the widows of our veterans. He asked me \nto support the POWs' lawsuit against the Japanese companies that \nprofited from slave labor during World War II. He would ask about \nhelping another veteran who might be having a problem with the VA.\n  Fran Agnes did not boast of his service. He didn't complain to me \nabout injuries or problems from his time as a prisoner of war. Fran \nwould call my office just to check in. He usually didn't have a \nrequest. He would just call and say, ``I know you're working for us. \nKeep it up.''\n\n  Because Fran, like so many veterans, did not boast of his own \naccomplishments, I want to share them with the Senate today. I cannot \nlet this moment pass without sharing some of the things about Fran that \nhe didn't talk about.\n  Fran Agnes was born in 1922 in North Dakota. His father was an Irish \nimmigrant who moved the family to Wenatchee, WA, for a WPA job during \nthe Great Depression.\n  Fran graduated from high school and enlisted to join the war effort. \nIn 1941, he was stationed with the 20th Pursuit Squadron in the \nPhilippines. He was captured early in 1942.\n  Fran Agnes endured the Bataan Death March--a 100-mile forced march \nconducted without food or water. During the march, men would drop out \nof column due to fatigue, dehydration, illness, and injury. This \n``disobedience'' would cause the Japanese guards to rush up, shouting \ncommands in Japanese to get back in the group. When that approach \nfailed, shots would ring out, killing those who would not or could not \nrise.\n  Many of those failing to obey the order to march were killed \ninstantly by sword-wielding Japanese soldiers who were guarding the men \non the march. Seventy thousand Americans were forced on the Bataan \nDeath March. Only 54,000 made it to the Japanese prisoner-of-war camps \nthat awaited the survivors. Fran turned 20 years old on the Bataan \nDeath March. He survived and was detained at Camp O'Donnell, which was \nused as a holding station.\n  Most prisoners stayed there for about 50 days. Eventually, it would \nhouse 50,000 men. Conditions there were grossly underequipped for the \nvolume of men passing through its gates. For\n\n[[Page S4155]]\n\nexample, there were only two water spigots available for all the \nprisoners. The men were fed tiny portions once a day.\n  Fran spent 6 months at Camp O'Donnell before being moved to Camp \nCabanatuan. Fran spent an additional year at that camp. He worked \nmostly in the hospital--helping other POWs survive their imprisonment.\n  Finally, Fran was transferred to Japan where he was kept at the Hiro \nHata POW camp and forced to work slave labor. He was held 30 miles from \nHiroshima. He would later describe the atomic bomb that signaled the \nend of World War II and the end of his 3\\1/2\\ years of captivity.\n  On September 2, 1945, the men at the Hiro Hata prison camp conducted \na liberation ceremony. The men gathered together and sang ``The Star \nSpangled Banner.'' Fran Agnes returned home to the United States \nweighing approximately 100 pounds.\n  Most of us can only imagine the horror that men like Fran Agnes \nendured as prisoners of war at the hands of the Japanese. After a short \nstint back at home in Wenatchee, Fran re-enlisted with the Army Air \nCorps before it became the Air Force. He served in the Air Force for \ntwo decades and retired at the rank of Captain. Fran worked for \nWashington State for 25 years.\n  Fran had a big family as well. In addition to his wife Marlene, he \nhad three daughters: Rose, Sonya, and Kathleen. I spent a few minutes \nwith Fran's daughters yesterday, and in each of them, I was reminded of \ntheir father. Fran also had two sons, David and Gregory, as well as 13 \ngrandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren.\n  Fran was involved in numerous veterans service organizations, \nparticularly the American Ex-Prisoners of War, which is holding its \nwinter meeting here in Washington, DC, this week. Fran served as \nnational commander of the American Ex-POWs in 1990 and 1991. He was \nalso chairman of the Governor's Advisory Action Committee in Washington \nState. Fran was chairman of the Tahoma National Cemetery Group in \nWashington.\n  I think it is appropriate that we memorialize Fran's many sacrifices \nand his great service to our Nation. Today, I have asked my staff to \nwork with the Tahoma National Cemetery, with the Agnes family, and with \nthe Washington veterans community to discuss naming an appropriate \nplace at Tahoma after Fran Agnes.\n  In addition, I call upon my Senate colleagues to join me in support \nof the Francis W. Agnes Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2003. This \nlegislation clarifies who is eligible for POW benefits through the VA \nand ensures our POWs can receive care for a number of ailments related \nto their captivity. The legislation is important to all POWs, and a \nsimilar measure has been introduced in the House of Representatives.\n  Fran wouldn't ask us to single out his fellow Pacific theatre POWs \nfor health care, but I know he would take special pride in the passage \nof this legislation because it is so important to our prisoners of war \nwho survived such harsh treatment at the hands of the Japanese in World \nWar II. I encourage all of my colleagues in the Senate to support the \nFrancis W. Agnes Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2003.\n  Fran Agnes was a great American. I was blessed to know him and work \nwith him. Veterans everywhere were blessed to have him as a fellow \nsoldier and airman. With his passing, it is time we acknowledge his \nservice and commit his memory to our history as an example to us all.\n  Even though I can't call upon him for his guidance and support, Fran \nwill always be there for me. After all the time we spent together--and \nall the efforts we worked on together--I feel that I know what he would \nwant me to do. And I pledge to continue to work very closely with \nveterans from my State and with his family to build on his legacy.\n  I hope this tribute captures for the Senate the many contributions of \na true patriot. Mr. President, Fran Agnes called himself a survivor. \nWe--those who knew him and his life of service to others--call him an \ninspiration.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  The Secretary of\n\n\n                                             Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2003.\n     Mrs. Marlene Agnes,\n     Everett, Washington.\n       Dear Mrs. Agnes: On behalf of America's 25 million \n     veterans, please accept my sincerest condolences on the death \n     of your husband, Fran. Although I am aware that mere words \n     cannot ease your sorrow, or that of your children and \n     grandchildren, be certain that my thoughts and prayers are \n     with you.\n       Fran's service to America is legend in the veterans' \n     community. He and all the men and women of his generation who \n     answered America's call during World War II, will be long \n     remembered for their monumental struggle and decisive \n     victory. However, Fran's service and sacrifice at Bataan, and \n     later as a prisoner of war, were as great as any American has \n     ever been asked to endure.\n       Fran was an American patriot who served his country twice-\n     over. Once in a uniform of its military services, and once-\n     again as a pillar of the Nation's veterans constituency. As \n     National Commander of America's Ex Prisoners of War, Fran's \n     leadership bore the same indelible hallmarks that \n     distinguished his wartime service . . . exemplary ability, \n     great honor, unfailing courage, and true compassion. His \n     contributions at once strengthened our Republic and enriched \n     the lives of its citizen-soldiers who, like him, had borne \n     the burden of captivity.\n       Quite simply, Fran was an ordinary American who served in \n     extraordinary ways. He represented the best of what it means \n     to be an American, and our Nation is lessened by his passing.\n       Mrs. Agnes, we who were privileged to know Fran, mourn with \n     you and your family.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Anthony J.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 24, \n2000 in Allentown, PA. A 24-year-old man, Michael Gambler, shot a 15-\nyear-old at a party after the teen touched him on the arm. According to \nwitnesses, partygoers suggested the teen was gay and teased the victim \nand Gambler prior to the shooting. After the teen touched his arm, \nGambler retrieved a shotgun and shot the victim in the forehead.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4155-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4155-S4156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ASSASSINATION OF SERBIAN PRIME MINISTER ZORAN DJINDJIC\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor a man of courage, \nconviction and integrity who was recently taken from his people and \nthis world in the most brutal and shocking of circumstances.\n  On Wednesday, March 12, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic was \nslain in Belgrade, assassinated, gunned down, leaving his Belgrade \noffice. He was, tragically, only 50 years old, and was taken from us \nlong before his time. To his wife Rizica and his two young children, \nJovana and Luka, I extend my deepest condolences.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Prime Minister Djindjic in 2001, during \na visit to Belgrade. He was best known to Americans and the \ninternational community for his central role in the downfall of former \nYugoslav dictator, Slobodan Milosevic, in October 2000. It was Djindjic \nwho, in 2001, took the principled decision to render Milosevic to the \nWar Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, where he is at this moment facing \ntrial for genocide and crimes against humanity.\n  It was this courage, this stand for integrity, that won Prime \nMinister Djindjic not only the respect of the internation community, \nbut the love and admiration of the people of Serbia, whom he helped to \nfree from the grips of dictatorship, oppression, and cruelty.\n  Prime Minister Djindjic was someone who fought for the needs of his \npeople. He devoted his life to the fight for progress, reform, and \ndemocracy, and a better life for the people of Serbia. Ultimately, he \ngave his life for that fight.\n\n[[Page S4156]]\n\n  He was imprisoned for his activities as a student dissident against \nthe repressive Communist Yugoslav regime in the 1970s, but this did not \ndiminish his zeal. In 1989, Djindjic, along with a group of dissident \nwriters and intellectuals, founded the Serbian Democratic Party. One \nyear later, he was elected its chairman, and in 1994, its president. In \nthe 1990s, as a member and a leader of Serbia's Parliament, he remained \nat the forefront of the dissident movement, resisting the oppression of \na new generation of post-Communist dictators, this time bent on ethnic \ncleansing and genocide.\n  As his courage grew, so did the people's respect for him. In 1996, \nthe people of Belgrade freely elected him the first non-Communist mayor \nsine World War II. It was in that position that he built the popular \nbase and credibility that served him so well in the historical role he \nwas about to play, in the downfall of Slobodan Milosevic. Djindjic was \none of the chief strategists behind the September 24, 2002, Yugoslav \nPresidential elections and the October 5, 2000, uprising that resulted \nin Milosevic's overthrow. In December 2000, he led the Democratic \nOpposition of Serbia--a coalition of 18 parties spanning a broad range \nof the political spectrum--into Serbia's parliamentary elections, and \nwon an impressive 65 percent of the popular vote. The DOS elected \nDjindjic to be Prime Minister of Serbia on January 25, 2001.\n\n  That popularity speaks well of Zoran Djindjic, but it speaks volumes \nabout the people of Serbia. After years--decades--of Communist and \nfascist dictatorship, the spirit of the Serbian people arose valiant, \ntriumphant because the desire for freedom cannot be crushed. Prime \nMinister Djindjic was, in a large sense, the embodiment of their \ndetermination, their yearning to be free. Each time this man spoke of \nfreedom and liberty, of reform and democracy, the people of Serbia \nsupported him, sustained him, elevated him to lead them, and followed \nthem into the brighter future that he hoped fervently to help them \nbuild.\n  It appears that it was, ultimately, his pledge and his actions to \nstamp out corruption and widespread organized crime that brought him \ninto the assassin's sights.\n  In February, a truck swerved from its lane, headed directly for the \nmotorcade carrying the Prime Minister, and narrowly missed. Prime \nMinister Djindjic very well could have been killed. Djindjic himself \nsuggested that the incident might be the handiwork of members of \norganized crime rings, which flourished under Miloservic and remain \nlinked to him to this day.\n  Just as he did not permit prison to diminish his energy, Prime \nMinister Djindjic did not let this danger impede him or dim his spirit. \nHe pressed on, valiantly, in his campaign against the crime and \ncorruption that corrodes his society.\n  The news of the Prime Minister's death has been a tremendous shock, \nnot only to the people of Serbia, but to the entire region. President \nStjepan Mesic of Croatia has rightly described the assassination as \n``an act of madness,'' and raised concerns that this assassination will \n``slow down [Serbia's] progress towards democracy.''\n  I certainly understand the Croatian President's concern. It would be \na dishonor to the memory of Prime Minister Djindjic were his fears to \nbe realized. After centuries of conflict and decades of oppression and \ncrippling violence, Serbia and the entire Balkan region have made \nremarkable strides toward peace, democracy, economic development, and a \nbetter life for the people of all nations in the region. The United \nStates has played a crucial role in furthering that progress. For the \npast 10 years, in Bosnia Hercegovina, in Kosovo, the United States has \nfought--diplomatically and militarily--to stop the forces of oppression \nand genocide, and to support the forces of liberty and democracy.\n  There can be no greater way to remember this man than to ensure that \nhis death will not be in vain, that his life's work will continue. And \nso, I urge all of us who are friends and supporters of democracy, and \nthose who fight for it, to redouble our commitment to and solidarity \nwith those who stand, as Prime Minister Djindjic did, for a better, \nfreer, more democratic future for the people of Serbia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4156-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4156-S4157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE CHILD SUPPORT DISTRIBUTION ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to state my strong support for \nthe Child Support Distribution Act of 2003, which Senator Snowe and I \nintroduced yesterday. I want to thank Senator Snowe for continuing to \nwork with me over the years on this important issue.\n  This bill takes significant steps toward ensuring that children \nreceive the child support money they are owed and deserve. In fiscal \nyear 2001, the public child support system collected child support \npayments for only 44 percent of its total caseload, up from 19 percent \nin 1995. Obviously, we still need to improve, but States are making \nreal progress. It is time for Congress to take the next step and help \nStates overcome a major obstacle to collecting child support for \nfamilies.\n  There are many reasons why noncustodial parents may not be paying \nsupport for their children. Some are not able to pay because they don't \nhave jobs or have fallen on hard times. Others may not pay because they \nare unfairly prevented from spending time with their children.\n  But other fathers don't pay because the public system actually \ndiscourages them from paying. Under current law, $2.2 billion in child \nsupport is retained every year by the State and Federal Governments as \nrepayment for welfare benefits--rather than delivered to the children \nto whom it is owed. Fifty-six percent of that amount is for families \nwho have left welfare. Since the money doesn't benefit their kids, \nfathers are discouraged from paying support. And mothers have no \nincentive to push for payment since the support doesn't go to them.\n  The current rules withhold a key source of income for low-income \nfamilies that could help them maintain self-sufficiency. For low-income \nworking families receiving child support, that support is the second-\nlargest source of income for those families, after wages, according to \nthe Urban Institute, a nonpartisan organization that studies social and \ngovernance issues. Families who receive child support can often avoid \ngoing on welfare. When low-income working families get child support, \nbut not welfare, child support makes up 35 percent of their income.\n  It is time for Congress to change this system and encourage States to \ndistribute more child support to families. My home State of Wisconsin \nhas already been doing this for several years and is seeing great \nresults. In 1997, I worked with my State to institute an innovative \nprogram of passing through child support payments directly to families. \nAn evaluation of the Wisconsin program clearly shows that when child \nsupport payments are delivered to families, noncustodial parents are \nmore apt to pay, and to pay more. In addition, Wisconsin has found \nthat, overall, this policy does not increase government costs. That \nmakes sense because ``passing through'' support payments to families \nmeans they have more of their own resources, and are less apt to depend \non public help to meet other needs such as food, transportation or \nchild care.\n  We now have a key opportunity to encourage all States to follow \nWisconsin's example. This legislation gives States options and strong \nincentives to send more child support directly to families who are \nworking their way off--or are already off--public assistance. Not only \nwill this create the right incentives for noncustodial parents to pay, \nbut it will also simplify the job for States, who currently face an \nadministrative nightmare in following the complicated rules of the \ncurrent system.\n  We know that creating the right incentives for noncustodial parents \nto pay support and increasing collections has long-term benefits. \nPeople who can count on child support are more likely to stay in jobs \nand stay off public assistance.\n  This legislation finally brings the Child Support Enforcement program \ninto the post-welfare reform era, shifting its focus from recovering \nwelfare costs to increasing child support to families so they can \nsustain work and maintain self-sufficiency. After all, it is only fair \nthat if we are asking parents to move off welfare, stay off welfare, \nand take financial responsibility for their families, then we in \nCongress\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\nmust make sure that child support payments actually go to the families \nto whom they are owed and who are working so hard to succeed.\n  I am pleased that there has been widespread bipartisan support for \nthis legislation. In 2000, a House version of this bill passed by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote of 405 to 18. Our legislation was also \nincluded in last year's TANF reauthorization bill that passed out of \nthe Senate Finance Committee with bipartisan support.\n  In addition, I am pleased that the administration and the House of \nRepresentatives both included child support provisions in their TANF \nreauthorization legislation. However, while those provisions are an \nimportant first step in the process, I am concerned that both the House \nbill and the administration's proposal fall short in reforming child \nsupport. Their approach would not benefit all States equally, has more \nlimited benefits for families who are currently on TANF, and imposes \nfees on some low-income families. I hope as the TANF reauthorization \nprocess continues, we can all work together to address these concerns \nand ensure that all children receive the support they are owed and \ndeserve.\n  We must keep this bipartisan momentum going in this Congress. It is \ntime that we finally make child support meaningful for families, and \nmake sure that children get they support they need and deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4157-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PIONEER NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAILS STUDIES ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pioneer \nNational Historic Trails Studies Act. This bill would require the \nNational Park Service to study the Pony Express, the Oregon, the \nCalifornia, and the Mormon National Historic Trails and make \nrecommendations to Congress on possible additions to these trails that \nwere used by the early pioneers of the West.\n  For various reasons, early settlers often used routes to arrive in \nthe West which were variations of the main routes now recognized as \nNational Historic Trails. These routes were used by large numbers of \nwestward pioneers. Since the enactment of the National Trails System \nAct in 1968, support has been building to broaden the law to include \nalternate routes that branch off the main trails. The Pioneer National \nHistoric Trails Studies Act allows for the feasibility study and \ndesignation of side trails and variant routes taken by pioneers \notherwise associated with the main trails.\n  These trails are the highways of our history. They are central to the \ngreat story of the West. But unfortunately, because of the confining \n``point to point'' wording now found in the Trails Act, many crucial \nparts of the story are not being told. Not every pioneer embarked on \nhis journey from Omaha or Independence, and not every great or tragic \nevent took place along the main routes. To the contrary, tens of \nthousands of settlers set out from other places, and many of the \nmemorable, if not most important, events occurred along historical side \nroads and alternate routes that were chosen because of inclement \nweather, lack of water, and conflicts with Native American tribes, \namong other reasons.\n  Since the original passage of the National Trails System Act, the \nPark Service has conducted endless hours of research, and now has a \nmore accurate picture of the story of our Western pioneers. There has \nbeen a great deal of support shown by State and local communities which \nwant to broaden the act to include this new knowledge. However, the \nPark Service has determined that legislation is required to do this. \nThe Pioneer National Historic Trails Studies Act will enable the Park \nService to identify those routes most worthy of being included in our \ntrails system. This legislation will highlight our Western history, and \nit will do so without any infringement of the rights of private \nproperty owners.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address this \nimportant issue today, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4157-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4157-S4159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TEACHING OF AMERICAN HISTORY AND CIVICS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof a speech I gave before the Heritage Foundation on March 14 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Remarks of Senator Lamar Alexander\n\n\n   putting the teaching of american history and civics back into our \n                               classrooms\n\n                   out of many, one: e pluribus unum\n\n       I am glad to have this privilege to come to Heritage today \n     to talk about the two subjects I care about the most: the \n     education of our children and the principles that unite us as \n     Americans. I salute Heritage for providing public forums on \n     issues that are important to our nation.\n       At a time when we are asking young Americans to give their \n     lives to defend our values, we are doing a poor job of \n     teaching just what those values are.\n       That is why, last week, in my maiden address--we still call \n     it that in the United States Senate--I proposed ways to put \n     the teaching of American history and civics back in our \n     schools so our children can grow up learning what it means to \n     be an American.\n       The Senate will hold hearings on April 10 on my proposal. \n     The proposal is to create Presidential Academies for Teachers \n     of American History and Civics and Congressional Academies \n     for students of American history and Civics--residential \n     summer academies at which teachers can learn better how to \n     teach, and outstanding students can learn more about the key \n     events, persons and ideas that shaped the institutions and \n     democratic heritage of the United States of America.\n       Today I want to discuss, first, why America is \n     exceptional--not always better than other countries, but in \n     important ways different; second, how the teaching and \n     learning of American history and civics has declined and why; \n     and, finally, why the three Latin words that were the first \n     motto of our nation, E Pluribus Unum, are still in the right \n     order--Out of Many, One--even though some are trying mightily \n     to turn them around to say that we are ``Many, out of One.'' \n     In other words, in the United States of America, I believe \n     unity still trumps diversity.\n\n\n                       you can't become japanese\n\n       Now to do this, I want to ask for your help.\n       So, will you please imagine that we are in a federal \n     courtroom in Nashville, where I was on October 2001. It is \n     naturalization day. The room is filled with anxious persons, \n     talking among themselves in halting English. They are \n     obviously with their families and closest friends. They are \n     neatly dressed, but for the most part, not so well dressed.\n       Most faces are radiant. Only a few faces are white. There \n     are 77 persons from 22 countries who have passed their exams, \n     learned English, passed a test about American government, \n     survived a character investigation, paid their taxes and \n     waited in line for five years to be a citizen of the \n     United States.\n       The bailiff shouts, ``God Save this Honorable court,'' and \n     the judge, Aleta Trauger walks in. She asks each of the \n     applicants to stand.\n       Now--here is where I need your help.\n       I will be Judge Trauger.\n       I want you to be the 77 new citizens.\n       Will you please stand, actually stand, raise your right \n     hand, and repeat after me. I want you to listen carefully to \n     this oath.\n       ``I, and state your name.\n       ``Hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely \n     renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any \n     foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, of whom or \n     which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen;\n       ``That I will support and defend the Constitution and laws \n     of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign \n     and domestic;\n       ``That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same;\n       ``That I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when \n     required by the law;\n       ``That I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed \n     Forces of the United States when required by the law;\n       ``That I will perform work of national importance under \n     civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take \n     this obligation freely without any mental reservation or \n     purpose of evasion:\n       ``So help me God.''\n       You may be seated. Thank you for doing that.\n       Now, that is quite an oath.\n       Sounds like it might have been written by some rowdy \n     patriots in Philadelphia or Williamsburg, and I wonder if \n     anything like that could be written into law today?\n       Judge Trauger then addressed the new citizens in Nashville \n     with these words:\n       ``You are now an American citizen. On behalf of your fellow \n     countrymen, I congratulate you. You have studied hard and \n     achieved much. You know more about the matters of citizenship \n     than many of us born into it. Even so, I would like to speak \n     to you for a few minutes about what I think it means to be an \n     American citizen,'' she said.\n       Continuing to quote, ``Americans, unlike many other people, \n     are not Americans simply because of accidents of geography or \n     centuries of tradition. Instead, we Americans based our \n     citizenship on our foundation of shared ideals and ideas \n     brought from many countries, races, religions and cultures.''\n       The judge said, ``We are Americans because we also share \n     certain fundamental beliefs.\n\n[[Page S4158]]\n\n     We are bound together by the unique set of principles set \n     forth in documents that created and continue to define this \n     nation. We find our heritage and inspiration in the profound \n     words of the Declaration of Independence: 'All people are \n     created equal and endowed with unalienable right to life, \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness.' We pledge allegiance \n     to the Republic as one nation under God, indivisible, with \n     liberty and justice for all. But the greatest expression of \n     our national identity is the constitution of the United \n     States which established the responsibilities and rights that \n     go with citizenship.'' And the judge continued.\n       These were the words that fall day in 2001 of Judge Aleta \n     Trauger to 77 incredibly happy new citizens, their families \n     and friends in the Nashville courthouse.\n       This happens almost every month, in almost every federal \n     courthouse. That same year, about 900,000 new citizens took \n     this oath and heard words like this.\n       Judge Trauger, may I say, is not some right wing, super \n     patriotic extremist nominated for the federal bench by the \n     Bush White House. She was appointed by a Democratic \n     president.\n       But Democrats as well as Republicans--almost all of us as \n     Americans--agree with what Judge Trauger's exposition of what \n     it means to be an American.\n       For example, after 9/11 President Bush spoke of the \n     American character.\n       Former vice-president Al Gore said the next day we ``must \n     defend the values that bind us together.''\n       Judge Trauger, the President and the former vice-president \n     were invoking a creed of ideas and values in which most of us \n     believe. ``It has been our fate as a nation,'' the historian \n     Richard Hofstader wrote, ``not to HAVE ideologies but to BE \n     one.''\n       Those who love and hate the United States love and hate us \n     not so much for what we do but for who we are.\n       And it IS different being an American. One major difference \n     is how you get to be an American, just as those citizens did.\n       You can't become Japanese by moving to Japan and taking \n     some oath.\n       A Turk with great difficulty might immigrate to Germany and \n     become a citizen, but he will find himself described as a \n     Turk living in Germany, not as a German.\n       Because of their Pakistani roots, the family of the \n     recently arrested Al Qaeda leader, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, \n     could not become Kuwaiti when they moved to Kuwait.\n       But if a Japanese, or a Turk or a Pakistani came to America \n     and wanted to be a citizen, they would have to take that oath \n     to become an American. And they do that based not on race, \n     creed or color but by taking an oath and pledging allegiance \n     to a common set of principles.\n\n\n                  What Happened to Our Common Culture?\n\n       What principles?\n       Judge Trauger mentioned most of them.\n       Until recently in our country, most people learned these \n     principles in school, in their churches, at home, from the \n     media, in patriotic celebrations that were a part of everyday \n     life.\n       Thomas Jefferson spent his retirement evenings at \n     Monticello teaching overnight guests what he had in mind when \n     he helped create America.\n       Other founders took extensive notes and wrote long letters \n     explaining what it means to be an American.\n       At the Alamo, Col. William Barrett Travis appealed for help \n     simply ``in the name of the American Character.''\n       Former American Federation of Teachers President Albert \n     Shanker, said that the public school ``was invented to teach \n     immigrant children the three Rs and what it means to be an \n     American with the hope they would then go home and teach \n     their parents.''\n       Diane Ravitch reminds us that McGuffey's reader sold 120 \n     million copies and helped to create a common culture of \n     literature, patriotic speeches and historical references.\n       President Roosevelt made sure those who charged the beaches \n     of Normandy knew they were fighting for Four Freedoms.\n       But then things changed, for a variety of reasons.\n       One reason was that McCarthyism gave ``Americanism'' a sour \n     taste.\n       The Vietnam War and other challenges to authority \n     questioned prevailing attitudes including our founding \n     principles.\n       The end of the Cold War removed a preoccupation with who we \n     were not, making it less important to consider who we are.\n       And our history textbooks, which had done a good job of \n     teaching some traditional history, left out a lot. The \n     contribution of Spanish explorers was undervalued. The \n     diseases those explorers brought with them that devastated \n     Native Americans was rarely mentioned.\n       No Tennessee history book taught me about men like Kunta \n     Kinte, the seventh generation ancestor of Alex Haley, a \n     Tennessean who won a Pulitzer Prize for his family story, \n     Roots, the struggle for freedom and equality.\n       There was very little mention of men like my ancestor John \n     Rankin, a conductor in the underground railway, and about the \n     slave-catchers from Kentucky who tried to assassinate him.\n       And finally, the largest number of new Americans in our \n     country's history came to our shores--and in the last few \n     years, the prevailing notion became let's just celebrate all \n     those cultures, and we forgot to remind new Americans of the \n     principles that have always united our many, new cultures.\n\n\n                 Osama Bin Laden and George Washington\n\n       So, just at a time when there should have been an \n     acceleration in the teaching and learning of American history \n     and civics--it declined.\n       In Dr. Ravitch's words, instead of incomplete history and \n     simplistic patriotism, we went to the other extreme--``Public \n     schools with an adversary culture that emphasized the \n     nation's warts and diminished its genuine accomplishments.''\n       So imagine the plight of teachers. Assaulted by simplistic \n     patriotism on one side and multiculturalism on the other, \n     teachers dove for cover, textbooks became sanitized and \n     boring, and we've seen the embarrassing results.\n       Christopher Hitchens, in a 1998 article in Harper's, \n     summarizes the evidence:\n       59 percent of 4th graders do not know why Pilgrims and \n     Puritans first voyaged to America.\n       68 percent of 4th graders can't name the first 13 colonies.\n       90 percent of 8th graders can't recount anything about the \n     debates of the constitutional convention.\n       Today, three quarters of 4th, 8th and 12th graders--this is \n     according to the National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress--are not proficient in civics knowledge and one \n     third of them do not have basic knowledge, making one third \n     of our students ``civic illiterates.''\n       Children are not learning American history and civics \n     because they are not being taught it, or at least they are \n     not being taught it well. American history has been watered \n     down and civics is too often dropped entirely from the \n     curriculum.\n       Today, more than half the states don't have a requirement \n     for students to take a course--even for one semester--in \n     American government.\n       The results of this are evident everywhere in American \n     life.\n       For example, some federal judges--who seem not to know that \n     the first Congress enacted both the first amendment and paid \n     the first senate chaplain--these judges are unable to \n     reconcile our religious traditions with the separation of \n     church and state--producing absurd decisions like the one \n     removing ``under God'' from the pledge of allegiance.\n       A United States Congresswoman actually says that ``Osama \n     Bin Laden and these non-nation state fighters with religious \n     purposes are very similar to those kinds of atypical \n     revolutionaries that helped to cast off the British crown.''\n       Schools remove the names of George Washington and Thomas \n     Jefferson because it is discovered they owned slaves, without \n     remembering they also created a country whose principles led \n     to the inevitable end of that horrible practice.\n       And, according to the Princeton Review, our presidential \n     debates (and I participated in these) are now conducted at a \n     sixth or seventh grade vocabulary level as compared with the \n     Lincoln--Douglas debates in the 1850's which were conducted \n     at a level of vocabulary expected of high school seniors.\n\n\n                        trust classroom teachers\n\n       So, to help put the teaching of American history and civics \n     back in its rightful place in our schools, I have proposed \n     that we create Presidential Academies for Teachers of \n     American History and Civics and Congressional Academies for \n     Students of American History and Civics.\n       These residential academies would operate in the summer for \n     two weeks for teachers and four weeks for students. Their \n     purpose would be to inspire better teaching and more learning \n     of these subjects.\n       The idea for these academies is based primarily upon my \n     trust and respect for classroom teachers.\n       I believe that if, for example, 200 Tennessee teachers come \n     together for two weeks in the summer to discuss how to do a \n     more complete, inspiring and effective job of teaching \n     American history and civics, they will light up their \n     classrooms with their enthusiasm during the next year.\n       In the same way, good students who spend a month with such \n     teachers will go back to their classrooms not only inspired \n     themselves but serving as good examples for other students.\n       I know this works because I have seen it happen before. \n     Tennessee's Governors' summer schools for teachers and \n     students were the best education spending, dollar for dollar, \n     our state has ever done. Teacher after teacher, student after \n     student told me these schools literally changed their lives. \n     There are more than 100 such Governor's schools in 28 states, \n     almost all with great experiences.\n       Our pilot program would start with 12 Presidential \n     Academies for Teachers and 12 Congressional Academies for \n     students. We'd spend $25 million a year for four years and \n     see if it worked. The schools would be sponsored by \n     educational institutions. The grants would be awarded for two \n     years at a time by the National Endowment for the Humanities \n     after a peer review process. Each grant would be subject to \n     rigorous review after three years to see if the program is \n     worth continuing.\n       This is not only something that will work; it is something \n     parents want. A Public Agenda survey showed that 84 percent \n     of parents with school age children said they believe that \n     the United States is a special country, and they want schools \n     to convey the belief to\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\n     their children by teaching about its heroes and traditions.\n       President Bush has taken leadership in this. He created a \n     ``We the People Program'' to develop curriculum and sponsor \n     lectures on American history and civics. He is also \n     sponsoring a White House forum on the subject soon.\n       Last year the Senate authorized $100 million to schools for \n     the teaching of traditional American history and civics. A \n     dozen senators, including the Democratic Whip, Harry Reid of \n     Nevada, have joined in sponsoring our legislation. \n     Congressman Roger Wicker and colleagues in the House of \n     Representatives have introduced it there.\n       I have one more thing I need to say.\n       I want to read you one sentence from my so-called ``maiden \n     speech'' to the Senate last week, because it elicited what \n     one newspaper described as ``harsh criticism from the civil \n     rights community.''\n       This is the sentence: ``Some of our national leaders have \n     celebrated multiculturalism and bilingualism and diversity at \n     a time when there should have been more emphasis on a common \n     culture and learning English and unity.''\n       There are some real differences of opinion reflected in the \n     criticism I got for saying that.\n       Some believe that America is just another country, and that \n     it is embarrassing for us to claim it is truly exceptional.\n       Some believe it is old fashioned and wrong to try to define \n     the principles that unite us as Americans because in the past \n     it led us to excesses such as McCarthyism, because it can \n     seem exclusionary and that we would be better off just being \n     comfortable as descendants of wherever we came from.\n       Most important, we have not been able to put behind us the \n     memory that the ancestors of some of us who didn't come for \n     the same reasons most did. Native Americans were already \n     here, and the ancestors of most African-Americans, like Kunta \n     Kinte, were captured in their villages, transported in the \n     stinking bellies of slave ships to this country and sold into \n     bondage. It is hard to put that out of one's memory.\n\n\n                       why unity trumps diversity\n\n       Here is what I believe.\n       I believe that America's variety and diversity is a \n     magnificent strength. I have always sought that in my own \n     life and for my children.\n       But diversity is not our greatest strength.\n       Jerusalem is diverse.\n       The Balkans are diverse.\n       The greatest challenge we face in Iraq is not winning a war \n     but turning diversity into unity after the war.\n       The greatest accomplishment of the United States of \n     America, after establishing freedom and democracy, is that \n     we've found a way to take all our magnificent variety and \n     diversity and unite as one country.\n       I preside a great deal as a freshman senator. Engraved \n     above the Senate president's chair, for every C-SPAN viewer \n     to see, are the three Latin words that form the original \n     motto of our country, E Pluribus Unum--Out of many, one.\n       It is NOT many, out of one.\n       As Samuel Huntington has observed, if it were many out of \n     one, we would be the United Nations, not the United States of \n     America.\n\n\n                         ``pledge plus three''\n\n       Now, since 9/11, there has been a different tone in our \n     country. The terrorists focused their cross hairs on the \n     ideas that unite us--forcing us to remind ourselves of those \n     principles, to examine and define them, and to celebrate \n     them.\n       President Bush has been the lead teacher, literally taking \n     us back to school on television about what it means to be an \n     American.\n       We should join our President in this National discussion.\n       One way would be for each school to start each day the way \n     the Senate does--with the Pledge of Allegiance, followed by a \n     teacher or student saying in his or her own words for three \n     minutes ``what it means to be an American.'' It would be a \n     daily lesson in American history and civics for the whole \n     school.\n       When I decided to run for the Senate a year ago, I was a \n     member of the faculty at Harvard's school of government, \n     teaching a course in ``The American Character and America's \n     Government.''\n       The students and I were trying to figure out if there is \n     ``an American way'' to solve tough public policy problems.\n       It was easy for us to define the principles that unite us, \n     such as: liberty, equal opportunity, rule of law, laissez \n     faire, individualism, e pluribus unum, the separation of \n     church and state.\n       But applying those principles to real problems turned out \n     to be hard work. The Senate was reminded of this yesterday \n     when we debated partial birth abortion: it was the liberty of \n     a woman versus the life of a baby.\n       We see these conflicts of principle when we discuss \n     President Bush's faith-based charity proposal because on the \n     one hand, ``In God We Trust,'' but on the other hand, we \n     don't trust government with God.\n       I want the federal government to pay for scholarships that \n     would follow children to any accredited school--public, \n     private or religious. To me that is equal opportunity. To the \n     National Education Association it is the violation of \n     separation of church and state and of the principle of e \n     pluribus unum.\n       As Samuel Huntington has written, most of our politics is \n     about conflicts among principles that unite us--and about \n     disappointments that occur when we try to live up to our \n     greatest dreams.'' ``All men are created equal,'' we say, but \n     there is still racism in America. ``We will pay any price, \n     bear any burden to defend freedom,'' President Kennedy said, \n     but we didn't go to Rwanda, and there is a great debate about \n     going to Iraq.\n       If the conflicts among these principles and our \n     disappointment in not reaching them is what most of our \n     politics and government are about--then we had better get \n     busy teaching them again.\n       My best student in my last class at Harvard was Natalia \n     Kubay. She had grown up in Ukraine, married a Peace Corps \n     worker and moved to Boston. She was waiting for her \n     citizenship. Her enthusiasm for her new country was so great \n     that it infected all of us who were privileged to be in the \n     classroom with her. She hopes one day, after she is a \n     citizen, to run for office and serve in government.\n       Natalia is proud of her family and her native country. When \n     she takes the oath of a naturalized citizen in the federal \n     courthouse in Boston, as you did today, she will be living in \n     this nation of immigrants, proud of where she came from, but \n     prouder to be able to say, ``We are all Americans.''\n       Thank you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommemorate the 47th anniversary of Tunisia's independence.\n  Since the establishment of the Republic of Tunisia, it has made \nsignificant progress in the areas of social and economic development, \ntransparency of the electoral process, respect for human rights, and \nthe promotion of women's rights.\n  As the Bush administration recently stated, Tunisia has become a \nforce for tolerance and moderation in the region.\n  It has been a vital partner with the United States in our efforts to \nfacilitate dialogue in the Arab world. This role has become \nincreasingly important in this turbulent time.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation for Tunisia's continued \nsupport and cooperation in the fight against terrorism.\n  By working together against this common enemy, we will eliminate the \nthreat of terrorism and ensure international peace and security.\n  Our shared commitments towards this end will only serve to strengthen \nour relations in the future.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the government \nand people of Tunisia on the occasion of their 47th anniversary of \nindependence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4159-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4159-S4160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    IN CELEBRATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALL AWARD RECIPIENT DALE MINAMI\n\n   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize Dale Minami, the 2003 recipient of the American Bar \nAssociation's Thurgood Marshall Award.\n  Mr. Minami has had a successful law practice in San Francisco for \nmany years. Additionally, for over 30 years, Mr. Minami has worked \ntirelessly to promote civil liberties and social justice. He has \nselflessly provided pro bono legal representation to minorities and \ndisadvantaged communities. Because of his dedication, Mr. Minami has \nbecome an accomplished leader in the national civil rights community.\n  Among his many accomplishments in the courtroom, Mr. Minami is known \nfor successfully reopening the landmark Supreme Court cases of Fred \nKorematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi, and Minoru Yasui. The Supreme Court \nsubsequently overturned their convictions for refusal to be interned \nduring WWII.\n  Mr. Minami cofounded the Asian Law Caucus, the first Asian Pacific \nlegal service organization in the Nation, established in 1972. Mr. \nMinami also helped establish the Asian American Bar Association of the \nGreater Bay Area in 1976, the first Asian American Bar Association in \nthe country. Additionally, he helped found the Asian Pacific Bar of \nCalifornia. He has also taught and lectured at various colleges and \nuniversities and has spoken widely across our country.\n  Mr. Minami has also been involved in developing public policy and \nlegislation. He has volunteered his time on numerous boards and \ncommissions, including California's Fair Employment and Housing \nCommission, the California Attorney General's Asian Pacific Advisory \nCommittee, and the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund\n\n[[Page S4160]]\n\nCommission. I am pleased and honored to say that Mr. Minami also served \nas a member of my Judicial Screening Committee, from 1993 to 1996. Mr. \nMinami did an outstanding job on the committee, and his contributions \nwere invaluable. He has been a successful advocate for increasing the \nselection of African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and Asian \nAmericans for executive and judicial appointments at both State and \nFederal levels.\n  Dale Minami embodies the legacy of Thurgood Marshall. I commend him \nfor his dedication, hard work, and many achievements in the areas of \ncivil liberties and social justice and wish him well in all future \nendeavors. He is the kind of person who makes my State and our country \na better place. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4160-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMEMORATING THE 47TH ANNIVERSARY OF TUNISIA'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, Tunisia commemorates the 47th \nanniversary of its independence from France. Our two countries share a \nlong friendship that began in 1797, when Tunisia was one of the first \ncountries to sign a Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the United \nStates. In 1956, when Tunisia gained independence from France, the \nUnited States was one of the first countries to recognize Tunisia's \nindependence. This long relationship has served as the backdrop for our \nincreased cooperation in the efforts to combat international terrorism. \nOur shared commitments to peace, security, and stability in the world \nwill remain the most important principles guiding our relationship \nthroughout the 21st century.\n  I am pleased by Tunisia's commitment to further strengthen the \ndemocratic values that our two countries share as the foundation for \nfree and open societies, and I am confident its leaders will continue \nto work toward promoting greater political freedom and respect for \nhuman rights throughout the region.\n  I wish the Tunisian people the best as they celebrate their country's \nsuccessful transition from colony to republic. I look forward to many \nmore years of cooperation and friendship between the United States and \nTunisia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4160-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING DR. GEORGE V. IRONS, SR.'S INDUCTION INTO THE ALABAMA MEN'S \n                              HALL OF FAME\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. I rise today to honor Dr. George V. Irons, Sr.'s \ninduction into the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame. Dr. Irons was \nDistinguished Professor of History and Political Science at Samford \nUniversity for 43 years and a prominent civic leader. As a professor, \nhe taught 17 students who became university presidents--a record in \nAmerican education.\n  Dr. Irons was also one of Alabama's true athletic greats--the only \nUniversity of Alabama track field athlete ever inducted into the \nprestigious Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. He is also the only person \ninducted by both Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and the Alabama Men's Hall \nof Fame.\n  While a student at the University of Alabama, he was spotted by Coach \nHank Crisp running across the campus because he was late to class. \nCoach Crisp promptly put him on the track team where he set a \ncollegiate record the first time he pulled on a Crimson Tide uniform. \nRemarkably, his records still stand today.\n  Before the days of the million-dollar band at major football games, \nhalftime entertainment consisted of a sport called road racing. After \nlaps in the stadium runners would speed over a hill-and-dale course, \nabout 4 miles, finishing as the halftime show. In this realm, his feats \nhave been heralded by as the greatest of his era.\n  The Men's Hall of Fame was created by the Alabama Legislature in 1987 \nto honor posthumously those men who in their chosen professions have \nmade national and international impact for the betterment of humanity. \nPast inductees include some of America's most distinguished leaders: \nWarner Von Braun, famed scientist who developed rockets which propelled \nAmerican astronauts to the Moon; George Washington Carver, botanist who \nmutated plants to create vital food sources throughout the South; and \nJames A. ``Brother'' Bryan, who gave sacrificially to fellow Alabamians \nduring some of the severest economic times.\n  Its most recent inductee, Dr. Irons, joined the Howard College (now \nSamford University) staff in 1933, the depth of the Great Depression. \nOn his first day the College President asked him to report to the bank \nto try to stop mortgage foreclosure on the school. At this time, the \nschool owed over a half million dollars. Dr. Irons' personality and \npersuasion on behalf of the college won the day, saving the school from \nforeclosure. During difficult economic times, he often taught for the \nsalary of an IOU and in his spare time he coached the college track \nteam and fired the dorm furnace.\n  In 1962 he received Freedom Foundation's George Washington Medal of \nHonor for his speech: ``Freedom, America's Weapon of Might.'' It was \nbroadcast worldwide on the U.S. Armed Forces Network. He was the first \nAlabamians to win this award. He also distinguished himself through \nmilitary service in World War II and was a respected leader in civic, \nsocial, and professional organizations.\n  Dr. Irons was elected to the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame as the \nrepresentative of the entire 20th Century. J.L.M. Curry, former \nCongresswoman and ambassador whose statue as one of Alabama's two \nrepresentatives in the Capitol's Statuary Hall collection, was elected \nfor the nineteenth century.\n  It is good this revered Hall of Fame honors those heroes who \ncelebrate the best of our past. I am hopeful that Dr. Irons' life as an \nathlete, university educator, military serviceman, and community leader \nwill continue to serve as an inspiration for future \ngenerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4160-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    JAMIL DADA, RECIPIENT OF THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA FIVE NATIONS \n    DISTRICT 2003 DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN GOOD SCOUT OF THE YEAR AWARD\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this moment to \nreflect on the exceptional work of Jamil Dada, who will be honored by \nthe Boy Scouts of America's Five Nations District with its 2003 \nDistinguished Citizen Good Scout of the Year Award on March 21, 2003.\n  Jamil Dada is exceptionally qualified for this award, with a strong \nrecord of serving others in his community in Riverside County and the \nbroader region. His contributions to both local and regional community \norganizations have made a significant difference to countless \nCalifornians.\n  Mr. Dada's most prominent role is that of chairperson for the \nRiverside County Workforce Development Board, working to ensure a \nhealthy, well-trained workforce for the county. In addition, Mr. Dada \ndevotes his time as a board member for the Boy Scouts of America Inland \nEmpire Council, the Family Service Association of Western Riverside \nCounty, the Magnolia Center Division of the Greater Riverside Chamber \nof Commerce, the Police Activities League in Moreno Valley, the Planned \nGiving Advisory Board of UC Riverside, the Riverside Community College \nFoundation, and the United Way of the Inland Valleys.\n  In the city of Moreno Valley, he demonstrates his broad capacity for \nleadership as the vice chairman of the Moreno Valley Chamber of \nCommerce, the treasurer of the Moreno Valley Substance Abuse Task \nForce, and vice president of the Community Assistance Program, which \nprovides food to those in need.\n  Mr. Dada is also an Honorary Commander at March Air Reserve Base, \nwhere he serves as vice president of the March Field Air Museum, \nchairman of the Friends of March Field, and treasurer of the March Air \nReserve Base Forum.\n  It is clear that Jamil Dada is an outstandingly active, concerned \ncitizen, and I am extremely proud to extend my sincere congratulations \nto him on this much deserved recognition from the Boy Scouts of America \nFive Nations District.\n  I send my best wishes for a memorable celebration of Jamil Dada's \naccomplishments and for his continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4160-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4160-S4161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CELEBRATING NATIONAL SAFE PLACE WEEK\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as our country faces imminent war \nwith Iraq, and current events of the day may turn\n\n[[Page S4161]]\n\nour attention overseas, it is essential to remember the ongoing battle \nthat many of our young citizens face each day here at home. Our youth \nare the future of this Nation and must be protected. We not only value \nthe young people of this country, but recognize that they are capable \nindividuals and can take an active role in creating a healthier living \nsituation.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to talk about a tremendous \ninitiative between the public and private sector that has been reaching \nout to youth for 20 years: Project Safe Place. I am pleased that the \nSenate unanimously adopted S. Res. 70, a resolution introduced by \nSenator Diane Feinstein and myself to designate the week of March 16, \n2003, as National Safe Place Week, in recognition of this partnership.\n  Over the past 20 years, Project Safe Place has acted as an outreach \neffort of the YMCA Center for Youth Alternatives--a short-term shelter \nfor youth at risk. Nearly 64,000 young people have received help at \nover 12,200 designated Safe Place locations. Young people can easily \nrecognize a safe place under a well-known symbol of safety for in-\ncrisis youth. The success of the program, beginning in Louisville, KY, \nhas prompted the implementation of this youth shelter outreach program \nin over 100 cities throughout the United States. Even though the \nprogram has already been established in 41 States across the country, \nthere are still too many communities that don't know about this \nvaluable youth resource.\n  Safe Place is a nationally acclaimed program that is easily \nimplemented in communities across the country. This program unites the \nbusiness sector, volunteers, and youth service agencies in a community \nto provide temporary safe havens for youth in crisis. I urge all my \ncolleagues: if your State does not already have a Safe Place \norganization, please consider facilitating this worthwhile resource so \nthat young people who are abused, neglected, or whose futures are \njeopardized by physical or emotional trauma will have access to \nimmediate help and safety in their community.\n  National Safe Place Week celebrates that outstanding program and \nhonors the efforts of thousands of dedicated Safe Place volunteers who \nselflessly devote time and resources to protect our Nation's young \npeople. I hope this commemoration helps to raise awareness of the \nnumber of troubled young people in our Nation and provides more youth \nand their families with the knowledge that help is often right in their \nown neighborhood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4161-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF DOROTHY SHANNON\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, a precious friend of mine and of \nprogressive causes passed away earlier this week. Dorothy Shannon died \nearly on the morning of Wednesday, March 19, 2003. She was 85.\n  Dorothy was one of the dearest friends anyone could have. She was a \nfiercely loyal Democrat who was a long-time, prominent fixture in the \nWisconsin political scene when I first ran for public office over 20 \nyears ago. As it was to so many candidates, Dorothy's support, and that \nof her husband Ted, was crucial to me in that first campaign, and they \nhave been staunch supporters and advisors ever since.\n  Growing up in a union household in Toledo, OH, during the Great \nDepression, Dorothy's activism came naturally to her. She came out of \nthe Roosevelt Democratic tradition, and it stayed with her. She would \nremind me to ``be a Democrat, like Franklin Delano Roosevelt.''\n  After her serving in the Navy during World War II, she earned her \nmasters in early childhood education at Yale, where she met and married \nTed. They moved to Madison in 1950 and had lived there ever since.\n  As Dorothy told national columnist John Nichols, it did not take her \nand Ted long to get involved in Democratic politics. She recalled how \none day, when they were living in university housing, a young fellow \nnamed Bill Proxmire knocked on their door, and asked them to sign up to \njoin the Wisconsin Democratic Party. Ted and Dorothy joined Bill \nProxmire and a few other hardy souls, that included such future \nnotables as Carl Thompson, Jim and Ruth Doyle, and Gaylord Nelson. They \nformed the core of what was to become the modern Wisconsin Democratic \nParty. Ted and Dorothy helped put Bill Proxmire and Gaylord Nelson in \nthe U.S. Senate, as they helped me over three decades later.\n  Long before I ran for the U.S. Senate, though, Ted and Dorothy helped \nme win in my first race, for the Wisconsin State Senate, and they were \nat every event I ever had for the next 20 years. No matter what the \nweather, no matter what their health was, they were always there, \nalways encouraging me.\n  Dorothy's commitment to progressive causes inspired many, and in the \nearly 1980s, Democrats in Dane County made her their cochair, along \nwith a friend of hers, Jim and Ruth Doyle's son. This past January, 20 \nyears later, Dorothy attended the inauguration of the Doyles' son, Jim \nDoyle, as Governor of Wisconsin.\n  As was noted in her obituary, Dorothy chaired the Mondale-Ferraro \nPresidential campaign in Dane County, and she was credited with helping \nto organize the largest public rally in support of the Democratic \nticket that year.\n  I was at that rally. I remember it well. Everyone who was there will \nremember it for the rest of their lives. It was a remarkable outpouring \nof energy, idealism, and hope for the future, and as such it was the \nperfect embodiment of Dorothy's qualities.\n  John Nichols reported that last August, at an antiwar rally and march \nin Madison, Dorothy was seated in the middle of the crowd. He noted \nthat ``when the crowd prepared to parade off to Vilas Park, several \nfolks said goodbye to the white-haired activist. `Goodbye?' asked \nShannon. `Oh, no, I'm ready to march.' '' As Nichols wrote, ``Dorothy \nShannon was always ready to march. And rally. And campaign.''\n  No matter what the progressive cause or issue, Dorothy was there. She \nwas steadfast in her commitment, and it extended well beyond party \npolitics. She served on the Middleton Plan Commission, and was active \nin the League of Women Voters, the University League, and Friends of \nPheasant Branch.\n  It is still hard for me to fully grasp Dorothy's passing. I have \nknown Ted and Dorothy Shannon for half of my life. And that is how we \nall thought of them. Ted and Dorothy. We always said their two names as \none word. If you wanted to mention just one of them, it took a little \neffort. It slowed up the conversation.\n  Now, Dorothy is gone, and conversations will be slowed all around \nWisconsin.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to Ted and his family. I will always \nremember Dorothy, my dear friend, and cherished supporter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4161-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4161-S4162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UVM CENTER MATT SHEFTIC CENTERS HIS PRIORITIES ON HIS FAMILY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a young \nVermonter whose priorities are in the right place. Matt Sheftic is the \ncenter for the University of Vermont basketball team, the first \nCatamounts team to reach the NCAA tournament.\n  Before choosing to play basketball for Coach Tom Brennan, Matt was a \nstandout for the Essex Junction Hornets, leading them to the 1998 \nVermont State Championship. He was a first team all-state selection \ntwice, and in 1999 was named Vermont's Mr. Basketball by the Burlington \nFree Press, and was Vermont's Gatorade Player of the Year. At UVM, he \nalso serves his country as a member of the U.S. Army ROTC program.\n  Aside from his successes on the basketball court, in the classroom, \nand in the ROTC program, Matt is first and foremost dedicated to his \nfamily. When his sister Lauren battled an unexpected serious illness, \nMatt left the basketball team to help care for her. His priorities \nspeak volumes about him as an outstanding young man, about the \ncloseness of the Sheftic family, and about the wonderful job his \nparents have done raising him.\n  Matt Sheftic's story is told in an article by Joe Burris in the March \n20 edition of the Boston Globe. Today, in honor of Matt Sheftic and his \nfamily, and in memory of Lauren Sheftic, I ask that the article ``For \nVermont's Sheftic, family came first'' be printed into the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n[[Page S4162]]\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Mar. 20, 2003]\n\n       Comeback player; for Vermont's Sheftic, Family Came First\n\n                            (By Joe Burris)\n\n       Burlington, VT.--Big men get nervous, too. Vermont center \n     Matt Sheftic--a 22-year-old junior with Jack Sikma's shooting \n     touch and Paul Bunyan's body--stood on the sideline moments \n     before the Catamounts' America East final against Boston \n     University, pondering how he would play in the biggest game \n     of his career. Worry set in; Sheftic's melon-sized calves \n     trembled.\n       But he knew it wasn't too late to dial heaven. As he often \n     does during the national anthem, Sheftic called upon his \n     sister Lauren--who died in 2001 at age 18 from a brain \n     aneurysm after a courageous struggle that lasted nearly a \n     year--and asked if she would loan him ``the strength she \n     showed'' for the next two hours.\n       Sheftic missed his first shot, with 18:04 left. With 17:25 \n     left, he turned the ball over. In fact, he didn't score until \n     the 11:01 mark of the first half, on his second shot of the \n     game. By then Vermont had raced out to a double-digit lead \n     and Sheftic began to settle; legs that once trembled became \n     sturdy enough to help carry his team.\n       With 8:33 left, he scored on an up-and-under post move. BU \n     left him open at the top of the key with 5:43 left and he \n     capitalized with a basket. He scored two more soft-stroke \n     baskets to finish the first half with 10 points on 5-for-10 \n     shooting.\n       Over the last 9:41, when BU rallied and subsequently forged \n     ahead, Sheftic was the Catamounts' go-to guy, scoring 8 \n     points. His poise helped keep Vermont close in a contest at a \n     time when the partisan BU crowd was loudest.\n       ``After I hit a couple shots, I really settled down and I \n     started to get my confidence, and all of my nervousness in my \n     legs just left,'' said Sheftic.\n       Vermont's David Hehn won it for the Catamounts with a \n     fadeaway baseline basket with 5.6 seconds left, but Sheftic \n     was named most outstanding player, scoring 23 points on 10-\n     for-17 shooting and adding 6 boards to lead UVM to its first \n     NCAA Tournament bid. The Catamounts are the 16th seed in the \n     West and will meet top-seeded Arizona in Salt Lake City \n     today.\n       ``I was just thinking that she was with me at the [high \n     school] state championship game, and just how awesome it \n     would have been for her to be there for [last Saturday's] \n     game,'' said Sheftic about Lauren, who was three years \n     younger. ``But I knew she was watching anyway, and I really \n     felt like she was there with me.''\n       For Sheftic, his involvement with Vermont basketball this \n     season is a far cry from last season. He enters today's \n     Arizona game as the team's second-leading scorer (10.8 points \n     per game) and rebounder (6.4 rebounds) and is third with 54 \n     assists. The Essex Junction, Vt., resident who chose to stay \n     home rather than accept lures from big-name programs such as \n     Providence and Southern California has led UVM in scoring in \n     five games and in rebounding in six. Moreover, the 6-foot-8-\n     inch, 260-pound widebody has been a team leader. He has \n     helped to alleviate pressure from other players--including \n     sophomore Taylor Coppenrath, the America East Player of the \n     Year.\n       ``We had a situation where when somebody said something \n     about Taylor, that he wasn't that good, Sheftic became his \n     big brother and his protector,'' said coach Tom Brennan. ``It \n     was really a neat thing to watch.''\n       ``I don't know if I've consciously taken it upon myself to \n     be a leader,'' said Sheftic. ``I try to help out the team \n     wherever I can.''\n       Last season, Sheftic didn't play at all.\n       Lauren took ill during winter 2000. Sheftic, the oldest of \n     five children and the only male, endured the 2000-01 season, \n     but during the fall of last year, weeks before the start of \n     the season, he decided to take a redshirt to spend more time \n     with his ailing sister.\n       ``It was really an unbelievable time for me,'' said \n     Sheftic. ``Thinking back on it now, it was like a dream, a \n     nightmare. My sister ended up with a brain aneurysm and was \n     really sick, and we had a really tough season the previous \n     year, when we finished 12-17. I'm a business major, and my \n     classes are really tough.\n       ``Making a decision to leave the team, it just became too \n     much for me. I just felt totally overloaded. I felt like I \n     was drowning, like I couldn't get up to the surface to \n     breathe with my school work, going back and forth to the \n     hospital, trying to help my family out, trying to be there \n     for my parents.\n       ``You just didn't know what was going to happen. Phone \n     calls from my mother would range from, `Lauren's making great \n     progress today,' to `We took 10 steps back today, she's sick \n     again.' It was an emotional roller coaster I was on, as well \n     as the season, just trying to get up for games, when I felt \n     like all my emotions were with my sister.''\n       Sheftic went to Brennan's office and relayed his desire to \n     sit out the season. ``He was looking across at me and saying, \n     `T.B., I just can't do it,' '' said Brennan. ``They were \n     very, very close, and it really ripped his heart out. He told \n     me, `I really need to spend time with her. Basketball doesn't \n     mean as much to me.' ''\n       During his sister's battle, he battled his own sense of \n     grief while helping his three youngest sisters cope. Then, he \n     said, his sister suffered her biggest setback.\n       ``She went in to get a routine shunt in her head, which is \n     a procedure where they drain pressure in her head,'' Sheftic \n     said. ``And when they went to drill into her head, they hit \n     her brain with the drill, and it caused another brain \n     aneurysm. So almost a year later, we were in the exact same \n     spot.\n       ``We had to make a decision. My mom had spent every single \n     day of her recovery with Lauren. And one day [before the \n     surgery], Lauren told her that if anything like this happened \n     again she didn't want to do it again, because it was so \n     painful for her and such a long road.'' Sheftic was at his \n     sister's bedside when she died shortly after the surgery.\n       ``I think my family has become so much more important to \n     me,'' said Sheftic. ``Family is always important, but I don't \n     know: You sometimes start to take your family for granted. \n     They'd be at my basketball games and I loved the support, but \n     I guess you don't realize how good it is to go home until \n     you've gone through some kind of adversity with your \n     family.''\n       Sheftic returned this season and picked up where he left \n     off as a sophomore, when he averaged 10 points per game. In \n     his first game back, he recorded a double-double: 20 points \n     and 10 boards against Eastern Michigan. That was followed by \n     a 22-point, six-assist contest against Albany, where he went \n     10 for 10 from the floor.\n       ``Sheftic as a recruit was a star. When we got Sheftic, it \n     was like, `Wow, this is a tremendous recruit,' '' said \n     Brennan. ``And yet he has never said, `I need the ball more. \n     You're not running plays for me.' He has fit in really well \n     since he's been back.''\n       Said Sheftic: ``Feeling as much pain as I did that year, \n     I'm so much more thankful and appreciative of having good \n     times and friends and family, and these games mean everything \n     to me.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4162-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4162-S4163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TAYLOR COPPENRATH, PRIDE OF WEST BARNET, VERMONT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I salute a key member of the \nfirst University of Vermont men's basketball team ever to participate \nin the NCAA Tournament. Taylor Coppenrath is the Vermont version of \nLarry Bird, a smalltown boy who found huge success on the basketball \ncourt.\n  Taylor's basketball excellence has transformed his hometown, tiny \nWest Barnet, VT, into perhaps, on a per capita basis, our State's most \nbasketball-crazy town, and with good reason. During his career at St. \nJohnsbury Academy, Taylor did not make the varsity squad until his \njunior year, but when he finally arrived, his presence was felt. Taylor \nwas named Vermont's 2000 Player of the Year by USA Today and Gatorade, \nand Mr. Basketball by the Burlington Free Press.\n  When Taylor joined Coach Tom Brennan's University of Vermont \nCatamounts, he had an immediate impact, and was named the 2002 America \nEast Rookie of the Year, and earned All-America East, second team \nhonors. During this season, he was named the Kevin Roberson America \nEast Player of the Year, an honor appropriately named for one of UVM's \nall time greatest players. Taylor has attracted national attention, \nincluding a mention on ESPN.com's The Radar Screen. An opposing coach, \nTim Welsh of Providence College said of Taylor, ``I'm glad we only have \nto play him once this year.''\n  Taylor Coppenrath's story is perhaps best told by award-winning \nwriter Sam Hemingway of the Burlington Free Press in his column of \nWednesday, March 19. I ask that the column ``Basketball Star Makes West \nBarnet Proud'' be printed into the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n            Basketball star Coppenrath makes W. Barnet proud\n\n                    [From the Burlington Free Press]\n\n                           (By Sam Hemingway)\n\n       Shortly after 3 p.m. Thursday, the quiet hamlet of West \n     Barnet will grow even quieter.\n       Sharon Roy will put her small, seldom-used black-and-white \n     television on the counter at the West Barnet General Store \n     and see whether she can capture WCAX-TV Channel 3 on the \n     screen.\n       Meg Clayton has a better plan. Her good friends, the \n     Coppenraths, have a satellite dish, and because they''ll be \n     away in Utah, she intends to stop by and ``check on their \n     cat'' for a couple of hours.\n       Over at the Barnet School, the afternoon in-service session \n     for teachers should end in time for the staff to check out \n     the cable television hook-up installed at the school this \n     week.\n       The focus of all this television attention: hometown hero \n     Taylor Coppenrath. The 6-foot, 8-inch forward will be on \n     network television, leading the University of Vermont men's \n     basketball team in its first-ever NCAA appearance, against \n     the University of Arizona.\n\n[[Page S4163]]\n\n       The funny thing is, no one in these parts really saw this \n     day coming five years ago. The funnier thing is that, now \n     that it's happening, no one's that surprised about it.\n       ``He's such a sweetie,'' said Karen Stewart, the principal \n     of Barnet School. ``He was always very mellow, very easy \n     going.''\n       He still is. Neighbor Liddy Roberts recalled how, last \n     year, Coppenrath and her son, Jimmy, were home on spring \n     break and spent a whole day making an igloo for a youngster \n     in town albeit one big enough for Coppenrath to stand up \n     inside.\n       ``And, of course, he and Jimmy had to go out and cook up \n     some hot dogs inside the igloo afterward,'' she said.\n       Under that unassuming exterior lurks the heart of a lion, \n     however.\n       As a kid, Coppenrath played so hard at recess, some \n     teachers said, the school created the Taylor Coppenrath Rule: \n     If you come in from recess soaked in sweat like he did, make \n     sure you have a set of dry clothes to put on afterward.\n       Name a game, and Coppenrath was ready to play it. Games \n     filled the idle hours for kids in the village, none more so \n     than basketball. The sound of a bouncing basketball often \n     echoed through town from dawn to dusk.\n       Sometimes the games involved Coppenrath and his two best \n     friends, Clayton's son Chris and Roberts' son Jimmy. Other \n     times, it drew in entire families, passers-by, anyone who \n     wanted to play.\n       ``We even had family tournaments,'' said George Coppenrath, \n     Taylor's father. ``You had mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, \n     all bumping and shoving each other out there. It was fun.''\n       Basketball became such a fixture in West Barnet that six \n     years ago a paved, full-sized basketball court with two \n     backboards and hoops was built smack dab in the middle of the \n     village.\n       Still, the chances of a small-town kid from Vermont making \n     a big splash in Division 1 college basketball are as remote \n     as West Barnet itself, tucked into the hills 15 miles \n     southwest of St. Johnsbury.\n       Coppenrath, who kept growing taller throughout high school, \n     was a late-blooming star. He didn't make the varsity at St. \n     Johnsbury Academy until his junior year, a year after his two \n     West Barnet buddies had made the team.\n       Only as a senior did he finally receive the recognition he \n     deserved: Vermont's Gatorade Player of the Year, The \n     Burlington Free Press' Mr. Basketball and a full scholarship \n     from UVM. This winter he led the Catamounts in scoring and \n     was named the player of the year in the America East \n     basketball conference.\n       How crazy is this town for basketball now? George \n     Coppenrath has taken to making video tapes of UVM games and \n     leaving them at the two stores in town for people to borrow \n     and watch.\n       Tuesday, all of the West Barnet General Store's copies were \n     out on loan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4163-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNITION OF COACH JOHN McDONNELL AND THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS \n                        TRACK AND FIELD PROGRAM\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in projects within the San Diego Creek Watershed, \nCalifornia, and for other purposes, to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \namend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities \nAct to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to fund projects within \nthe Irvine Basin.\n  This bill will authorize up to $19 million in funds in order to cover \nup to 25 percent of the costs of constructing three water projects in \nSouthern California. Water is an issue of paramount importance in \nCalifornia, and these projects provide innovative examples of ways that \nwe can improve our water quality and increase our water supply.\n  The first project, called the Natural Treatment System, will build a \nnetwork of wetlands to filter surface water and urban runoff in the San \nDiego Creek Watershed and Upper Newport Bay. Based on the performance \nof a single constructed wetland in the area, we expect the Natural \nTreatment System to filter out 126,000 pounds of nitrogen and 21,000 \npounds of phosphorus from the watershed each year and reduce levels of \nharmful bacteria such as fecal coliform by as much as 26 percent.\n  The second project, the Irvine Desalter, will clean brackish \ngroundwater and provide drinking water for between 40,000 and 50,000 \npeople. By allowing the Irvine Basin to access another water source, \nthe desalter will reduce our dependence on imported water and take \nconsiderable pressure off of our other water resources.\n  The final project will construct a regional brine line to dispose of \nbrine directly into the ocean. Like much of California, the Irvine \nRanch Water District is a leader in water reclamation and recycling \nefforts. Buildup of too much salt in the system can hamper these \nreclamation efforts. The brine line will allow the District to continue \nits innovative efforts to ensure that water is used more than once \nwhile increasing use of brackish water resources.\n  These projects shows us how California and the West can improve our \nwater situation. Projects like these show us the way forward. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4168-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4168-S4169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS--March 19, 2003\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, \n        Mr. Allen, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bond, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, \n        Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. \n        Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Frist, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, \n        Mr. Hagel, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr.\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\n        Lott, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Miller, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Nelson of \n        Nebraska, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Reid, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n        Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith, Mr. Specter, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n        Sununu, Mr. Talent, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 659. A bill to prohibit civil liability actions from being brought \nor continued against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers \nof firearms or ammunition for damages resulting from the misuse of \ntheir products by others; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that I and my good friend \nfrom Idaho, Senator Craig, have introduced yesterday. This bill already \nenjoys strong bi-partisan support--Senator Craig and I are joined by \nover 50 other co-sponsors, both Democrat and Republican.\n  This bill will correct a significant injustice that threatens the \nviability of a lawful United States industry, the firearms industry. An \nincreasing number of lawsuits are being filed against the firearms \nindustry seeking damages for wrongs committed by third persons who \nmisuse the industry's products. These lawsuits seek to impose liability \non lawful businesses for the actions of people over whom the firearms \nindustry has no control.\n  This is just outrageous. Businesses that comply with all applicable \nFederal and State laws, that produce a product fit for its intended \nlawful purpose--be it elk hunting, duck hunting, target shooting or for \npersonal protection--should not be subject to frivolous lawsuits that \nhave only one goal--to put them out of business. This an unacceptable \nburden on lawful interstate commerce.\n  That's why Senator Craig and I have introduced the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act. The bill is carefully tailored to bar \nactions against firearms manufacturers or dealers that are based solely \non the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearms by third parties. The \nbill would not block legitimate actions against the firearms industry \nfor cases involving defective firearms, breaches of contract, criminal \nbehavior by a firearm manufacturer or seller, or the negligent \nentrustment of a firearm to an irresponsible person.\n  This is only fair and right. The U.S. firearms industry serves \nAmerica's gun owners and sportsmen well, and provides good-paying jobs \nfor many Americans. They shouldn't be penalized just for legally \nproducing or selling a product that functions as designed and intended.\n  I would ask all of my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation. It is very important that we take up and pass this bill as \nsoon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4169-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4169-S4179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 670. A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n95 Seventh Street in San Francisco, California, as the ``James R. \nBrowning United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am re-introducing legislation today to \nname the courthouse at 95 Seventh Street in San Francisco, California, \nas the ``James R. Browning United States Courthouse.''\n  Judge Browning was appointed to the court by President Kennedy and \nhas spent 40 years as a circuit judge on the Court of Appeals for the \nNinth Circuit. For twelve of those years, he served as Chief Judge. As \nchief judge, Judge Browning reorganized and modernized the \nadministration of the Ninth Circuit. Now, he is on Senior Status.\n  He is originally from Montana and graduated from Montana State \nUniversity in 1938 and from Montana University Law School in 1941, \nachieving the highest scholastic record in his class and serving as \neditor-in-chief of the law review. Before being appointed to the Court, \nJudge Browning served in the U.S. Army and worked for Department of \nJustice and in private practice.\n  I can think of no more appropriate honor for Judge Browning than to \nplace his name on the courthouse building where he has worked for 40 \nyears.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN:\n  S. 672. A bill to require a 50 hour workweek for Federal prison \ninmates and to establish a grant program for mandatory drug testing, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mandatory \nPrisoner Work and Drug Testing Act of 2003. This legislation is the \ncontinuation of work I did while in the House of Representatives to \nrein in the undeserved privileges that are currently given to Federal \nprisoners.\n  Today's criminal justice system is failing, partly because of what \nhappens, or more specifically, doesn't happen, once convicted criminals \narrive in prison. What prisoners are doing is watching cable \ntelevision, getting high on drugs, lifting weights, and learning to be \nbetter criminals. What they are not doing is working and paying back \ntheir victims. That's not justice.\n  The purpose of the Mandatory Prisoner Work and Drug Testing Act is to \nhelp establish a Federal prison system that provides discipline and \nrehabilitation for our Nation's prisoners and requires that they make \nrestitution to their victims.\n  First, this legislation requires that all Federal prison inmates have \na 50-hour work week. Job training, educational and life skills \npreparation study will also be mandated under this provision. Current \nfederal law does not mandate a minimum work week for the 100,000 \ninmates in the Federal prison system. Sadly, the average workday for a \nprisoner in the United States is 6.8 hours. This is absolutely \nunacceptable. American taxpayers should not have to work full-time to \nprovide rest and relaxation for our nation's prisoners.\n  Federal prisoners would be paid for the work they do, but their pay \nwould be divided and dispersed in the following manner: 25 percent \nwould offset the cost of prisoner incarceration, 25 percent would go to \nvictim restitution, 25 percent would be made available to the inmate \nfor necessary costs of incarceration, 10 percent would be placed in a \nnon-interest bearing account to be paid to the inmate upon release, and \nthe remaining 15 percent would go to states and local jurisdictions \nthat operate correctional facilities which have similar programs.\n  Second, this legislation requires the Bureau of Prisons to establish \na zero-tolerance policy for the use or possession of illegal \ncontraband. A drug-free environment is essential to any hopes of \nrehabilitation for our federal prison inmates. Under these provisions, \ninmates would be subject to random searches and inspections for drugs \nnot less than 12 times each year. Federal prisons would be required to \noffer residential drug treatment for all inmates. And finally, any \nemployee hired to work in a federal prison would undergo a mandatory \ndrug test, and all employees would be subject to random testing at \nleast twice each year.\n  I understand that many State and local prisons would also be \ninterested in starting programs to get a drug-free prison, and for that \nreason have included a new grant program. Any State or unit of local \ngovernment may apply for grants if they meet the same drug-testing \nrequirements that are mandated for federal prisons under this \nlegislation.\n  Third, the Mandatory Prisoner Work and Drug Treatment Act includes a \nrequirement that all inmates in the Federal prison system participate \nin a boot camp for not less than four weeks. This boot camp program \nwould include strict discipline, physical training, and hard labor to \ndeter crime and promote successful integration or reintegration of the \noffender into the prison community. Those prisoners that choose not to \nparticipate or are physically unable to participate are required to be \nconfined to their cells for not less than 23 hours per day during the \nduration that they would otherwise be spending in this program and be \nallowed only those privileges that are granted under Federal law.\n  These boot camps work. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Prisons already \nsupports two such programs, one for men and one for women. These \nprograms place inmates in highly structured, spartan environments where \nthey undergo physical training and labor-intensive work assignments, \ncoupled\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\nwith education and vocational training, substance abuse treatment, and \nlife skills programs. They focus on promoting positive changes in \ninmates' behavior, including responsible decision-making, self-\ndirection and positive self-image. In fact, boot camps have worked so \nwell that over 30 states now have them in place.\n  Finally, this legislation will further restrict inmates' activities \nand possessions. Under this legislation inmates would not be allowed to \npossess or smoke tobacco, view or read pornographic or sexually \nexplicit material, or view cable television that is not educational in \nnature. Inmates would not be allowed to possess microwave ovens, hot \nplates, toaster ovens, televisions, or VCRs. They would not be allowed \nto listen to music that contains lyrics that are violent, vulgar, \nsexually explicit, glamorize gang membership or activities, demean \nwomen, or disrespect law enforcement. We have to remember that these \nindividuals are in Federal prison to be punished for a crime they \ncommitted. There is no reason for inmates to be given the same, or \nbetter, privileges than law-abiding citizens have. No one can tell me \nthat an inmate has to have cable television when many law-abiding, \ntaxpaying families cannot afford such a perk.\n  We need to work to ensure that our nation's criminals understand the \ngravity of the crimes they committed. I understand that many of our \nnation's jails and prisons use activities like weight lifting as \nrewards for their inmates. My legislation does not restrict that kind \nof activity. This legislation simply states that it is no longer \nacceptable for our nation's inmates to leisurely go about their day \ninstead of working to pay for the crimes they committed. It is time \nthat our government send a clear message to the victims of these crimes \nthat these criminals will pay, and that restitution, to the maximum \nextent possible, will be made.\n  Quite simply, we need to stop the revolving doors of our prison \nsystem. A study released in June, 2002, by the U.S. Department of \nJustice found that among nearly 300,000 prisoners released in 15 states \nin 1994, 67.5 percent were rearrested within three years. It is my hope \nthat if Federal prisoners were required to work and given drug \ntreatment, instead of perks like cable television and weight training \ntime, these individuals would be deterred from committing another crime \nand returning to prison.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation and help me \nin getting it passed this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 673. A bill to amend part D of title III of the Public Health \nService Act to authorize grants and loan guarantees for health centers \nto enable the centers to fund capital needs projects, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important piece \nof new legislation to help an essential part of our health care safety \nnet--our Nation's health centers--serve the uninsured and medically-\nunderserved.\n  The Building Better Health Centers Act will promote health centers' \nmission of providing care to anyone who needs it by getting rid of an \nartificial distinction existing in current law. Right now, federal \ngrant dollars to health centers can be used for most things a health \ncenter needs to do--including salaries, supplies, and basic upkeep. But \nfederal grants to health centers cannot be used for one of the most \ncritical and expensive needs a health center, or any business or \nnonprofit organizations, will ever face--capital improvements.\n  Unless we correct this silly distinction, many of our health centers \nare destined to be shackled to slowly deteriorating facilities. Over \ntime, this will sap their ability to provide care. If we are serious \nabout maximizing health centers' ability to deal with our health care \naccess needs, we must allow Federal grant dollars to be used to meet \nour health centers' capital needs.\n  I've been down here on the Senate floor many times to talk about \nhealth centers, but let me cover the basics once again. Health \ncenters--which include community health centers, migrant health \ncenters, homeless health centers, and public housing health centers--\naddress the health care access problem by providing primary care \nservice in thousands of rural and urban medically-underserved \ncommunities throughout the United States.\n  And as we all know, the health care access problem remains a serious \nissue in our country. Many health care experts believe that Americans' \nlack of access to basic health services is our single most pressing \nhealth care problem. Nearly 50 million Americans do not have access to \na primary care provider, whether they are insured or not. In addition, \nover 41 million Americans lack health insurance and have difficulty \naccessing care due to the inability to pay.\n  Health centers help fill part of this void. More than 3,400 health \ncenter clinics nationwide provide basic health care services to more \nthan 12 million Americans, almost 8 million minorities, nearly 850,000 \nfarmworkers, and almost 750,000 homeless individuals each year. The \ncare they provide has been repeatedly shown by studies to be high-\nquality and cost-effective. In fact, health centers are one of the best \nhealth care bargains around--the average yearly cost for a health \ncenter patient is just over one dollar per day.\n  I believe that one of the most effective ways to address our health \ncare access problem is by dramatically expanding access to health \ncenters. And I am pleased to report a strong consensus is developing to \ndo exactly that. The Senate has voted in support of a proposal I have \nmade with Sen. Hollings to double access to health centers by doubling \nfunding over a five-year period. In addition, President Bush has \nproposed that we double the number of people that health centers care \nin the years ahead.\n\n  But over the next few years, as we hopefully see additional resources \nflow to health centers, we will increasingly encounter problems that \nstem from an artificial distinction we see in current law. As I \nmentioned, Federal health center grants are currently allowed to be \nused for most purposes--including salaries for health professionals and \nadministrators, medical supplies, basic upkeep of clinic facilities, \neven lease payments if the health center rents. But they simply cannot \nbe used for capital improvements.\n  This means that unless health centers can find some other way to \nfinance their capital needs--and I will talk in a moment about the \nsignificant barriers they face in doing this--major projects that could \nprovide substantial benefit to patients will never happen.\n  It means that an urban community health center that has been slowly \nexpanding staff and services over many years until it's bursting at the \nseams of its modest two-story building will have to continue to find \nways to cope, even if that prevents additionally-needed expansion or \neven if upkeep costs on the old building begin to spiral out-of-\ncontrol.\n  It means that a rural community health center in an area desperately \nin need of dental services may not be able to expand the facility and \npurchase dental chairs, X-ray machines and other major dental equipment \nneeded for the desired expansion into dental services.\n  It means that even if Federal Government is willing to commit grant \nfunds to open a new health center in one of the hundreds of underserved \ncommunities nationwide which lacks any health care professionals for \nmiles around, the new center may never come to be due to lack of \nfunding for a facility in which to house it.\n  This is more than theory--the evidence shows that many existing \nhealth centers operate in facilities that desperately need renovation \nor modernization. Approximately one of every three health centers \nreside in a building more than 30 years old, and one of every eight \noperate out of a facility more than half a century old.\n  Moreover, a recent survey of health centers in 12 states showed that \nmore than two-thirds of health centers had a specifically-identified \nneed to renovate, expand, or replace their current facility. The \naverage cost of a needed capital project was $1.8 million, and the \nneeds ranged from ``small'' projects of $400,000 to major $5 million \nefforts. The survey demonstrates that there may be as much as $1.2 \nbillion in unmet capital needs in our nation's health centers.\n  And that is just for existing health centers. As I mentioned, \nhundreds of\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\nmedically-underserved areas lack--and could desperately use--the \nservices of a health center. This further shows the need for new \nfacilities--and more capital--as we expand access to new communities.\n  So what about possible sources of capital? There are plenty of ways--\nin theory--that health centers might be able to get money for capital \nimprovements. Businesses--large and small--do it all the time. So do \nother nonprofit organizations like universities and hospitals. They use \nbuilt-up equity. They take out loans. They float bonds. They raise \nmoney through private donations as part of a capital campaign.\n\n  But unfortunately, health centers just aren't quite like most other \nbusinesses or nonprofits, and many times these options are unrealistic \nas a way to provide the entire cost of a major project.\n  Health centers simply don't have loads of cash in the bank. The \nrevenue these clinics are able to cobble together from federal grants, \nlow-income patients, Medicaid, private donations, and other health \ninsurers is typically all put back into to patient care.\n  Health centers already work hard to maximize the money they can raise \nthrough private donations and non-Federal grant sources. In fact, an \naverage of 9 percent of health center revenue comes from these sources. \nMost of this private and public funding is used to meet operating \nexpenses, and it is difficult to go back to the same sources to request \nfurther donations for capital needs. In fundraising, health centers \nalso face a huge disadvantage compared to nonprofit organizations like \nuniversities and hospitals because health centers lack a natural \nmiddle- and upper-class donor base. And raising private funds is \nparticularly hard in isolated rural areas that are often quite poor and \nwhich can have the most dire health care access problems.\n  Finally, health centers have difficulties obtaining private loans for \ncapital needs for a variety of reasons. The high number of uninsured \npatients health centers treat and the poor reimbursement rates received \nfrom most Medicaid programs mean health centers rarely have significant \noperating margins. Without these margins, banks are leery about loans \nbecause they don't feel assured that a health center will have \nsufficient cash flow to successfully manage loan payments. Banks are \nmade even more nervous by the high proportion of health center revenue \nthat comes from sometimes-unreliable government sources--such as the \nhealth centers' grant funding and Medicine and Medicaid reimbursements.\n  So what should we do? This isn't exactly rocket science. We have a \nneed--many health centers require significant help to build or maintain \nadequate facilities because they can't raise the money or obtain the \nloans themselves. And we have an existing law that prevents the federal \ngovernment from using health center funding to do exactly that.\n  We simply need to get rid of the artificial distinction we have right \nnow and allow our health center grant dollars to go to further the \nhealth center mission in the best way possible--and that is going to \nmean at times that we should support some new construction or major \nrenovation projects. If a crumbling building is constantly in need of \nrepair, is soaking up money, and is reducing the number of patients a \nhealth center can reach out to, the Federal Government should help with \nthe major renovation or the new construction needed.\n  The Building Better Health Centers Act authorizes the Federal \nGovernment to make grants to health centers for facility construction, \nmodernization, replacement, and major equipment purchases. If our goal \nis to help health centers provide high-quality care to as many \nuninsured and medically-underserved people as possible, we need to get \nrid of barriers to doing that, including capital barriers.\n\n  Behond just the possibility of grant funding, the bill goes further \nand permits the Federal Government to guarantee loans made by a bank or \nanother private lender to a health center to construct, replace, \nmodernize, or expand a health center facility. This loan guarantee is \nan additional tool that will help allay the fears of banks and other \nprivate lenders by limiting their exposure if a health center defaults \non a loan. An additional advantage of loan guarantees is that you can \nstretch funds farther. When guaranteeing a $1 million loan, the Federal \nGovernment need only set aside a much smaller amount of appropriated \nmoney--perhaps only a twelfth to a tenth of the loan total--to insure \nagainst that loan's possible default. This multiplier factor means that \nfor every dollar appropriated for this purpose, many dollars worth of \nloans can be guaranteed.\n  There is actually tremendous potential for these two new options--the \nfacility grants and the facility loan guarantees--to work together. \nSharing in up-front costs through grant funding, and helping further by \nguaranteeing a loan that covers the remainder of a project's cost may \nwell be the best approach. This will balance the need to make sure \nspecific projects get enough grant funding to make them realistic and \nthe need to spread capital assistance among as many projects as \npossible.\n  Let my try to respond in advance to a few potential criticism of this \nlegislation. First, to those who simply think on principle that the \ngovernment should stay out of private-sector bricks and mortar \nprojects, I would say we're already at least halfway pregnant. In just \nabout every appropriations bill, we have dozens if not hundreds of \nspecific projects earmarked for major building or renovation projects.\n  Some might worry that the potential large costs of construction \nprojects could get out of hand and squeeze out funding actually used \nfor patient care. But let me point out that we limit capital assistance \nto five percent of all health center funding. Based on this year's \nfunding level, this would mean up to $75 million for facility grants \nand loan guarantees. Because the loan guarantee program would allow \nsome of this money to be stretched, this level of support could easily \nmean help for more than $200 million in health center capital projects. \nBut the main point is that capital projects are absolutely limited to \nfive-percent of health center funding, which prevents any possible \nrunaway spending.\n  Finally, we should ask ourselves whether or not Federal assistance is \ngoing to give a free pass to communities, which really should be \nexpected to help out with public-minded projects like the construction \nor renovation of a health center. In my bill, local communities are \nexpected to help. No more than 90 percent of the total costs of a major \nproject can come from Federal sources--and this is the absolute upper \nlimit. Much more likely are evenly-shared costs or situations in which \nfederal support represents a minority of the capital investment. This \nbill does not give local areas a free ride.\n  The quick rationale for this bill is simple. Many health centers are \nhampered in their efforts to provide health care to the medically-\nunderserved by inadequate facilities. It doesn't make sense to help \nthese vital community clinics only with day-to-day expenses if their \nbuilding is literally crumbling around them.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and on the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to aggressively help \nour nation's health centers meet their dire capital needs by making \nthis bill law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Edwards, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Dodd, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 674.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing America's \nNational Maritime Museum Designation Act of 2003. This legislation \nwould designate an additional 19 maritime museums as ``America's \nNational Maritime Museums'' nationwide. Maritime Museums are dedicated \nto advancing maritime and nautical science by fostering the exchange of \nmaritime information and experience and by promoting advances in \nnautical education.\n  The America's National Maritime Museum designation would include a\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\ncommitment on the part of each institution toward accomplishing a \ncoordinated education initiative, resources management program, \nawareness campaign, and heritage grants program. Maritime museums in \nAmerica are dedicated to illuminating humankind's experience with the \nsea and the events that shaped the course and progress of civilization.\n  Museum collections are composed of hundreds of thousands of maritime \nitems, including ship models, scrimshaw, maritime paintings, decorative \narts, intricately carved figureheads, working steam engines, and much \nmore. Maritime museums offer a variety of learning experiences for \nchildren and adults through hands-on workshops and programs that focus \non maritime history.\n  Maritime lecture series offer an opportunity to learn about the \nhistory and lore of the sea from some of the Nation's leading maritime \nexperts. Visitors learn the broad concept of sea power--the historic \nand modern importance of the sea in matters commercial, military, \neconomic, political, artistic, and social.\n  The legislation that I am proposing would help museums better \ninterpret maritime and social history to the public using their \nextensive collections of artifacts, exhibits and expertise. These \nprograms and facilities are used by schools, civic organizations, \ngenealogists, maritime scholars, and the visiting public, thus, serving \nstudents of all ages.\n  I urge all members of the Senate to join me in support of The \nAmerica's National Maritime Museum Designation Act of 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. \n        Kyl):\n  S. 675. A bill to require the Congressional Budget Office and the \nJoint Committee on Taxation to use dynamic economic modeling in \naddition to static economic modeling in the preparation of budgetary \nestimates of proposed changes in Federal revenue law; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs and the Committee on the Budget, jointly, \npursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, with instructions that if one \nCommittee reports, the other Committee have thirty days to report or be \ndischarged.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ninstruct the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget \nOffice to employ dynamic scoring models, alongside static scoring when \nestimating the fiscal effect of tax policy changes.\n  For too long, Congress has debated tax changes without considering \nhow those changes might affect the economy.\n  The current method, static scoring, assumes tax cuts or tax hikes \nhave no effect on how taxpayers work, save and invest their money. Not \nsurprisingly, experience shows this assumption is completely off-base. \nThe idea that tax relief and investment incentives strengthen our \neconomy is not new to the 21st Century.\n  On April 15, 1986, President Reagan talked about the positive effect \nof tax relief on economic growth. He stated:\n\n       Whatever you want to call it, supply side economics or \n     incentive economics . . . it's launching the American economy \n     into a new era of growth and opportunity . . . Our basic \n     ingredients for a tax package have not changed: tax rate \n     reductions, thresholds high enough so hard-working Americans \n     aren't pushed relentlessly into higher brackets, some long-\n     overdue tax relief for America's families, and investment \n     incentives for business. . .\n\n  What President Reagan stated so eloquently in 1986 holds true today. \nEconomic growth is more easily achieved in an atmosphere where more \nAmericans are able to save and invest their money. Tax relief provides \neconomic growth, and when we draft legislation, we should understand \nnot just the cost of tax relief to the Federal budget, but also the \nbenefits that tax relief provides to the economy and the long-term \nincrease in revenues to the federal government that tax relief can \nprovide.\n  The current static estimates that we use imply that tax policy \nchanges have no effect on our economy, never produce higher or lower \nrevenues and never cause resources to shift within our federal budget. \nThis is simply incorrect. Tax policy changes can have a huge impact on \nour economy.\n  The belief that tax policy changes directly impact our economy is not \njust a Republican ideal.\n  In 1962, President John F. Kennedy remarked:\n\n       It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in \n     power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an \n     economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce \n     enough jobs or enough profits.\n\n  Tax relief provides jobs and profits, no matter who is in the White \nHouse and no matter who holds the majority in Congress. It is time that \nCongress looks at the real world implications of our tax policy before \nwe decide the overall cost and how much relief we can afford to give to \nAmerican families.\n  The debate on dynamic versus static scoring may sound like an inside-\nthe-Beltway squabble, but as I have said today, the decision on how to \nestimate revenues does have important real world implications.\n  For example, better revenue estimating methods would make it easier \nto implement tax rate reductions. This would put more money into the \npockets of taxpayers, which would have a very real positive affect on \nour economy.\n  Another example, shifting to a more simple, fair tax code would be \nless difficult if revenue estimators were allowed to consider the \npositive impact of tax reform on economic performance. Clearly a \nsimplified tax code would affect each and every tax paying American.\n  American families face the challenge of paying their tax burden; \nproviding food, clothing and shelter for their children; and must work \neven harder to have money leftover so they can afford to pay their \nmedical bills, enjoy a family vacation, save for education costs, or \nput money away for retirement.\n  We know that when government takes money away from working families, \nit stifles growth. We also know that when the government gives money \nback to the working families that earned it, we encourage growth.\n  I should clarify that this legislation does not negate the Congress' \nuse of the currently used static scoring model. This bill simply \ndirects OMB and the Joint Tax Committee to use both static and dynamic \nscoring.\n  This will create a system that will allow Congress a slide-by-slide \nanalysis of both scoring methods. In a Washington Post editorial on \nJanuary 31, it was suggested that dynamic scoring could be useful as a \nway to present tax or spending policies as an additional alternative \nscenario. The editorial states that it would do no harm to the \ntraditional way that CBO goes about its job to set up a dual scoring \nmethod. This is not, as some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have suggested, ``fantasyland scoring.''\n  By using both static and dynamic scoring methods, Mr. President, \nthrough time we will all understand which approach is more realistic, \nand only then, I believe, can we then confidently do away with the \nantiquated, unrealistic static model we use today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                 S. 675\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that it is necessary to ensure \n     that Congress is presented with reliable information from the \n     Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation as to the dynamic macroeconomic feedback effects to \n     changes in Federal law and the probable behavioral responses \n     of taxpayers, businesses, and other parties to such changes. \n     Specifically, the Congress intends that, while not excluding \n     any other estimating method, dynamic estimating techniques \n     shall also be used in estimating the fiscal impact of \n     proposals to change Federal laws, to the extent that data are \n     available to permit estimates to be made in such a manner.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTIMATES OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION.\n\n       In addition to any other estimates it may prepare of any \n     proposed change in Federal revenue law, a fiscal estimate \n     shall be prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation of each \n     such proposed change on the basis of assumptions that \n     estimate the probable behavioral responses of personal and \n     business taxpayers and other relevant entities to that \n     proposed change and the dynamic macroeconomic feedback \n     effects of that proposed change. The preceding sentence shall \n     apply only to a proposed change that the Joint\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\n     Committee on Taxation determines, pursuant to a static fiscal \n     estimate, has a fiscal impact in excess of $250,000,000 in \n     any fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTIMATES OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE.\n\n       In addition to any other estimates it may prepare of any \n     proposed change in Federal revenue law, a fiscal estimate \n     shall be prepared by the Congressional Budget Office of each \n     such proposed change on the basis of assumptions that \n     estimate the probable behavioral responses of personal and \n     business taxpayers and other relevant entities to that \n     proposed change and the dynamic macroeconomic feedback \n     effects of that proposed change. The preceding sentence shall \n     apply only to a proposed change that the Congressional Budget \n     Office determines, pursuant to a static fiscal estimate, has \n     a fiscal impact in excess of $250,000,000 in any fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 4. DISCLOSURE OF ASSUMPTIONS.\n\n       Any report to Congress or the public made by the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation or the Congressional Budget Office that \n     contains an estimate made under this Act of the effect that \n     any legislation will have on revenues shall be accompanied \n     by--\n       (1) a written statement fully disclosing the economic, \n     technical, and behavioral assumptions that were made in \n     producing that estimate, and\n       (2) the static fiscal estimate made with respect to the \n     same legislation and a written statement of the economic, \n     technical, and behavioral assumptions that were made in \n     producing that estimate.\n\n     SEC. 5. CONTRACTING AUTHORITY.\n\n       In performing the tasks specified in this Act, the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office \n     may, subject to the availability of appropriations, enter \n     into contracts with universities or other private or public \n     organizations to perform such estimations or to develop \n     protocols and models for making such estimates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. \n        Rockefeller):\n  S. 676. A bill to establish a WTO Dispute Settlement Review \nCommission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer, along with Senator \nCraig, much needed trade legislation. I also want to thank Senators \nBayh and Rockefeller for their support for this legislation.\n  The bill that we are introducing would create a Commission to review \ndecisions of the World Trade Organization.\n  Why is this legislation necessary? Simply put--we must ensure that \nthe United States is getting the benefit of the agreements we \nnegotiated.\n  WTO panels have handed down several decisions recently that go well \nbeyond the scope of their authority. These decisions have had a wide-\nranging impact, undermining our ability to use antidumping and \nsafeguard laws and calling major portions of the U.S. tax code into \nquestion.\n  Most recently, the WTO ruled that the so-called ``Byrd Amendment'' \nviolates WTO rules. In fact, the Byrd Amendment simply takes duties \ncollected on unfairly traded products out of the U.S. Treasury and \nredistributes them to companies and workers hurt by that unfair trade.\n  The Byrd Amendment adds no burden whatsoever on imports. But despite \nthis, a WTO panel has inexplicably ruled that this law imposes an \nimpermissible penalty for dumping.\n  I would note here that the Administration has proposed repealing the \nByrd Amendment. I strongly oppose that. And so does an overwhelming \nmajority of the Senate.\n  In fact, last month 70 Senators sent a letter to the President in \nsupport of this important law.\n  Another area that I have great concerns about involves the softwood \nlumber dispute. The WTO currently found that Canada subsidizes its \nlumber industry, and I applaud that decision.\n  But then the WTO undercut the benefits of that decision. They ruled \nthat when determining a market price, Commerce must use the subsidy-\ndistorted Canadian timber prices rather than the market-based U.S. \nprices. This practice is wholly inconsistent with previous WTO \npractice.\n  We need to start seriously examining why it is that we are losing \nthese and other cases.\n  In my view, it is because WTO panels have ceased intepreting our \ntrade agreements and have begun legislating. Instead of following the \nrules, they are flouting the rules. And they are substituting their own \njudgment in place of carefully negotiated principles.\n  In the process, they are eroding U.S. trade laws, taking away rights \nthe U.S. bargained for, and imposing new obligations we never agreed to \naccept.\n  Just as troubling, they are doing so mostly under the radar of \nCongress and the American public.\n  The purpose of the legislation Senator Craig and I are proposing is \nto open the performance of WTO panels to public debate.\n  Under the legislation, the President, in consultation with Congress, \nwould create a Commission by appointing 5 retired federal appellate \njudges to serve 5-year terms.\n  The Commission would review WTO decisions adverse to the United \nStates to examine whether the panelists have exceeded their authority. \nThe Commissioners would then report their findings to Congress.\n  Increasing the transparency of the WTO in this manner is entirely \nconsistent with the Administration's stated objectives. It would also \nallow us to discuss openly and fairly whether the WTO is working as it \nshould.\n  The legislation offers something for everyone. If the Commission \nfinds that the WTO is applying the rules properly it will silence \ncritics--and perhaps earn converts.\n  But if the WTO is in fact straying beyond the carefully negotiated \nboundaries of our trade agreements, Congress needs to have the \noversight in place so that we can remedy the situation.\n  I understand and support the need for a global trading system. But we \nneed to ensure that the WTO is respecting the limits of its authority \nand honestly applying the rules under which it operates.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in helping to pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 676\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``World \n     Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Review Commission \n     Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States joined the World Trade Organization \n     (in this Act referred to as the ``WTO'') as an original \n     member with the goal of creating an improved global trading \n     system and providing expanded economic opportunities for \n     United States firms and workers, while preserving United \n     States sovereignty.\n       (2) The American people must receive assurances that United \n     States sovereignty will be protected, and United States \n     interests will be advanced, within the global trading system \n     which the WTO will oversee.\n       (3) The WTO's dispute settlement rules are meant to enhance \n     the likelihood that governments will observe their WTO \n     obligations. These dispute settlement rules will help ensure \n     that the United States will reap the full benefits of its \n     participation in the WTO.\n       (4) United States support for the WTO depends on obtaining \n     mutual trade benefits through the openness of foreign markets \n     and the maintenance of effective United States and WTO \n     remedies against unfair and otherwise harmful trade \n     practices.\n       (5) Congress passed the Uruguay Round Agreements Act based \n     on its understanding that effective trade remedies would not \n     be eroded. These remedies are essential to continue the \n     process of opening foreign markets to imports of goods and \n     services and to prevent harm to American industry and \n     agriculture.\n       (6) In particular, WTO dispute panels and the Appellate \n     Body should--\n       (A) operate with fairness and in an impartial manner;\n       (B) not add to the obligations, or diminish the rights, of \n     WTO members under the Uruguay Round Agreements; and\n       (C) observe the terms of reference and any applicable WTO \n     standard of review.\n       (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide for \n     the establishment of the WTO Dispute Settlement Review \n     Commission to achieve the objectives described in subsection \n     (b)(6).\n\n      SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Adverse finding.--The term ``adverse finding'' means--\n       (A) in a panel or Appellate Body proceeding initiated \n     against the United States, a finding by the panel or the \n     Appellate Body that, any law or regulation of, or application \n     thereof by, the United States, or any State, is inconsistent \n     with the obligations of the United States under a Uruguay \n     Round Agreement (or nullifies or impairs benefits accruing to \n     a WTO member under such an Agreement); or\n       (B) in a panel or Appellate Body proceeding in which the \n     United States is a complaining party, any finding by the \n     panel or the Appellate Body that a measure of the party \n     complained against is not inconsistent with that\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\n     party's obligations under a Uruguay Round Agreement (or does \n     not nullify or impair benefits accruing to the United States \n     under such an Agreement).\n       (2) Affirmative report.--The term ``affirmative report'' \n     means a report described in section 234(b)(2) which contains \n     affirmative determinations made by the Commission under \n     paragraph (3) of section 4(a).\n       (3) Appellate body.--The term ``Appellate Body'' means the \n     Appellate Body established by the Dispute Settlement Body \n     pursuant to Article 17.1 of the Dispute Settlement \n     Understanding.\n       (4) Dispute settlement body.--The term ``Dispute Settlement \n     Body'' means the Dispute Settlement Body established pursuant \n     to the Dispute Settlement Understanding.\n       (5) Dispute settlement panel; panel.--The terms ``dispute \n     settlement panel'' and ``panel'' mean a panel established \n     pursuant to Article 6 of the Dispute Settlement \n     Understanding.\n       (6) Dispute settlement understanding.--The term ``Dispute \n     Settlement Understanding'' means the Understanding on Rules \n     and Procedures governing the Settlement of Disputes referred \n     to in section 101(d)(16) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.\n       (7) Terms of reference.--The term ``terms of reference'' \n     has the meaning given such term in the Dispute Settlement \n     Understanding.\n       (8) Trade representative.--The term ``Trade \n     Representative'' means the United States Trade \n     Representative.\n       (9) Uruguay round agreement.--The term ``Uruguay Round \n     Agreement'' means any of the Agreements described in section \n     101(d) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.\n       (10) World trade organization; wto.--The terms ``World \n     Trade Organization'' and ``WTO'' mean the organization \n     established pursuant to the WTO Agreement.\n       (11) WTO agreement.--The term ``WTO Agreement'' means the \n     Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization entered \n     into on April 15, 1994.\n\n      SEC. 3.

A bill to revise the boundary of the Black Canyon of the \nGunnison National Park and Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area in \nthe State of Colorado, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Black Canyon of \nthe Gunnison National Park and Gunnison Gorge National Conservation \nArea Boundary Revision Act of 2003.'' I introduced a similar bill in \nthe 107th Congress. I am confident that the 108th Congress will quickly \npass this bill on to the President for his signature so\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\nthat we can continue to celebrate this special place.\n  My bill improves upon my earlier efforts designating the park.\n  The Black Canyon of the Gunnison Gorge is a national treasure to be \nenjoyed by all. The park's combination of geological wonders and \ndiverse wildlife make it one of the most unique natural areas in North \nAmerica.\n  The first person to survey the canyon, Abraham Lincoln Fellows, noted \nin 1901, ``our surroundings were of the wildest possible description. \nThe roar of the water . . . was constantly in our ears, and the walls \nof the canyon, towering half mile in height above us, were seemingly \nvertical.'' Similarly, today, visitors can enjoy hiking the deep gorge \nto the Gunnison River raging below, or look overhead to marvel at \neagles and peregrine falcons soaring in the sky.\n  This bill modifies the legislative boundary of the Gunnison Gorge \nNational Conservation Area allowing even greater access to the park's \nmany recreational opportunities including boating, fishing, and hiking.\n  This important legislation would expand the National Park by 2,725 \nacres, for a total of 33,025 acres. The Conservation area will be \nincreased by 5,700 acres, for a total of 63,425 acres. In total this \nbill adds approximately 8,400 acres to provide habitat for several \nlisted, threatened, endangered and BLM sensitive species including, the \nBald Eagle, the River Otter, Delta Lomation, and Clay-Loving Buckwheat.\n  Furthermore, I have added specific language to ensure that the Bureau \nof Reclamation retains its traditional jurisdiction over water and \nwater delivery systems.\n  This legislation helps preserve a unique national resource and a \nsource of national pride.\n  I urge quick passage of this important bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 677\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Black Canyon of the Gunnison \n     National Park and Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area \n     Boundary Revision Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend chapter 10 of title 39, United States Code, \nto include postmasters and postmasters organizations in the process for \nthe development and planning of certain policies, schedules, and \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Postmasters \nEquity Act of 2003, and I am pleased to have Senators Collins, Daschle, \nJeffords, Inouye, Mikulski, and Sarbanes join me as original \ncosponsors. Our bill modifies legislation I offered in the 107th \nCongress. That bill, S. 177, the Postmasters Fairness Act, enjoyed the \nbipartisan support of 49 members of the U.S. Senate. Its House \ncompanion bill, H.R. 250, had 291 cosponsors.\n  The measure I introduce today differs from its predecessor in that it \nprovides postmasters the option of fact finding rather than binding \narbitration if the postmasters management associations and the Postal \nService are unable to reach agreement on specific issues. Fact finding \nwould allow for an unbiased review of the issues in dispute and the \nissuance of non-binding recommendations. The measure would also define \nthe term postmaster for the first time.\n  Extending the option of fact finding to postmasters will enable them \nto take a more active and constructive role in managing their \nindividual post offices and discussing compensation issues with the \nPostal Service. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created a \nconsultative process for postmasters and other non-union postal\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\nemployees to negotiate pay and benefits. However, under the current \nsystem, postmasters have seen an erosion of their role in improving the \nquality of mail services to postal patrons and managing their local \npost offices. This has been particularly true for postmasters \nresponsible for small and medium sized post offices where they serve as \nfront line managers. These circumstances are among factors contributing \nto the decline in the number of postmasters since the reorganization of \nthe Postal Service over three decades ago.\n  At the present time, postmasters lack recourse when consultation \nfails, and my bill extends to our Nation's postmasters what is \ncurrently enjoyed by postal supervisors. While postal supervisors have \nthe same consultation process as postmasters, the supervisors also have \nfact finding, which provides them with greater ability to negotiate \nwith USPS management.\n  The Postal Service estimates that each day seven million customers \ntransact business at post offices. We expect timely delivery of the \nmail, six days a week, and the Postal Service does not disappoint us. \nGiven the regularity of mail delivery and the number of Americans \nvisiting post offices daily, it is no wonder that we have come to view \nour neighborhood post offices as cornerstones of our communities. In \nfact, many of our towns and cities have developed around a post office \nwhere the postmaster served as the town's only link to the federal \ngovernment.\n  Our Nation's postmasters are on the front line to ensure that the \nmail gets delivered in a timely manner, and they help fuel the \ninfrastructure that continues to boost the performance ratings of the \nPostal Service. Postmasters have enabled us to communicate with one \nanother since the dawn of this great republic. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in showing their support for our Nation's postmasters by \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 678\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Postmaster Equity Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide reliable officers, technology, education, \ncommunity prosecutors, and training in our neighborhoods; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the COPS program through 2009.\n  Since September 11, our local police have been asked to do more for \ntheir communities than ever before. Walk the beat. Be on guard against \nterrorists. Secure critical infrastructures. And gather intelligence on \nfuture terrorist acts when possible. Washington has a role in securing \nthe homeland, but the burdens fall heaviest on our local communities.\n  There are more than 700,000 police officers and sheriffs in the \ncountry, compared with nearly 11,000 FBI agents. It is our local police \nchiefs and sheriffs who are called upon more and more to protect us \nagainst the new threats from abroad. We had a sobering reminder this \nweek. As President Bush braced the Nation for war in Iraq, Homeland \nSecurity Director Tom Ridge ratcheted our alert level back up to orange \nand called all 50 governors to request that they provide an increased \npolice presence at airports.\n  Our mayors and police chiefs are hurting. Local budgets are \nincredibly tight--some communities have been forced to lay officers \noff, or to consider freeing criminals before their sentences are up, to \ncut costs. Even before 9/11, it was clear that the crime drop of the \nnineties was coming to a close. Last winter, the FBI reported that \ncrime jumped for the second straight year. The FBI has had to \nnecessarily refocus its resources. Recently, the Washington Post \nreported that the FBI has plans to ``mobilize as many as 5,000 agents \nto guard against terrorist attacks'' during hostilities with Iraq. The \nFBI's criminal surveillance operations ``would be temporarily \nsuspended.'' Local police will be called upon to pick up the slack once \nthe FBI is forced to pull almost half of its agents out of traditional \ncrime-fighting work.\n  The fight to secure our streets does not end with preventing \nterrorism. Crime is up again. The newest figures tell us the historic \ncrime drop the nation experienced during the 1990s is over. Property \ncrimes--offenses that tend to jump in a week economy--are rising \nparticularly fast. The FBI recently reported a 4 percent hike in \nburglaries and motor vehicle thefts last year alone. Where fighting \nviolent crime and bank robberies used to be among the FBI's highest \npriorities, the FBI is now focused on counter-\nterrorism efforts. Increasingly, local police departments, statewide \ncrimefighting task forces and drug-fighting projects are being told by \nthe Bush administration that they are on their own when it comes to \nfighting crime.\n  What's worse, all of this is happening during a time of unprecedented \neconomic hardship in our cities and States. States are facing dramatic \nbudgetary shortfalls. A new report finds that budget gaps for State \ngovernments soared by nearly 50 percent in the past three months and \nstate legislatures face a minimum $68.5 billion budget shortfall for \nthe coming fiscal year. Mayors nationwide report that cities spent $2.6 \nbillion through the end of last year on new security costs.\n  The response of the administration to these concerns has been \ndisappointing. This year, for the second budget cycle in a row, the \nPresident proposes to eliminate the COPS hiring program. COPS is the \nonly initiative in the entire Federal Government that targets its \nresources directly towards police. There is no middleman. There is very \nlittle red tape. Police chiefs report they have never worked with such \na responsive, effective Federal program. And yet the administration \nwants to shut it down.\n\n  Since we created COPS as part of the 1994 Crime Bill, the program has \nawarded grants to hire and redeploy 117,000 police officers to the \nstreets. 87,300 are on the beat. In the most recent year of hiring \ngrants, 2002, 4,400 officers were hired or redeployed.\n  The President's budget gives several justifications for shutting down \nCOPS. First, the administration claims the program doesn't work, that \nit hasn't cut crime. That is a curious assertion. Crime dropped for \nseven straight years after COPS resources began to be put to use in \ncities and towns. There was a 28 percent drop in crime from 1994 to \n2000.\n  Two studies support the assertion that COPS grants help cut crime. \nOne, released just this past November by the American Society of \nCriminology, found that COPS hiring grants have ``resulted in \nsignificant reductions in local crime rates.'' In 2000, the urban \nInstitute concluded that COPS has had a ``broad national impact'' on \nthe levels and styles of policing, and that it provided ``significant \nsupport for the adoption of community policing around the country.''\n  It's not just criminologists and think tanks who agree with me that \nCOPS works. Leading law enforcement officials share the view. Last \nyear, our friend and former colleague Attorney General Ashcroft called \nCOPS a ``miraculous sort of success.'' He said, ``it's one of those \nthings that Congress hopes will happen when it sets up a program.'' At \na conference last July, the Attorney General endorsed the theory that \nCOPS cuts crime. ``Since law enforcement agencies began partnering with \ncitizens through community policing, we've seen significant drops in \ncrime rates,'' he noted.\n  The administration offers a second reason for wanting to eliminate \nCOPS: The disparity between ``officers hired'' and ``officers funded''. \nBecause COPS has funded 117,000 cops, but only 87,000 are on the \nstreet, the President argues, the program is not accountable. That \nassertion overlooks the operations of the Office of community Policing \nServices. Few Federal programs operate with as much oversight and \ninternal review as does COPS. The disparity that seems to so concern \nthe Administration is simple to explain: It takes time to hire a new \ncop. Once COPS awards a hiring grant, it can take anywhere from six to \neighteen months to find, hire, train and deploy the new officer. There \nis no accounting problem. It is good public policy for police \ndepartments to take the appropriate amount of time to find suitable \ncandidates for new community policing positions, and this discrepancy \nbetween officers funded and officers hired is the result.\n  Post 9/11, COPS is about much more than fighting crime. It's about \nhomeland security. The Attorney General again said it best last July \nwhen he noted that ``COPS provides resources that reflect our national \npriority of terrorism prevention.'' The new assistant director at the \nFBI in charge of coordinating with local law enforcement agreed: ``The \nFBI fully understands that our success in the fight against terrorism \nis directly related to the strength of our relationship with our State \nand local partners.'' These aren't my words. They're the words of the \ntop cops.\n  COPS does not just hire new officers. It requires these officers to \npractice community policing. Community policing is a philosophy that \ngives more power to line officers. They get assigned to fixed \ngeographic areas. This decision-making power and neighborhood \nfamiliarity can be invaluable in a crisis, when relationships with \ncommunity residents and the ability to make quick decisions is \ncritical. Community relationships that come from COPS can also help \nunearth intelligence about potential terrorist actions.\n  By taking cops out of their cars and having them walk the streets, \npolice\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\nofficers get to know the residents of the neighborhood where they're \nassigned. This has proven extremely effective at building trust and \npartnership between local police and the residents they protect. \nCommunity residents consistently sing the praises of community \npolicing. It pays dividends by creating a climate in which neighborhood \nresidents partner with police, not only providing police with valuable \ninformation about criminal activity in their neighborhood, but \nrestoring overall confidence in the criminal justice system.\n  We need to continue the COPS program. The Justice Department reports \nthat for the past several grant-making cycles, demand for new police \nhiring grants has outstripped available funds by a factor of almost \nthree to one. To meet this need, the legislation I introduce today \nauthorizes $600 million per year over the next 6 years, enough to hire \nup to 50,000 more officers. We have made this portion of the program \nmore flexible: up to half of these hiring dollars can be used to help \npolice departments retain those community police officers currently on \npayroll. In another change from current law, a portion of these funds \ncan be used for officer training and education.\n  We make a key change to the current COPS program in the bill I \nintroduce today. In response to the needs of first responders across \nthe country, the bill authorizes a new, permanent COPS Overtime \nProgram. This initiative, funded at up to $150 million per year for 6 \nyears, will help ease the homeland security burdens faced by police \ndepartments across the country by reimbursing local police departments \nfor the homeland security overtime expenses they incur. I was pleased \nthat the Appropriations Committee included a 1-year, $60 million \nversion of this program in the recently-passed omnibus appropriations \nbill. The permanent COPS Overtime Program in this bill builds on that \nappropriations provision.\n  The legislation also provides funding for new technologies, so law \nenforcement can have access to the latest high-tech crime fighting \nequipment to keep pace with today's sophisticated criminals. Also \nincluded are funds to help local district attorneys hire more community \nprosecutors. These prosecutors will expand the community justice \nconcept and engage the entire community in preventing and fighting \ncrime. The statistics we have on community prosecutions are quite \npromising, and we should increase the funds available to local \nprosecutors, a piece of our criminal justice puzzle that has too often \ngone overlooked.\n  I would like to thank the men and women of law enforcement for their \nservice and heroism during these difficult times. They are up to the \nchallenge, but we should support them any way we can. The bill I \nintroduced today gives local police the support they deserve. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to continue the COPS program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 680. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to enhance \nbook donations and literacy; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to clarify and enhance the charitable contribution tax \ndeduction for donations of excess book inventory for educational \npurposes. This proposal would simplify a complex area of the current \nlaw and eliminate significant roadblocks that now stand in the way of \nbusinesses with excess book inventory to donating those books to \nschools, libraries, and literacy programs, where they are much needed.\n  Unfortunately, our current tax law contains a major flaw when it \ncomes to the donation of books that are excess inventory for publishers \nor booksellers. The tax benefits for donating such books to schools or \nlibraries are often no greater than those of sending the books to the \nlandfill. And, since it is generally cheaper and faster for a company \nto simply send the books to the dump, rather than go through the \ntrouble and cost of finding donees, and of packing, storing, and \nshipping the books, it often ends up being more cost effective and \neasier for companies to truck the books to a landfill or recycling \ncenter.\n  While there are provisions in the current law where a larger \ndeduction is available for the donation of excess books, many companies \nhave found that the complexity and uncertainty of dealing with the \nrequirements, regulations, and possible Internal Revenue Service \nchallenges of the higher deduction serve as a real disincentive to \nmaking a contribution.\n  This is a sad situation, when one considers that many, if not most, \nof these books would be warmly welcomed by schools, libraries, and \nliteracy programs.\n  The heart of the problem is that under the current law, the higher \ndeduction requires that the donated books be used only for the care of \nthe needy, the sick, or infants. This requirement makes it difficult \nfor schools to qualify as donees and also frequently prohibits \nlibraries and adult literacy programs from receiving such deductions. \nThis is because these schools, libraries, and literacy programs often \nserve those who are not needy or are over the age of 18. Further \ncomplicating the issue, the valuation of donated book inventory has \nbeen the subject of ongoing disputes between taxpayers and the IRS. The \ntax code should not contain obstacles that provide disincentives to \ncharitable donations of books that can enhance learning.\n  The bill I am introducing today addresses the obstacles of donating \nexcess book inventory by providing a simple and clear rule whereby any \ndonation of book inventory to a qualified school, library, or literacy \nprogram is eligible for the enhanced deduction. This means that \nbooksellers and publishers would receive a higher tax benefit for \ndonating the books rather than throwing them away and would thus be \nencouraged to go to the extra trouble and expense of seeking out \nqualified donees and making the contributions.\n  My home State of Utah, like the rest of the Nation, has a problem \nwith illiteracy. According to the National Institute for Literacy, \nbetween 21 and 23 percent of the adult population of the United States, \nabout 44 million people, are only at Level 1 literacy, meaning they can \nread a little but not well enough to fill out an application, read a \nfood label, or read a simple story to a child. Another 25 to 28 percent \nof the adult population, or between 45 and 50 million people, are \nestimated to be at Level 2 literacy, meaning they can usually can \nperform more complex tasks such as comparing, contrasting, or \nintegrating pieces of information but usually not higher level reading \nand problem-solving skills. Literacy experts tell us that adults with \nskills at Levels 1 and 2 lack a sufficient foundation of basic skills \nto function successfully in our society.\n  While this bill is not a cure-all for the tragedy of illiteracy, it \nwill increase access to books, both for adults and for children. Our \ntax code should not encourage the destruction of perfectly good books \nwhile schools, libraries, and literacy programs go begging for them.\n  The Senate is already on record in unanimous support of this bill. \nDuring the floor debate on the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001, I offered this proposal as an amendment, \nwhich was accepted without opposition. Unfortunately, the provision was \ndropped in the conference with the House. Moreover, the Finance \nCommittee has also approved this provision, having included it in S. \n476, the CARE Act, which is currently pending on the Senate calendar.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this provision would \ndecrease revenues to the Treasury by $283 million over a ten-year \nperiod. This estimate helps demonstrate the extent of the value of the \nbooks that are currently being discarded that could be utilized to help \nAmerica's adults and children.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting this bill. It is \nwrong for our tax code to encourage book publishers to send books to \nthe landfill instead of to the library. Let's correct this problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 680\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This resolution may be cited as the ``Resolution to Expand \n     Access to Community Health Centers (REACH) Initiative''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that appropriations for \n     consolidated health centers under section 330 of the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b) should be increased by \n     100 percent over 5 fiscal years, ending in 2006, in order to \n     double the number of individuals who receive health care \n     services at community, migrant, homeless, and public housing \n     health centers.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation, the Resolution to Expand Access to Community Health \nCenters, or the REACH Initiative. This resolution will continue to \nexpand access to health care for the medically underserved by doubling \nfunding for our nation's community health centers. I am joined in this \neffort by my good friend from South Carolina, Sen. Hollings.\n  The goal of the REACH Initiative is simple--to make sure more people \nhave access to health care. During the last session of Congress we set \nout an ambitious plan to double the federal funding for community \nhealth centers by 2006. Congress responded by increasing the funding \nfor the program and now we are calling on Congress to continue this \neffort and complete the doubling plan.\n  Health centers are already helping millions of Americans get health \ncare. But they can still help millions more--pregnant women, children, \nand anyone else who desperately needs care. The REACH Initiative will \nallow another 10 million women, children, and others in need to receive \ncare at health centers by 2006. And since we began this effort, we've \nalready increased the number of health center patients by nearly 3 \nmillion, and increased federal funding by nearly 30 percent. We're on \ntrack, we just need to stay there; and that's just what this resolution \nwill do--keep us on track to double this important program.\n  Simply put, we must achieve the goal of the REACH initiative--and we \ncan and should make it happen.\n  Let me close with what this initiative means in human terms.\n  The REACH initiative will help make sure that a young woman who has \njust found out she is pregnant but does not have health insurance has a \nplace to get prenatal care so she does not risk her health and the \nbaby's health by waiting until late in the pregnancy.\n  The REACH initiative will help make sure that a 6-year-old boy who is \nliving in a deep rural Missouri community, a community that otherwise \nwould not have any health care providers at all, has a place to get \nregular checkups so he can stay healthy at home and in school.\n  The REACH initiative will help make sure a young couple without any \nplace to go will be able to get their infant daughter immunized to \nprotect her from a variety of dreaded disease.\n  These Americans, and millions like them, are the reasons why we must \nmake the REACH Initiative a reality. I invite my colleagues to join me \nas a cosponsor of this resolution. If we work together, we can make a \ndifference and deliver care to those who are in the greatest need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4180-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 25--RECOGNIZING AND HONORING AMERICA'S \n JEWISH COMMUNITY ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 350TH ANNIVERSARY, SUPPORTING \nTHE DESIGNATION OF AN ``AMERICAN JEWISH HISTORY MONTH'', AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. DeWine) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S.

Con. Res. 26\n\n       Whereas execution by stoning is an exceptionally cruel form \n     of punishment that violates internationally accepted \n     standards of human rights, including those set forth in the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention \n     Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \n     Treatment or Punishment;\n       Whereas women around the world continue to be targeted \n     disproportionately for cruel, discriminatory, and inhuman \n     punishments by governments that refuse to protect equally the \n     rights of all their citizens;\n       Whereas the brutal sentence of execution by stoning is \n     pronounced in many countries on women who have been accused \n     of adultery, a charge that is brought even against victims of \n     coerced prostitution or rape;\n       Whereas in some places execution by stoning has been \n     invoked as punishment for ``blasphemy,'' thereby suppressing \n     religious freedom and diversity and stifling political \n     dissent;\n       Whereas, in July 2002, Amnesty International referred to \n     execution by stoning as ``a method specifically designed to \n     increase the victim's suffering'';\n       Whereas, in 2002, the European Union, the Secretary General \n     of the Council of Europe, the Government of Australia, the \n     Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand, the \n     President of Mexico, the Congress of Deputies of Spain, and \n     other world leaders all condemned execution by stoning and \n     called for clemency for individuals sentenced to stoning; and\n       Whereas, according to the Country Reports on Human Rights \n     Practices of the Department of State, the sentence of \n     execution by stoning continues to be imposed in several \n     countries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) condemns the practice of execution by stoning as a \n     gross violation of human rights and appeals to the \n     international community to end the practice;\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\n       (2) requests the President formally to communicate this \n     resolution to governments that permit this cruel punishment \n     and to urge the termination of execution by stoning; and\n       (3) requests the President to direct the Secretary of State \n     to work with the international community to promote adherence \n     to international standards of human rights and repeal laws \n     that permit execution by stoning.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Concurrent \nResolution to condemn executions by stoning.\n  Death by stoning is an exceptionally cruel form of execution. It \nviolates internationally accepted standards of human rights, including \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Convention Against \nTorture. Amnesty International has noted that stoning is ``a method \nspecifically designed to increase the victim's suffering.'' \nUnfortunately, the laws of Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia, Nigeria, and \nseveral other countries permit this cruel and unusual punishment. It \nmust be eliminated from every corner of the globe.\n  As those who work on women's issues have learned all too well, women \naround the world are subjected disproportionately to cruel, \ndiscriminatory, and inhuman punishments. Frequently their governments \ncannot or will not provide equal protection of the law to all their \ncitizens--especially women and girls. In several countries, women can \nbe sentenced to execution by stoning for ``adultery,'' even in cases of \ncoerced prostitution or rape. In some places, stoning has been invoked \nas punishment for ``blasphemy,'' suppressing religious freedom and \nstifling political dissent.\n  The Concurrent Resolution which I have introduced would condemn \nexecution by stoning, appeal for an end to the practice, and request \nthe President to urge other nations' governments to terminate that \ncruel form of execution. If adopted by the Senate, this measure, \ntogether with Concurrent Resolution 26 just passed unanimously by the \nHouse, would put both houses of Congress on the record as firmly \nopposing stonings.\n  I urge my colleagues to join the eight original co-sponsors and me in \nsupporting this humanitarian measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/20/senate-section/article/S4181-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 27--URGING THE PRESIDENT TO REQUEST THE \n UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS \n WITH RESPECT TO THE TEMPORARY SAFEGUARDS ON IMPORTS OF CERTAIN STEEL \n                    PRODUCTS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. BOND (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Fitzgerald) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S.

Mr. SCHUMER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 23, setting forth the \ncongressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year \n2004 and including the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year \n2003 and for fiscal years 2005 through 2013; which was ordered to lie \non the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 79, after line 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ______. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INCREASING THE CAP ON THE \n                   CRIME VICTIMS FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Victims of Crime Act established the Crime Victims \n     Fund which is one of the main Federal sources of money and \n     support for crime victims.\n       (2) The Crime Victims Fund provides funding for--\n       (A) formula grants to States for victims compensation and \n     victims assistance; and\n       (B) discretionary grants.\n       (3) State compensation programs pay directly for medical \n     care and counseling, lost wages, and funerals for victims of \n     domestic violence, child abuse, rape, and homicide.\n       (4) State assistance programs provide services including \n     crisis intervention, counseling, emergency shelter and child \n     care, and emergency transportation.\n       (5) Discretionary grants awarded to organizations fund \n     demonstration projects, training, and other assistance to \n     expand and improve the delivery of services to victims of \n     Federal crimes.\n       (6) The Crime Victims Fund consists of monies collected \n     from criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, penalty fees, and \n     special assessments collected by the Offices of the United \n     States Attorneys, the United States courts, and the Bureau of \n     Prisons, and does not rely on any tax-generated revenues.\n       (7) The formula to receive funding to compensate victims \n     under the Victims of Crime Act changed in 2002. In that year, \n     the Victims of Crime Act matched 40 percent of the amount \n     that a State spent for victim compensation. In 2003, the \n     percentage increased to 60 percent. However, because of the \n     existence of the cap on the Crime Victims Fund (currently \n     $600,000,000), the increase in victim compensation money has \n     reduced the amount that can be spent on victim assistance. \n     The existence of the cap has resulted in 8 percent less money \n     for victim assistance.\n       (8) The cap on the Crime Victims Fund must be raised to \n     ensure that the same amount is available for victim \n     assistance that was available in fiscal year 2002, an amount \n     equal to $383,000,000. To ensure this, the national victim \n     advocacy groups estimate that the cap should be raised from \n     the current $600,000,000 to $675,000,000 (not including any \n     amounts for the antiterrorism emergency reserve).\n       (9) Raising the cap on the Crime Victims Fund will not cost \n     any additional expenditures since Congress has capped the \n     Fund for 4 successive years, thereby holding back more than \n     $638,500,000 allocated to the Fund.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the cap on the Crime Victims Fund be raised to \n     $675,000,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 352.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICARE HOME HEALTH \n                   PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Home health has become an increasingly important part \n     of our health care system. The kinds of highly skilled, and \n     often technically complex, services that our Nation's home \n     health agencies provide have enabled millions of our most \n     frail and vulnerable older and disabled persons to avoid \n     hospitals and nursing homes and remain in the comfort and \n     security of their homes.\n       (2) The changes initiated as part of the Balanced Budget \n     Act of 1997 produced cuts in home health spending under the \n     medicare program far beyond what Congress intended. According \n     to estimates from the Office of the Actuary of the Centers \n     for Medicare & Medicaid Services, expenditures for home \n     health services under the medicare program decreased by 39 \n     percent between fiscal year 1997 and fiscal year 2003.\n       (3) Projected medicare home health savings under the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have totaled more than \n     $72,000,000,000 between fiscal year 1998 and fiscal year \n     2002, over 4 times the $16,000,000,000 that the Congressional \n     Budget Office originally estimated for that time period.\n       (4) Over 3,400 home health agencies have either closed or \n     stopped serving medicare beneficiaries since the enactment of \n     the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       (5) Since January 1997, the number of medicare \n     beneficiaries receiving home health services nationwide has \n     dropped by 1,300,000, more than \\1/3\\, and the average number \n     of visits provided over a 60-day period has dropped from 36 \n     to 20.\n       (6) On October 1, 2002, home health agencies received an \n     additional across-the-board cut in medicare home health \n     payments and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has \n     dramatically reduced projections for home health spending \n     under the medicare program over the next 10 years.\n       (7) Further cuts in payments for home health services under \n     the medicare program simply cannot be sustained without \n     affecting patient care, particularly for those medicare \n     beneficiaries with complex care requirements.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the medicare home health benefit should be stabilized \n     by--\n       (1) avoiding further cuts in payments for home health \n     services under the medicare program;\n       (2) preserving the full market basket update for payments \n     under the medicare prospective payment system for home health \n     services for 2004; and\n       (3) providing for an add-on payment under the medicare \n     program for home health services furnished in rural areas \n     after March 31, 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 363.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 9, S. 205.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 205) to authorize the issuance of immigrant \n     visas to, and the admission to the United States for \n     permanent residence of, certain scientists, engineers, and \n     technicians who have worked in Iraqi weapons of mass \n     destruction programs.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I applaud the Senate for passing S. 205, the Iraqi \nScientists Immigration Act. I am a cosponsor of this legislation, along \nwith Senators Biden, Hatch, Lugar, and Specter. When Senator Biden \nintroduced this last year, I worked closely with him, discharging the \nbill from the Judiciary Committee and encouraging the Senate to pass \nit. I was pleased when the Senate did so, and disappointed that the \nHouse failed to act.\n  This bill could not be more timely. As the United States and United \nNations seek to obtain information about Iraq's development of weapons \nof mass destruction, the scientists who have worked on biological, \nchemical, and nuclear weapons for Iraq hold critical information. Thus \nfar, however, those scientists have refused to speak privately with \nU.N. inspectors, instead insisting that Iraqi government \nrepresentatives be included in interviews. Many have suggested that \nthese scientists fear they will be executed if they provide material \nassistance to the inspectors.\n  The Iraqi Scientists Immigration Act offers a potential way around \nthis quandary by offering a benefit to those scientists who would like \nto share what they know about Iraq's weapons development. It provides \nfor the admission to the United States of scientists who want to \nprovide useful information about Iraq's efforts to develop weapons of \nmass destruction, along with those scientists' families. Eventually, \nthese scientists could become legal permanent residents of the United \nStates.\n  This bill has taken on increased importance since the Homeland \nSecurity Act--which has caused severe disruption in the processing of \nasylum and refugee applications--has taken effect. Many Iraqi \nscientists would surely be eligible for asylum and/or refugee status. \nSection 457 of the Homeland Security Act, however, eliminated the \nsurcharges on applicants for immigration benefits, which had been used \nto fund the processing of asylum and refugee applications, which are \ngenerally made by destitute people. This was apparently an oversight in \nthe hasty and secret process by which the Homeland Security Act was \nwritten by Congressional Republicans and the administration. This \nprovision has left the asylum and refugee programs in limbo. The \nSenate-passed omnibus appropriations bill includes language to strike \nsection 457 and restore the status quo, but the prospects for that \nchange will remain unclear until the conference committee has completed \nits work. This gives us an added incentive to pass the Iraqi Scientists \nImmigration Act as quickly as possible. I urge the House to take the \nbill up and pass it without further delay.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read \na third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements related thereto be printed in the Record, without \nfurther intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 205) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
