Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place in the \nRecord a speech delivered on November 11 by the majority leader, \nSenator Frist, to the Federalist Society regarding the treatment of \njudicial nominations in the 108th Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Majority Leader Bill Frist, MD, the Federalist \n                    Society 2004 National Convention\n\n       Wardman Park Marriott Hotel, Nov. 11.--Thank you all for \n     that warm welcome. You've succeeded at an almost impossible \n     task: you've put a doctor at ease in a room filled with a \n     thousand lawyers.\n       I take great pride in being a citizen legislator--someone \n     who sets aside a career for a period of time to serve in \n     public office.\n       Perhaps the most famous citizen legislator of modern times \n     was Jefferson Smith. Or, as he's better known: ``Mr. Smith'' \n     in the classic American film, ``Mr. Smith Goes to \n     Washington.''\n       One of my favorite scenes in that movie is when Mr. Smith \n     takes the oath of office. He raises his right hand. And the \n     Senate President reads the oath.\n       Mr. Smith pledges: ``I do.'' Then the Senate President says \n     with a less than subtle touch of sarcasm: ``Senator, you can \n     talk all you want to, now.''\n       United States Senators do talk all they want. And, with \n     only one Senator and the presiding officer in the chamber \n     during many debates, you often see them talking just to \n     themselves.\n       It makes me think that I'd be a lot better prepared as \n     Majority Leader with 20 years of experience, not as a heart \n     surgeon, but as a psychiatrist.\n       The right to talk--the right to unlimited debate--is a \n     tradition as old as the Senate itself.\n       It's unique to the institution. It shapes the character of \n     the institution.\n       It's why the United States Senate is the world's greatest \n     deliberative body. And, as James Madison wrote in Federalist \n     No. 63, ``History informs us of no long lived republic which \n     had not a senate.''\n       From time to time Senators use the right to unlimited \n     debate to stop a bill. A Senator takes the floor, is \n     recognized, starts talking, and doesn't stop talking.\n       This brings Senate business to a halt. And it's called a \n     filibuster.\n       Senators have used the filibuster throughout much of Senate \n     history. The first was launched in 1841 to block a banking \n     bill. Civil rights legislation was filibustered throughout \n     the 1950s and 60s.\n       The flamboyant Huey Long once took the floor and \n     filibustered for over 15 hours straight.\n       When Senator Long suggested that his colleagues--many of \n     whom were dozing off--be forced to listen to his speech, the \n     presiding officer replied, ``That would be unusual cruelty \n     under the Bill of Rights.''\n       The current Minority has not hesitated to use the \n     filibuster to bring Senate business to a halt in the current \n     Congress.\n       I have grave concerns, however, about one particular and \n     unprecedented use of the filibuster.\n       I know it concerns you, as well. And it should concern \n     every American who values our institutions and our \n     constitutional system of government.\n       Tonight I want to share with you my thoughts about the \n     filibuster of judicial nominees: it is radical; it is \n     dangerous; and it must be overcome.\n       The Senate must be allowed to confirm judges who fairly, \n     justly and independently interpret the law.\n       The current Minority has filibustered 10--and threatened to \n     filibuster another 6--nominees to federal appeals courts.\n       This is unprecedented in over 200 years of Senate history.\n       Never before has a Minority blocked a judicial nominee that \n     has majority support for an up-or-down vote on the Senate \n     floor.\n       Never.\n       Now the Minority says the filibuster is their only choice, \n     because the Majority controls both the White House and the \n     Senate. But that fails the test of history.\n       The same party controlled the White House and the Senate \n     for 70 percent of the 20th Century. No Minority filibustered \n     judicial nominees then.\n       Howard Baker's Republican Minority didn't filibuster \n     Democrat Jimmy Carter's nominees.\n       Robert Byrd's Democrat Minority didn't filibuster \n     Republican Ronald Reagan's nominees.\n       Bob Dole's Republican Minority didn't filibuster Democrat \n     Bill Clinton's nominees.\n       Now there's nothing specific in the formal Rules of the \n     Senate that restrained those Minorities from filibustering. \n     They simply used self-restraint.\n       Those Senators didn't filibuster, because it wasn't \n     something Senators did.\n       They understood the Senate's role in the appointments \n     process. And they heeded the intent and deferred to the \n     greater wisdom of the Framers of the Constitution.\n       Then came the 108th Congress.\n       Majority control of the Senate switched hands. And one \n     month later--in February 2003--the Minority radically broke \n     with tradition and precedent and launched the first-ever \n     filibuster of a judicial nominee who had majority support.\n       That nominee was Miguel Estrada--a member of this society.\n       You know first-hand that Miguel Estrada is an extraordinary \n     human being.\n       He's an inspiration to all Americans and all people who \n     aspire to one day live the American dream.\n       Miguel Estrada immigrated to the United States from \n     Honduras as a teenager. He spoke little English.\n       But with a strong heart and a brilliant mind, he worked his \n     way up to the highest levels of the legal profession.\n       He graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from \n     Columbia College in New York. He earned his J.D. from Harvard \n     Law School--where he served as editor of the Harvard Law \n     Review.\n       He clerked in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and for \n     Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. He worked as a Deputy \n     Chief U.S. Attorney and as an Assistant to the Solicitor \n     General of the United States.\n       Miguel Estrada would have been a superb addition to the \n     D.C. Circuit court. He's considered to be among the best of \n     the best legal minds in America.\n       The American Bar Association gave him their highest rating.\n       But after two years, more than 100 hours of debate, and a \n     record 7 attempts to move to an up-or-down vote, Miguel \n     Estrada withdrew his name from consideration.\n       A sad chapter in the Senate's history came to a close. But, \n     unfortunately, it was just the beginning.\n       The Minority extended its obstruction to Priscilla Owen, \n     Carolyn Kuhl, William Pryor,\n       Charles Pickering, Janice Rogers Brown, Bill Myers, Henry \n     Saad, Richard Griffin and David McKeague.\n       With the filibuster of Miguel Estrada, the subsequent \n     filibuster of 9 other judicial nominees, and the threat of 6 \n     more filibusters, the Minority has abandoned over 200 years \n     of Senate tradition and precedent.\n       This radical action presents a serious challenge to the \n     Senate as an institution and the principle so essential to \n     our general liberty--the separation of powers.\n       It would be easy to attribute the Minority's actions to \n     mere partisanship. But there is much more at work.\n       The Minority seeks nothing less than to realign the \n     relationship between our three branches of government.\n       The Minority has not been satisfied with simply voting \n     against the nominees--which is their right. They want to \n     require a supermajority of 60 votes for confirmation.\n       This would establish a new threshold that would defy the \n     clear intent of the Framers.\n       After much debate and compromise, the Framers concluded \n     that the President should have the power to appoint. And the \n     Senate should confirm or reject appointments by a simple \n     majority vote.\n       This is ``advice and consent.'' And it's an essential check \n     in the appointment process.\n       But the Minority's filibuster prevents the Senate from \n     giving ``advice and consent.'' They deny the Senate the right \n     to carry out its Constitutional duty.\n       This diminishes the role of the Senate as envisioned by the \n     Framers. It silences the American people and the voices of \n     their elected representatives.\n       And that is wrong.\n       This filibuster is nothing less than a formula for tyranny \n     by the minority.\n       The President would have to make appointments that not just \n     win a majority vote, but also pass the litmus tests of an \n     obstructionist minority.\n       If this is allowed to stand, the Minority will have \n     effectively seized from the President the power to appoint \n     judges.\n       Never mind the Constitution.\n       Never mind the separation of powers.\n       Never mind the most recent election--in which the American \n     people agreed that obstruction must end.\n\n[[Page S11849]]\n\n       The Senate cannot allow the filibuster of circuit court \n     nominees to continue. Nor can we allow the filibuster to \n     extend to potential Supreme Court nominees.\n       Senators must be able to debate the merits of nominees on \n     the floor and have the opportunity to publicly and \n     permanently record a yes or no vote.\n       We must leave this obstruction behind. And we can--as an \n     aberration in Senate history and a relic of a closely divided \n     body during a challenging time for America.\n       The American people have re-elected a President and \n     significantly expanded the Senate majority.\n       It would be wrong to allow a Minority to defy the will of a \n     clear and decisive Majority that supports a judicial nominee.\n       And it would be wrong to allow a Senate Minority to erode \n     the traditions of our body and undermine the separation of \n     powers.\n       To tolerate continued filibusters would be to accept \n     obstruction and harden the destructive precedents established \n     in the current Congress.\n       With its judicial filibusters, the Minority has taken \n     radical action. Now the damage must be undone.\n       American government must be allowed to function. And \n     America must be allowed to move forward.\n       Senate rules and procedures have been shaped and molded \n     throughout the body's history.\n       They're not set in stone. They can be changed to fit the \n     governing climate, to respond to emerging challenges, and to \n     restore vital constitutional traditions.\n       So when it became clear that the Minority was intent on \n     abusing the filibuster in this\n       Congress, we proposed to reform the rules.\n       In May 2003, Senator Zell Miller and I--joined by every \n     member of the Majority leadership--proposed a new way to end \n     debate and move to an up-or-down vote on nominations over a \n     reasonable period of time.\n       A first attempt would require 60 votes, the next 57, the \n     next 54, then 51, and finally we could end debate by a simple \n     majority.\n       The Frist-Miller resolution went to the Rules Committee. \n     Senator Lott chaired a hearing and the committee approved it \n     in June.\n       For the remainder of 2003 and all of this year, Frist-\n     Miller has sat on the Senate calendar--facing a certain \n     filibuster by those who want to continue to filibuster \n     judges.\n       The Frist-Miller reforms would be a civil, constructive and \n     cooperative way to end the filibuster of judicial nominees.\n       The Senate now faces a choice: either we accept a new and \n     destructive practice, or we act to restore constitutional \n     balance.\n       We are the stewards of rich Senate traditions and \n     constitutional principles that must be respected. We are the \n     leaders elected by the American people to move this country \n     forward.\n       As my colleague, Senator Feinstein said, ``A nominee is \n     entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them down. . . . If we \n     don't like them, we can vote against them. That is the honest \n     thing to do.''\n       I fervently believe in the principles of the American \n     Founding.\n       And I know you do too. Because I serve and work closely \n     with 4 members of this society: Mitch McConnell, John Kyl, \n     Jeff Sessions and Orrin Hatch.\n       Let me say this about these Senators: there are no more \n     passionate defenders of America's founding principles \n     anywhere in our government. They are true patriots.\n       They know that the principles enshrined in our Constitution \n     have guided a miraculous experiment that has matured into the \n     most stable form of government in human history.\n       And if we truly desire lasting solutions to the challenges \n     of the 21st century, those same principles must guide us \n     today and in the future.\n       The filibuster of judicial nominees is about Senate \n     tradition. It's about the separation of powers.

On Saturday, November 20, 2004, the American \ntaxpayers dodged a bullet. The Congress came close, much too close, to \npassing legislation that would have stripped every American of their \nright to privacy with regard to their tax returns.\n  The Senate averted this dangerous step, in part, because members of \nmy staff--and one staffer in particular--came in to work on Saturday \nand read through more than 3,646 pages of a bill and its explanatory \ntext.\n  As my colleagues know, we were called to the Chamber on Saturday to \ndebate and vote on the conference report on H.R. 4818, the Omnibus \nappropriations bill. This so-called ``catch-all spending'' package \nincluded nine different appropriations bills costing some $388 billion \nfor fiscal year 2005.\n  Many Members of Congress were familiar with some elements of the \nindividual appropriations bills, including funding levels for programs \nand projects important to our States. But few, if any, Members were \nable to carefully analyze the bill in its entirety. Because the bill \nwas delivered to each Senator and House Member at 6 a.m., we did not \nhave much time to review the massive bill before we were asked to vote \non it.\n  When the bill arrived I asked members of my staff to pore over the \nbill, each tasked with finding and reviewing sections of the bill where \nthey have policy expertise. It was during this effort to review the \nbill that one of my staff members discovered an egregious tax \nprovision. Steve Bailey, my tax counsel on the Senate Budget Committee, \nreading the Transportation-Treasury section of the bill, spotted \nsection 222 and immediately realized it was a huge problem. The \nparagraph read:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing the \n     disclosure of income tax returns or return information, upon \n     written request of the Chairman of the House or Senate \n     Committee on Appropriations, the Commissioner of the Internal \n     Revenue Service shall hereafter allow agents designated by \n     such Chairman access to Internal Revenue Service facilities \n     and any tax returns or return information contained therein.\n\n  Mr. Bailey, who has worked on tax issues for more than 20 years, knew \nthat if enacted, the provision would endanger the right and expectation \nof every American. This provision held the very real promise that the \nprivacy of their tax returns could be compromised.\n  Thanks to Mr. Bailey's close reading of the bill and his quick \nrecognition of the negative implications of that 60-word paragraph, I \nwas able to bring the paragraph's existence to the attention of my \ncolleagues. Fortunately, the Senate then firmly and unanimously \nrejected the paragraph and demanded that the House of Representatives \nremove the offending language before the bill could be sent to the \nPresident's desk for his signature.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks, I would like to have printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks an editorial from today's New \nYork Times, ``Snookering the Taxpayers.'' This editorial mentions ``a \nsharp-eyed Democratic staff member [who] spotted the terse paragraph \nsitting like a toxic clam in the muck of the omnibus spending bill. . . \n.'' This editorial concludes with a clear understatement, ``Taxpayers \ncan only hope someone keeps reading.''\n  Well, I can assure my constituents in North Dakota that my staff and \nI will keep on reading. But I also hope this experience will lead to a \nnew method of doing business next year. The Senate should never again \ntolerate a process by which we are given a 3,600-page bill and are then \nasked to vote upon that bill several hours later. As my colleague from \nArizona, Senator John McCain, has noted, this process is broken and it \nmust change. I will be working with my colleagues to accomplish that \ngoal next year.\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to recognize and thank Mr. Steve \nBailey for his outstanding work and service to me and to the Senate. \nThis past week, his hard work made a big difference to millions of \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  The editorial follows.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 24, 2004]\n\n                        Snookering the Taxpayers\n\n       It is called a snooker clause in legislative parlance--a \n     last-minute insert into a dense and hurried midnight bill \n     that, if ever disclosed after passage, always leaves \n     legislators shocked, shocked at how such an undemocratic bit \n     of mischief ever came to be. ``No earthly idea how that got \n     in there,'' said Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader, \n     after the impenetrable, 14-inch-thick omnibus budget bill \n     turned out to have a provision giving Congressional chairmen \n     and staff members entree to Americans' tax returns without \n     regard to privacy protections.\n       This has been a sacrosanct area ever since the Watergate \n     scandals. Severe civil and criminal penalties were enacted \n     after the Nixon administration's rifling of private tax \n     returns to build the ``enemies list'' aimed at government \n     harassment.\n\n[[Page S11850]]\n\n       A sharp-eyed Democratic staff member spotted the terse \n     paragraph sitting like a toxic clam in the muck of the \n     omnibus spending bill, a 3,000-page disgrace in its own right \n     that capped months of Capitol procrastination. Once the \n     provision was found, everyone felt compelled to denounce it. \n     Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, growled that \n     it summoned ``the dark days in our history when taxpayer \n     information was used against political enemies.'' The Senate \n     declared the clause void, forcing G.O.P. leaders in the \n     House, where the gambit originated, to sheepishly follow \n     suit. House leaders insisted there was never an intent to pry \n     into taxpayers' lives. The goal, they said, was simply to \n     establish better oversight of the tax collection bureaucracy. \n     Really? Then how come anyone bothering to read the bill (and \n     that did not include many members of Congress) could see what \n     an outrageous license it provided for the appropriations \n     committees to look into tax offices ``and any tax returns or \n     return information contained therein.''\n       Embarrassed solons had to admit they had no idea what other \n     dangerous items might be in the bill. Taxpayers can only hope \n     someone keeps reading.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/24/senate-section/article/S11850-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11850-S11851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IDEA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues, \nChairman Gregg and Senator Kennedy, as well as Chairman Boehner and \nRepresentative Miller, for conducting a truly bipartisan conference. \nWhen the legislative process is working properly, we have a fair \nnegotiation, and more often than not, that produces a better bill. Not \na bill that gives each of us everything we wanted, but a fair result \ngiven the two bills that we are charged with reconciling. And that is \nwhat we have here.\n  Last week, Washington Post's internet site ran a cartoon by Ted Rall \nthat was one of the most egregious things I have ever seen. I don't \nknow if many of you saw it, but it showed a student in a wheelchair \nwith crossed eyes and drool coming from his mouth. He had joined a \nclass of students without disabilities and here is what one of the \npanels of the cartoon read: ``The special needs kids make people \nuncomfortable and slow the pace of learning.'' The cartoon showed the \nclass changing from higher level math to simple addition because of the \nspecial education student.\n  The cartoon was supposed to be some kind of analogy to the United \nStates, but it was very hard to understand the point. What was crystal \nclear, however, was the author's bigotry and stereotyping of children \nwith disabilities. I understand that the Post will no longer run \ncartoons by Mr. Rall because cartoons like this are not funny. They are \nhurtful and serve as a stark reminder of why we are here and why IDEA \nis such important civil rights legislation.\n  I was here in Congress in 1975, as were some of my Senate colleagues, \nwhen IDEA was enacted. It is important to remember why we passed this \nlegislation in the first place. We passed it because bigotry and \ndiscrimination were keeping a million children with disabilities \ncompletely out of school. Those children were locked out of an \neducation and denied the bright future that comes with an education. \nIDEA opened the doors of opportunity for those children.\n  I have participated in many subsequent revisions to the law over the \npast 29 years, and I am supporting this reauthorization because we \ncontinue our proud tradition of ensuring that children with \ndisabilities have the right to a free, appropriate public education \n(FAPE). In addition, we improve the enforcement of that right.\n  Over the years, I have been involved in the debate about disciplining \nstudents with disabilities--and this was a major issue for the \nconferees. I know parents were very concerned about changes to this \nsection of the law. I appreciate and understand those concerns because \nI have shared them.\n  While this reauthorization streamlines the discipline provisions, it \ncontinues several key principles. We will continue to consider the \nimpact of the disability on what the child is doing, and we will not \npunish children for behavior that is related to their disability. It is \nalso important that we continue to require that children receive \neducational services when they are being disciplined so they do not \nfall further behind. We also continue to emphasize that an assessment \nand services must be provided to children who have more serious \nbehaviors so we can prevent future discipline problems.\n  I believe that discipline will become less and less of an issue over \ntime as schools implement positive behavior supports more widely. \nSection 614(d)(3)(B), entitled Consideration of Special Factors, was \nadded in 1997 to provide special emphasis on certain related services, \nmodifications, and auxiliary aides which were not being considered by \nIEP teams and therefore not provided. The Senate bill modified \nsubsection 614(d)(3)(B)(i) to state that behavioral supports must be \nprovided when the child's behavior impeded his/her education or that of \nothers. In conference, current law was reinstated in order to make the \nsubsection consistent with the other special consideration subsections.\n  By instructing the IEP team to consider the specified services, it \ngoes without saying that the services must be provided if the IEP team \nfinds that the services will assist the child in benefiting from his/\nher educational program. In the case of behavioral interventions, the \nsection sets forth the circumstances when the services would be \nrequired.\n  The regulations to IDEA specify that ``if, in considering the special \nfactors . . . the IEP team determines that a child needs a particular \ndevice or service (including an intervention, accommodation, or other \nprogram modification) in order for the child to receive FAPE, the IEP \nteam must include a statement to that effect in the child's IEP.'' 34 \nC.F.R. Sec. 346(c). And IEP services must be provided to the student. \nSee Office of Special Education Programs Letter to Osterhout, 35 IDELR \n9 (2000).\n  There has been widespread noncompliance with this requirement. \nHowever with reauthorization's increased emphasis on monitoring and \nenforcement, we expect this implementation will improve. Children whose \nbehavior is impeding them or others from learning should get the \npositive behavioral supports they need when the IEP team considers this \nissue and finds that the services are part of FAPE for that child.\n  In addition, we allow schools to use up to 15 percent of their funds \nto address behavior issues for children who have not been identified as \nspecial education students. Also, Senator Clinton has worked to include \nauthorization for a program that would provide funding for systemic \npositive behavioral supports in schools.\n  Research by Dr. George Sugai and others indicates that the \nimplementation of positive behavioral supports can have a dramatic \nimpact on disciplinary problems. Dr. Sugai testified in 2002 before the \nHealth, Education, and Labor Committee that by shifting to schoolwide \npositive behavioral supports, an urban elementary school decreased its \noffice referrals from 600 to 100. It also decreased in 1 year its days \nof suspension from 80 to 35. Schools can save administrators' time and \nresources and cut down on discipline problems by implementing these \nprograms.\n  Another area that generated discussion in this reauthorization is \nlitigation and attorneys fees. However, the facts show that there is \nvery little litigation under IDEA. GAO examined the data and concluded \nthat the use of ``formal dispute resolution mechanisms has been \ngenerally low relative to the number of children with disabilities,'' \naccording to a 2003 report titled, ``Special Education: Numbers of \nFormal Disputes are Low and States are Using Mediation and Other \nStrategies to Resolve Conflicts.''\n\n  My own State of Iowa follows the general trend of very low hearings \nand court cases. A graduate student in Iowa did a thorough analysis of \ndue process hearings in Iowa from 1989-2001. Since the amendments in \n1997, there were three hearings in 1998; three also in 1999 and four \nhearings in 2000. The Department of Education informs me that this \ntrend continues, with only three hearings in each of the past 2 years. \nAnd there are thousands of children in special education in the State \nof Iowa.\n  Given the fact that litigation is generally not a problem in IDEA, in \nthis reauthorization we merely include a standard that is used in other \ncivil rights contexts--it is generally referred to by the case, \nChristiansburg Garment Company vs. Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, 98 S.Ct. 694 (1978). Both prongs of the Christiansburg\n\n[[Page S11851]]\n\nstandard (filing or pursuing litigation that is groundless or for bad \nfaith/improper purpose) adopted today are very high standards, and \nprevailing defendants are rarely able to meet them. They are designed \nfor only the most egregious cases.\n  Also, in deciding cases under this standard, courts have considered \nthe party's ability to pay. This is important because Congress does not \nintend to impose a harsh financial penalty on parents who are merely \ntrying to help their child get needed services and supports. So in \napplying this standard and deciding whether to grant defendants fees, \nthe court must also consider the ability of the parents to pay.\n  A school district would be foolhardy to try to use these provisions \nin any but the most egregious cases. Not only would the school be \nwasting its own resources if it did not prevail, but it would be liable \nfor the parents' fees defending the action.\n  Unlike parents who are entitled to attorney fees if they win the \ncase, the fact that a LEA ultimately prevailed is not grounds for \nassessing fees against a parent or parent's attorney. As the Supreme \nCourt concluded in Christiansburg, courts should not engage in ``post \nhoc reasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff did not \nultimately prevail, his action must have been unreasonable or without \nfoundation. This kind of hindsight logic could discourage all but the \nmost airtight claims, for seldom can a prospective plaintiff be sure of \nultimate success.''\n  As GAO found, there has been a low incidence of litigation under \nIDEA. The cases that are filed are generally pursued because parents \nhave no other choice. Congress does not intend to discourage these \nparents from enforcing their child's right to a free, appropriate, \npublic education. This is merely to address the most egregious type of \nbehavior in very rare circumstances where it might arise.\n  In this reauthorization, we also include a 2-year statute of \nlimitations on claims. However, it should be noted that this limitation \nis not designed to have any impact on the ability of a child to receive \ncompensatory damages for the entire period in which he or she has been \ndeprived of services. The statute of limitations goes only to the \nfiling of the complaint, not the crafting of remedy. This is important \nbecause it is only fair that if a school district repeatedly failed to \nprovide services to a child, they should be required to provide \ncompensatory services to rectify this problem and help the child \nachieve despite the school's failings.\n  Therefore, compensatory education must cover the entire period and \nmust belatedly provide all education and related services previously \ndenied and needed to make the child whole. Children whose parents can't \nafford to pay for special education and related services when school \ndistricts fail to provide FAPE should be treated the same as children \nwhose parents can. Children whose parents have the funds can be fully \nreimbursed under the Supreme Courts decisions in Burlington and \nFlorence County, subject to certain equitable considerations, and \nchildren whose parents lack the funds should not be treated \ndifferently.\n  I also want to discuss the monitoring and enforcement sections of \nthis bill. I want to thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this \nissue. Again, GAO has issued a report that has informed our \ndeliberations around this issue. They noted that the Department of \nEducation found violations of IDEA in 30 of the 31 States monitored. In \naddition, GAO found that the majority of these violations were for \nfailure to provide actual services to children. That report, issued \nthis year, is titled, ``Special Education: Improved Timeliness and \nBetter Use of Enforcement Actions Could Strengthen Education's \nMonitoring System.''\n  When we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, we said that our \nfour national goals for people with disabilities were equality of \nopportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-\nsufficiency. But children with disabilities are never going to meet any \nof those goals if they don't get the tools they need when they are \nyoung. So if we truly want equal opportunity for individuals with \ndisabilities, it has to start with IDEA, and with our youth, who are \nour future. The law must be enforced so they receive the services and \nsupports they need to get a quality education and a brighter future.\n  As part of the enforcement of this law, States must ensure that local \neducation agencies are meeting their targets to provide a free, \nappropriate public education. If they fail to do so, the State must \ntake action, including prohibiting the flexible use of any of the local \neducation agency's resources.\n  In addition to monitoring and enforcement, there are other \nimprovements in this bill. I will mention one area that is near and \ndear to my heart because of my brother Frank, who, as many of you know, \nwas deaf. In this bill, we add interpreter services to the list of \nrelated services, a change that is long overdue and we continue to \nrequire the Department of Education to fund captioning so deaf and \nhard-of-hearing individuals will have equal access to the media.\n  While I support the bill, I must point out, however, that I am deeply \ndisappointed that this bill does not include mandatory full funding of \nIDEA. We fought for this on the floor of the Senate. Even though a \nmajority of the Senate agreed, we did not have the needed 60 votes, and \nit did not become part of the Senate bill. I continue to believe that \nmandatory funding is required to give schools the resources they need \nto ensure that all children get a quality education.\n  This bill does, however, have specific authorized levels that will \nget us to full funding in 7 years. If we fail to meet these levels, I \nwill continue to argue that Congress should provide mandatory funding \nto ensure we meet the commitment we made almost 30 years ago.\n  This is a bill about children. We all tell our children to keep their \npromises, to fulfill any commitments they make. Yet Congress has not \nkept its word to these children and their families. We have not \nprovided the resources we said we would. We must fully fund IDEA. This \nis important to children, to schools, and to our communities. And it is \nthe right thing to do.\n  I want to thank the staff who worked so hard on this bill. On my \nstaff, I would like to thank Mary Giliberti, Julie Carter, Erik Fatemi, \nand Justin Chappell. I especially thank Senator Kennedy's staff for \ntheir dedication to children with disabilities, including Connie \nGarner, Kent Mitchell, Michael Dannenberg, Roberto Rodriguez, and \nJeremy Buzzell.\n  I would also like to thank Denzel McGuire, Annie White, Bill Lucia, \nand Courtney Brown on Senator Gregg's staff for their efforts to ensure \na bipartisan process.\n  Also, thanks go to Sally Lovejoy and David Cleary with Congressman \nBoehner; Alex Nock with Congressman Miller; Michael Yudin with Senator \nBingaman; Carmel Martin, formerly with Senator Bingaman's staff; Jamie \nFasteau, with Senator Murray's; Bethany Little, formerly with Senator \nMurray's staff; Catherine Brown, with Senator Clinton; Justin King with \nSenator Jeffords; Rebecca Litt, with Senator Mikulski; Elyse Wasch, \nwith Senator Reed; Maryellen McGuire and Jim Fenton with Senator Dodd; \nJoan Huffer, with Senator Daschle; Bethany Dickerson with the \nDemocratic Policy Committee; and Erica Buehrens, with Senator Edwards.\n  Mr. President, IDEA is fundamentally a civil rights statute for \nchildren with disabilities. I have worked with my colleagues on this \nconference to ensure that core rights are protected and \nenforced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/24/senate-section/article/S11851-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11851-S11852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NAMING OF JAMES R. BROWNING FEDERAL COURTHOUSE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about \nlegislation to rename the U.S. Courthouse in San Francisco after Judge \nJames R. Browning. This legislation cleared Congress over the weekend. \nIt is a long overdue honor for one of the Nation's finest public \nservants.\n  I would like to thank my Senate friends and colleagues for their hard \nwork and support, particularly Senator Boxer, who sponsored the \nBrowning courthouse naming legislation. I would also like to recognize \nand thank Senator Hatch and Senator Stevens. Their efforts were crucial \nin moving this legislation across the finish line in the 109th \nCongress.\n  Let me tell you about Judge James R. Browning. First, he is a great \nman\n\n[[Page S11852]]\n\nand a fine judge who has committed the better part of his life to \npromoting and improving the administration of justice. Montana is proud \nto call him one of their own, and I am proud to call him my friend.\n  Judge Browning was born in Great Falls, MT, just like another famous \nMontana son--former Senate Majority Leader and Ambassador to Japan, \nMike Mansfield. Judge Browning grew up in the small town of Belt, MT, \nand married his high-school sweetheart Marie Rose from Belfry, MT. \nJudge Browning received his law degree from the University of Montana \nin 1941, graduating at the top of his class. He worked for the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice before joining the U.S. \nArmy where he served in Military Intelligence for 3 years, attaining \nthe rank of first lieutenant and winning the Bronze Star.\n  After the war, he returned to the Justice Department, eventually \nrising through the ranks to become Executive Assistant to the Attorney \nGeneral. In 1953, he entered private practice, leaving after 5 years to \nserve as the Clerk of the U.S. Supreme Court at the request of Chief \nJustice Earl Warren. In that position, he held the Bible during \nPresident John F. Kennedy's inauguration.\n  In 1961, President Kennedy named James Browning to be a Circuit Judge \nof the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Judge Browning has \nserved on that court with distinction and honor for more than 40 years, \nlonger than any other judge in Ninth Circuit history. He was still \nworking 6 days a week as an active federal judge when he turned 80 in \n1998, and he did not take senior status until November of 2000. He has \nparticipated in nearly 1000 published appellate decisions.\n  Judge Browning was named chief judge of the Ninth Circuit in 1976. \nDuring his 12-year tenure as the chief judge, the Ninth Circuit \nexpanded from 23 to 28 judges, eliminated its case backlog entirely, \nand reduced by half the time needed to decide appeals. He worked \ntirelessly to improve the administration of the courts, dramatically \nincreasing the efficiency and productivity of the Ninth Circuit, all \nthe while emphasizing collegiality and civility among his colleagues on \nthe Ninth Circuit. Judge Browning's leadership and innovation sparked \nsimilar administrative reforms throughout the country.\n  Judge Browning is held in the highest regard by both bench and bar \nacross California, in Montana, and within the Ninth Circuit legal \ncommunity. His rich and distinguished career spans more than six \ndecades--most of it spent in public service. We have finally recognized \nhis long service to his country and the Ninth Circuit by renaming the \nU.S. Courthouse in San Francisco in his honor. It is a long way from \nBelt, MT, but Judge Browning never forgot his roots, and now neither \nwill the Ninth Circuit that he helped to build.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/24/senate-section/article/S11852-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11852-S11854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT AND COPYRIGHT ACT OF 2004\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, would the chairman yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to yield for a question from the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. As the chairman knows, he and I and our other co-sponsors \nhave worked throughout this Congress on the provisions of the Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act of 2004 that we have introduced today. \nI just want to confirm what I believe to be our mutual understanding \nabout the effect of certain provisions of the Family Movie Act. Title \nII of the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2004 that we \nintroduced today modifies slightly the Family Movie Act provisions of \nH.R. 4077 as passed by the House of Representatives. That bill created \na new exemption in section 110(11) of the Copyright Act for skipping \nand muting audio and video content in motion pictures during \nperformances that take place in the course of a private viewing in a \nhousehold from an authorized copy of the motion picture. The House-\npassed version specifically excluded from the scope of the new \ncopyright exemption computer programs or technologies that make \nchanges, deletions, or additions to commercial advertisements or to \nnetwork or station promotional announcements that would otherwise be \ndisplayed before, during, or after the performance of the motion \npicture.\n  My understanding is that this provision reflected a ``belt and \nsuspenders'' approach that was adopted to quiet the concerns of some \nMembers in the House who were concerned that a court might misread the \nstatute to apply to ``ad-skipping'' cases. Some Senators, however, \nexpressed concern that the inclusion of such explicit language could \ncreate unwanted inferences as to the ``ad-skipping'' issues at the \nheart of the recent litigation. Those issues remain unsettled, and it \nwas never the intent of this legislation to resolve or affect those \nissues. In the meantime, the Copyright Office has confirmed that such a \nprovision is unnecessary to achieve the intent of the bill, which is to \navoid application of this new exemption in potential future cases \ninvolving ``ad-skipping'' devices; therefore, the Senate amendment we \noffer removes the unnecessary exclusionary language.\n  Would the chairman confirm for the Senators present his understanding \nof the intent and effect, or perhaps stated more appropriately, the \nlack of any effect, of the Senate amendment on the scope of this bill?\n  Mr. HATCH. My cosponsor, Senator Cornyn, raises an important point. \nWhile we removed the ``ad-skipping'' language from the statute to avoid \nthis unnecessary controversy, you are absolutely correct that this does \nnot in any way change the scope of the bill. The bill protects the \n``making imperceptible . . . limited portions of audio or video content \nof a motion picture . . .'' An advertisement, under the Copyright Act, \nis itself a ``motion picture,'' and thus a product or service that \nenables the skipping of an entire advertisement, in any media, would be \nbeyond the scope of the exemption. Moreover, the phrase ``limited \nportions'' is intended to refer to portions that are both \nquantitatively and qualitatively insubstantial in relation to the work \nas a whole. Where any substantial part of a complete work, such as a \ncommercial advertisement, is made imperceptible, the new section \n110(11) exemption would not apply.\n  The limited scope of this exemption does not, however, imply or show \nthat such a product would be infringing. This legislation does not in \nany way deal with that issue. It means simply that such a product is \nnot immunized from liability by this exemption.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the chairman. I am pleased that we share a common \nunderstanding. If the chairman would yield for one more question about \nthe Family Movie Act?\n  Mr. HATCH. Certainly.\n  Mr. CORNYN. This bill also differs from the House-passed version \nbecause it adds two ``savings clauses.'' As I understand it, the \n``copyright'' savings clause makes clear that there should be no \n``spillover effect'' from the passage of this law: that is, nothing \nshall be construed to have any effect on rights, defenses, or \nlimitations on rights granted under title 17, other than those \nexplicitly provided for in the new section 110(11) exemption. The \nsecond, relating to trademark, clarifies that no inference can be drawn \nthat a person or company who fails to qualify for the exemption from \ntrademark infringement found in this provision is therefore liable for \ntrademark infringement. Is that the chairman's understanding as well?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes it is. Let me ask that a copy of the section-by-\nsection analysis of the Family Movie Act as amended by the Senate be \nincluded in the Record. This section-by-section analysis contains a \nmore complete analysis of the bill as proposed today in the Senate, \nincluding the limited changes made by the bill Senators Leahy, Cornyn, \nBiden, and I offer today.\n  The analysis follows.\n\n Section-by-Section Analysis of the Family Movie Act of 2004, Amended \n                        and Passed by the Senate\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       Title II of the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of \n     2004 incorporates the House-passed provision of the Family \n     Movie Act of 2004, with limited changes as reflected in this \n     section-by-section analysis. As discussed herein, these \n     changes are not intended to and do not affect the scope, \n     effect or application of the bill.\n       The purpose of the Family Movie Act is to empower private \n     individuals to use technology to skip and mute material that \n     they find objectionable in movies, without impacting \n     established doctrines of copyright or\n\n[[Page S11853]]\n\n     trademark law or those whose business models depend upon \n     advertising. This amendment to the law should be narrowly \n     construed to effect its intended purpose only. The sponsors \n     of the legislation have been careful to tailor narrowly the \n     legislation to clearly allow specific, consumer-directed \n     activity and not to open or decide collateral issues or to \n     affect any other potential or actual disputes in the law.\n       The bill as proposed in the Senate makes clear that, under \n     certain conditions, ``making imperceptible'' of limited \n     portions of audio or video content of a motion picture--that \n     is, skipping and muting limited portions of movies without \n     adding any content--as well as the creation or provision of a \n     computer program or other technology that enables such making \n     imperceptible, does not violate existing copyright or \n     trademark laws. That is true whether the movie is on \n     prerecorded media, like a DVD, or is transmitted to the home, \n     as through pay-per-view and ``video-on-demand'' services.\n     Subsection (a): Short Title\n       Subsection (a) sets forth the short title of the bill as \n     the Family Movie Act of 2004.\n     Subsection (b): Exemption From Copyright and Trademark \n         Infringement for Skipping of Audio or Video Content of \n         Motion Pictures\n       Subsection (b) is the Family Movie Act's core provision and \n     creates a new exemption at section 110(11) of the Copyright \n     Act for the ``making imperceptible'' of limited portions of \n     audio or video content of a motion picture during a \n     performance in a private household. This new exemption sets \n     forth a number of conditions to ensure that it achieves its \n     intended effect while remaining carefully circumscribed and \n     avoiding any unintended consequences. The conditions that \n     allow an exemption, which are discussed in more detail below, \n     consist of the following:\n       The making imperceptible must be ``by or at the direction \n     of a member of a private household.'' This legislation \n     contemplates that any altered performances of the motion \n     picture would be made either directly by the viewer or at the \n     direction of a viewer where the viewer is exercising \n     substantial choice over the types of content they choose \n     to skip or mute.\n       The making imperceptible must occur ``during a performance \n     in or transmitted to the household for private home \n     viewing.'' Thus, this provision does not exempt an \n     unauthorized ``public performance'' of an altered version.\n       The making imperceptible must be ``from an authorized copy \n     of a motion picture.'' Thus, skipping and muting from an \n     unauthorized or ``bootleg'' copy of a motion picture would \n     not be exempt.\n       No ``fixed copy'' of the altered version of the motion \n     picture may be created by the computer program or other \n     technology that makes imperceptible portions of the audio or \n     video content of the motion picture. This provision makes \n     clear that services or technologies that make a fixed copy of \n     the altered version are not afforded the benefit of this \n     exemption.\n       The ``making imperceptible'' of limited portions of a \n     motion picture does not include the addition of audio or \n     video content over or in place of other content, such as \n     placing a modified image of a person, a product, or an \n     advertisement in place of another, or adding content of any \n     kind.\n       These limitations, and other operative provisions of this \n     new section 110(11) exemption, merit further elaboration as \n     to their purposes and effects.\n       The bill makes clear that the ``making imperceptible'' of \n     limited portions of audio or video content of a motion \n     picture must be done by or at the direction of a member of a \n     private household. While this limitation does not require \n     that the individual member of the private household exercise \n     ultimate decision-making over each and every scene or element \n     of dialog in the motion picture that is to be made \n     imperceptible, it does require that the making imperceptible \n     be made at the direction of that individual in response to \n     the individualized preferences expressed by that individual. \n     The test of ``at the direction of an individual'' would be \n     satisfied when an individual selects preferences from among \n     options that are offered by the technology.\n       An example is the C1earPlay model. C1earPlay provides so-\n     called ``filter files'' that allow a viewer to express his or \n     her preferences in a number of different categories, \n     including language, violence, drug content, sexual content, \n     and several others. The version of the movie that the viewer \n     sees depends upon the preferences expressed by that viewer. \n     Such a model would fall under the liability limitation of the \n     Family Movie Act.\n       This limitation, however, would not allow a program \n     distributor, such as a provider of video-on-demand services, \n     a cable or satellite channel, or a broadcaster, to make \n     imperceptible limited portions of a movie in order to provide \n     an altered version of that movie to all of its customers, \n     which could violate a number of the copyright owner's \n     exclusive rights, or to make a determination of scenes to be \n     skipped or dialog to be muted and to offer to its viewers no \n     more of a choice than to view an original or an altered \n     version of that film. Some element of individualized \n     preferences and control must be present such that the \n     viewer exercises substantial choice over the types of \n     content they choose to skip or mute.\n       It is also important to emphasize that the new section \n     110(11) exemption is targeted narrowly and specifically at \n     the act of ``making imperceptible'' limited portions of audio \n     or video content of a motion picture during a performance \n     that occurs in, or that is transmitted to, a private \n     household for private home viewing. This section would not \n     exempt from liability an otherwise infringing performance, or \n     a transmission of a performance, during which limited \n     portions of audio or video content of the motion picture are \n     made imperceptible. In other words, where a performance in a \n     household or a transmission of a performance to a household \n     is done lawfully, the making imperceptible limited portions \n     of audio or video content of the motion picture during that \n     performance, consistent with the requirements of this new \n     section, will not result in infringement liability. \n     Similarly, an infringing performance in a household, or an \n     infringing transmission of a performance to a household, are \n     not rendered non-infringing by section 110(11) by virtue of \n     the fact that limited portions of audio or video content of \n     the motion picture being performed are made imperceptible \n     during such performance or transmission in a manner \n     consistent with that section.\n       The bill also provides additional guidance, if not an exact \n     definition, of what the term ``making imperceptible'' means. \n     The bill provides specifically that the term ``making \n     imperceptible'' does not include the addition of audio or \n     video content that is performed or displayed over or in place \n     of existing content in a motion picture. This is intended to \n     make clear in the text of the statute what has been expressed \n     throughout the consideration of this legislation, which is \n     that the Family Movie Act does not enable the addition of \n     content of any kind, including the making imperceptible of \n     audio or video content by replacing it or by superimposing \n     other content over it. In other words, for purposes of \n     section 110(11), ``making imperceptible'' refers solely to \n     skipping scenes and portions of scenes or muting audio \n     content from the original, commercially available version of \n     the motion picture. No other modifications of the content are \n     addressed or immunized by this legislation.\n       The House sponsor of this legislation noted in his \n     explanation of his bill, and the Senate is also aware, that \n     some copy protection technologies rely on matter placed into \n     the audio or video signal. The phrase ``limited portions of \n     audio or video content of a motion picture'' means what it \n     would naturally seem to mean (i.e., the actual content of the \n     motion picture) and does not refer to any component of a copy \n     protection scheme or technology. This provision does not \n     allow the skipping of technologies or other copy-protection-\n     related matter for the purpose of defeating copy protection. \n     Rather, it is expected that skipping and muting of content in \n     the actual motion picture will be skipped or muted at the \n     direction of the viewer based on that viewer's desire to \n     avoid seeing or hearing the action or sound in the motion \n     picture. Skipping or muting done for the purpose of or having \n     the effect of avoiding copy protection technologies would be \n     an abuse of the safe harbor outlined in this legislation and \n     may violate section 1201 of title 17.\n       Violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and \n     particularly its anti-circumvention provisions, is not \n     necessary to enable technology of the kind contemplated under \n     the Family Movie Act. Although the amendment to section 110 \n     provides that it is not an infringement of copyright to \n     engage in the conduct that is the subject of the Family Movie \n     Act, the Act does not provide any exemption from the anti-\n     circumvention provisions of section 1201 of title 17, or from \n     any other provision of chapter 12 of title 17. It would not \n     be a defense to a claim of violation of section 1201 that the \n     circumvention is for the purpose of engaging in the conduct \n     covered by this new exemption in section 110(11), just as it \n     is not a defense under section 1201 that the circumvention is \n     for the purpose of engaging in any other non-infringing \n     conduct.\n       There are a number of companies currently providing the \n     type of products and services covered by this Act. The Family \n     Movie Act is intended to facilitate the offering of such \n     products and services, and it certainly creates no impediment \n     to the technology employed by those companies. Indeed, it is \n     important to underscore the fact that the support for such \n     technology and consumer offerings that is reflected in this \n     legislation is driven in some measure by the desire for \n     copyright law to be respected and to ensure that technology \n     is deployed in a way that supports the continued creation and \n     protection of entertainment and information products that \n     rely on copyright protection. This legislation reflects the \n     firm expectation that those rights and the interests of \n     viewers in their homes can work together in the context \n     defined in this bill. Any suggestion that support for the \n     exercise of viewer choice in modifying their viewing \n     experience of copyrighted works requires violation of either \n     the copyright in the work or of the copy protection schemes \n     that provide protection for such work should be rejected as \n     counter to legislative intent or technological necessity.\n       The House-passed bill included an explicit exclusion to the \n     new section 110(11) exemption in cases involving the making \n     imperceptible of commercial advertisements or network or \n     station promotional announcements. This provision was added \n     on the House floor to respond to concerns expressed by \n     Members during the House Judiciary Committee markup that the \n     bill might be\n\n[[Page S11854]]\n\n     read somehow to exempt from copyright infringement liability \n     devices that allow for skipping of advertisements in the \n     playback of recorded television (so called ``ad-skipping'' \n     devices). Such a reading is not consistent with the language \n     of the bill or its intent.\n       The phrase ``limited portions of audio or video content of \n     a motion picture'' applies only to the skipping and muting of \n     scenes or dialog that are part of the motion picture itself, \n     and not to the skipping of commercial advertisements, which \n     are themselves considered motions pictures under the \n     Copyright Act. It also should be noted that the phrase \n     ``limited portions'' is intended to refer to portions that \n     are both quantitatively and qualitatively insubstantial in \n     relation to the work as a whole. Where any substantial part \n     of a complete work (including a commercial advertisement) is \n     made imperceptible, the section 110(11) exemption would not \n     apply.\n       The House-passed bill adopted a ``belt and suspenders'' \n     approach to this question by adding exclusionary language in \n     the statute itself. Ultimately that provision raised concerns \n     in the Senate that such exclusionary language would result in \n     an inference that the bill somehow expresses an opinion, or \n     even decides, the unresolved legal questions underlying \n     recent litigation related to these so-called ``ad-\n     skipping'' devices. In the meantime, the Copyright Office \n     also made clear that such exclusionary language is not \n     necessary. In other words, the exclusionary language \n     created unnecessary controversy without adding any needed \n     clarity to the statute.\n       Thus, the Senate amendment omits the exclusionary language \n     while leaving the scope and application of the bill exactly \n     as it was when it passed the House. The legislation does not \n     provide a defense in cases involving so-called ``ad-\n     skipping'' devices, and it also does not affect the legal \n     issues underlying such litigation, one way or another. \n     Consistent with the intent of the legislation to fix a narrow \n     and specific copyright issue, this bill seeks very clearly to \n     avoid unnecessarily interfering with current business models, \n     especially with respect to advertising, promotional \n     announcements, and the like. Simply put, the bill as amended \n     in the Senate is narrowly targeted to the use of technologies \n     and services that filter out content in movies that a viewer \n     finds objectionable, and it in no way relates to or affects \n     the legality of so-called ``ad-skipping'' technologies.\n       There are a variety of services currently in litigation \n     that distribute actual copies of altered movies. This type of \n     activity is not covered by the section 110(11) exemption \n     created by the Family Movie Act. There is a basic distinction \n     between a viewer choosing to alter what is visible or audible \n     when viewing a film, the focus of this legislation, and a \n     separate entity choosing to create and distribute a single, \n     altered version to members of the public. The section 110(11) \n     exemption only applies to viewer directed changes to the \n     viewing experience, and not the making or distribution of \n     actual altered copies of the motion picture.\n       Related to this point, during consideration of this \n     legislation in the House there were conflicting expert \n     opinions on whether fixation is required to infringe the \n     derivative work right under the Copyright Act, as well as \n     whether evidence of Congressional intent in enacting the 1976 \n     Copyright Act supports the notion that fixation should not be \n     a prerequisite for the preparation of an infringing \n     derivative work. This legislation should not be construed to \n     be predicated on or to take a position on whether fixation is \n     necessary to violate the derivative work right, or whether \n     the conduct that is immunized by this legislation would be \n     infringing in the absence of this legislation.\n       Subsection (b) also provides a savings clause to make clear \n     that the newly-created copyright exemption is not to be \n     construed to have any effect on rights, defenses, or \n     limitations on rights granted under title 17, other than \n     those explicitly provided for in the new section 110(11) \n     exemption.\n     Subsection (c): Exemption From Trademark Infringement\n       Subsection (c) provides for a limited exemption from \n     trademark infringement for those engaged in the conduct \n     described in the new section 110(11) of the Copyright Act.\n       In short, this subsection makes clear that a person \n     engaging in the conduct described in section 110(11)--the \n     ``making imperceptible'' of portions of audio or video \n     content of a motion picture or the creation or provision of \n     technology to enable such making available--is not subject to \n     trademark infringement liability based on that conduct, \n     provided that person's conduct complies with the requirements \n     of section 110(11). This section provides a similar exemption \n     for a manufacturer, licensee or licensor of technology that \n     enables such making imperceptible, but such manufacturer, \n     licensee or licensor is subject to the additional requirement \n     that it ensure that the technology provides a clear and \n     conspicuous notice at the beginning of each performance that \n     the performance of the motion picture is altered from the \n     performance intended by the director or the copyright holder.\n       Of course, nothing in this section would immunize someone \n     whose conduct, apart from the narrow conduct described by \n     110(11), rises to the level of a Lanham Act violation. For \n     example, someone who provides technology to enable the making \n     imperceptible limited portions of a motion picture consistent \n     with section 110(11) could not be held liable on account of \n     such conduct under the Trademark Act, but if in providing \n     such technology the person also makes an infringing use of a \n     protected mark or engages in other ancillary conduct that is \n     infringing, such conduct would not be subject to the \n     exemption provided here. As amended by the Senate, the bill \n     also makes clear that failure by a manufacturer, licensee, or \n     licensor of technology to qualify for the exemption created \n     by this subsection is not, by itself, enough to establish \n     trademark infringement. Failure to qualify for the safe \n     harbor from trademark liability merely means that the \n     manufacturer, licensee, or other licensor of technology \n     cannot assert an affirmative defense based on this exemption \n     in a case where trademark infringement or some other \n     violation of the Trademark Act is established.\n     Subsection (d): Definition\n       Subsection (d) provides definitional clarification \n     regarding short-hand references throughout this section to \n     the ``Trademark Act of 1946.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/24/senate-section/article/S11854-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of January 7, 2003, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on November 24, 2004, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives, announcing that \nthe House has passed the following joint resolution, in which it \nrequests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.
