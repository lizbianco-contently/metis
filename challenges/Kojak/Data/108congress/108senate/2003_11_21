Mr. President, we are in the final hour of debate on \nprobably one of the most important policy issues to come before this \nSenate in a good number of years. The Senator from Nevada has talked \nabout the quality of the debate and the detail of the debate. \nCertainly, that is true.\n  I yield to the chairman of the committee, Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator yield to the Senator from \nNew Mexico?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield to the chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to make sure that we understand \nthe timing. I asked Senator Craig if he would come to the Senate floor \nso I could give him some time. I wonder if 5 minutes would be enough.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, what we are attempting to do for the \nAmerican people is allow them, their country, and the energy sector of \nour economy to get back into the business of producing energy. We may \nwell be faced with some of the highest natural gas prices that any \nconsumer will have paid in the United States this winter. If we have a \ncold winter, it will be time for those who are paying exorbitant energy \nbills to ask a fundamental question: Why? Why is the public policy of \nthis country driving up our energy bills? Why is not there a public \npolicy that begins to put this country back into the business of \nproducing energy?\n  Our historic wealth, in large part, has been based on an abundance of \nhigh-quality, low-cost energy in all kinds of forms.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2003 continues that most important economic \nlegacy for this country--to assure that we continue our traditional \nenergy sources but with new technologies and cleaner approaches; that \nwe invest money in new technologies so that the next generation of \nAmericans can have the same abundance of energy that I have had and \nthat my father had before me.\n  It would be an absolute tragedy if in the fine ticking of all of the \nissues within this very large bill someone collectively decides to vote \nagainst it because, if they do, they ought to go home and try to \nexplain why in February or March of this year their constituents are \ncontinuing to pay ever increasingly higher rates, or why there was a \nblackout in the Northeast this year, or why the brownouts in California \na few years ago, and why gas prices at the pump are at an average \nhistoric high.\n  There are sound answers to all of those questions. But, more \nimportantly, the Energy Policy Act of 2003 begins to address resolution \nof those questions, bringing those prices down overall and creating a \ngreater abundance.\n  We have also stepped out in a variety of new areas, including new \nnuclear technologies, new fuels approaches, and new hydrogen technology \nwhich our President was very daring to talk about--a new surface \ntransportation fuel future, hydrogen. We have set about the technology \nand the planning and the design for all of those types of new \napproaches.\n  I say to the Senator from Alaska, his State is one of the largest \nenergy producers of all of our States.\n  This bill clearly gives companies the ability to come in and invest \nand bring literally trillions of cubic feet of gas to the lower 48 that \nwill offer help in bringing down those high prices.\n  We created the incentives. We have allowed them to invest in the \nmarketplace and to get a good return on their investment.\n  This is a truly comprehensive bill. There is no question that we have \nspent literally the last 5 years in attempting to design an Energy bill \nthat will fill all of the needs of this country, and to restructure and \nrefine the existing energy sector of our country especially in the \nelectrical area.\n\n  This has a new electrical title much different from the one before. \nCompromises were made. I stood in the Senate a year ago and offered an \namendment to take the electrical title out because of its controversy \nand its impact on the Pacific Northwest. Today we have changed that. \nToday we have said all areas of the country can grow and develop and we \nwill work to build an interconnectivity between those regions of the \ncountry that will, hopefully, disallow the kind of problems we had in \nthe Northeast this summer and certainly begin to address the inability \nof California to produce its energy needs.\n  All of those issues are bound up in this bill. Yet some of our \ncolleagues have picked a very small piece of this bill, less than one-\nhalf of 1 percent of the total impact of this bill, and have said that \nis the problem, that is the destructive character of the bill. That is \nwhy some Members oppose it.\n\n[[Page S15327]]\n\n  This is a very good piece of work. It brings our country back into \nenergy production. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and allow \nthe Senate to move toward final passage for this critical piece of \npublic policy.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, America needs an energy policy, but not \nthis one. This bill fails to provide a realistic, sustainable energy \nplan for America's future. Observers have called this Energy bill \n``three parts corporate welfare and one part cynical politics.'' They \ncall it a complete waste of energy and say it fails to address the fuel \nand power needs of the average American. They are absolutely right.\n  The bill includes environmental rollbacks. It threatens public \nhealth. It weakens consumer protections against electricity market \nmanipulation. It gives out billions of dollars in subsidies to fossil \nfuel and nuclear industries. The rollback of three of our most \nfundamental environmental laws--the Clean Air Act, the Drinking Water \nAct, and the Clean Water Act--is terrible environmental policy.\n  This bill allows more smog pollution. This bill exempts all oil and \ngas construction activities from the Clean Water Act. The Senate's \nrenewable portfolio standard requiring utilities to generate 10 percent \nof their power from renewable sources by 2020 was struck from the bill.\n  What we needed was a bill to decrease our energy dependence on \nforeign oil, but this bill will not conserve a drop of oil. We need to \nprotect our consumers, our public lands, and our public health. \nInstead, this bill weakens protections. We need to give a boost to the \nrenewable energy sector, but instead the bill is a kickback to the \nfossil fuel industry.\n  We now need to do the right thing and oppose cloture. We need to \nspend more time developing the right energy policy for America.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am excited about the opportunity we have \ntoday to finally, after a number of years, come forward with a broad, \nencompassing policy for energy.\n  We ought to give a little thought to where we will be in the future \nas individuals, as families, think about the energy we use, the energy \nwe need, where it will come from. Our demands go up, yet we do not \nreally have a policy.\n  Nothing is more important to the economy than having accessible \nenergy and jobs. This bill creates a great number of jobs. It is a \npolicy on conservation. It includes the types of equipment we use. It \nincludes renewables, with a good many dollars spent for renewables. We \ntalk of alternative fuels. We talk of hydrogen. We talk about domestic \nproduction.\n  It does not roll back the economy despite what is being said on the \nfloor. It does conserve. We have conservation methods included. What is \nmost important in terms of the environment is a good deal of research \nfor coal development so we can have energy from our largest fossil \nfuel, coal, and do it in a way that is clean for the air. We will hear \nthat it amounts to politics regarding MTBE, which is a very small \naspect of this.\n  We need to have an energy policy for our country. We must have an \nenergy policy. Now is our opportunity to have an energy policy. \nCertainly we ought to at least be able to vote to have an up-or-down \nvote on this issue.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nthe time be charged equally.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, I would like to speak on \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator withhold his suggestion \nof a quorum?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I withhold my request.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will speak for the bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as a member of the energy committee who \nhas worked very hard with both the distinguished Senators from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Domenici, as well as the former chair from \nAlaska, Senator Murkowski, trying to fashion a bill that balances the \ngreat interests of every region of this country, I am proud to come to \nthe Senate and urge my colleagues to vote for this Energy bill.\n  There are provisions that should be in this bill that are not. There \nare many aspects of this bill that I would have written differently \nmyself. However, the fact is, as any member on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee can state, we have had hours and hours, maybe \nhundreds of hours, of hearings on how we create a more reliable \nelectricity structure in this Nation, how we try to use our great \nnatural resources in a better fashion to help create the energy this \ncountry needs to be more independent and more economically competitive.\n  I come from the State of Louisiana, which is a net exporter of \nenergy. We do a lot of energy production in Louisiana, not just in oil \nand gas but cogeneration. We have municipal as well as private \ncompanies, public companies, municipal generators of electricity. We \ndrill for a lot of oil and gas. We are not a mining State in that \nsense, like the West, but we mine our resources and we do a much better \njob than we did 10 years ago and a heck of a lot better job than 20 or \n30 years ago. Why? Because the United States has some of the toughest, \nmost stringent environmental laws in the world when we take our coal \nout of the ground or when we drill off our shore. The Shell Oil company \ntold me last year if they put all the oil they spilled off the coast of \nLouisiana in a container, it would not fill up the bottom fourth of a \nbarrel.\n  There are people in the Senate who think we cannot mine our resources \nin a way that protects our environment. Do we have a perfect system? \nNo. Is it one of the best in the world? Absolutely. So this Senator and \nthis Democrat is for using our natural resources in a way that helps \nmeet the energy demands of this Nation.\n  This country consumes more energy per capita than any nation in the \nworld. As far as I am concerned, we have an obligation to produce it. \nSome Members think we can consume, consume, consume and not produce \nanything. One of the most extraordinary aspects about this bill is \nstreamlining of regulations, trying to untie people's lands so we can \nappropriately extract natural resources, clean our coal, have good \ntechnology off our shores, and use that money to invest in our \nenvironment.\n  People say the Senator from Louisiana is on the floor because \nLouisiana gets money out of this bill. The State gets some help. We \ndeserve some help because for 50 years we have sent over $140 billion \nof this Nation's treasury off the shores of Louisiana. That is not \npocket change.\n  We have saved the redwood forests, and we have funded the whole land \nand water conservation funding for the Nation. Now we have an \nopportunity to take a portion of that money and save the wetlands of \nAmerica. It is not Louisiana's wetlands. This is the largest delta in \nthe continental United States, and it is in crisis. It is washing away. \nThe chairman from New Mexico came to see it. He does not need to read a \nbook or anything about it; he has seen it.\n  So, yes, we have some resources, a tiny percentage of the money that \ncomes out of the great natural resources of the Gulf of Mexico, not to \ngive this Senator any special project, because I sure do not have any \nspecial sweet deal. The deal I have cut for my State, which the Senator \nknows, is to save these wetlands, where migratory birds for the whole \nNation go, and fisheries off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, from the \neast coast to the west coast.\n  So there are lots of good things in this bill. I know we have \nproblems with MTBE. I know we have problems. I am\n\n[[Page S15328]]\n\nvery disappointed in the hydrogen section that would have helped us \nmove to hydrogen cars. I am very disappointed. The ranking member \nfought very hard for renewable portfolio standards, and I am \ndisappointed that his language was stripped out.\n  But I can tell you, the chairman from New Mexico has fought like a \ntiger to get a balanced bill. The fact is, we are not divided Democrat \nagainst Republican; we are divided regionally.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know people have come down here and \ncomplained about standard market design. I realize the Senators from \nthe Northeast are concerned about the language that has been put in \nthis bill. But I will tell you, the reason the language has been put in \nthe bill like this is that there are Southerners who are generating a \nlot of electricity. Why? Because we are drilling, and we are producing, \nand we are building plants in the South. And I will be darned if our \nratepayers have to pick up the tab to ship that electricity to the \nNortheast. They need to be doing a better job of building plants and \nlaying down pipelines.\n  I have more pipelines in Louisiana per capita than any State in the \nUnion. If you took an x-ray of the country, you would be shocked. Like \na little skeleton, you could see the pipelines under Louisiana. We \ncannot build any more. And do not believe we are taking the gas from \nthose pipelines. We are sending it all over the country. We are happy \nto. But we cannot pay for all of it. We have to share the costs in an \nappropriate way.\n  So I say to my Democratic colleagues, when they say there is nothing \nin the bill for Democrats, may I please remind them there is no \ndrilling--30 more seconds--there is no drilling in this bill in ANWR.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator yield 30 seconds?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. I say to the Senator, we are not using your time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  There is no drilling, in this bill, in ANWR, which I know the \nPresident fought very hard for and this Senator thought might be \nreasonable, but the majority wasn't there.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you. I urge Democrats and Republicans to support \ncloture on this bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana, I am very pleased I got to know you in the past year and a \nhalf. I do not think we would have had a chance to meet each other but \nfor the energy crisis. I visited your State. And everything you have \nsaid today, and on the floor time after time, about what is going to \nhappen in your State because of what is happening to the water line is \ntrue. We can kill this bill and kill that. You know how long you have \nbeen waiting for it.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Fifty years.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And you are going to wait 60 more because there is \nnobody going to pass another bill like this with these kinds of things \nin it for a long time. Why do I know that? Because I have been through \nit. And every time we just about get there, somebody has some \nobjection, and we have a big hole, it all falls in, and nothing gets \ndone.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, thank you for your effort. I \nappreciate it.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Arizona 6 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I had an opportunity earlier this week to \nspeak about this bill, but I think so much is objectionable in this \nlegislation that I am compelled to expend a little more energy on it.\n  I have listened to my colleagues' statements, and I have yet to hear \nany plausible, substantiated argument in support of ethanol. Even my \ncolleagues from corn-producing States who have indicated they support \nthis bill have not been able to identify one benefit ethanol provides \nthe American taxpayers, who pay dearly for it--including the taxpayers \nin those corn-producing States.\n  Ethanol is a product that would not exist if Congress did not create \nan artificial market for it. No one would be willing to buy it. Yet \nthanks to agricultural subsidies and ethanol producer subsidies, it is \nnow a very big business--tens of billions of dollars that have enriched \na handful of corporate interests, primarily one big corporation, Archer \nDaniels Midland.\n  Ethanol does nothing to reduce fuel consumption, nothing to increase \nour energy independence, nothing to improve air quality. Let me repeat: \nEthanol does nothing to reduce fuel consumption, nothing to increase \nour energy independence, nothing to improve air quality.\n  As far as reducing fuel consumption is concerned, it requires 70 \npercent more energy to produce a gallon of ethanol than it provides \nwhen combusted. There is actually a net energy loss from the use of \nethanol. There is nothing about ethanol that will increase our energy \nindependence. More energy is used in the production of ethanol, and it \nhas reduced the amount of gasoline consumed in the United States by 1 \npercent.\n  Ethanol does not improve air quality. In fact, doubling the amount of \nethanol, as required by this bill, will most certainly degrade air \nquality. A National Academy of Sciences report in 2000 found that \noxygenates, meaning ethanol and MTBE, can lead to higher nitrous oxide \nemissions, which contribute to higher ozone levels in some areas.\n  That means in large cities, such as Phoenix, AZ, air quality \ndegradation could be increased under this legislation. The residents of \nmy State already suffer due to the impact of a lingering brown cloud. I \ndread the effects of this bill--doubling our national use of ethanol--\non my town and communities across this Nation.\n  The American public has to pay a lot of money not only in taxes but \nat the pump for all these negative impacts on the national economy, the \ncountry's energy supply, the environment, and public health. The total \ncost of ethanol to the consumer is about $3 per gallon, and the highway \ntrust fund is deprived of over $1 billion per year to the ethanol \nproducers.\n  Plain and simple, the ethanol program is highway robbery perpetrated \non the American public by Congress. I maintain you cannot claim to be a \nfiscal conservative and support the profligate spending and corporate \nwelfare in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I will talk just for a minute about another problem I \nhad with this bill, the way it was developed. A secretive, exclusive \nprocess has led to a 1,200-page monstrosity that is chock full of \nspecial interest giveaways and exemptions from environmental and other \nlaws that, frankly, cannot withstand the light of scrutiny.\n  I mentioned one such provision earlier. It is a glaring example of \ncorporate favors. Section 637 carves out a very special deal for a \nconsortium of energy companies, predominantly foreign owned, called \nLouisiana Energy Services, which would allow it to construct a uranium \nenrichment plant in a small town in New Mexico at taxpayers' expense--\nto the tune of $500 million to $1 billion. This is not your ordinary \npork project; it is in a class almost by itself.\n  Louisiana Energy Services has had some serious difficulties getting a \nlicense from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and for good reason. \nOne major British partner of this group was fired by the Department of \nEnergy from a $7 billion cleanup contract due to safety and financial \nfailures. Even more disturbing, the major French partner, Urenco, has \nbeen associated with leaks of uranium enrichment technology to Iran, \nIraq, North Korea, and Pakistan. One high-level U.S. nuclear security \nadministrator stated:\n\n\n[[Page S15329]]\n\n\n       [T]o have this company operate in the U.S. after it was the \n     source of sensitive technology reaching foreign powers does \n     raise serious concerns.\n\n  There is significant reason to believe the NRC would not issue a \nlicense to this group of companies. And communities in other States did \nnot want the LES facility in their backyard.\n  This bill gives LES a helping hand in New Mexico. The criteria for \nNRC licensing and the time period for review have been modified to make \nit easier and quicker for LES to get a license. Opportunities for \nchallenges on environmental or other grounds would be severely \nrestricted. And if you are wondering how sweet it could possibly get \nfor this company, the uranium waste from the plant would be \nreclassified as low-level radioactive waste and the cost of disposal \nwould be borne by the Department of Energy--the taxpayers of America.\n  Furthermore, there isn't any disposal method or site currently \navailable. This provision, which was inserted in conference at the \neleventh hour, is the epitome of corporate welfare. Allowing foreign \ncompanies with questionable reputations to circumvent longstanding \nenvironmental and nuclear regulations is simply wrong.\n  Let me quote from a few of the many editorials opposing this bill. I \nhave never seen anything quite like this level of agreement in \nnewspapers representing all regions of the country. In fact, I have yet \nto see a single editorial in favor of this, although I am sure there is \none.\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer:\n\n       . . . what most Americans were looking for was an energy \n     bill that protected their interests. . . . Instead they got \n     this unbalanced, shameful mess.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the Senator an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. From the Chicago Tribune:\n\n       Neither the contents nor the process for cobbling it \n     together suggest this is the type of energy legislation this \n     country needs.\n\n  The Denver Post:\n\n       . . . the most pernicious pork got added in conference \n     committee. Congress should start over next year.\n\n  Mr. President, let's put this up against the backdrop of a $500 \nbillion deficit we are facing this year, with 12 percent growth of the \nGovernment. Don't call yourself a fiscal conservative and vote for this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes to the Senator from Idaho, \nand 20\\1/2\\ minutes for the junior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Do you want to go to another speaker?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Washington, Ms. \nCantwell.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know we have had a healthy debate on \nthis issue and in a few minutes we will probably have one of the \nclosest votes this body has seen in a while. But I want to make one \npoint clear this morning. This vote is about whose side you are on: \nWhether you are on the side of ratepayers and consumers in making sure \nwe have a national energy policy that works or whether you are going to \ngive in to the special interests who are at this very moment trying to \nput last-minute deals on the table, ripening other bills with projects \nthat will convince Members to switch over at the last minute instead of \nstanding up for the public.\n  When the Vice President started this effort, he said, ``We are going \nto have a national energy policy,'' quoting from his report that a lot \nof people took pride in, thinking that somehow this administration was \ngoing to play a leadership role in an energy policy for the 21st \ncentury.\n  In that report, the Vice President said:\n\n       It envisions a comprehensive long-term strategy that uses \n     leading edge technology to produce an integrated energy, \n     environmental, and economic policy to achieve a 21st century \n     quality of life, enhanced by renewable energy and a clean \n     environment. We must modernize conservation, modernize our \n     infrastructure, increase energy supply, including renewables, \n     accelerate the protection and improvement of our environment, \n     and increase greater energy security.\n\n  That is what the Vice President's goal and objectives were. \nUnfortunately, this bill cannot defy gravity. It is so weighted down \nwith special interest pork subsidies and things that Americans are \ngoing to be shocked to see that this bill needs to fail.\n  We have all heard about the subsidies in the wrong place, $23 billion \nin incentives, mostly going to the fossil fuel industry. We have heard \nabout the exemptions for Texas. Here it is that we are trying to come \nup with an electricity title that somehow makes everybody else more \nresponsible and accountable with electricity, but we are going to \nexempt Texas.\n  Also, the overturning of various environmental laws--why is it that \nevery other business in America, whether a high-tech firm or a farmer, \nhas to comply with environmental laws, but somehow we are going to let \nnew construction of oil, gas, and coal out of the mandates of the Clean \nAir Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and some of \nour rules on public lands?\n  As I said yesterday, one of the biggest tragedies of this bill is the \nmissed opportunity for jobs. We could have gotten language in this bill \nthat would have provided for a natural gas pipeline out of Alaska that \nwould have benefited many in this country as far as job creation is \nconcerned. It would have benefited many of us in the Northwest in \ngetting off our overreliance on hydro energy.\n  We missed an opportunity in planning for the hydrogen economy; \n750,000 jobs could have been created in the next 10 years by having a \nvision. Not just one line in a State of the Union speech about a \nhydrogen car, but instead a plan with specifics and incentives so the \nUnited States could be a world leader in the hydrogen fuel economy. \nThat is not what is in this bill.\n  I woke up this morning to read in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer \nonline an article that was entitled ``The Energy Bill, It Would Be A \nHoot, If It Wasn't So Sad.''\n  In that article it says :\n\n       Vice President Dick Cheney, whose secretive energy task \n     force crafted much of the energy bill in consultation with \n     industry executives, is coming to our Washington next month \n     for a GOP fundraiser.\n\n  I would advise the Vice President not to come and talk about his \nenergy policy in the Northwest.\n\n       Curiously, the Senate yesterday debated the energy bill and \n     its subsidies in a virtual media blackout.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We yield the Senator an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. This bill hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. But \none thing is clear: Members are going to be held accountable for whose \nside they are on. The energy policy of this administration has fleeced \nNorthwest ratepayers from essential dollars and now this bill \npromulgates that policy further by giving in to special interests. This \nbill should fail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time so as not to \ntake away from the time allotted to those who still wish to speak.\n  America needs a comprehensive national energy plan that increases our \nenergy independence, that creates jobs, that lowers energy prices for \nconsumers, and that is environmentally and fiscally responsible.\n  We have been trying in the Senate for 3 years to pass such a plan.\n  Regrettably, this is not that plan.\n  This plan will move America forward in some ways. But it falls far \nshort of a comprehensive approach to America's energy needs. In fact, \nit does not even attempt to address some of our most pressing problems. \nAnd it is extremely generous to a variety of special interests.\n  I am greatly disappointed by the number of opportunities we are \nmissing here.\n  This bill fails to significantly reduce America's growing dependence \non foreign oil.\n  Today, our Nation imports 60 percent of our oil, much of it from some \nof the most volatile and dangerous areas on Earth. Over the next 10 \nyears, the United States is expected to consumer roughly 1.5 trillion \ngallons of gasoline.\n  The Republicans in the House and Senate who wrote this conference \nreport actually rejected measures that\n\n[[Page S15330]]\n\nwould have reduced our dependence on foreign oil.\n  They rejected efforts to mandate oil savings.\n  The authors of this conference report also rejected a common-sense \nplan to address America's projected natural gas shortage.\n  They killed tax incentives needed for construction of a pipeline to \nbring natural gas from Alaska to the lower 48 States.\n  The provision, which was contained in the Senate passed bill, was \ndropped in conference. And, when Senator Bingaman offered a motion in \nconference to restore it--in the one meeting of Conferees to discuss \nsubstantive issues--that motion was defeated on a straight party line \nvote, with the seven Republican Senate conferees voting against it.\n  The Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline would have been the largest \nconstruction project ever in this country. It would have brought down \n35 trillion cubic feet of known natural gas reserves on the North Slope \nof Alaska. Right now, we are paying to pump that gas back into the \nground because there is no way to get it to the American consumers who \nneed it.\n  The pipeline would also have created 400,000 good jobs and used an \nestimated 5 million tons of U.S. steel. It would have reduced our \ndependence on foreign oil by bringing Alaska gas directly to the \nMidwest.\n  This conference report also fails to address the problems that led to \nthe catastrophic energy crisis California experienced, and the blackout \nthat left nearly one-third of the country without electricity this past \nsummer.\n  In addition, this bill actually repeals existing consumer \nprotections--and does nothing to prevent a repeat of the Enron schemes \nthat cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, this bill \ncould make such schemes more likely by tying the hands of regulators.\n  This bill fails to include a renewable portfolio standard that would \ndiversify America's sources of electricity. The Senate-passed energy \nbill includes a requirement that 10 percent of America's electricity \ncome from renewable sources, such as wind and solar. This would \nincrease our energy security and create new jobs and opportunities in \nAmerica's rural communities.\n  The people who wrote this bill ignored 53 Senators who said this \nprovision should be in the final bill.\n  Last year, and again this year, the Senate passed energy bills that \nreflected the growing scientific and bipartisan consensus that the \nthreat of global climate change is real and, unless we act, will have \ndevastating consequences for our children and grandchildren.\n  This bill simply ignores that fact.\n  Many important provisions that the Senate passed with strong \nbipartisan support are nowhere to be found in this bill.\n  But there are many provisions that are in this conference report that \nwere not even debated in either the House or the Senate. They were \nsimply added in a back room.\n  One of the most egregious is the retroactive liability protections \nfor MTBE manufacturers.\n  Forty-three states have problems with contaminated groundwater as a \nresult of MTBE.\n  The National Conference of Mayors estimates clean-up costs at $29 \nbillion. This bill dumps those costs on local taxpayers, by granting \nimmunity from liability to the polluters.\n  In fact, this bill provides retroactive liability protection to MTBE \nproducers dating back to September 5 of this year.\n  It is no coincidence that this is one day before the State of New \nHampshire filed its lawsuit against companies responsible for the \ncontamination of groundwater by MTBE.\n  The authors of this conference report know that provisions like this \ncould not survive open debate. That is why they chose to write this \nbill in secret.\n  This process began in secrecy--with Vice President Cheney's energy \ntask force. And it ended in secrecy.\n  Democrats in Congress were shut out. The American people were shut \nout. That is not the way to debate a matter that is so critical to our \nNation's security.\n  Even with these obstacles, we were able to make some important \nimprovements over the bill we were originally given.\n  Against great odds, we succeeded in protecting the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge from oil drilling.\n  We increased efficiency standards for appliances and machinery, and \nincreased investments in research and development of new energy-saving \ntechnologies.\n  This bill also makes an historic commitment to expanding the use of \nrenewable energy sources by nearly tripling the use of ethanol.\n  This is important to the people of South Dakota and many other farm \nStates. And it is important to our national energy security.\n  A year and a half ago, President Bush came to South Dakota. We \nvisited an ethanol plant in Wentworth. The President said: ``[ethanol \nis] important for the agricultural sector of our economy, it's an \nimportant part of making sure we become less reliant on foreign sources \nof energy.''\n  I agree. I've been fighting for ethanol and other renewable fuels for \nover 20 years.\n  Nearly tripling America's use of ethanol will create 214,000 new jobs \nand produce $5.3 billion in new investments in America.\n  It will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And it will \nsave $4 billion in imported oil each year.\n  Ethanol comes from American farmers and producers, passes through \nAmerican refiners, and fuels American energy needs. No soldier will \nhave to fight overseas to protect them. And no international cartel can \nturn off the spigot on us.\n  I understand and respect my colleagues who oppose this bill. There is \nmuch in this conference report that is objectionable.\n  Despite secrecy, the partisanship and the shortcomings in this bill, \nI will vote to invoke cloture--reluctantly--because America needs to \nimprove its energy situation, and I think this proposal takes a few \nsmall steps forward.\n  However, the people who wrote this bill must understand that a vote \nfor this bill is not a vote of support for their radical energy agenda \nthat some of it includes.\n  We can--indeed must--revisit the shortcomings in this bill. We must \nre-examine the MTBE liability waiver, the effects of this legislation \non environmental laws and consumer protections.\n  I intend to press these issues in the next session of this Congress \nand for as long as it takes to get it right.\n  So I will vote for this bill. But I tell my colleagues--especially \nthose who were involved in its drafting--that this bill could have been \nmuch better, and the American people deserve better from us in the \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues the 9th Report \non Carcinogens 2000, as it relates to MTBE. This report is a product of \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health \nService, which says that it is not carcinogenic. It is a true ground \nwater pollutant, but there is no indication of a carcinogenic effect.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 14 minutes for the Senator from New \nMexico, and 15\\1/2\\ minutes for the other side.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York, Mr. Schumer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \nlegislation, and I have fervent hopes that we will not invoke cloture.\n  Mr. President, this bill is bad for what is in it and bad for what is \nnot in it. I don't know which is worse. It is bad for what is in it \nbecause there are so many provisions that don't make much sense that \nare done to help one State or another but don't really add up to a \nnational policy.\n  It is particularly bad for what is in it because the MTBE provision \nis one of the worst provisions that has come down the legislative pike \nin decades. To tell homeowners who have lost their homes that they \ncannot take a shower, cannot drink the water and, through no fault of \ntheir own, they are out of luck, that their life savings which they \ninvested in their little homes is gone--\n\n[[Page S15331]]\n\neven though the MTBE producers knew the stuff was bad and didn't inform \nanybody--is an outrage.\n  Some say the Government authorized MTBE. Then let the Government help \nthe homeowners if you don't want to have the oil companies, the MTBE \nproducers, be sued. But don't leave tens of thousands today, and \nhundreds of thousands within a few years, of homeowners high and dry. I \nam not a big fan of lawsuits all the time, as my colleagues know. But \nif there were ever a case where lawsuits were justified, it is in this \ncase. To cut them off, and to cut them off retroactively, is dastardly.\n  In addition, there is no energy policy in this bill. We have had the \ntriple storm: we have had 9/11; we have had Enron, we have had the \nblackout. And we do virtually nothing to deal with the aftermath of all \nthree of those.\n  There is no conservation in the bill. There is no real dealing with \nthe Enron excesses. When it comes to the blackout, we take a baby step \nthat utilities okayed but not what we have to do. Great nations have \nfailed when faced with a crisis and they refused to grapple with it. \nThat is what is happening here.\n  This bill, whether it passes or fails, will be deeply regretted 5 \nyears from now for what it does and what it does not do.\n  Mr. President, when pork is used to grease a policy along, well, that \nis not good. But when pork is used as a substitute for policy, that can \nbe disastrous. I argue that in this case that is what has happened. I \nhad wished that we had a real energy policy in this bill.\n  My colleagues are all people of good faith. Both Senators from New \nMexico, the Senator from Iowa, and the Senator from Montana have all \ntried their best. Unfortunately, at a time when America demands a \nthoughtful and far-reaching energy policy, this proposal, instead, \ndelivers little bags of goodies to some individuals, not others, and \nsays that is a substitute for policy.\n  I hope the bill is defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes out of the time \nallotted to Senator Domenici.\n  Unlike my colleague and supporter of ethanol, Senator Daschle--and he \nis a big supporter of ethanol--I am not reluctant to vote for cloture \nbecause if we don't get cloture on this bill, we will never have the \nopportunity to get renewable fuels and the environmental impact of \nthose renewable fuels and what it does for American agriculture. This \nis the best thing for renewable fuels and ethanol that we have had \nbefore this Congress in 25 years.\n  This is an opportunity for people to decide: Are they for the farmers \nor are they against the farmers? This bill, for the most part, is very \ngood for the green growing regions of the Midwest. The choice is easy. \nThis bill contains those production incentives for ethanol, biodiesel, \nand other renewable energy sources--the best ever for Senators from \nother energy-producing regions, such as the gulf States, the Southwest, \nthe Rocky Mountains, and the Appalachians. The bill moves the ball \nforward for energy production.\n  The Finance Committee has a history in the area of energy-related tax \npolicy. Almost one decade ago, my committee put its imprint on a \ncomprehensive energy-related tax policy. The bill the committee \nproduced strikes a very good balance between conventional energy, \nalternative renewable energies, and conservation.\n  I thank Senator Baucus for working with me and every member of this \ncommittee on its priorities. I also thank the Democratic staff for its \nhard work in helping us put together a bipartisan bill that may now be \ndestroyed because of a Democratic filibuster.\n  First and foremost, we have an expansion of production credit for \nwind energy. Back in 1992, I was the first to offer this proposal. Now \nwe have an important expansion of this production credit to cover, in \naddition to wind, biomass, geothermal, and solar energy. As the \nPresident has wisely said, as a matter of national security, we need to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. That means all domestic energy \nsources--green or otherwise--are fair game.\n  Along those lines, we have a new tax credit for biodiesel fuel that \nis included in this bill. The conference report contains several \nprovisions that enhance tax incentives for ethanol production because \nit is a clean-burning fuel that will continue to be a key element in \nour transportation fuel needs.\n  We also remove in this bill the prejudice against ethanol for highway \ntrust fund purposes by providing a tax credit for ethanol production. \nWhen we complete our work on the highway bill next year, ethanol fuels \nwill pay the full gas tax into the highway trust fund.\n  This bill also provides an effective small producer tax credit.\n  With this bill, ethanol will be treated as all other energy \nincentives. It will be derived from the general fund. Ultimately, all \ncommunities, rural and urban, will get more highway money if this bill \npasses. If you care about highway money for your local roads, you \nshould vote for cloture.\n  There are a number of other good provisions in this bill that benefit \nagriculture, clean coal, and new technologies for gas production. The \nbill, in other words, is balanced with new energy conservation \nmeasures, as well as alternative renewable fuels.\n  We have an opportunity--almost the last opportunity--to do what it \ntakes to get this bill passed. We are responding to national \npriorities. There is no going back to the House for another chance.\n  I ask all Senators to think long and hard about what this vote today \nrepresents. This is an historical moment. It is as if we are on the \nlast steps of a trail to the top of a big mountain that we have \nclimbed. We can either take the next few steps and enjoy the view or we \ncan jump off the side of the mountain. There is no going back down the \ntrail.\n  For Senators from my part of the world, the grain growing regions of \nthe Midwest, the choice is easy. This bill contains production \nincentives for ethanol, biodiesel and other renewable energy sources. \nWe are for farmers they are against farmers. For Senators from other \nenergy-producing regions, like the Gulf States, the Southwest, the \nRocky Mountains, and the Appalachians, this bill moves the ball forward \non energy production.\n  The Finance Committee has a distinct history in the area of energy-\nrelated tax policy. Almost one decade ago, this committee put its \nimprint on comprehensive energy-related tax policy. Then, as now, the \nbill the committee produced strikes a balance between conventional \nenergy sources, alternative energy, and conservation.\n  I would like to thank Senator Baucus for working with me and every \nmember of this committee on their priorities. I would also like to \nthank the Finance Committee Democratic staff for the hard work they \nhave put in to get us here.\n  First and foremost, we have an extension and expansion of the \nproduction credit for wind energy. Back in 1992, I was the first to \noffer this proposal to the Senate. Now, we have an important expansion \nof this production credit to cover biomass, geothermal wells and solar \nenergy.\n  As the President has wisely said, as a matter of national security, \nwe need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. That means all \ndomestic energy sources, green and otherwise, are fair game. Along \nthose lines, we have a new tax credit for bio diesel fuels that will be \nincluded in this bill.\n  The conference report contains several provisions that enhance the \ntax incentives for ethanol production. Ethanol is a clean burning fuel \nthat will continue to be a key element in our transportation fuels \npolicy.\n  We remove the prejudice against ethanol for highway trust fund \npurposes by providing a tax credit for ethanol production. When we \ncomplete our work on the highway bill next year, ethanol fuels will pay \nthe full gas tax into the highway trust fund. We are most of the way \nthere. This bill also provides an effective small producer tax credit. \nWith this bill, ethanol will be treated as all other energy incentives. \nIt will be derived from the general fund.Ultimately, all communities, \nrural and urban, will get more highway money if this bill passes. If \nyou care about highway money for your local roads, you should vote for \ncloture.\n  There are a number of other very good proposals in the conference \nreport. They benefit agriculture, clean\n\n[[Page S15332]]\n\ncoal, and new technologies for gas production. The bill is balanced \nwith new energy conservation measures as well.\n  So, to sum up, we have an opportunity to do what we should do. We are \nresponding to a national priority, energy security, in a balanced and \ncomprehensive way. Let there be no mistake about it, Mr. President. A \nvote against cloture is a vote to stop this bill. There is no going \nback to the House for another chance. There is no going back to \nconference with the House with the leverage the energy-producing States \nhad on this bill. As the lead negotiator on the Senate side for the tax \nprovisions, let me tell you it was not easy. The Ways and Means \nCommittee likes oil--they don't like clean-burning ethanol. It was a \ndifficult conference. We will not get this chance again.\n  So, for my friends on both sides of the aisle, especially those from \nthe Midwest, this is the time to show your cards. You can show whether \nyou are with farmers or with other interests.\n  As I said, at the start, we are on the last steps of the trail to the \nmountain top. There is no looking back now. A vote for cloture \ncompletes the journey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We either pass this bill or the good provisions in it \nfor ethanol are lost forever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the ranking member for yielding. I spoke on 2 \nsuccessive days on this bill, and I feel strongly about it. I spent 20 \nyears in Congress supporting ethanol and I believe in it. I think it is \nimportant to help our farm economy, reduce pollution, and reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. There is no doubt this bill would greatly \nexpand ethanol across America. That is a good thing. It is something I \nsupport.\n  I cannot support this bill. I cannot support this bill because, \nfrankly, it is fundamentally unfair and unjust and it is unbecoming of \nthe Senate to offer this to America as an energy policy.\n  When it comes to energy, this bill is a full-scale retreat. This bill \nfails to include any provisions whatsoever to deal with fuel efficiency \nand fuel economy of the cars and trucks we drive. How can we in good \nconscience stand before the American people and say this is an Energy \nbill for our future and not address the No. 1 consumption of energy, \noil imported from overseas--the cars and trucks that we drive? Why? \nBecause the special interest groups that oppose fuel efficiency and \nfuel economy won the battle. They won the argument. The American people \nwere the losers.\n  There is another aspect to this bill which troubles me. This bill is \na full-scale retreat when it comes to environmental protection for \nAmerica. Think about this for a moment. Every major environmental group \nin America opposes this Energy bill. What has brought them all \ntogether? The fact that in the course of negotiating this bill, those \nfew people sat in that secret room, gave away the Clean Air Act, the \nClean Water Act, access to America's public lands, and the natural \nheritage which we helped to leave to our children. That is what is at \nstake. To walk away from basic environmental protection in the name of \npromoting energy is a bad deal for America's future.\n  To think for a moment that we have reached a point in time where \nChina--this new developing Nation, China--has more and better fuel \nefficiency standards than the United States of America should be a \nsupreme embarrassment to everyone in this Chamber.\n  This bill is a gusher of giveaways. We are going to build a nuclear \nreactor. We are going to start building coal mines in some States. We \nare going to build all sorts of shopping centers. It goes on and on. I \nam no babe in the woods. I have served in Congress and on the \nAppropriations Committee long enough to tell you I have an appetite for \npork like every Member of the Senate and the House, but I have to agree \nwith the Senator from New York. If giveaways turn out to be a \nsubstitute for energy policy, then we have defrauded the American \npublic. We need to have leadership on this issue, and we do not.\n  The single worst part of this bill, as far as I am concerned, the \nmost shameless aspect of this bill is found in section 1502. It is the \nmost egregious giveaway I have ever seen in my time on Capitol Hill \nbecause in a dark room, the people who wrote this conference report \nsaid to the major oil companies and some major chemical companies that \nthey would protect them from liability for the very product which they \nsold, which has contaminated water supplies across America.\n  Think about that for a moment. They have said that for families and \nindividuals whose health and homes have been damaged by MTBE as a \ncontaminant, they are going to close the courthouse doors. They are \ngoing to lock the doors and say to those families: You are going to \nhave to bear these losses and these medical bills on your own. That is \nshameless. To think it is included in here should be enough for every \nSenator to vote against this bill.\n  To add insult to this injury, there is a $2 billion Federal subsidy \nfor the MTBE producers and industry, not just protecting them in court \nfor their wrongdoing but giving them a lavish Federal subsidy.\n  What does it come down to? Who are the big winners in this bill? It \nis obvious: Big oil companies, big energy companies, high rollers on K \nStreet, and the muscle men on Capitol Hill.\n  Who are the big losers in this bill? Families with kids who have \nasthma, who will find more air pollution, which will mean that their \nkids have to stay home from school; families with water supplies \ncontaminated by MTBE, which make their homes uninhabitable and they \nhave no recourse to go to court to hold these oil companies \naccountable.\n  Basically, the biggest loser in this bill is Americans who expected \nmore from this Congress, who expected leadership and vision and instead \nhave a very sorry work product which should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the two sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Mexico has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The senior Senator from New Mexico has 9 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time \nbe equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we have come to the point of deciding \nwhether to vote to send this bill to the President for his signature or \nto effectively set this conference report aside, regroup, and pursue \nanother strategy.\n  Those of us who are about to vote against cloture do so not because \nwe are against having an Energy bill but because we are against having \nthis Energy bill. A view has been stated over the last few days that \nthis particular conference report, even with its problematic provisions \nand its excess spending, is the only option available if we wish to \ndeal with energy problems in this Congress.\n  It is argued that if we do not pass this bill today, then energy is \ndead as an issue for this Congress. In my view, that is not a logical \nconclusion to reach. We are not at the end of this Congress. We are \nreaching the midpoint in this Congress. There is nothing magical about \nhaving to pass energy legislation in odd-numbered years.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 1992, which was the last fairly \ncomprehensive bill passed through this Congress, was put to final \npassage a few weeks before the Presidential election in that year.\n  There is a broad consensus in the Senate for enacting forward-looking \nenergy legislation. We know this is true. Three and a half months ago, \nwe passed an Energy bill by a margin of 84 to 14. That bill would have \nmade 35 trillion cubic feet of Alaskan natural gas available to the \ncountry, which this conference report would not. That bill would have \nsaved twice as much energy as this conference report is projected to \nsave. That bill gave a real\n\n[[Page S15333]]\n\nboost to renewable energy in the production of electricity. It took a \nmodest first step toward dealing with the reality of global warming. It \ndid not undercut the National Environmental Policy Act. It did not roll \nback the Clean Air Act. It did not exempt anyone from the Clean Water \nAct. It was $10 billion lighter on the tax side than this legislation \nbefore us. It was another $3 billion lighter on the direct spending \nportion of the bill. It did not unfairly shift all of the costs of \nbuilding new electric transmission to consumers who do not get the full \nbenefit of that transmission. It did not contain embarrassing tax \ngiveaways such as a proposal to build a mall for a Hooters restaurant. \nIt was a reasonably good bill.\n  I have served on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for 19 \nyears. That is longer than any Member of my party in the Senate. I did \nnot get on that committee to filibuster Energy bills. I went on the \ncommittee to pass good energy legislation.\n  The reason so many of us believe we should not proceed to pass this \nEnergy bill is that many of the provisions that caused the earlier bill \nI referred to to pass with 84 votes 3\\1/2\\ months ago have been deleted \nin conference and an array of irrelevant and objectionable provisions \nhave been added. It is almost as if a calculation had been made that as \nlong as we stuck ethanol provisions into the bill and kept provisions \nout that would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, \nthen there would be 60 votes for passage of the bill and no one would \nlook too much at the other details and no one would be concerned about \nthe other effects of the legislation.\n  Well, we are about to test that proposition. I hope it turns out to \nbe wrong. If it turns out to be a miscalculation and cloture cannot be \ninvoked on this bill this morning, then our job on energy will not be \ndone in this Congress. In fact, this may be an opportunity to get \nthings back on a better and a more bipartisan track.\n  Both sides have made their share of mistakes in assembling massive \nEnergy bills in this Congress and in the last Congress. Yesterday, \nSenator Nickles criticized the process Democrats used in the last \nCongress to move an Energy bill directly to the floor, and many of \nthose criticisms were valid. Throughout this Congress and at each \nstage, we Democrats have tried to make a constructive contribution to \nthe bill, even in spite of the flawed process that has seemed \nexcessively partisan and closed to us and to the public, but now we are \nfaced with a choice of voting for or against the bill in its totality. \nThose who oppose cloture, both Democrats and Republicans, choose to do \nso because in its totality the conference report will not lead us to an \nenergy future that is secure, clean, affordable, and fiscally \nresponsible.\n  If this conference report is rejected, I for one will continue to \npush for the enactment of a good, comprehensive energy policy. It may \nbe that having tried twice to do so with thousand-page bills and \nfailed, Congress should look at smaller legislation.\n  I hope this conference report is rejected and, once the dust settles, \nwe can find a way to move forward with forward-looking legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 1 minute to Senator Burns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from New Mexico for \nyielding.\n  I want to say one thing, and that is that the general premise of this \nbill is in the right direction. The emphasis is on renewables and \nthings we can do that are good for the environment and still produce \nenergy. All this other chaff and dust that has been kicked up around it \nthat gives opponents such a move in the right direction can be dealt \nwith later, but the general premise of the bill is good because a \nbalance is there in the areas in which most of us really believe.\n  Let us not take our eye off the ball. Let us move it on down the \nfield under a premise of developing a policy and a way to not only deal \nwith the environment but also produce energy.\n  I tell my colleagues, we can deal with those things that are \nobjectionable at a later time, but we must move in this kind of a \ndirection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has Senator Burn's minute expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, there are a lot of people \nto thank for getting us where we are. We are a long way from where we \nstarted. I want to thank them. In particular, on the Democratic side I \nthank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana--from the very \nbeginning; thank you very much for all your help and all the others who \nput a lot of work into this.\n  I regret very much the statements that this bill was done in privacy \nand secrecy, in some way different in terms of a conference than most \nconferences around here. But I would like to tell the Senate, energy is \na big hole in the Congress. Energy policy is a big hole, and we keep \ndropping problems in it but we never solve them.\n  Everyone talks about conservation and renewables, but we happen to be \ntalking about those and production. As soon as you start talking about \nproduction, somebody produces and they are certainly not nonprofit \ncorporations. So as soon as you say ``produce and we'll give you an \nincentive,'' you are ``giving money to big companies.'' You are giving \nit to companies who will do the job and wouldn't otherwise do it.\n  I want to repeat, for everybody, the history. Last year we could not \nwrite a bill in committee. Think of that. My good friend, Senator \nBingaman, talks about how poorly we conducted ourselves. They couldn't \nwrite a bill in committee. So we wrote it on the Senate floor. Do you \nall remember that? We were down here, humiliated that we had to write \nan Energy bill on the Senate floor because we couldn't write it in \ncommittee.\n  Then what happened? We went to conference with the House. And, boy, \nif it was ever a storybook conference, it was wide open. And it took \nmonth after month, and guess what happened, Senator Burns--zero. \nNothing was done. So there is another one, the big hole sucked it up. \nBut we did it right. We had a conference. We had it open.\n  This Senator decided that to do it that way would yield nothing. For \nthe first time I decided that we should write the bill differently and \nwe should circulate it differently. Most of this bill was put on the \nInternet. In fact, that is the first time in history that a conference \nreport was on the Internet. Anybody who wanted to read this bill had \nweeks and weeks to read all but the last 15 percent. It was on the \nInternet. It was delivered to every single office. If you didn't read \nit, that is not my fault. Then for the last part we gave the opposition \n48 hours' notice on the Internet to everybody.\n  Do you know, this bill was more discussed by the press, piece by \npiece, than any conference report in the history of America? You will \nnever find a conference report that is reported piecemeal in the media \nof America.\n  So where was the clandestine bill? Everybody knew about it. The \nproblem is, just as before, the Democrats didn't like it. Yet they \noffered amendments. For not knowing anything about it, the \ndistinguished Democrat leader offered 21 amendments, or at least he had \nthem ready. We discussed them. The fact they didn't win them, does that \nmean the bill is no good? What would you expect when you go to \nconference? I heard somebody say we should have passed the 15 or 20 \npercent mandates for renewables. Yes, we should have. We did in our \ncommittee. But what do you know about it, the House said no. Not only \n``no,'' but ``absolutely no.'' So what do we do, throw the bill out? Of \ncourse not.\n  We have the most powerful renewable provisions in history.\n  I want to tell everybody the true facts. We have worked harder for \nthe farmers of America than anybody in history. The farmers who are \nlooking to see who is for the farmers, once and for all, you can look \nto the Republicans, not the Democrats; for the Democrats are leading a \nparade to kill the most important provision ever thought up for the \nfarmers. The Republicans are here, trying to get it done.\n\n[[Page S15334]]\n\nSenator Grassley stood in a corner with his arms out, put on the armor \nand said, ``It will be this way or we don't have a bill.'' We got it. \nAnd guess what. We are just about to throw it away.\n  If I were the farmers of America, I would ask: Who threw it away? And \nthey are going to all know, the people who killed this bill threw it \naway. And guess what. Over the last 3 or 4 days, an array of people who \nbuild wind energy and solar energy in America walked up to our office. \nIncidentally, Senator Grassley, before they opened their mouth about \nthe bill, they thanked you because they said all significant wind \nenergy will stop if this bill is not adopted. They didn't say ``tone \ndown; we will come down at half mast.'' They say it stops, because wind \nenergy is predicated upon the credits in this bill, the most \nsignificant credits in history; solar energy, the most significant \ncredits in history. Renewables will go faster and farther with this \nbill than they ever have.\n  But I don't believe you can leave here today having voted, especially \nif you vote to kill this bill, and walk out and tell people: Oh, don't \nworry, we will take care of the farmers next week. Next week is not \ngoing to come because I am aware of what it is. You will not get this \nethanol bill through the House again. So it is gone and there are some \npeople walking around liking that. Some people have a smile on their \nface. But I tell you there is no way to get this ethanol bill through \nthe House. I can't imagine another format where Senator Grassley can do \nwhat he did and we get this issue out of conference and here.\n\n  Then we have all the other things in this bill that we thought were \ninteresting and good for America. They are all falling by the wayside \nbecause, for the first time, people have brought an issue called MTBE \nto the floor and talked about it. The United States House said we ought \nto hold harmless the product called MTBE--just the product, not people \nwho spill it, not people who cheat with it, not people who, instead of \nputting it in cars pour it on somebody's lawn--we didn't protect those. \nWe just said the product is OKed by the Environmental Protection \nAgency, approved by the U.S. Government, and whether I liked it or not, \nthe House said let's hold them harmless for the product itself.\n  Frankly, I am just beginning to read some stories about the lawsuits \non MTBE. In fact, if we had another day at it, I would give you some \nthat would shock you as to what is going on in the United States with \nthese MTBE lawsuits. I can tell you there is one in one State--we got a \nmessage on it. Somebody is walking around trying to drum up the \nlawsuits. It happens to be the chairperson of the bar association of \nthe State. She went to one city that wrote us a letter and said: We \ntold her we are not interested. As far as we know there is no problem \nin our city with MTBE. Go someplace else and look for your lawsuits. \nPrecisely what I said yesterday--precisely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In addition, if you like blackouts, then you vote to \nkill this bill because this bill provides a clear, absolute remedy for \nblackouts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I think the majority leader is here. \nI yield at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. Leader, on leader time I just have very brief closing \ncomments.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member. They have done a superb \njob.\n  Several issues have come up. I want to make it clear that this vote \nis the vote on the Energy bill and on the energy provisions. People \nhave envisioned that there will be other votes, other opportunities; \nthat if this bill has not passed, we can address some of these issues \nlater in some other form.\n  First, some have made a procedural argument that if cloture is not \ninvoked this morning, we can simply recommit the bill to conference and \nstrip out a provision or two provisions and then bring it back to the \nSenate.\n  Everybody needs to understand that is not an option. The other body, \nthe House, has already approved the conference report and therefore the \nconference committee has been dissolved. It has been dissolved. There \nis no motion to recommit available. So this is the vote. If you are for \na comprehensive Energy bill, you need to vote for cloture. This is the \nvote.\n  Second, there has been some speculation, people have mentioned on the \nfloor, if we do not pass this conference report we will pull out this \nprovision or that provision and enact them separately. I wanted to \ndispel that idea as well. We are not going to pull apart pieces of this \nconference report and pass them separately. We are not going to do it. \nWe are either going to pass this Energy bill now or the individual \nprovisions that many Senators favor are not going to become law. It is \nas simple as that. I just use the example of ethanol because, as \neverybody knows, I joined the Democratic leader in offering the ethanol \namendment on the Senate floor earlier this summer.\n  I have to say it very clearly that this Energy conference report is \nthe vehicle for ethanol. We are not going to enact that as a stand-\nalone. We are not going to attach ethanol to another vehicle. To the \nSenators who favor this strong ethanol provision that we have in this \nconference report--this is the vote. You vote for cloture if you want \nto see it actually enacted into law. It is important for people to \nunderstand.\n\n  In closing, this is a good bill. It is a balanced bill. It will make \nAmerica more secure. It will make America more energy independent, and, \nas we all have talked about, it will create jobs. We should pass it \nnow. We should send it to the President. The first step right now with \nthis vote is to invoke cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, pursuant to rule XXII, \nthe Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate to the conference \n     report H.R. 6, the energy policy bill to enhance energy \n     conservation and research and development, to provide for \n     security and diversity in the energy supply for the American \n     people, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Pete Domenici, John Cornyn, Mike Crapo, Larry \n           Craig, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Michael B. Enzi, Mike \n           DeWine, Christopher Bond, Robert F. Bennett, Trent \n           Lott, Pat Roberts, Jim Bunning, Mitch McConnell, \n           Richard G. Lugar, Norm Coleman, Conrad Burns.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the quorum call is \nwaived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 6 shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are required. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings), and the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 57, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 456 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham (FL)\n\n[[Page S15335]]\n\n\n     Gregg\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Edwards\n     Hollings\n     Kerry\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). On this vote, the yeas are 57, the \nnays are 40. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the vote, prior to switching my vote for \nprocedural reasons, was 58 to 39; thus, two votes short for invoking \ncloture. As I said just prior to the vote, America needs a \ncomprehensive national energy policy, and we need it now. Congress has \nbeen debating this energy issue for a long time, for nearly 3 years. It \nis now time for us to stop talking and to deliver to the American \npeople.\n  I truly believe the bill before us, that the chairman and the other \nmembers on the Energy Committee have worked so hard to produce, is a \nfair bill. It is a balanced bill. It addresses everything from future \nblackouts to the whole discussion on development of a wide range of \nreliable energy resources. Now is the time for us to act.\n  I am very disappointed that we are, at this point, two votes short; \nthat we are facing another filibuster on a very important policy for \nthe American people. I do want to let colleagues know that this will \nnot be the last vote that we have on this bill. We are going to keep \nvoting until we pass it so we get it to the President's desk. We will \nhave at least one more vote before we leave the early part of next week \non stopping this filibuster. I don't know when that vote will be, but \nwe will have at least one more vote. I hope we will respond at that \ntime by giving the American people the energy security, the economic \nsecurity, and the job security that they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15335-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15335-S15358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I now move to proceed to the consideration \nof H.R. 2417, the Intelligence authorization conference report. Before \nthe Chair puts the question, this conference report has been cleared on \nboth sides, and I hope that we can finish action on it very quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nproceed.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in response to the leader's statement, we \nalso believe in energy independence and the security of the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not a debatable motion.\n  Mr. REID. Fine. I will withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nproceed.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2417) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2004 for \n     intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the \n     United States Government, the Community Management Account, \n     and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability \n     System, and for other purposes, having met, have agreed that \n     the House recede from its disagreement to the amendment of \n     the Senate, and agree to the same with an amendment and the \n     Senate agree to the same, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 19, 2003.)\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the distinguished \nassistant Democratic leader for a question.\n\n\n                           Energy Policy Act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say through the Chair to my colleagues, we \nalso believe in energy independence. We also believe in the security of \nthis Nation. This was a bipartisan vote that just took place. I think \nwe would all be well advised, this late in the session, to recognize \nthat we should take this bill back to the committee, conference, if \nnecessary, but I suspect it would be better off going back to committee \nand coming up with a different piece of legislation. People over here \nwant badly to have a bill. The 58 votes we have are firm votes. It \nwould not be advisable to have a vote, say, on Monday or Sunday. \nCloture is not going to be invoked.\n  But let's assume it were for purposes of this argument. Then we have \nthe situation where there are hours following that debate, and I just \nthink we should recognize where we are. The reality is, it is late in \nthe session. We need to go to some other matters. With this vote, we \ndid the Senate a favor, as everyone knows. There are points of order, \nrule XXVIII. This bill was going nowhere. We just did it quickly rather \nthan prolong it. It doesn't help the Senate to prolong the inevitable. \nThe inevitable is this bill is history. It is not going to go anyplace.\n  We really did the Senate a favor. Cloture was not invoked. There are \npoints of order against this bill, as we all know. There would be \nbipartisan votes on those matters. I think we should go on to something \nelse. This was a very good debate. I think we should look back at this \nas something that is good for the Senate in the sense that the tone was \ngood, and look forward to the very important issues we have facing us, \ndifficult issues. We have the omnibus bill. We have the important \nMedicare bill. I hope that we would not prolong things on this much \nlonger because this bill, in its present form, is just not going \nanyplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Again, to clarify for our colleagues, two votes short, as \nI implied in my statement. This policy is too important to the American \npeople for us to desert. So we are going to come back. We are going to \ncome back with another opportunity, after I talk to the Democratic \nleadership. And we will do that at the appropriate time.\n  For the information of our colleagues, we will be going to other \nissues--right now, the Intelligence authorization conference report. It \nis likely today we will be doing Healthy Forests shortly. We have a lot \nof business today. Medicare will be addressed shortly. The two Houses \nwill be addressing that today.\n  It may well be that we will begin to address issues such as Medicare \nlater today and continue debate on energy today and look at both issues \nover the course of tomorrow.\n  Again, in the intervening time, we will be addressing issues such as \nIntelligence, Healthy Forests, and other conference reports as they \ncome to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I, too, wish to have an opportunity to \ncomment briefly on the vote we have just taken.\n  Mr. President, for Senators like me, who support enactment of a \ncomprehensive energy bill, the Senate's failure this morning to break \nthis filibuster was as unnecessary as it is unfortunate.\n  It is a classic example of insisting on provisions that were simply \ntoo much for the traffic to bear.\n  The Senate's lead negotiator, Senator Domenici, was, I believe, \nprepared to work in good faith with his House counterparts to craft a \ncomprehensive energy bill that could attract broad bipartisan support \nin this body.\n  Regrettably, his best intentions were undercut by the cynical \nmanipulations of the House Republican leadership during the conference \nproceedings, which cut Senator Bingaman out of the conference process \nand produced a product that was a far cry from the bipartisan energy \nbill that passed the Senate in July.\n  I am convinced that a true conference would have produced a much more \nbalanced energy bill than that before us today.\n  Make no mistake, however, the overriding reason for the failure of \nthis bill today was not what I consider to be its disturbing lack of \nbalance between production and conservation or between promotion of \nfossil fuels and renewable energy sources. It was the House Republican \nleadership's insistence on inclusion of retroactive liability \nprotections for MTBE shielding MTBE producers from legal exposure.\n\n[[Page S15336]]\n\n  The provision was not contained in either the House or Senate-passed \nenergy bills. In an effort to aid a major special interest, the House \nRepublicans wrote the provision so that it would specifically \ninvalidate the State of New Hampshire's lawsuit against the MTBE \nindustry.\n  So it is no surprise that New Hampshire's two Republican Senators \nchose to filibuster this bill.\n  The drive to placate a narrow special interest not only came at the \nexpense of the public, it trumped the Republican Party's own \nlegislative strategy.\n  I personally--on numerous occasions--warned Chairman Domenici, \nChairman Tauzin, and others responsible for the closely held Republican \nenergy bill conference deliberations that inclusion of this provision \nthreatened enactment of this legislation.\n  This scenario has, unfortunately, come to pass, ironically because \nthe inclusion of MTBE liability waiver was the straw that broke the \ncamel's back for many Republicans.\n  While the drumbeat of recriminations about who bears responsibility \nfor this setback had begun even before the vote, the question I am \nconcerned about is what we can do to enact a comprehensive energy bill \nquickly.\n  My first preference would be to adopt something close to the \nbipartisan energy bill that passed the Senate by overwhelming \nbipartisan votes in the current and past Congresses under the \nleadership of both parties. But experience tells us that won't happen.\n  While I fully appreciate that the current bill without MTBE liability \nrelief would still be objectionable to many Senators, there should be \nno doubt that if this provision was not included, the bill would pass \nthe Senate today and be enacted into law.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I call on the White House, and the House \nand Senate Republican leadership, to join with me to immediately strip \nout the offending safe harbor language now in the bill.\n  Further, as a demonstration of good will, I propose that safe harbor \nlanguage be eliminated for ethanol as well as MTBE.\n  Once these changes are made, the comprehensive energy bill could be \nbrought back to the Senate and the House, either as a new conference \nreport or as part of the Omnibus Appropriations bill now being readied \nfor final passage in both Chambers.\n  This simple action would have this energy bill, as imperfect as it \nis, ready for the President's signature yet this session.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, after much deliberation, I have decided to \noppose the conference report to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act.\n  The conference report before us today is a serious departure from the \ncomprehensive and balanced approach to energy policy passed by the U.S. \nSenate earlier this year by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 84 to \n14. The Senate bill carefully weighed many competing interests and \nstruck a fair and even-handed balance that would have strengthened our \nnational security, safeguarded consumers, and protected the \nenvironment.\n  The conference report has tipped the studied balance of the Senate \nbill drastically in favor of short-term business interests. \nRegrettably, I am not surprised by the sweeping changes made to the \nSenate bill because the conference report was prepared by the \nRepublican leadership behind closed doors, without the participation of \ntheir Democratic counterparts. Under these circumstances, one cannot be \nsurprised that balance was lost, and a flawed conference report \nemerged.\n  Upon review of the bill, I was initially pleased to note its positive \naspects. My completed review of the conference report, however, \nrevealed that these few beneficial provisions were far outweighed by \nthe many items injurious to the American people as a whole. The \nconference report erodes the careful web of environmental protections \nthat safeguard the public health and our natural resources. It promotes \na static energy industry by failing both to encourage the development \nof alternate fuel sources and energy efficient technologies, and does \nnothing to police the energy industry to prevent a recurrence of the \nEnron debacle. For example, the conference report does not include the \nbroad, effective prohibitions against price gouging schemes used by \nEnron and other energy trading firms, included in the Senate version of \nthe Energy bill.\n  As science has helped to illuminate the negative impacts of \nenvironmental pollutants on public health, Congress has responded by \nenacting a series of statutory protections designed to safeguard the \nAmerican people by restricting the levels of pollutants that enter our \nenvironment. The conference report substantially undermines these \nprotections.\n  For example, the report would exempt three major metropolitan areas \nfrom meeting the Clean Air Act's ozone-smog standard. While industry in \nthese areas may enjoy a respite as a result of the conference report, \npeople with asthma and other respiratory diseases will not. Moreover, \nit should be noted that this particular provision appeared for the \nfirst time in the conference report, and was never debated by the \nSenate or the House. Without such debate, my colleagues and I are \nunable to judge whether there are any mitigating factors that might \njustify a rollback of the Clean Air Act in these three cases.\n  Of direct concern to my home state of Hawaii is the treatment of \nmethyl tertiary butyl ether, MTBE, and producers of this common \ngasoline additive. As a fuel additive, MTBE helps gasoline to burn more \ncleanly, but outside of our gas tanks, MTBE is a proven cancer causing \nagent that has contaminated groundwater supplies across the country. In \nHawaii alone, there are approximately 500 known contamination sites, \nand in a state completely dependent on its isolated groundwater, this \nis an alarming statistic. Under this conference report, the State and \nits counties would have no legal recourse against the producers of MTBE \nfor the expensive process of environmental cleanup, including the \nremediation and clean up of contaminated soil, water supplies and \nwells.\n  The conference report also exempts all construction activities at oil \nand gas drilling sites from coverage under the Clean Water Act. It goes \nfurther and completely removes hydraulic fracturing--an underground oil \nand gas recovery method from coverage under the Safe Drinking Water \nAct. Domestic oil and gas production contributes significantly to the \nshort-term security of our national energy infrastructure, but I do not \nbelieve that our security interests outweigh our health interests. Nor \ndo I believe that conventional fuel sources can ever provide a long-\nterm solution to our energy security.\n  As a further blow to ongoing efforts to reduce our nation's \ndependence on conventional fuels, the Republican conferees dropped \nSenate-passed provisions that would have encouraged further research, \ndevelopment, and demonstrations of hydrogen fuel resources, for which \nHawaii is rapidly developing a keen expertise. The measure also \neliminated the broadly-supported goals for introduction of hydrogen \nfuel cell vehicles.\n  I support strong renewable portfolio standards, RPS, that provide \nincentives for producing renewable energy in this country. These \nmeasures--such as RPS for electricity, requirements for measures to \nreduce dependence on foreign oil, climate change policy, and \ntechnology--have been dropped from the conference report.\n  The conference report further dilutes efforts to reduce our \ndependence on fossil fuels by weakening Corporate Average Fuel \nEfficiency, CAFE standards. I believe that strong CAFE standards drive \nthe development and implementation of fuel efficient technologies for \nuse in cars and trucks, and history has proven the strength of this \napproach. With the volatility of international fossil fuel sources, and \nthe decline of our worldwide stock of this resource, strong CAFE \nstandards are more important than ever. By introducing a variety of new \nand difficult criteria for the administrative development of CAFE \nstandards, it will prove difficult or impossible for any President to \nstrengthen the current set of standards before being halted by industry \nlawsuits.\n  As a Senator from an island state, I am also concerned about \nprovisions that seek to weaken the laws that protect our coastlines \nsuch as the Coastal Zone Management Act, CZMA. For example, the \nconference report shortens\n\n[[Page S15337]]\n\nthe time within which states can appeal state consistency review \ndeterminations made by the Secretary of Commerce, thus limiting the \nrights of states under the CZMA.\n  The conference report also jeopardizes federal conservation lands by \nallowing the Secretary of Energy to determine the siting of \ntransmission lines through certain national forests and national \nmonuments--even over the objections of the Federal agency charged with \nmaintaining and preserving these natural treasures.\n  Mr. President, I must also express my serious concern with regard to \nthe provisions of H.R. 6 as they relate to the development of energy \nresources on Indian lands and the impact of these provisions on the \nUnited States trust responsibility for Indian lands and resources. To \nallow this bill to be passed without amendment, would, in my view, \nalter the bedrock principles upon which relations between the United \nStates and the Indian nations are founded.\n  The United States trust responsibility is perhaps the most \nfundamental principle of Federal Indian law. It was first enunciated in \n1832 by United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Marshall. It is the \npolestar which has guided the course of dealings between the Indian \ntribes and the United States over the last two centuries.\n  The United States trust responsibility for Indian lands and resources \nis derived from treaties and agreements between the Indian nations and \nthe United States, statutes, executive orders, court rulings, and \nregulations. The Congress has legislated on this basis. The Federal \ncourts have ruled on that basis, and the Executive branch has premised \npolicy on this basis and promulgated regulations based upon this \nfundamental principle of Federal-Indian law.\n  The Federal Government's trust responsibility for Indian lands and \nresources is based on the fact that the United States holds legal title \nto lands that are held in trust for Indian tribal governments. As the \nprincipal agent of the United States as trustee for Indian lands and \nresources, under current law, the Secretary of the Interior must \nauthorize and approve any activities affecting Indian lands and trust \nassets.\n  However, recently the United States Supreme Court ruled in the United \nStates v. Navajo Nation case that tribal governments may not hold the \nSecretary of the Interior accountable for mismanaging trust assets \nexcept if there is a specific authorization contained in a Federal \nstatute. As a result of this ruling, tribal governments are looking to \nthe Congress to protect longstanding principles of established trust \nlaw and to clarify with certainty the meaning of the trust \nresponsibility after the Court's pronouncement in the Navajo Nation \ncase.\n  The Indian provisions of H.R. 6 unfortunately fail to provide a means \nfor tribal governments to call upon the United States, as trustee for \nIndian lands and resources, to assist them in remedying any damages \nincurred to tribal lands, nor do they establish express statutory \nstandards for the administration of the U.S. trust responsibility.\n  The bill requires that any tribe attempting to avail itself of the \npowers to regulate and develop its own energy resources must waive its \nrights to seek any recourse against the Secretary of the Interior. This \nrequirement signals a dramatic departure from existing law, and tribal \ngovernments across the country have expressed serious concern that this \nbill will erode the United States' trust responsibility, especially in \nthe aftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling in the Navajo Nation case.\n  As tribal governments seek to further their rights to self-\ndetermination in new areas, such as the leases, agreements, and rights-\nof-way affecting tribal lands that are addressed in this bill, there \nmust also be an evolution of the duties that the trustee for Indian \nlands and resources--the United States--undertakes on behalf of tribes \ndesiring to develop energy resources.\n  My view is that there is a well-founded and long-established \npartnership between Indian tribal governments and their trustee--and \nthat it is this relationship which assures that if there is any harm or \ndamage done to tribal lands and resources caused by other parties, the \ntribes will have the full force of the United States government to \nassist them in securing redress for such harm.\n  With this end in mind, I respectfully suggested that those standards \napplicable under the Indian Self-Determination Act be incorporated into \nthis bill, such as the annual trust asset evaluation that is authorized \nin that act to be conducted by the Secretary of the Interior as a \ncondition of the Secretary's approval of a tribal government's right to \nenter into leases, business agreements, and rights-of-way without the \nSecretary's approval.\n  Unfortunately, this language was not adopted, and instead the bill \nprovides that the Secretary will have the discretion to determine the \nmanner in which trust resources will be managed, and what, if any, \nongoing oversight there will be as tribal governments move into an \narena that is associated with serious financial and environmental \nrisks.\n  In addition, in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in the Navajo \nNation case, the absence of expressly-stated statutory standards for \nthe administration of the government's trust responsibilities as they \nrelate to the development of energy resources on Indian lands is, I \nbelieve, a further derogation of the trust relationship that cannot be \noverstated.\n  In another section of the bill, state and tribal governments are \neffectively excluded from the process by which conditions for the \noperation of hydropower projects are established, and as a result, the \nprotection of fish and wildlife resources is left up to those for whom \nthe financial incentives to reduce costs at the expense of the survival \nof fish and wildlife resources are great.\n  There are many in Indian country who share these concerns, and would \nperhaps express them more strongly than I have been able to do. We do \nnot have a record of which we can be proud when it comes to our \ndealings with the first citizens of this land, and I fear that this \nmeasure will not mark a new, more constructive direction in Federal-\nIndian relations.\n  Mr. President, two men involved in the process of bringing this \nconference report to the floor for a vote--Senator Pete Domenici and \nSenator Ted Stevens--are very dear to me and I have the honor of \nworking with them on a daily basis. I hope they will understand that, \nas much as I would like to support them and their interests, I must \noppose this conference report.\n\n\n                            ethanol subsidy\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for several years now I have worked with \nthe highway community to hold the Highway Trust Fund harmless with \nrespect to the ethanol subsidy. While it is good agriculture and energy \npolicy to encourage alternative fuels, it should not be the Highway \nTrust Fund, and therefore the Nation's transportation system, that \nbears the burden of the ethanol subsidy.\n  A few years ago I introduced a bill that transferred revenue from the \ngeneral fund to the Trust Fund so it could be the general fund that \nwould bear the responsibility rather than the Trust Fund.\n  This Congress, Senator Grassley and I introduced a bill, S. 1548, \nthat replaced the ethanol exemption with a credit and that transferred \nthe 2.5 cents, currently retained by the general fund to the Highway \nTrust Fund. Although other provisions in S. 1548 are now contained in \nthe energy bill conference agreement, including the new ethanol credit, \nthe provisions most important to me did not make it in.\n  I appreciate your commitment and that of Speaker Hastert and Ways and \nMeans Chairman Thomas to ensure that the provisions in S. 1548, \nregarding the Highway Trust Fund will be enacted no later than February \n29, 2004 which is the day that the TEA 21 extension expires.\n  In fact, Speaker Hastert sent out a press release today that confirms \nhis commitment to enacting these important provisions from S. 1548.\n  I thank Senator Frist for working with me to ensure that the Highway \nTrust Fund will receive all the taxes due to it and that our Nation's \ntransportation program will thrive.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I extend my gratitude to Senator Baucus for \nworking together with the Vice President, the Speaker of the House and \nmyself to reach a compromise on the ethanol issue in the energy bill \nconference\n\n[[Page S15338]]\n\nagreement. We understand this is a very important issue to him and to \nthe country and his efforts on this matter have been crucial to \ndeveloping a strong energy policy.\n  As per the agreement, I would like to reiterate our commitment \nregarding the portions of the ethanol issue which are not currently in \nthe conference agreement. In the next highway bill, we will make \ncertain that the 2.5 cents that currently goes into the General Fund, \nas well as the proceeds from repealing the 5.2 cents from the ethanol \ntax exemption, are credited to the Highway Trust Fund. Moreover, it \nwould be my desire to hold the Highway Trust Fund harmless with respect \nto this late date of enactment.\n  Once again, I thank Mr. Baucus for working closely with us to resolve \nthis very important issue. We look forward to enacting these \nprovisions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there are several provisions in this \nconference report that amend the Commodity Exchange Act, which is \nadministered by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  I appreciate the Energy Committee's consultation with the Agriculture \nCommittee with respect to the amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act.\n  The most important change to the act is to the CFTC's antifraud \nauthority in section 4b, which is found in section 33 of the conference \nreport. Section 4b is the CFTC's main antifraud weapon. In November, \n2000, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled in \nCommodity Trend Service, Inc., v. CFTC, 233 F.3d 981, 992 (7th Cir. \n2000) that the CFTC could only use section 4b in intermediated \ntransactions, thus prompting this clarification. We are amending \nsection 4b to provide the CFTC with clear antifraud authority over non-\nintermediated futures transactions. Newly revised subsection 4b(a)(2) \nprohibits fraud in transactions with another person that are within the \nCFTC's jurisdiction. This new language will make it clear that the CFTC \nhas the authority to bring antifraud actions in off-exchange principal-\nto-principal futures transactions, including retail foreign currency \ntransactions and exempt commodity transactions in energy and metals. In \naddition, the new section 4b also clarifies that this fraud authority \napplies to transactions conducted on derivatives transaction execution \nfacilities as well. The amendments to section 4b(a) of the CEA \nregarding transactions currently prohibited under subparagraph (iv) are \nnot intended to affect in any way the CFTC's historic ability to \nprosecute cases of indirect bucketing of orders executed on designated \ncontract markets. See, e.g., Reddy v. CFTC, 191 F.3d 109 (2nd Cir. \n1999); In re DeFrancesco, et al., CFTC Docket No. 02-09 (CFTC May 22, \n2003) (Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions as to \nRespondent Brian Thornton).\n\n  The next important changes, or clarifications, come in section 9 of \nthe Commodity Exchange Act that deals with CFTC's false reporting \nauthority. These clarifications are also found in section 332 of the \nconference report.\n  In the last 12 months the CFTC has received approximately $100 \nmillion in settlements from energy trading firms accused of filing \nknowingly inaccurate reports. Despite these successes, the amendment to \nsection 9(a)(2) has been included in the legislation in response to a \nrecent U.S. Federal District Court decision in the criminal case of \nU.S. v. Valencia, No. H-03-024 (S.D. Tex.). In this case, the U.S. \nattorney brought a criminal case against an energy trader for filing \nfalse reports regarding fictitious natural gas transactions in an \nattempt to manipulate natural gas price indexes. The Court, recognizing \nthat the U.S. attorney had to show intent for knowingly inaccurate \nreports, dismissed some of the false reporting counts because there \narguably was no intent requirement for false or misleading reports. The \nCFTC consistently has maintained that an intent to file a false report \nis necessary for there to be a violation of section 9(a)(2). \nAccordingly, to address the concerns of the Court in Valencia, section \n9(a)(2) will be revised by inserting the word knowingly in front of \nboth false and misleading so it is clear that the CFTC and the U.S. \nattorneys must show intent.\n  The legislation also includes an amendment clarifying Congress' \nintent that section 9 provides a civil enforcement remedy to the CFTC, \nin addition to criminal prohibitions. This amendment merely clarifies \nand confirms the CFTC's longstanding use of section 9, as the CFTC has \nbrought over 60 enforcement actions charging violations of its \nprovisions, including but not limited to false reporting charges under \nsubsection (a)(2).\n  These amendments will permit the CFTC and U.S. Attorneys to continue \nto bring false reporting cases in the energy arena for acts or \nomissions that occurred prior to enactment. The bill expressly provides \nthat these amendments simply restate, without substantive change, \nexisting burden of proof provisions and existing CFTC civil enforcement \nauthority, and do not alter any existing burden of proof or grant any \nnew statutory authority.\n  The last amendment I will mention is a set of savings clauses for the \nNatural Gas Act and the Federal Power Act. These savings clauses are \nintended to help clarify the dividing line between the jurisdiction of \nthe CFTC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The two savings \nclauses, which are virtually identical, can be found in section 332 and \nsection 1281 of the conference report.\n  The savings clauses have two purposes. The first purpose is to make \nit clear that nothing in the Natural Gas Act or the Federal Power Act \naffects the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC with respect to \naccounts, agreements and transactions involving commodity futures and \noptions. The CFTC, not FERC, has exclusive jurisdiction over commodity \nfutures and options. This exclusive jurisdiction extends to futures and \noptions on natural gas, electricity and other energy commodities, \nregardless of whether the futures or options contract goes to delivery, \nis cash settled or offset in some other fashion.\n  The second purpose of the savings clauses is to clarify that FERC \nshould follow the existing Commodity Exchange Act statutory scheme for \nrequesting futures and options trading data from futures exchanges \nthrough the CFTC. Section 8 of the Act recognizes the highly sensitive \nnature of futures and options trading data and specifically restricts \nits public disclosure except in very limited circumstances. The \nregulatory scheme of the act ensures the confidentiality of futures and \noptions trading data and is one of the reasons that investors have such \nconfidence in the U.S. futures markets. FERC can and should be able to \nobtain futures and options trading data by directing its request to the \nCFTC not to a futures exchange such as the New York Mercantile \nExchange. The CFTC has a long history of sharing futures and options \ntrading data with other Federal and State regulators that agree to \nabide by the public disclosure restrictions found in section 8. The \nsavings clauses assure that requests for futures and options trading \ndata will be processed in the same way and be subject to the same \nprotections.\n  I believe the clarifications to the Commodity Exchange Act included \nin the conference report will only strengthen what is already a strong \nand sensible regulatory program administered by the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, and I support passage of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nenergy bill conference report and urge its quick passage. I am deeply \ntroubled by the misinformation being cast about by opponents of this \nbill on the Senate floor and in the press. I would like to take just a \nmoment and distinguish some of the fact from fiction.\n  First, opponents of the bill have been criticizing the energy bill's \nelectricity provisions. They have made sensationalistic allegations \nabout Enron and the August blackout, among others, and conclude that \nthis bill does nothing to improve our Nation's electricity grid. If \nopponents of this bill were to take the time to read the bill they have \nbeen so fervently criticizing, they would have reached far different \nconclusions.\n  Opponents have been desperately trying to color a good piece of \nlegislation with known bad guys. I don't know how many times I have \nheard Enron thrown around, but never have those folks mentioned that \nthis bill includes significant market transparency, consumer \nprotection, and improved enforcement provisions. The fact: this bill \nimproves matters.\n\n[[Page S15339]]\n\n  Second, critics have criticized this bill for shielding MTBE \nproducers from product liability lawsuits. Many of those Senators \nrepresent States that have sued MTBE producers for contaminating \ngroundwater. On one hand, I appreciate why they object to that \nprovision. My State of Colorado too is searching for ways to meet \nfunding shortfalls, and groundwater out West is always a premium. \nHowever, MTBE isn't in groundwater because someone put it there. MTBE \nis in groundwater because the underground storage tanks made to hold \ngasoline with MTBE leaked.\n  Another fact: Congress mandated MTBE's use, requiring the oxygenate \nbe added to gasoline to meet Clean Air Act requirements.\n  My friends on the other side should focus on fairness, and not just \nthe deep pockets their trial lawyer friends are after. Fairness is the \nspecial interest opponents of the bill are so adamant on vilifying.\n  Opponents of the energy bill conference report have made outlandish \nclaims that this bill does nothing for renewable energy. Again, such \nstatements beg the question; have they bothered to read the bill? The \nfact of the matter is that this bill includes significant financial \nincentives for wind, biomass, and solar energy, and has the full \nsupport of the Solar Energy Industries Association. Further, the bill \nrequires that 7.5 percent of electricity purchased by the Federal \nGovernment come from renewable energy.\n  Opponents have criticized the Indian energy title of the bill as \noffensive to the environment. They claim that if Indians opt-in to the \nvoluntary provisions, then those tribes can skirt NEPA. Without \ntouching the prejudicial nature of that statement--the assumption that \nIndians would violate the environment--I seriously doubt that opponents \nknow why NEPA might apply at all. Under current law, if a tribe wanted \nto build an energy production facility on their own land with their own \nmoney, NEPA would not apply. NEPA only applies on Federal land or when \nthere is some Federal action. Although some critics may like to think \notherwise, Indian land is treated as their own land. In the example \nabove, there is no Federal action.\n  However, if the Nation's most disenfranchised and poverty stricken \ngroup seeks third-party funding to develop their own resources, then \nthe Secretary of Interior must review the proposed project. This \npaternalistic Secretarial review, a historical construct in the law, is \ntantamount to Federal action triggering NEPA. Indians believe that \ntheir lands should be treated like other private land under the law.\n  Opponents of this bill are playing a cruel joke on Indians. On one \nhand, they argue that Indians should be free to exercise their right to \nself-determination. Yet, on the other hand they tell the poorest of the \npoor that they must do so without any third-party financing. It seems \nthat opponents of this bill believe that, for Indians, self-\ndetermination may only be exercised through posing for tourist photos \nand making handcrafts.\n  The Indian Energy title in the bill under discussion provides Indians \nwith a completely voluntary tool that could help them to develop their \nown resources. This title could be a significant empowerment vehicle \nproviding much needed jobs and economic development.\n  Last, my friends on the other side have made several statements \ncriticizing this bill's process. In part, I have to agree with them. \nSimilar to the failed energy bill of the democratically controlled \n107th Congress that never benefited from being drafted in the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, the current energy bill has reached \nthe floor in an imperfect way.\n  However, the fact of the matter is that the energy bill of the 108th \nCongress is a far reaching piece of legislation that is good for the \ncountry, good for my State of Colorado, which still relies heavily on \nthe agricultural industries, and good for workers. It is important to \nnote that all manner of farm groups support this bill, including the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, the American Corn Growers, the National Farmers \nUnion, and the National Cattleman's Beef Association. Furthermore, this \nbill is supported by a host of labor organizations; the Brotherhood of \nLocomotive Engineers, the United Mine Workers, and the United \nTransportation Union, to name just a few.\n  Mr. President, the comprehensive energy bill before the Senate is a \ncritical piece of legislation for the country. Its writers had the \nunenviable task to ask the questions that most in the Nation are never \nrequired to consider--where does our energy come from, and how can we \nmeet future demand? This bill provides important answers and plans for \nthe future. I urge its passage.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the energy \nbill. I wanted to support this bill, but the many environmentally \nquestionable provisions and the large price tag prevent me from doing \nso.\n  This bill is not an energy policy bill. It is a special interest \nbill. We are at war in two countries, and we receive more than 50 \npercent of our oil from sources beyond our shores. But this bill does \nnot provide a way for us to break free from the security threat that \nposes. It lacks clear vision for how this country moves away from our \ndependence on foreign oil and dirty fuel and towards new, cleaner \nsources of energy.\n  There are no oil saving provisions or climate change provisions. I do \nsupport the incentives for nuclear energy, wind energy, solar energy \nand other renewable energy sources. I also support the provisions for \ntax credits for the sale of hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles. The \nrepeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act and reform of the \nPublic Utility Regulatory Act's mandatory purchase obligation are \npositive changes. But I can't get past the MTBE liability waiver, the \ncoastal zone management changes, and the huge tax credits for the oil \nand gas industry. Half of the tax benefits--approximately $11.9 billion \nof the $22.9 billion--in tax provisions will go to the oil and gas \nindustries, some $72 billion in authorized spending, a 50 percent \nincrease over the price tag going into conference. And this price tag \nis not offset anywhere in this budget.\n  With regard to MTBE, my State of Florida has more MTBE spills than \nany other State in the country--more than 20,000--and those communities \nin Florida may be held responsible for the cleanup of those sites if \nthe liability waiver in this bill passes. And the ratepayer in these \ncommunities, instead of the producers of MTBE, will have to pay the \nprice for the cleanup.\n  In fact, a lawsuit filed by Escambia County Utilities Authority would \nbe nullified by this bill. And at least 11 other water systems serving \n629,000 people will be prevented from seeking redress from the refiners \nof MTBE who caused the contamination.\n  My staff talked to the Executive Director of the Escambia County \nUtilities Authority, Steve Sorrell, and he told my staff that if \nEscambia's suit cannot go forward the County will be on the hook for an \nexpensive cleanup and the ratepayer will have to pay the price. So if \nthis energy bill passes, the main cause of action in Escambia County \nFL's suit will be taken away and the ratepayers, the citizens of \nEscambia County, not the producers or oil refiners, who knew this \nsubstance was a health and environmental hazard when it was introduced, \nwill pay the price.\n  Some have said that we shouldn't hold the producers responsible for \nthe contamination, they just produced the MTBE. They didn't know it was \na health risk or environmental hazard.\n  But the successful lawsuits have uncovered that the refiners did know \nit was a health and environmental risk and why not let the courts \ndecide whether they are at fault instead of the U.S. Congress. In a \ndocument dated April 3, 1984 an MTBE producer employee said:\n\n       We have ethical and environmental concerns that are not too \n     well defined at this point; e.g., 1. possible leakage of \n     [storage] tanks into underground water systems of a gasoline \n     component that is soluble in water to a much greater extent \n     [than other chemicals], 2. potential necessity of treating \n     water bottoms as a ``hazardous waste,'' [and] 3. delivery of \n     a fuel to our customers that potentially provides poorer fuel \n     economy . . .\n\n  Another memo by an energy company engineer in 1984 is even more \negregious.\n  This memo says:\n\n       Based on higher mobility and taste/odor characteristics of \n     MTBE, Exxon's experiences with contaminations in Maryland and \n     our knowledge of Shell's experience with\n\n[[Page S15340]]\n\n     MTBE contamination incidents is estimated to increase three \n     times following the widespread introduction of MTBE into \n     Exxon gasoline . . .\n\n  Later the memo notes:\n\n       Any increase in potential groundwater contamination will \n     also increase risk exposure to major incidents.\n\n  These memos were written more than 5 years before the Clean Air Act \namendments passed that ushered in the widespread use of MTBE in \ngasoline. These documents were uncovered in lawsuits in California in \nwhich manufacturers and distributors of MTBE, the very entities \nimmunized from product liability suits in this bill, were found guilty \nof irresponsibly manufacturing and distributing a product they knew \nwould contaminate water. The jury found by ``clear and convincing \nevidence'' that these companies acted with ``malice'' by failing to \nwarn customers of the almost certain environmental dangers of MTBE \nwater contamination.\n  The coastal provisions of this bill are also troubling. Under section \n321, of the Oil and Gas title, the Secretary of the Interior will be \ngiven broad new authority to grant leases, easements or right-of-ways \non the Outer Continental Shelf in moratorium areas. Interestingly, this \nprovision left the Senate prohibiting these oil and gas activities in \nthe moratorium areas, but came back allowing those projects to go \nforward in moratorium areas--without input from the Department of \nCommerce as required under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. \nSection 325 restricts the appeals process for coastal states appealing \nan oil or gas exploration or development plan to the Department of \nCommerce. The timeline put in place by this provision is even shorter \nthan that requested by the Bush administration. Section 330 circumvents \nthe Coastal Zone Management Act and deems the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission record the record for a Coastal Zone Management Act appeal--\nlimiting a State's input into the process. For these reasons, I cannot \nsupport the bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, there is an old adage we have heard many \ntimes that says that the journey of a thousand miles begins with a \nsingle step. Today we are taking another one of those steps in a long \njourney that will hopefully lead to an increase in our energy \nindependence, more reliable sources of energy, and more stable prices \nthat are not so subject to fluctuations in the energy market.\n  The bill we have before us is something that will truly affect every \nAmerican, no matter their age, where they work, where they live, or \nwhat activities they pursue in life. One of the many things that bonds \nus as Americans is our love of so many things that makes us consumers \nof energy. No matter who you are, you are a strong and vital part of \nthat market.\n  If you drive a car, you won't get very far without a full tank of \ngas.\n  If you use a computer, you have to tie it to some source of \nelectricity to get the power you need to access the Internet or the \ninformation stored on your hard drive.\n  If you live in a mobile home, or in a cabin in the woods and cook \nyour food over an open fire, you are still an energy consumer who is \nusing a resource to make your dinner.\n  Every lifestyle has its own energy needs and we have been incredibly \nblessed to have had access to an abundance of energy for many, many \nyears.\n  In fact, we had such relatively easy access to energy we started to \ntake it for granted. That led to calls for conservation and more wise \nuse of our resources when energy costs first started to rise. That was \nthe start of our journey to create an energy policy--one that has seen \nus through these past years. Unfortunately, it has taken quite a long \ntime to agree on an update to our policy, one that takes into \nconsideration the changes we have seen in our society and in the \navailability of energy both here and abroad.\n  Our dependence on foreign sources of energy continues to be a \nnational concern, one that had me and many others calling for the \ncreation of a national energy policy, which we have done since 1973 \nwhen OPEC and the Saudi Arabians first pulled the plug on our supply of \ncrude oil.\n  The irony was the fact that we had an abundance of oil here in the \nUnited States at the time. In fact, we still have a huge supply of oil \nin the country today, but that oil has not been made available for \nexploration. Because we hadn't taken the steps to develop it, we \nallowed a foreign government to disrupt and control part of our daily \nlives. We became vulnerable to their manipulations and it took us \nmonths to recover. In some ways, we are continuing to recover from \nthose days of the long gas lines, high prices and short supplies that \nwe saw in the 1970s.\n  Things were bad enough back then when we didn't have an energy \npolicy. Still, they could have been much worse. I shudder to think what \nmight have happened if we'd had a situation like 9/11 occur at the \nheart of that crisis. If the terrorists had struck when we were \neconomically crippled and energy supplies were low, what effect could \nthey have had on our national security?\n  That kind of scenario is exactly the kind of thing that a national \nenergy policy like the one we are taking up today is supposed to avoid.\n  It has taken us quite a while to get where we are, but we finally \nhave something before us that will provide us with a plan, a blueprint \nfor the future that will also address our needs in the present. It is \ntime now for us to take it off the planning board and put it into \naction. After all, 30 years ought to be enough time to put the basics \nof a plan together, and that is how long we have had since the energy \ncrisis of the 1970s to work out a plan like this. Now we have before us \nthe beginning of what will be a long and continuing effort to stabilize \nour energy markets and protect our national security.\n  This bill isn't perfect, but it is a good start. It is more than a \nbeginning, but it is not the final answer. It is a temporary remedy \nthat will start producing results immediately while it lets us continue \nworking on a more permanent solution. In other words, it is a chance to \ngrab the brass ring and get another ride on the energy merry-go-round, \nwhile providing for the ride we are currently on.\n  I am pleased that this bill includes a number of important provisions \nthat support and promote clean coal development. Coal is an important \nproduct of Wyoming, and one of the most important ways we can reduce \nour dependence on foreign energy is to find ways to diversify our \nenergy supplies and better utilize our Nation's abundant coal \nsupplies--especially clean burning coal like what we mine in Wyoming.\n  In addition to our coal supplies, in recent years our new energy \ndevelopment has focused on the increased use of natural gas. I support \nnatural gas development and I hope that our gas industry continues to \ngrow and flourish. IO am also keenly aware of the fact that there isn't \nenough natural gas or infrastructure available to supply all of the \nworld's energy needs so we are going to have to continue relying on \ncoal for some of our energy uses.\n  That does not mean we have to continue doing business as usual and \ncontinue to push our aging coal-fired power plants well beyond their \noriginally designed lifetimes. We have the technology and the ability \nto design and build cleaner and more efficient power plants that \nutilize new clean coal technology, but we won't be able to do that if \nwe cripple our economy and prohibit new development.\n  This won't surprise anyone, but none of us are going to be \nenthusiastic about everything in this bill. Again, it is not a perfect \nbill, but it is a good start on a policy. It does not have everything I \nwant in it, but it does have more than enough to make it worth our \nsupport. There is a provision that would have greatly helped Wyoming \nget the more than $400 million that it is owed by the Federal \nGovernment through the Abandoned Mine Lands Trust Fund, but that \nprovision was not included in this bill. We have received assurances \nfrom the Finance and Energy Committees that they would take up this \nmatter early next year, and we are grateful for their commitments. \nHowever, I would have preferred that the provision had been included in \nthis bill and we didn't have to take up any of the committee's time \nnext year. Still, again, on balance, and taking the whole bill into \nconsideration, it is a good bill and it deserves our support.\n  I know I am not the only one who feels that one provision or another\n\n[[Page S15341]]\n\ncould have been added or left out and it would have made for a better \nbill. Like me, almost every State can point at something that they wish \ncould have been included but was not. It is a reason to be \ndisappointed, but it's not a reason to ignore the task at hand, which \nis to continue the process and develop a national energy policy.\n  There are just too many positive things that the bill would do for \nthe country in the long and short term. To begin with, the bill would \ncreate nearly 1 million jobs and implement mandatory electricity \nreliability standards that we believe may prevent future massive \nblackouts as was experienced in August by the Northeast.\n  It would encourage the Federal Government to increase energy \nefficiency in Federal installations.\n  It would increase assistance for lower income families by raising the \nbase authorization of LIHEAP to $3.4 billion. The bill also includes \nincentives to increase solar, wind, geothermal and other biomass \ntechnologies.\n  It encourages modernizing and streamlining our Nation's hydropower \nlaws.\n  It provides incentives for responsible oil and gas development and \nroyalty relief for marginal wells. In other words, it helps keep wells \nthat are slow, but long-term energy suppliers going so we don't always \nhave to rely on short-term, get-rich-quick wells for all of our energy \nneeds.\n  It provides incentives to encourage consumers to purchase more hybrid \nand alternative fuel vehicles and authorizes two new programs that \nwould improve the efficiency and quality of our Nation's fleet of \nschool buses.\n  There are a number of other provisions included in this bill that \nwill contribute to our Nation's energy security and I hope my \ncolleagues will take the time to look at what is in this bill for what \nit really is: A desperately needed and all-important first step toward \na policy that will increase our energy independence, ensure we have a \nmore reliable supply of energy available, and a more stable energy \nmarket for consumers to purchase from with prices that are not so \nsubject to as much fluctuation and change.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee for his leadership on this challenging bill both on \nthe Senate floor and through the conference. This is the first \ncomprehensive energy legislation this country has seen in more than a \ndecade, and it is a huge step forward for America. This energy bill is \nabout looking forward to our future, and creating the energy and the \njobs that will keep this country best in the world.\n  This is a large and complicated bill. It addresses everything from \nenergy efficiency and conservation, to research and development for new \ntechnologies, and policies to encourage a wide variety of energy \nsources nationwide. People will always find something to criticize in a \nsweeping piece of legislation, but we need to focus on the huge \naccomplishments this bill will achieve.\n  We will advance cutting-edge technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells \nand improve clean technologies already in place like nuclear power, \nhydropower, wind, and solar energy. At the same time we will shore up \nour own domestic production of the resources we use most, including \nclean coal, oil, and natural gas. We will begin to use 5 billion \ngallons of ethanol and biodiesel annually as a result of this bill, and \nthat is a very good thing for farmers and consumers across America. \nReal reforms in the electricity title will result in more reliable \nservice and more investment in the backbone of our electricity \ninfrastructure.\n  I would especially like to acknowledge Senator Domenici's wise \ncounsel in regard to an amendment I had intended to propose to enhance \nthe economic growth of western States. My amendment would have provided \nfor the study and creation of National Interest Electric Transmission \nCorridors by the Secretary of Energy, based on national security and \nenergy policy grounds. Pursuant to those designations, the permitting \nand siting of needed electric transmission lines would be provided for. \nWhile most of this additional capacity would probably be achieved by \nbroadening existing rights-of-way, there would no doubt be some need \nfor additional rights of way. Upon the advice of the chairman and his \nassurance that he would pursue these concepts, I declined to offer that \namendment on the Senate floor.\n  I am very encouraged that the chairman has been successful in having \nthe concept of National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors \nincluded in the bill, for any area experiencing electric energy \ntransmission constraints or congestion. Transmission capacity in these \nwestern States is one of the significant issues regarding their future \neconomic expansion. Furthermore, if we could unlock the tremendous \ncoal, wind and other resources of these States through mine-mouth \nelectric generation and provide for the transmission of that \nelectricity to load centers it would take significant pressure off our \nincreasing reliance on natural gas as a power source. This is one of \nthe keys to a balanced energy portfolio and lessened reliance on \nforeign energy sources.\n  My home State of Montana can make a significant contribution to our \nNation's energy independence, provided we can develop the needed \ntransmission infrastructure to move electricity to market if we \ngenerate it from our coal and wind resources. This is very important \nfor both the generating States and the end-user markets and is simply \ngood national energy policy and good national security policy.\n  This energy bill isn't perfect, but it helps us transition into \ntomorrow's economy without sacrificing our quality of life today. It is \na good balance, and a good compromise between the countless demands \nthat have been made by those with opposing viewpoints. No one can win \nevery battle, but without this energy legislation the entire country \nloses. I am disappointed there are Members in this body who would \nrather complain about this bill than enact it. We shouldn't let \npartisanship get in the way of progress, and this bill is progress. No \none got all they wanted, but every State in the Union will benefit, and \nevery American will be better off if we ensure this country's energy \nsecurity by passing this legislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act. It has been a long, long time since \nwe could claim to have a national energy policy, and I am very proud to \nsay that we are about to deliver an energy plan to the American people \nthat is comprehensive and forward looking. It is a balanced bill that \npromotes greater energy independence and cleaner air.\n  It is no simple task to construct complex legislation of such a broad \nscope. A good deal of the credit for the fact that we have a conference \nreport today goes to the heroic leadership of Chairman Domenici and \nChairman Grassley, and the respective Democratic ranking members \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Baucus. I congratulate our colleagues for \ntheir leadership.\n  And when it comes to leadership, we all know that it was President \nGeorge W. Bush who first put us on the path to a national energy plan. \nOne of the President's earliest acts was to establish the National \nEnergy Policy Development Group, which produced the National Energy \nPolicy Report, an early template for the legislation we have before us \ntoday.\n  We don't have to convince the American people that we need this \nenergy bill. They already know. They are the ones who paid more than $2 \nper gallon to fill their cars this summer. They are the ones who sat in \nblackouts for days. And, they are the ones who have watched their \nnatural gas bills go through the roof.\n  I am pleased to report to the American people that the Energy Policy \nAct addresses each of those problems--and more.\n  My State of Utah is an energy resource State. Utah has long helped to \nfuel our Nation's growth, whether it be by supplying the uranium that \nfueled our early nuclear industry, the oil and natural gas for our \nvehicles and homes, or the clean coal which powers our coal-fired \nelectricity plants. Utah has also been a leader in producing renewable \nelectricity with our large hydro-power facilities and our significant \ngeothermal plants. Thanks to environmental protections, labor laws, and \nhealth and safety regulations, our Nation is cleaner and stronger than \never before. And I am glad these protections are in place. However, the \nmany layers\n\n[[Page S15342]]\n\nof these rules and regulations do make energy production more \nexpensive. In Utah, where we have many millions of acres of beautiful \npublic lands, we have the extra difficulty of developing energy while \ntrying to preserve significant portions of scenic areas. In my State we \nwant all the protections our laws provide, but we recognize the need \nfor assistance from the Federal Government to keep this activity going \nin this country. And in doing so, this legislation leaves almost no \nstone unturned.\n  The act will help us to leap forward in creating more efficient \nbuildings and homes in this Nation, and it starts at home by addressing \ncongressional and other Federal buildings. The act takes large strides \nforward in promoting the use of renewable energy in the United States. \nThe bill also covers solar energy, wind energy, hydro power, and \ngeothermal energy, the latter being particularly important in my State \nof Utah.\n  I am pleased that the Energy Policy Act includes important provisions \nto increase the reliability of our electricity system.\n  We have seen what happens when we lack a reliable affordable \nelectricity supply; our modern society comes to a near standstill. \nReliable electricity is one of the most important services we can \nprovide our Nation. Most of the electricity produced in the United \nStates comes from coal-fired power plants. The newer coal plants which \nare prevalent in the West are very clean and very efficient. This \nlegislation promotes the most advanced technologies in this industry \nwhich will lead to further improvements in the reliability of our \nelectricity system and in the quality of our air. The bill also \nprovides programs to improve electricity service to our Native \nAmericans.\n  Importantly, the Energy Policy Act addresses our need for a more \nreliable fossil fuel supply. This includes home heating oil, natural \ngas, and our other basic transportation fuels, petroleum and gasoline.\n  The transportation sector in the U.S. accounts for nearly two-thirds \nof all oil consumption, and we are almost entirely dependent on \npetroleum for our transportation needs. Is it any wonder, that 50 \npercent of our urban smog is caused by mobile sources? If we want to \nclean our air and address our Nation's energy dependency, we must focus \non the transportation sector. And we must focus first on those \ntechnologies and alternative fuels that are already available and \nabundant domestically.\n  To that end, 14 cosponsors and I introduced S. 505, the Clean \nEfficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car Technologies Act of \n2003, or the CLEAR Act. The CLEAR Act is the most comprehensive and \neffective plan we have seen in this country to accelerate the \ntransformation of the automotive marketplace toward the widespread use \nof fuel cell vehicles. And it would do so without any new Federal \nmandates. Rather, it would offer powerful market incentives to promote \nthe advances in technology, in our infrastructure, and in the \nalternative fuels that are necessary if fuel cells are to ever reach \nthe mass market. As a result our Nation benefits from cleaner air and \ngreater energy independence.\n  I am very pleased to report that a large portion of the CLEAR Act was \nincluded in the Energy Policy Act. And for that I give my heartfelt \nthanks to Finance Committee Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus.\n  First, the bill offers CLEAR Act credits to consumers who purchase \nalternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, such as hybrid-\nelectric vehicles. These credits would lower the price gap between \nthese cleaner and more efficient vehicles and conventionally-fueled \nvehicles of the same type. This is a direct attack on our Nation's huge \nappetite for petroleum as a transportation fuel, and I am confident \nthat the CLEAR Act credits will accelerate our shift toward a more \nefficient and cleaner transportation future.\n  When I introduced the CLEAR Act, it contained a significant tax \ncredit for the installation costs of retail and residential refueling \nstations. I was disappointed that this provision was weakened in \nconference and replaced with a provision that extends and expands an \nexisting tax deduction for infrastructure. However, I am pleased that \nan infrastructure incentive did survive in the Energy Policy Act.\n  As originally introduced, the CLEAR Act also provided a very \nimportant tax credit of 50 cents per gasoline-gallon equivalent for the \npurchase of alternative fuel at retail. This would have brought the \nprice of these cleaner fuels much closer in line with conventional \nautomotive fuels and contributed significantly to the diversity of our \nfuel supply.\n  This was a very important component of the CLEAR Act that did not \nsurvive the conference process. It was important because of the \ncombination of this incentive, the infrastructure incentive, and the \nalternative fuel vehicle credit working together was meant to have a \nlarger effect on the market than could have been accomplished by \nproviding these incentives alone at different times. For instance, the \nfuel credit would have combined with the vehicle credit for an added \nincentive to consumers to buy cleaner cars. The fuel credit also would \nhave combined with the infrastructure credit for a very powerful \nincentive to install new fueling stations. The presence of more fueling \nstations also opens the way for the purchase of more clean vehicles, \nand so on. Because all three incentives are not in the final bill, we \nwill not achieve the synergy that would otherwise have been possible, \nand the potential benefits of the CLEAR Act may not be fully realized.\n  In spite of this disappointment, I am very pleased that such a large \nportion of the CLEAR Act was included in the energy bill. I can see the \nday when alternative vehicle fuels, fuel cells, and other advanced car \ntechnologies will be common. And considering the environmental and \nsecurity costs associated with our petroleum-based transportation \nsystem, that day cannot come too soon.\n  As I have outlined in my statement, the Energy Policy Act will go a \nlong way to bringing our nation into the future. It will increase our \nenergy security and clean our air. I urge my colleagues to support \nthese goals and throw their support behind it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support the \nenergy bill conference report.\n  I have long believed we need a comprehensive national energy policy. \nThe reality is that our economy depends on affordable energy. We often \ntake it for granted, but just imagine how different our daily lives \nwould be if we did not have plentiful, affordable oil, natural gas, and \nelectricity. We depend on energy in almost everything we do in our \nlives, from turning on the light in the morning, to driving our cars to \nwork, to cooking our dinner, to watching TV at the end of the day.\n  And energy is absolutely critical to the functioning of our economy. \nOur manufacturing sector uses vast amounts of energy to produce the \nwhole range of products we take for granted in stores all across the \ncountry. Our services sector--and particularly our high tech sector--\nrely on electricity. Our agriculture economy uses enormous energy \ninputs for planting, harvesting and processing its bountiful \nproduction. And without energy, we could not transport these goods and \nservices to consumers.\n  It is virtually impossible to understate the importance of energy to \nour daily lives and to our economy. Yet our energy policy is seriously \nlacking.\n  As the blackout in the northeast demonstrated last summer, our \nnational electricity infrastructure is decades old and dangerously \noverloaded. Quite simply, we have under-invested in making sure that \nthe national electricity grid can keep up with demand for electricity. \nSince 1992, demand for electricity has been growing at 2-3 percent per \nyear while transmission capacity has been growing at only .7 percent \nper year. At the same time, deregulation of the electricity industry \nhas led to a hodgepodge of control over transmission capacity, without \nclear rules and responsibility for maintaining the reliability of the \nsystem. We need new rules to improve the reliability of the grid and \nnew incentives to increase transmission capacity if we're to avoid \nfuture meltdowns.\n  And, we remain overly dependent on foreign oil. Oil imports now \naccount for nearly 60 percent of consumption, and the projection is for \nthat percentage to continue increasing inexorably. That puts our \neconomy at risk, because it is vulnerable to price spikes caused by\n\n[[Page S15343]]\n\nOPEC or supply disruptions in foreign trouble spots. And it creates \nnational security challenges. We currently rely on the vast oil \nreserves in the Middle East to meet our import demands, and that makes \nensuring the free flow of oil from that unstable, undemocratic part of \nthe world a vital national security interest. So we need an energy \npolicy that will reduce our reliance on imported oil.\n  For these reasons, I have long believed we need to update our \nnational energy policy. The bill we have before us begins to address \nthese challenges. It will improve the reliability of our electric grid. \nIt provides positive incentives for renewable energy. And it promotes \nconservation.\n  Let me be clear, though. This is not a perfect bill. It does not go \nnearly as far as I would like in addressing the issues I have outlined \nand other critical elements of a comprehensive national energy policy. \nIt contains several provisions that I do not think should be in an \nenergy bill. But on balance, it is a positive step for North Dakota and \nthe national economy, and it will mean additional jobs in my State.\n  Let me first talk about the provisions I support that will help \nensure our national energy security and benefit North Dakota.\n  First, the bill strongly promotes the use of ethanol and other bio-\nfuels. The bill will require 5 billion gallons of ethanol by 2012. And \nit will create a biodiesel tax credit of $1 per gallon for feedstocks \nsuch as canola and 50 cents a gallon for recycled feedstock such as \nrestaurant grease. These are clean and renewable fuels, and these \nprovisions are good for the environment, good for our energy \nindependence, and good for North Dakota farmers.\n  Second, I am very pleased that the bill contains a provision I fought \nfor to extend the production tax credit for wind for 3 years. North \nDakota has the highest potential for wind energy of any State in the \nNation. This provision will spur the production of wind energy \nfacilities and equipment in North Dakota. That is good for electricity \nconsumers, good for the environment, good for wind energy equipment \nmanufacturing workers, and good for farmers and others who will benefit \nfrom having wind turbines on their land.\n  Third, the bill contains a 15 percent investment tax credit to \nsupport the development of clean coal technology that will benefit \nNorth Dakota's lignite coal industry. We have a thriving lignite coal \nindustry in North Dakota, with seven lignite plants that use 30 million \ntons of lignite each year. And jobs in the lignite industry are among \nthe highest paying jobs in my State.\n  Fourth, the bill contains incentives for adding pollution control \nequipment on older coal plants and incentives for building new, more \nenvironmentally friendly coal plants. This could be a big help in \ngetting a new lignite plant in western North Dakota while maintaining \nour pristine environment, something I have been working on for years.\n  Fifth, the bill contains modest steps to promote energy conservation, \nincluding a tax credit of up to $2000 to encourage people to better \ninsulate their homes, and provisions to encourage the purchase and use \nof more energy efficient appliances.\n  Sixth, there are provisions to encourage small producers of oil and \ngas. Many people do not think of North Dakota as an oil and State, but \nwe have significant reserves that can be tapped to help reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil and address the shortage of domestic natural \ngas production. The bill includes a tax credit for marginal wells, \nprovisions to speed up permitting on Federal lands, and a section to \nencourage a particularly important process for natural gas extraction.\n  Seventh, the bill includes a set of provisions to improve the \nreliability of the national electric transmission grid, reducing the \nchances of a massive failure like the one that affected the northeast \nlast summer.\n  Eighth, the electricity title also ensures that small cooperatives \nwill not be subject to burdensome FERC jurisdiction and contains native \nload protections for co-operatives, which are a major source of \nelectricity in North Dakota. These provisions ensure that North Dakota \nrural electric co-ops can continue to provide low-cost power to their \nconsumers.\n  Finally, the bill expands and extends assistance to low income \nfamilies in meeting their home heating needs. The Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, has provided valuable assistance to \nthousands of North Dakota families in paying their winter heating \nbills.\n  Because of all these important provisions, a number of North Dakota \ngroups support the bill. These include the North Dakota Farmers Union, \nthe North Dakota Farm Bureau, the North Dakota Rural Electric \nCooperative Association, the Lignite Energy Council, and the Greater \nNorth Dakota Association.\n  As I said earlier, however, this bill is far from perfect. There are \na number of areas where it could and should have been much better.\n  For example, the conference report does not contain a Renewable \nPortfolio Standard. The bill that passed the Senate required that 10 \npercent of electricity be produced from renewable energy sources by \n2020. This modest RPS would have helped to clean up our environment and \nspurred wind energy development. I supported this provision and wish it \nhad been included in the conference report.\n  More generally, the conference report falls short on promoting the \nuse of renewable fuels and emphasizing conservation. If we are ever to \novercome our dependence on foreign oil imports, we will need to be more \naggressive on these fronts. The conference report could and should have \ndone more in this area.\n  I am also disappointed that the bill does not contain tradeable tax \ncredits to encourage cooperatives and municipal utilities to further \ninvest in renewable energy sources. Tradeable credits would have \nleveled the playing field for these electricity suppliers as we build \nwind farms and other renewable energy facilities. The conference report \ncould and should have included this provision.\n  And I do not believe the conference report goes nearly far enough in \ncreating new incentives for expanding transmission capacity to reduce \nthe risk of blackouts. I had hoped the conference report would contain \nprovisions to eliminate the transmission bottleneck that is preventing \nmy state from expanding lignite and wind energy plants to export more \nelectricity to regional markets. Here again, the conference report \ncould and should have done more.\n  Finally, the bill contains a number of unnecessary provisions that I \ndo not support. The liability waiver for the dangerous fuel additive \nknown as MTBE--or methyl tertiary butyl ether--is troubling. Clean Air \nAct changes that will allow certain cities to postpone compliance with \nreductions in ozone damaging pollutants have nothing to do with \npromoting sound energy policy and should not be in the bill.\n  I believe we have more work to do to produce a truly comprehensive \nenergy policy that addresses our energy, economic and national security \nchallenges. In particular, I will continue to push for an expansion of \ntransmission capacity to protect against the failure of our electricity \ngrid and allow North Dakota to increase its exports of electricity. It \nis my hope that we will be able to work on these issues in a bipartisan \nmanner.\n  Despite its shortcomings, on balance the bill before us takes \npositive steps to address our Nation's energy needs. It will encourage \ndomestic energy production, promote renewable fuels, and modestly \nencourage conservation to help reduce our reliance on foreign oil. It \nwill help to reduce the likelihood of major transmission breakdowns.\n  And it will provide significant benefits to my State of North Dakota. \nEnergy is the second largest sector of the North Dakota economy, and it \nwill benefit very directly from a number of provisions in the bill. And \nagriculture, the largest sector of the North Dakota economy, will also \nsee important benefits from the various renewable fuel incentives.\n  For those reasons, I support the conference report.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to announce my support for \nthe Energy Policy Act of 2003. I want to thank Chairmen Grassley and \nDomenici and Senators Baucus and Bingaman for working with me to \ninclude renewable energy and energy efficiency provisions important to \nmy home State of Arkansas. While some may say this bill is not perfect, \nit is a step toward reducing our dependence on foreign oil and\n\n[[Page S15344]]\n\nincreasing the use of renewable resources in this country.\n  Nine months ago, I stood before this body and spoke on the dangers of \ncontinued reliance on foreign sources of energy. Today, I am pleased to \nstand here in support of a bill that includes several provisions I \nbelieve will take our country's energy policy in the right direction. I \nknow this bill is not perfect, and I am disappointed that some of my \ncolleagues who have been leaders on this issue for many, many years \nwere excluded from the drafting of this bill.\n  But I am pleased that those who did draft this bill made an effort to \naddress energy concerns in every sector of this industry. In Arkansas, \nwe have investor owned utilities and co-operatives. This bill will help \nboth of these providers serve their customers in a more efficient and \nreliable manner. And while this bill may not go as far as some would \nlike in the direction of renewable energy, there are many provisions in \nthis package which will help the United States begin the long process \nof eliminating our dependence on foreign oil. I believe the renewable \nfuel standard, requiring our government to purchase at least 5 percent \nof its energy from renewable sources, represents a positive step toward \nthis goal. I personally fought to include provisions that will \nencourage greater use of renewable resources, increased production of \nefficient appliances, and greater investment in delivering fuels to \nrural America.\n  In Arkansas, we recognize the importance of renewable fuels in \nhelping the United States to become more energy-independent. That's why \nI am excited about the provisions in this bill that will encourage \ngreater use of a valuable new alternative fuel, biodiesel. Biodiesel, \nwhich can be made from just about any agricultural oil, including oils \nfrom soybeans, cottonseed, or rice, is completely renewable, contains \nno petroleum, and can be easily blended with petroleum diesel. It can \nbe added directly into the gas tank of a compression-ignition, diesel \nengine vehicle with no major modifications. Biodiesel is completely \nbiodegradable and non-toxic, contains no sulfur, and it is the first \nand only alternative fuel to meet EPA's Tier I and II health effects \ntesting standards. Biodiesel also stands ready to help us reach the \nEPA's new rule to reduce the sulfur content of highway diesel fuel by \nover 95 percent. These tax credits are necessary as biodiesel is not \nyet cost-competitive with petroleum diesel.\n  This legislation will provide tax incentives for the production of \nbiodiesel from agricultural oils, recycled oils, and animal fats and \nwill ensure that biodiesel becomes a central component of this Nation's \nautomobile fuel market. This legislation is identical to language \nauthored by myself and Senator Grassley included in the last Congress's \nEnergy Bill. It is intended to be a starting point for our debate and \ndiscussion as we draft an energy bill for consideration in this \nCongress.\n  This legislation will provide a partial exemption from the diesel \nexcise tax for diesel blended with biodiesel. Specifically, the bill \nprovides a one-cent reduction for every percent of biodiesel from \nvirgin agricultural oils blended with diesel up to 20 percent.\n  The legislation will also provide a half-cent reduction for every \npercent of biodiesel from recycled agricultural oils or animal fats. \nWith today's depressed market for farm commodities, biodiesel will \nserve as a ready new market for surplus farm products. Investment now \nin the biodiesel industry will level the playing field and create new \nopportunities in rural America. This bill also contains a provision I \nfought for that will provide a tax credit for production of fuels from \nanimal and agricultural waste.\n  Thanks to new technological developments, we can now produce \nsignificant quantities of alternative fuels from agricultural and \nanimal wastes in an environmentally-friendly manner. The production \nincentives included in this bill will assure implementation and \ncommercialization of this new generation of technology. I am also \npleased this bill includes language to encourage additional collection \nand productive use of methane gas generated by garbage decomposing in \nAmerica's landfills. Landfill gas is a renewable fuel that can be used \ndirectly as an energy source for heating, as a clean burning vehicle \nfuel, and as a hydrogen source for fuel cells. Furthermore, it can \npower generators to produce electricity. There are compelling \nenvironmental reasons to encourage these projects.\n\n  Even the large landfills that are required under the Clean Air Act to \ncollect their gas and control non-methane organic compounds often find \nit more cost-effective to simply flare or otherwise waste the gas \nrather than use the methane to produce electricity. Some smaller \nlandfills are not required to collect the gas, and may continue to emit \nit for decades under the Clean Air Act. Thus, landfill gas projects \nwill not only reduce local and regional air pollution while yielding a \nrenewable source of energy, they will also reduce the country's yearly \nemissions of greenhouse gases by a very substantial amount at a \nrelatively small cost. I also worked to include a provision that will \nencourage new waste-to-energy facilities to produce electricity \ndirectly from the combustion of our trash. Arkansas stands with other \nenvironmentally conscious States in understanding that waste-to-energy \ntechnology saves valuable land and significantly reduces the amount of \ngreenhouse gases that would have been released into our atmosphere \nwithout its operation. The volume of waste generated in this country \ncould be reduced by greater than 90 percent by utilizing waste-to-\nenergy facilities, and EPA has confirmed that more than 33 million tons \nof greenhouse gases can be avoided annually by the combustion of \nmunicipal solid waste. Municipal solid waste is a sustainable source of \nclean, renewable energy and I am proud to see this measure enacted into \nlaw.\n  Another provision I am extremely proud of is one that will provide a \ntax credit for the production of super energy-efficient clothes washers \nand refrigerators if those appliances exceed new Federal energy \nefficiency standards. Conservation and efficiency are the most \neffective and immediate ways to limit our energy consumption and reduce \npollution. I am confident this provision will spur manufacturers to \ndevelop super-efficient appliances that will be affordable for \nconsumers.\n  Another provision of which I am particularly proud relates to the \nclean-up of Southwest Experimental Fast Oxide Reactor, a decommissioned \nnuclear reactor near the community of Strickler, Arkansas, in the \nnorthwest corner of my State. The site is contaminated with residual \nradiation, liquid sodium, lead, asbestos, mercury, PCBs, and other \nenvironmental contaminants and explosive chemicals. I have been \nfighting to rehabilitate this site since I came to the Senate, and now \nwe know that persistence pays off.\n  SEFOR was built by the Southwest Atomic Energy Associates, a \nconsortium of investor-owned electric utilities, and the U.S. Atomic \nEnergy Commission for testing liquid metal fast breeder reactor fuel. \nSEFOR began operations in 1969 and was permanently shut down in 1972. \nAfter the reactor's useful life, the ownership of the site was \ntransferred to the University of Arkansas. The Federal Government \nhelped create these contaminants, and therefore should pay to help \nclean them up. This is great news for northwest Arkansas, because this \nsite has threatened public health and the environment in one of our \nstate's most beautiful areas for too long. I thank the conferees for \nretaining my provision related to cleaning up this site.\n  The final provision I would like to praise relates to improving our \ncountry's natural gas infrastructure. I am proud that this bill \ncontains provisions to make it easier for natural gas companies to \ndeliver clean-burning natural gas to this Nation's rural homes, by \ndecreasing the depreciation time for natural gas pipelines.\n  America's demand for energy is expected to grow by 32 percent during \nthe next 20 years and consumer demand for natural gas will grow at \nalmost twice that rate, due to its economic, environmental, and \noperational benefits. That level of natural gas use is almost 60 \npercent greater than the highest recorded level. To satisfy this \nprojected demand, we must substantially expand our existing gas \ninfrastructure and this provision will do that. These are provisions in \nthis bill that I am very proud of, but there are also provisions in \nthis bill that I am not proud of. I am very disappointed by the way in \nwhich the\n\n[[Page S15345]]\n\nissue of MTBE liability is handled in this bill. I am also disappointed \nby the lack of a renewable portfolio standard in this bill and I will \ncontinue to work to see that a RPS is enacted in coming years.\n  Our current global situation shows us just how important it is that \nwe takes steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. I hope that \nthis bill is taken for what it is: not a comprehensive solution, but a \ncertain step in the right direction. Much more work needs to be done if \nwe ever expect this country to lose its dependence on fossil fuel and \nforeign sources of energy and I urge my colleagues to continue to work \nhard until we achieve this goal.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for our national security, for our economic \nfuture, for the health of our environment, our country needs an \neffective, comprehensive national energy policy. We must free ourselves \nfrom dependence on foreign sources of energy. We must leave behind \ncostly, inefficient energy practices and invest in cutting-edge \ntechnologies that will keep our economy the most productive in the \nworld. And we must protect and heal the natural environment that we \nwill leave to our children and grandchildren.\n  The legislation before us fails to meet those needs. When I, and 83 \nother Senators, voted for the Energy Policy Act on July 31, it was very \na different piece of legislation. Unfortunately, the bill has been \ndrastically changed since then. Without sufficient discussion and input \nfrom our side of the aisle, unacceptable parts were added to this \nlegislation and crucial parts were taken away. We have been left with a \nbloated symbol of lost opportunity. I cannot support it.\n  This is not a trivial matter. This bill would set our energy policy \nfor the next 10 years; we must get it right. Consider how things have \nchanged since we last enacted an energy policy in 1992 and what new \nchallenges we will face in the next 10 years.\n  Cracks in our energy policy, both in infrastructure and regulation, \nhave become evident in the last few years. They have been most clearly \nshown during the Enron scandal and the August blackout in the Northeast \nand Midwest. These were clear signals of serious problems in the \ncurrent system. Sixty million people were affected by the blackout, and \nit cost New York City alone $1 billion. This should have been a call to \naction, but it was not. This bill fails to address the weaknesses in \nour electrical grid that were exposed over the summer.\n  The Federal Energy Regulation Commission is prohibited in this bill, \nuntil 2007, from reforming the national power grid through mandating \nRegional Transmission Organizations, which would be necessary to ensure \nthat further blackouts don't occur. This legislation also requires \nthose who want to construct a Regional Transmission Organization to \nfoot the full bill themselves, basically guaranteeing that it won't \nhappen. I have received complaints from the Public Service Commission \nin Delaware on this very provision.\n  As our colleagues from the West Coast have reminded us so forcefully, \nEnron-style energy market manipulation was a major force in undermining \nthe energy system in that part of the country. But this bill does not \nclose the loopholes, with cute names like ``Fatboy'' and ``Get \nShorty,'' that allowed Enron to inflate their profits, and that \ndirectly caused some of the disruptive and costly power shortages.\n  The bill also rescinds the Public Utility Holding Company Act without \nproviding an adequate replacement. PUHCA has for decades protected \nenergy customers from energy corporations, like Enron, who might \nundertake predatory actions or make risky acquisitions or mergers. The \nrepeal of this legislation leaves consumers holding the bag if a power \ncompany loses money on a non-energy investment. They could just put it \non their customers' electric bills.\n  Not only does this bill not address the problems of the past, it \ndoesn't plan at all for the future. Our reliance on oil and gas today \nis inescapable, but the need to move toward something better is \nundeniable. We will invest billions of taxpayer dollars in this bill \nfor a resource that can't possibly sustain us. Our dependence on oil \nties us to internal politics of unstable countries around the world. It \ncondemns us to unsustainable levels of pollution. It should not be a \nvery radical idea to suggest that we need to shift the type of energy \nthat we use in this country. We consume almost 25 percent of the \nworld's daily production of oil, though we hold only 3 percent of the \nworld's oil reserves. This is a deficit that we will pay for with lack \nof control over our own economy and security. We are bound to the price \nfixing of Middle East suppliers and unrest in South America and the \nstates of the former Soviet Union, and we will continue to be unless we \ninvest in alternate sources of energy and curb the rate at which we \nconsume.\n  Unfortunately, this bill takes no major steps toward these goals. In \nfact, the conference refused to include renewable portfolio standards, \nsupported by 52 Senators, which would have required utilities to \ngenerate 10 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources \nby 2020.\n  To deal with our dependence on fossil fuels, we must address both \nsupply and demand. But this bill fails to provide us with a sensible \nenergy conservation program. It doesn't address the need to improve \nfuel efficiency in our cars and trucks. In that regard, we can now \ncount China among the countries with more foresight than this \nlegislation provides on the issue of automobile efficiency. And this \nbill simply dropped a measure, accepted 99 to 1 by the Senate, that \nwould have instructed the President to reduce our daily oil consumption \nby a little more than 5 percent by 2013.\n  Instead of a forward-looking policy on energy, this bill has been \nturned into a vehicle to undermine our Nation's environmental laws to \nthe benefit of fossil fuel producers. The bill spends $1.8 billion in \ntaxpayer dollars for the purchase of conventional coal-burning \ntechnologies, which reduces future demand for ``clean-coal.'' At the \nsame time, subsidies to promote the cleanest coal technologies have \nbeen cut by 20 percent.\n  It rolls back provisions of the Clean Air Act, by allowing \ncommunities to bypass compliance deadlines on ozone attainment \nstandards if they can prove that some of the pollution drifts into \ntheir area from upwind locations. Unfortunately, almost all communities \nwith poor air quality can meet this test. The result is a significant \nweakening of the Clean Air Act and a slap in the face to cities, like \nWilmington, DE, who have met clean air standards despite dealing with \nupwind pollution.\n  This is not only an environmental problem. Currently, 130 million \nAmericans are living in areas that don't comply with the air quality \nstandards, and non-compliance has been linked to an increased \noccurrence of respiratory problems. A group of health organizations \nincluding Physicians for Social Responsibility and the American Lung \nAssociation have estimated that this rollback would cause more than \n385,000 asthma attacks and nearly 5,000 hospital admissions per year.\n  The Clean Water Act has likewise been weakened. Oil and gas drilling \nsites are exempted in this bill from run-off compliance, and hydraulic \nfracturing, an oil and gas recovery technique, has been completely \nremoved from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  These are two major changes, but there are other assaults on the \nenvironment. For instance, royalties charged to oil and gas recovery \nunits on public land were reduced; offshore oil drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf was authorized; and, a Senate-approved provision, \nauthorizing research on global climate change, was eliminated. This \nbill prefers ignorance to understanding when it comes to the most \nimportant environmental issues that our planet faces today.\n  And, in perhaps the most transparent concession to special interests, \nthis bill not only waives liability, retroactively to September 5, for \nthose who have produced the toxic substance, MTBE, that is polluting \nour ground water supply, but it grants its manufacturers $2 billion in \ntransition funds and doesn't ban the additive until 2014, a provision \nwhich can be easily waived by the President or any Governor. This \nleaves those affected communities with a $29 billion clean up tab.\n  But, that is not the only tab that this bill leaves with the American \npeople. It leaves us to pay $25 billion,\n\n[[Page S15346]]\n\nmostly in pork, almost half in backward-looking tax breaks to fossil \nfuel producers. That is simply too much to be spent on a bad idea. This \nis not a roadmap, a vision on the horizon, to guide us for the next \ndecade.\n  This bill fails to give us the comprehensive energy policy our Nation \nneeds in this new century. It does nothing to free us from our \ndangerous dependence on fossil fuels. It does not set a clear course \ntoward cleaner, more efficient technologies. And it fails to protect \nour environment. In too many ways it has sacrificed the long-term \ninterests that we all share for shortsighted special interests. We can, \nwe must do better.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President I regret having to vote against this energy \npackage. The country needs a coherent energy policy to help us tackle \nthe challenges that come with economic growth. Our constituents need to \nknow that when they wake up in the morning, the lights will be on and \nthe energy to power our days will be available.\n  Our economy needs plentiful, affordable, reliable energy as we \nstruggle to climb out of a devastating period of slow growth and job \nloss. Unfortunately, this bill does more to meet the needs of special \ninterests than the needs of a growing economy.\n  We need an energy bill that leads to lower prices, a clean \nenvironment, and consumer protection. The bill before us today is a \nmissed opportunity to further any of those goals. It has come up short \nin its effort to lower natural gas prices for Wisconsin consumers. \nNatural gas prices have been a roller coaster for the people from my \nState, and we need a large long term supply to come on line. The North \nSlope of Alaska was the answer, but this bill has done little to make \nthat supply a reality.\n  Another problem plaguing consumers in Wisconsin is spikes in gas \nprices brought on by our overdependence on boutique fuels. Most \nrecently, in southeastern Wisconsin, a fire at a refinery resulted in \nconsumers paying $2 a gallon for gasoline because we could not bring in \ngasoline from other regions without violating the Clean Air Act. The \nbill before us could have limited the different blends of gasoline in \nuse around the country, so that if one area had a supply disruption, \nfuel could be imported from another region. I worked with members of \nthe Wisconsin delegation to include language to solve this problem in \nthe future, but that was not retained in the conference Committee \nnegotiations. Wisconsinites will continue to be held hostage to local \nrefineries during supply disruptions.\n  I supported provisions in the Senate energy bill that would have \ncreated a renewable fuels portfolio standard or RPS. The RPS was going \nto be an aggressive target that would have created a significant market \nfor renewable energy technologies. While the bill does contain tax \nprovisions to encourage the use of renewable energy, the RPS was a new \nand exciting effort to wean us of our addiction to fossil fuels. The \nRPS was dropped in conference, even though it had received several \nstrong votes in the Senate. Many States are creating their own RPS, but \na national requirement would have set the renewable energy industry on \na path to mainstream success. Instead, we are left with small changes \nat the margins which will not significantly affect our energy \nproduction mix.\n  High electricity prices over the last few years have made it clear \nthat consumers need better protection from unscrupulous companies. \nAgain the Senate bill contained provisions that would protected \nconsumers from the kind of price gouging schemes created by Enron. My \ncolleagues worked hard to make sure the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission had the teeth and the oversight capability to protect \nconsumers in a world without the Public Utility Holding Company Act. \nAgain the conference turned their back on the Senate provision and \nembraced House language that defends industry at the expense of State \nand Federal regulators.\n  The Congress has squandered another opportunity to craft a far \nreaching and progressive energy policy for this country. Instead we \nhave chosen to pander to special interests and create a particularly \nunsavory piece of legislative sausage. The bill before has been laden \nwith three time the tax breaks the President requested, and more than \n$100 billion in spending. We can do better than this. We should do \nbetter than this, which is why I oppose the bill and support the \nfilibuster. Congress owes it to the American people to come back next \nyear and put together a bill that meets the needs of everyone, \nconsumers and industry alike, instead of playing favorites and leaving \nthe taxpayers with the bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to take time to comment on the \nEnergy bill before us today.\n  It is disappointing that such a massive bill could do so little to \npromote our energy independence, national security, economy, or \nenvironment. It does nothing to protect our rate-payers from the type \nof energy crisis we faced in the Pacific Northwest and California. \nThose who claim otherwise are simply masking the real mission of this \nbill which is a taxpayer giveaway to the big energy companies.\n  A 1,200-page bill has much to comment on, but I will not take time to \ndetail every concern I have. I want to discuss the electricity title, \nthe lack of a true energy policy, and threats to our environment.\n  First let me discuss the electricity title of the bill. For those of \nus from the Pacific Northwest this title was of the utmost concern.\n  For over 2 years the Pacific Northwest has been struggling against \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's, FERC, effort to deregulate \nthe transmission system through its promotion of regional transmission \norganizations, RTOs, and standard market design, SMD, rules.\n  Two simple points: First, FERC had proposed a solution in search of a \nproblem that doesn't exist in the Pacific Northwest. Second, the one-\nsize-fits-all approach being promoted by FERC would neither work nor be \ncost-effective in our unique hydropower based system.\n  With those concerns in mind I have been working with many of my \ncolleagues in the Pacific Northwest and Southeast, who have similar \nregional concerns, to keep FERC from moving forward with these plans. I \nam pleased that the bipartisan group has been successful in delaying \nuntil 2007 FERC's ability to move forward with SMD.\n  While the bill delays SMD implementation, it does not permanently \nstop FERC from ultimately pursuing this power grab, and does nothing to \nstop RTO development.\n  In fact, the bill is an outright endorsement of the RTO plan, going \nso far as to provide incentives to utilities for joining such \ntransmission organizations.\n  FERC has not demonstrated that such a system in the Pacific Northwest \nwill be an economic benefit to the region and, to date, the majority of \nWashington State utilities remain opposed to the RTOs. Even with the \nSMD delay provision, this bill is a threat to the electricity system of \nthe Northwest, and I cannot add my voice to this bill's support of \nRTOs.\n  Also of great concern in the electricity title is the bill's failure \nto deal with market manipulation. The Pacific Northwest and California \nare still feeling the direct effects of the 2000-2001 energy crisis \nthat we now know was caused, in large measure, by energy companies \nmanipulating prices.\n  Given the lessons we have learned over the past 3 years, one would \nhave hoped that this Energy bill would aggressively attack these known \nmethods of market manipulation. But that is not the case. This bill \nonly bans one type of manipulation and ignores all the other \nmethodologies we know were used.\n  By remaining virtually silent on market manipulation, this bill is \ngiving a nod to energy companies to once again employ Fat Boy, Get \nShorty, and other infamous price-gouging schemes.\n  This bill is an open invitation for companies to once again seek to \nfatten shareholders' wallets at the expense of ratepayers. This is more \ntrue now that the bill repeals the Public Utility Company Holding Act, \nPUHCA, without implementing any countervailing laws to protect against \nabuse in the industry.\n  In total, this bill promotes schemes that are counter to Washington's \nrate-payers and fails to protect them against the manipulative \npractices that have already raised their rates.\n  The bill also lacks a comprehensive energy policy.\n\n[[Page S15347]]\n\n  During the past 3 years of debate on energy I have acknowledged we \nshould recognize the current importance of oil, gas, and coal in our \nenergy production today. But to ensure America's energy security for \nthe future, it must strongly promote energy efficiency, conservation, \nclean, and renewable energy sources, and should diversify our energy \nsources.\n  But rather than aggressively promoting renewable energy and \nconservation, this bill maintains the status quo. This bill directs \nbillions of taxpayer dollars to traditional energy producers who \nalready have healthy market shares and hardly need Government support.\n  Of the roughly $23 billion in tax credits in this bill, only $4.9 \nbillion, or 20 percent, would go towards renewable energy or \nconservation.\n  I support the production tax credits for wind, solar, geothermal, and \nbiomass renewable energy in this bill, but unfortunately public power \nis left out of the equation.\n  Many Washington residents are served by publicly owned utilities and \ncooperatives and they should receive the same incentives to invest in \nrenewable energy as this bill gives to the for-profit utilities.\n  Earlier drafts of the tax title included a tradable tax credit for \npublic power investment in renewables. I know that Senate Finance \ncommittee members fought for this provision, but unfortunately the \nPresident and House objected to the provision.\n  With so much of Washington and the Pacific Northwest served by public \npower utilities, it will be much harder to get these type of \ninvestments made.\n  We hear constantly that we need to decrease our reliance on oil from \nthe Middle East and yet this bill does nothing substantive to increase \nautomobile efficiency standards. The United States is the most \ntechnologically advanced country in the world. There is no reason we \ncannot build and produce more fuel-efficient cars.\n  Without addressing fuel efficiency standards, it is hard to praise \nthis bill for promoting energy efficiency or national security.\n  In the end, this bill does nothing more than preserve the status quo \nof energy production in the United States. We are not more secure, we \nare not more independent, and we have not truly diversified our \nproduction sources. All we have done is promote the traditional energy \nsources of oil, coal, and gas at the expense of our national security \nand environment.\n  This bill does serious harm to our environment and our health by \neffectively turning back the clock on decades-old environmental \nprotections.\n  First, the bill includes a provision that would amend the Clean Air \nAct to allow more delays for adhering to the EPA's smog regulations. \nThis provision is not just illogical, it is dangerous.\n  Second, the bill's provisions for our coastal regions present a \nthreat to an area my State wants protected.\n  For Washingtonians, the coastal areas are some of the most pristine \nand cherished natural areas in the State. Under this bill, these areas, \nalong with coastal areas in many other States, would be placed in \nserious jeopardy.\n  The bill would grant new authority to the Department of the Interior \nto authorize energy development projects on the Outer Continental \nShelf, OCS, including the transport and storage of oil and gas. At the \nsame time, it would undermine the rights of States to manage their \ncoasts. Under the Coastal Zone Management Act, CZMA, States were given \nthe right to have a say in Federal projects that impacted their coastal \nregions. This bill would severely compromise these rights.\n  Third, the bill has alarming environmental implications for drilling \nand construction projects. It would allow an expedited application \nprocess for drilling on Federal lands by requiring the Department of \nthe Interior to automatically approve applications once they have met \ncertain standards, regardless of any outstanding environmental \nconcerns.\n  It also exempts companies from adhering to the Clean Water Act's \nrunoff regulations for construction and drilling sites. Without \nadherence to these guidelines, the risk of ground water contamination \nincreases dramatically.\n  Fourth, I am concerned about a measure to provide legal immunity to \nchemical companies that produce the gasoline additive MTBE. The toxic \nsubstance is known to have caused ground water contamination, and this \nbill shifts costs for cleanup to taxpayers.\n  Lastly, this bill contains huge amounts of subsidies for the oil and \ncoal industries. Nearly half of this bill's incentives are given to the \noil and coal industries, two of the most environmentally destructive \nfossil fuels that have contributed to global warming. This is not just \nirresponsible; it is wrong.\n  We must actively work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but \nsubsidizing the industries and rolling back environmental protections \nis not a logical methodology.\n  In contrast, the bill provides less than one-quarter of its \nincentives to industries that produce renewable energy. The facts are \nclear. Renewables are simply not the top priority of this piece of \nlegislation.\n  These are some of the many reasons I cannot support this piece of \nenergy legislation. Not only does it put consumers at risk by repealing \nnecessary protections, but it seriously puts at risk our own health and \nthe health of our environment with the special interest giveaways to \nthe oil, gas, and coal industries.\n  Finally, let me address the claims about job creation in this bill. \nFor Washington State, a more aggressive promotion of renewable energy \ncould have been a boost to local companies involved in this area of \ngeneration, but this bill did not provide that direction.\n  Proponents have argued that the bill encourages the construction of a \nnatural gas pipeline from Alaska, which would create jobs in Washington \nState. Unfortunately, the bill does not provide the guarantees needed \nfor what could have been an important project. To construct the \npipeline, its builders say they would need some protection against gas \nprices falling below a certain level. But, this bill provides no \nmechanism for risk mitigation, so according to its own builders, the \npipeline will not be built.\n  The negative aspects of this bill are overwhelming. It fails to \nadequately address the real problems that we all face. It threatens the \nenvironmental progress we have made in the past and the progress we \nhope to make in the future. Without measures that substantively promote \nresponsible energy use, increased conservation, energy independence, \nconsumer protection, and environmental safeguards, this bill is simply \nunacceptable.\n  I cannot support legislation that puts us all in danger, and that is \nexactly what this bill does. The people of Washington State deserve \nbetter, and the people of America deserve better.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is difficult to oppose a bill that has a \nnumber of provisions that I not only support, but worked to have \nincluded in the bill. However, the process and the product are deeply \nflawed and I cannot support it.\n  There are many objectionable provisions that were added to this bill \nthat were not in either the House or Senate versions of this \nlegislation; for instance the retroactive MTBE liability waiver, \nunderground storage tank provisions that would require taxpayers, \nrather than polluters, to pay $2 billion to clean up leaking \nunderground storage tanks containing gasoline and other toxic \nchemicals, even at sites where viable responsible parties are \nidentifiable, and the numerable State-specific projects that will cost \nbillions of dollars and were, again, not considered by the House or the \nSenate.\n  The Senate passed a comprehensive and balanced Energy bill in July. \nThen, after weeks of closed-door meetings with virtually no input from \nDemocratic conferees, the Republicans put forward this ``take it or \nleave it'' Energy bill that is drastically different than the bill that \nthe Senate passed. We have no opportunity to amend this bill, or choose \namong its good and bad provisions. It is all or nothing.\n  There are simply too many provisions on the negative side of the \nledger. The massive power failure of August 2003, on top of the massive \nprice manipulation perpetrated by Enron and others, provided additional \nproof, proof that shouldn't have been needed, that the United States' \nderegulated energy markets are not functioning well. This bill doesn't \nhelp that problem. It may make it worse.\n  The Conference report would repeal the Public Utility Holding Company\n\n[[Page S15348]]\n\nAct of 1934, PUHCA, longstanding consumer and investor protection \nlegislation governing energy industry structure and consolidation, 1 \nyear after enactment of this bill. Unfortunately, the bill fails to \nprovide adequate protections to prevent industry market manipulation \nand consumer abuses. Governor Granholm of Michigan has said that \nreplacing PUHCA with ``weaker anti-fraud and market manipulation \nrules'' could weaken the States' ability to protect consumers. Further, \nwhile the enactment of this legislation's mandatory reliability \nprovisions would be an improvement over the current voluntary system of \nstandards, the bill fails to ensure that regional transmission \norganizations will have the authority to enforce those standards in \norder to prevent, or respond effectively to, another blackout. \nUncertainty in the power industry threatens our economy and security \nand creates the loss of investor confidence in U.S. energy markets. If \nnecessary, we should adopt a stand-alone bill that sets mandatory \nreliability standards, requires utilities to join regional transmission \norganizations and establishes consistent rules for the enforcement of \nstandards nationwide than pass an Energy bill filled with so many \nharmful provisions.\n  In addition, two provisions in this conference report would \nsignificantly impede the ability of Federal and State agencies to \ninvestigate and prosecute fraud and price manipulation in energy \nmarkets. These provisions would make it easier to manipulate energy \nmarkets without detection.\n  Section 1281 of the electricity title states: ``Any request for \ninformation to a designated contract market, registered derivatives \ntransaction execution facility, board of trade, exchange, or market \ninvolving accounts, agreements, contracts, or transactions in \ncommodities (including natural gas, electricity and other energy \ncommodities) within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission shall be directed to the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission.'' Section 332(c) of the oil and gas title contains similar \nlanguage specifically applicable to investigations by the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, FERC.\n  If adopted, this would curtail all State and Federal authority, other \nthan CFTC, to investigate wrongdoing in CFTC-regulated markets. This \nwould impede FERC, Department of Justice, and State investigations of \nfraud and manipulation in these markets. It would turn the CFTC into an \nimpediment for all other Federal and State investigations into matters \nwithin CFTC-regulated markets, which would be an unprecedented \nintrusion into the enforcement of State and Federal consumer protection \nlaws. Had this approach been in effect in recent years, FERC would not \nhave been able to investigate manipulation of the energy markets, \nincluding the fraud and manipulation perpetrated by Enron through \nEnronOnline.\n  Section 1282 of the electricity title would impose a higher criminal \nstandard, ``knowingly and willfully,'' for filing false information and \nfor improper round trip trading than exists under current law. The new \nround trip trading provision is inconsistent with current law and the \nCantwell amendment, which prohibited market manipulation in electricity \nmarkets, and which recently passed the Senate.\n  For example, section 4c of the Commodity Exchange Act states it is \n``unlawful for any person to enter into . . . a transaction . . . \ninvolving the purchase or sale of any commodity for future delivery'' \nif the transaction ``is, of the character of, or is commonly known to \nthe trade as a `wash sale' or . . . is a fictitious sale.'' There is no \nrequirement that the violation be ``willful.''\n  Manipulation is difficult to prove even under current law. By raising \nthe burden of proof, this provision will make it nearly impossible to \nprove illegal round trip trading or wash sales. Rather than weakening \nthe laws preventing fraud and manipulation in energy markets, the \nCongress should be strengthening these prohibitions.\n  There are other provisions that would affect FERC's ability to ensure \nmarkets are transparent and fair.\n  The ``Enron loophole'' was attached during the conference on an \nomnibus appropriation bill in 2000, and was a factor underlying the \nmassive manipulation of the energy markets in 2000 and 2001. The \nprovisions in this bill, attached under hurried circumstances would \nwiden the loophole and increase the chances of more manipulation and \ndysfunctional markets. This is the wrong response to the current crisis \nof confidence and integrity in our energy markets.\n\n  I am also disappointed that the conference report on this bill \ndirects the Department of Energy, DOE, to ``as expeditiously as \npracticable, acquire petroleum in amounts sufficient to fill the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve to the [1 billion] barrel capacity,'' but \ndoes not include any direction to DOE to fill the SPR in a manner that \nminimizes the cost to the taxpayer or maximizes the overall supply of \noil in the United States. That second direction is critical--otherwise \nthe filling of the SPR could lead to continuing high gas prices.\n  The Levin-Collins amendment, which was adopted unanimously by the \nSenate last month, directed DOE to develop procedures to fill the SPR \nin a manner that minimizes the cost to the taxpayer and maximizes the \noverall supply of oil in the United States. The Levin-Collins amendment \nexpressed the sense of the Senate that the DOE's current procedures for \nfilling the SPR are too costly for the taxpayers and have not improved \nour overall energy security.\n  DOE's internal documents state that filling the SPR without regard to \nthe price and supply of oil in the global markets exacerbates price \nproblems in those markets. By increasing demand for oil at a time when \noil is in scarce supply, the SPR program pushes the price of oil up \neven further. Moreover, when near-term prices are higher than future \nprices, oil companies will meet the additional demand for crude oil by \nremoving oil from their own inventories rather than purchasing high-\npriced oil on the spot market. Thus, under these price conditions, \nwhich have generally prevailed over the past year and a half, adding \noil to the SPR will lead to a corresponding decrease in private sector \ninventories. Since market prices are so closely tied to inventory \nlevels, filling the SPR under these market conditions both depletes \nprivate sector inventories and pushes up prices for America's \nconsumers.\n  Furthermore, according to the Department of Energy's own analyses, \ntaking costs into consideration--as the DOE did prior to early 2002--\ncan save taxpayers several hundreds of millions of dollars over the \nspan of a few years. Acquiring more oil when prices are low will \nincrease revenues to the Treasury from the sale of high-priced royalty \noil that is not needed to fill the SPR. Secondly, allowing oil \ncompanies to defer deliveries to the SPR when prices are high in return \nfor the delivery of additional barrels of oil at a later date--as DOE \ndid prior to early 2002--enables the DOE to increase the amount of oil \nin the SPR without any additional costs.\n  In summary, the unqualified direction in the bill to DOE to fill the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve to 1 billion barrels is likely to increase \nthe cost of crude oil and crude oil products, such as gasoline, home \nheating oil, and diesel and jet fuel, to American consumers and \nbusinesses, as well as to the taxpayer, with uncertain benefits to our \nnational security.\n  Also, while I support the provision in this legislation that would \nincrease the use of ethanol to 5 billion gallons by 2012 and 3.1 \nbillion gallons by 2005, it needs to be reasonable in a way that \nensures the continued viability of the Highway Trust Fund.\n  Twice the Senate passed legislation that included a Volumetric \nEthanol Excise Tax Credit, VTEEC, that would address the shortfall in \nrevenue to the Highway Trust Fund that was caused by the ethanol tax \nexemption. In addition to taxing ethanol, the VTEEC, as passed by the \nSenate, would maintain the credit for ethanol production by paying for \nit from the general treasury, create a biodiesel credit and ensure that \nall taxes charged on ethanol go to the highway trust fund.\n  Unfortunately, the arrangement worked out by House and Senate \nRepublicans gives ethanol blenders the new option to receive a 5.2 cent \ntax credit after paying the federal gas tax or they could continue \nreceiving the current ethanol exemption of 5.2 cents. Since most \nblenders likely would continue to choose to receive the exemption up \nfront rather than wait for a tax\n\n[[Page S15349]]\n\ncredit, the highway trust fund would still lose billions of dollars per \nyear. Efforts by Senator Baucus to address this problem were approved \nby the Senate conferees, but was refused by the House. While I support \nincreased ethanol production, it is imperative that increased ethanol \nproduction does not diminish the Highway Trust Fund.\n  Additionally, I am troubled that this legislation exempts producers \nof MTBE from liability. MTBE, an oxygenate that can and should be \nreplaced by ethanol, is a potentially harmful product and its producers \nshould not be exempt from liability. In Michigan, it has been estimated \nthat MTBE has contaminated ground water around over 700 leaking \nunderground storage tank sites. Further, as many as 22 water supply \nwells have been deemed unusable due to MTBE contamination. Because of \nthis MTBE liability waiver, the State of Michigan may have to pay over \n$200 million to clean up those sites. Governor Granholm has strongly \nprotested that we need to hold manufacturers accountable for the damage \nthat MTBE does to public health and the environment, not guard them \nfrom liability which then allows them to pass the cleanup costs on to \nthe States.\n  As I stated earlier, this bill has a number of provisions that I \nsupport and that I worked to have included in it. These include tax \ncredits for advanced technology vehicles and joint research and \ndevelopment between the Government and the private sector to promote \nthe expanded use of advanced vehicle technologies. But in the end, the \ngood provisions must be weighed against the large number of bad \nprovisions, and there are too many objectionable provisions for me to \nsupport this bill.\n  The Senate has worked to create a national energy policy for years. \nIn just a few weeks, without bipartisan negotiation, this piece of \nlegislation was created. We should work to complete a long-term, \ncomprehensive energy plan that provides consumers with affordable and \nreliable energy, increases domestic energy supplies in a responsible \nmanner, invests in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources and \nprotects the environment and public health.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in the strong opposition to the \nbill before us, the conference Energy Policy Act of 2003. The bill \nbefore us is a pork-laden, budget-busting, fossil-fuel promoting \nvestige of the past, developed largely in secret by a handful of GOP \nMembers. This legislation is a mere shadow of what it was and could be.\n  This could have been a proud moment for this Congress and for the \nNation. Rather than caving to special interests and wallowing in pork \nbarrel politics, we could have risen to the challenge and met our \nobligation to help prevent such crises as the Enron energy scandal and \nthe blackout of 2003 from reoccurring. We could have acted to promote \nour economic prosperity, strengthen our national security, and protect \nthe health and welfare of all Americans through bold, balanced \nlegislation. We could have finally tackled global warming--the greatest \nenvironmental challenge of our time. We could have considered a real \njobs bill, based on opening new markets and spurring new technologies. \nWe could have set American energy policy on a better, brigther course.\n  Instead, we are stuck with this--a sewer of an Energy bill. The bill \nthat has emerged from the closed door, Republican-only conference, and \nwhich we consider today is a legislative disaster. Sadly, it bears \nlittle resemblance to the balanced, bipartisan legislation that passed \nthe Senate last July. The Senate bill, which originally passed this \nbody in the 107th Congress, strengthened our national security, \nsafeguarded consumers, and protected the environment, and was developed \nin open, meaningful, bipartisan fashion.\n  Before I move to the substance of the conference bill, I must offer a \nfew harsh words with the process of GOP majority employed to produce \nit. In all my time in the Senate, I have never witnesses a more unfair \nand unstatesmanlike spectacle. With the exception of the tax provisions \nof this bill, in which Senator Grassley seized every possibility to \ninvolve his Democratic colleagues, this is a thoroughly partisan \nproduct.\n  Here is the way the conference went: One conference meeting at which \nDemocratic conferences offered opening statements only: complete shut \nout of Democratic conferences from negotiations over the substance of \nthe bill: a few staff-level meetings for show after policy decisions \nhad already been made and reflected in GOP-only developed text; \nspecial-interest lobbyists exerting extraordinary influence over the \nbill; release of a more than 1,000-page document only 48 hours before \nthe scheduled meeting to adopt it--40 percent or more of which was new \ntext. It is inconceivable to me that legislation of this import was \ndeveloped this way. Quite simply, this process afforded no \nreal opportunity for Democrats to influence the final product and no \nopportunity for the American public--whom this body is charged to \nrepresent--to view and comment on the final product. I second the \ncomments of many of my Democratic colleagues that we will never be \nsubject to a conference like this again.\n\n  In dissecting the pork-laden bill that emerged from the smoke-filled \nback rooms of the conference committee, let me first highlight one \nprovision of extraordinary importance to the State of Connecticut. \nConnecticut has worked for decades to ensure that the construction and \noperation of natural gas pipelines and electric cables across our \nnational treasure, the Long Island Sound, fully comply with State and \nFederal environmental and energy laws. The bill before us contains a \nprovision to permanently activate the Cross Sound Cable--a provision \nthat did not appear in either the House or the Senate bill and as to \nwhich no one received advance notice. The Cross Sound Cable had been \ntemporarily activated by Federal order in emergency response to the \nsummer's massive blackout, but had been prevented from permanent \nactivation by the State of Connecticut until it complies with State \nlaws. So much for States rights and environmental and consumer \nprotection. Shameful.\n  That is only the tip of the iceberg. Let me review the most egregious \noffenses buried in this bill.\n  First, subsidies and giveaways to industries and special interests. \nMy good friend, Senator McCain, has labeled this bill the porkiest of \nthe porkbarrel, budget-busting bills. CBO estimates that the bill will \ncost more than $30 billion in industry tax incentives and direct \nspending. Taxpayers for Common Sense has estimated that it will cost in \nexcess of $90 billion. This stunning price tag includes millions of \ndollars in direct incentive payments to mature energy industries, \nincluding payments to undertake equipment upgrades they would have to \ndo anyway. The bill authorizes $1.1 billion for a nuclear reactor in \nIdaho to demonstrate uneconomic hydrogen production technologies. It \nhas loan guarantees to build coal plants in several States, provided as \nlast-minute sweeteners to secure Senatorial support for the bill. The \nbill contains interesting new ``green bonds'' for five projects \nthroughout the country, by which projects would get financial benefits \nfor ``green'' construction of primarily shopping centers. One project, \nin Shreveport, LA includes a new Hooters restaurant. Is this \ngroundbreaking energy legislation? How can we approve legislation \ngushing money this way given the mushrooming budget deficit? Our \nneediest citizens will surely pay the cost.\n  Second, inadequate consumer protections. The bill does not adequately \nprotect consumers against utility mergers and electricity market \nmanipulation. For example, broad, effective prohibitions against price \ngouging schemes used by Enron and other energy trading firms, which \npassed the Senate 57 to 40 earlier this month, are excluded from the \nbill. The legislation repeals the requirements of the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act, PUHCA, without putting adequate consumer \nprotections in place.\n  Third, electric transmission line and natural gas pipeline and \nconstruction. The bill allows the Secretary of Energy to determine the \nsiting of transmission lines through Federal lands, including national \nforests and national monuments, except those in the National Park \nSystem, over the objection of the responsible Federal agency. The bill \noverrides State energy and environmental legal authorities to give the \nFederal Government power to site and construct transmission lines and \nnatural gas pipelines.\n\n[[Page S15350]]\n\n  Fourth, MTBE liability protection. In a provision added in conference \nto benefit companies primarily based in Louisiana and Texas, the bill \nprovides retroactive and prospective liability protection for producers \nof methyl tertiary-butyl ether, MTBE, cutting off the rights of injured \nAmericans across the country and imposing a huge financial burden for \ncleanup on our States and local communities. Simply unbelievable.\n  Fifth, environmental protection rollbacks and giveaways. The icing on \nthe cake for this bad bill is the significant environmental protections \nit strips away for the benefit of energy producers. The bill also \ncontains new provisions to make our air much dirtier. The conference \nbill would exempt metropolitan areas from meeting the Clean Air Act's \nozone-smog standard. This issue was never considered by the Senate or \nthe House and was inserted into the conference report during \n``conference committee'' meetings. A new report from Clean the Air \nreveals that the ill-conceived Energy bill would have severe public \nhealth consequences around the country, especially for children. Delays \nin implementing the Clean Air Act could lead to nearly 5000 \nhospitalizations due to respiratory illness and more than 380,000 \nasthma attacks and 570,000 missed school days each year. The bill \nexempts all construction activities at oil and gas drilling sites from \ncoverage under the Clean Water Act and removes hydraulic fracturing, an \nunderground oil and gas recovery method, from coverage under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. The conference bill expedites energy exploration \nand development at the expense of current National Environmental Policy \nAct, NEPA, requirements. Environmental review is waived for all types \nof energy development projects and facilities on Indian land.\n  I want to be fair. The conference bill does contain provisions that \nmake limited progress--baby steps only--toward achieving energy goals. \nAnd the bill recognizes the political reality that the Senate has \nspoken forcefully to the fact that it will not permit the Bush \nadministration to drill in another of our Nation's treasures, the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. You can search the bill to find \nrequirements for renewable fuels, (increase in sales of renewable \nfuels, including ethanol, from 2 billion gallons to 5 billion gallons \nby 2012); Federal energy efficiency standards for energy use and \nappliances; increase in Federal Government purchase of renewable \nenergy, 7.5 percent of electricity from sources such as wind, solar, \ngeothermal, and biomass; funding for energy research and development, \nincluding related to hydrogen fuels; and limited tax incentives for \nalternative vehicles, renewable energy sources, and energy efficiency. \nThat is why some of my colleagues claim this bill articulates an energy \nprogram for the 21st century. Hogwash. These weak provisions do not \neven register on the scale against the predominant special interest, \nfossilized provisions of the conference bill.\n  What is this bill missing? Frankly, the list is staggering. I have \ntime to highlight five key areas:\n  First, renewable portfolio standards. Our Senate-passed bill required \nutilities to generate 10 percent of their electricity from renewable \nenergy facilities by 2020. Such a provision would spur new technology \ndevelopment and work to wean the country off foreign oil dependence and \nthe drilling-first-and-only mindset that has predominated American \nenergy policy for generations. In addition, the majority touts this \nbill as a great jobs creation bill; according to studies of the Tellus \nInstitute and Union for Concerned Scientists, the renewable industry \nwould create new, sophisticated job opportunities for hundreds of \nthousands of Americans.\n  Second, climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of \nfossil fuels threaten not only our environment, but also our economy \nand our public health. Should we continue unabated our current rate of \npolluting, we threaten to disrupt the delicate ecological balance on \nwhich our livelihoods and lives depend. This bill is so short-sighted \nthat it contains no provisions of any kind to address climate change.\n  Third, fuel economy improvements. No credible Energy bill can lack \nmeans to improve fuel economy for automobiles and trucks. This is key \nto reducing our dependence on foreign oil because the transportation \nsector is the single largest user of petroleum.\n  Fourth, oil savings provision and specific hydrogen standards. \nAmendments agreed to by the Senate last summer contained provisions \nwith specific deadlines--real teeth--to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil and to move us to the hydrogen fuel program of the future. \nNeither appears in this bill.\n  Fifth, Alaska natural gas pipeline. I strongly support the \nconstruction of this pipeline, which will bring millions of gallons of \nnatural gas to the lower 48 States and create almost half of the new \njobs, 400,000, touted under this bill. The conference bill, however, \nfails to provide the necessary incentives to enable construction of the \nAlaska natural gas pipeline, which would prevent the U.S. from becoming \nmore dependent on natural gas imports.\n  This abominable bill must not be made law. Any Senator serious about \nadvancing America's energy and environmental policies and curtailing \nGovernment waste is compelled to vote against the Energy bill before \nus. We can and must do better. Americans deserve a real Energy bill, \none that we can be proud of. This is not it. Let us reject this \nlegislation and return to the drawing board, recommitting ourselves to \nproducing a balanced, innovative, and responsible energy policy for the \n21st century.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as I rise to speak to the issue of the \nconference report to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2003, I want to \nfirst recognize the efforts of Energy Committee Chairman Domenici and \nFinance Committee Chairman Grassley for the extraordinary time and \neffort they have devoted to developing a national energy policy for a \n21st century America. Theirs was an arduous task in addressing not only \npolitical differences with the bill but also regional ones as well. So \nI thank them for their work.\n  This has certainly been a long road. Congress has been debating and \nvoting on a number of energy issues over the past two Congresses, one \nwhen under Democratic control and one under Republican leadership. \nThere have been a myriad of issues to consider as we have attempted to \nshape appropriate policy, and to help increase the public's awareness \nof the benefits to our health and national security in shifting from \nforeign fossil fuel imports toward renewable, efficient, and \nalternative energy sources and manufacturing technologies. Yes, it has \nbeen a long, hard road but this conference report simply does not put \nus on the right road to accomplish these goals for the good of the \nNation. We have yet to find that new direction, but we must keep \nseeking it.\n  As Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``Conservation is a great moral \nissue, for it involves the patriotic duty of ensuring the safety and \ncontinuance of the nation.'' The conferees had the opportunity to raise \nthe bar for the Nation's future domestic energy systems through new \nenergy policies, through the creation of tax incentives for available \nand developing technologies, and most of all for incentivizing the \nentrepreneurial spirit of the American people. But, this goal, in my \nopinion, has not been reached in the Energy conference report before \nus.\n  Since we started to develop new strategies for the Nation's energy \npolicy for the 21st century, we have had to undergo a fundamental \nreassessment of our energy infrastructure in the aftermath of the \nhorrific events of 9/11 and the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East. We \nrealize now more than ever that we must reduce our vulnerabilities to \nterrorism with more secure, localized, and reliably distributed energy \ndelivery systems rather than relying solely on our current centralized \ninfrastructure of pipelines, refineries, powerplants, patchwork of \nelectricity grids, and oil tankers berthed in our harbors. The United \nStates simply cannot afford to continue to spend at least $57 billion a \nyear buying oil from the Middle East and continue its upward trend of \nfossil fuel usage.\n  The entire world--particularly the developing and fast-growing \nnations of China, India, and Brazil--desperately needs access to clean, \nlow-cost, energy-efficient and renewable resources. The key is to make \nthe best alternate energy systems that are competitive with today's \nnonrenewable sources of energy\n\n[[Page S15351]]\n\nso that they can be developed and used both at home and sold abroad.\n  Since 2000, I have been proud to have been a member of the Finance \nCommittee where I worked to develop responsible tax incentives to \nincrease the efficiencies of the electricity we produce, the vehicles \nwe drive, the appliances we use, the homes in which we live, and, in \nturn, enhance the competitiveness of our domestic manufacturers. Our \ntask is to incentivize, through the Tax Code, our U.S. manufacturers to \ndevelop and employ the most promising and cost-effective technologies \nto the U.S. and global marketplace with all due speed.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report increases oil and gas tax \ncredits to $11.9 billion while conservation and energy efficiency \nincentives were decreased to $1.5 billion. An equitable balance has not \nbeen achieved nor is it a step forward.\n  We need to expand the mix of the country's energy sources with the \nrealization that power from nuclear and fossil fuels will continue to \nbe a large part of the energy basket in the next decades--but, at the \nsame time, we must encourage safer, cleaner and decentralized sources \nas well. The conference report before us simply does not progress far \nenough in this direction, instead maintaining more of a ``business as \nusual'' approach to the Nation's energy future.\n  One of my greatest disappointments is the absence of provisions from \nthe Feinstein-Snowe SUV loophole legislation that would have phased-in \nchanges in CAFE standards requirements in four, attainable stages that \nwould have brought the standards for SUVs in line with passenger cars \nwithin the next 8 years. Closing this loophole alone would save our \nnation approximately 1 million barrels of oil, or fully 10 percent of \nthe oil our vehicles consume on a daily basis.\n  Right now, all our vehicles combined consume 40 percent of our oil, \nwhile coughing up 20 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions--the \nmajor greenhouse gas linked to global climate change. To put this in \nperspective, the amount of carbon dioxide emissions just from U.S. \nvehicles alone is the equivalent of the fourth highest carbon dioxide \nemitting country in the world. Given these stunning numbers, I cannot \nfathom why we continue to allow SUVs to spew three times more pollution \ninto the air than our passenger cars.\n  Like Senator Feinstein and I, other nations have realized the value \nof these changes. Even China--a developing country--has great concerns \nabout its increased reliance on foreign oil, so much so that Chinese \nofficials say they have to save energy--and how are they prepared to \naccomplish this? By implementing more stringent CAFE standards for new \nvehicles--including those manufactured in the United States--in their \ncountry than we currently have in the United States or in this \nconference report. How ironic that China is more progressive than the \nUnited States in their attempts to save energy and decrease dependency \nin oil imports at the same time that the United States overall fuel \neconomy has actually fallen to its lowest level since 1980.\n  According to a November 18 New York Times article, vehicles made by \nWestern automakers that do not meet the standards the Chinese \nGovernment has drafted may have to be modified to get better gas \nmileage before the first phase of the new rules becomes effective in \nJuly of 2005. I ask unanimous consent to print the November 18 article \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    China Set To Act on Fuel Economy; Tougher Standards Than in U.S.\n\n                          (By Keith Bradsher)\n\n       Guangzhou, China, Nov. 17--The Chinese government is \n     preparing to impose minimum fuel economy standards on new \n     cars for the first time, and the rules will be significantly \n     more stringent than those in the United States, according to \n     Chinese experts involved in drafting them.\n       The new standards are intended both to save energy and to \n     force automakers to introduce the latest hybrid engines and \n     other technology in China, in hopes of easing the nation's \n     swiftly rising dependence on oil imports from volatile \n     countries in the Middle East.\n       They are the latest and most ambitious in a series of steps \n     to regulate China's rapidly growing auto industry, after \n     moves earlier this year to require that air bags be provided \n     for both front-seat occupants in most new vehicles and that \n     new family vehicles sold in major cities meet air pollution \n     standards nearly as strict as those in Western Europe and the \n     United States.\n       Some popular vehicles now built in China by Western \n     automakers, including the Chevrolet Blazer, do not measure up \n     to the standards the government has drafted, and may have to \n     be modified to get better gas mileage before the first phase \n     of the new rules becomes effective in July 2005.\n       The Chinese initiative comes at a time when Congress is \n     close to completing work on a major energy bill that would \n     make no significant changes in America's fuel economy rules \n     for vehicles. The Chinese standards, in general, call for new \n     cars, vans and sport utility vehicles to get as much as two \n     miles a gallon of fuel more in 2005 than the average required \n     in the United States, and about five miles more in 2008.\n       This country's economy is booming, and a growing upper \n     class in big cities like this one is rapidly buying all the \n     accouterments of a prosperous Western life, including cars. \n     As China burns more fossil fuels, both in factories and in a \n     rapidly growing fleet of motor vehicles, its contribution to \n     global warming is also rising faster than any other \n     country's.\n       But Zhang Jianwei, the vice president and top technical \n     official of the Chinese agency that writes vehicle standards, \n     said in a telephone interview on Monday that energy security \n     was the paramount concern in drafting the new automotive fuel \n     economy rules, and that global warming has received little \n     attention.\n       ``China has become an important importer of oil so it has \n     to have regulations to save energy,'' said Mr. Zhang, who is \n     also deputy secretary of the 39-member interagency committee \n     that approved the rules at a meeting this month.\n       China was a net oil exporter until a decade ago, but its \n     output has not kept up with soaring demand. It now depends on \n     imports of oil for one-third of its needs, mainly from Saudi \n     Arabia and Angola. Before the war, Iraq was also an important \n     supplier. By comparison, the United States now imports about \n     55 percent of the oil it uses.\n       The International Energy Agency predicts that by 2030, the \n     volume of China's oil imports will equal American imports \n     now. Chinese strategists have expressed growing worry about \n     depending on a lifeline of oil tankers stretching across the \n     Indian Ocean, through the Strait of Malacca, a waterway \n     plagued by piracy, and across the South China Sea, protected \n     mainly by the United States Navy.\n       Various Chinese government agencies still have three months \n     to review the legal language in the fuel economy rules, \n     giving automakers some time to lobby against them; as yet, \n     there has been no mention of the approval of the new rules in \n     the government-controlled Chinese media.\n       But Mr. Zhang said that the rules in draft form were the \n     product of a very strong consensus among government agencies \n     and that ``the technical content won't be changed.''\n       Two executives at Volkswagen, the largest foreign automaker \n     in China, said that representatives of their company and of \n     domestic Chinese automakers attended what they described as \n     the final interagency meeting to approve the rules. Under \n     pressure from the government, these auto industry \n     representatives agreed to the new rules despite misgivings, \n     the executives said. ``They had no choice but to agree,'' one \n     of the Volkswagen executives added.\n       The executive said that Volkswagen's vehicles would meet \n     the first phase of the standards in 2005, while declining to \n     comment on compliance with the second, more rigorous phase, \n     which is to take effect in July 2008.\n       The new standards are based on a vehicle's weight--lighter \n     vehicles must go the farthest on a gallon--and on the type of \n     transmission, with manual-shift cars required to go farther \n     than those with less efficient automatic transmissions.\n       In a major departure from American practice, all new sport \n     utility vehicles and minivans in China would be required to \n     meet the same standards as automatic-shift cars of the same \n     weight. In the United States, standards for sport utilities \n     and minivans are much lower than for cars.\n       The Chinese rules do not cover pickups or commercial \n     trucks. According to General Motors market research, there is \n     little demand for pickup trucks in China except from \n     businesses, because the affluent urban consumer who can \n     afford a new vehicle regards pickup trucks as unsophisticated \n     and too reminiscent of the horse-drawn carts still used in \n     some rural areas.\n       Typically, heavy vehicles are much harder on fuel than \n     light ones, but the new Chinese standards permit the heavy \n     vehicles to get only slightly worse gas mileage. As a result, \n     they provide an incentive for manufacturers to offer smaller, \n     lighter vehicles, which will be easier to design.\n       The new standards would require all small cars sold in \n     China to achieve slightly better gas mileage than the average \n     new small car sold in the United States now gets, according \n     to calculations by An Feng, a consultant who advised the \n     government on the rules. But officials in Beijing would \n     require much better minimum gas mileage for minivans and, \n     especially, S.U.V.'s than the average vehicle of either type \n     now gets in the United States.\n       American regulations call for each automaker to produce a \n     fleet of passenger cars\n\n[[Page S15352]]\n\n     with an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles a gallon under a \n     combination of city and highway driving with no traffic; \n     window-sticker values for gas mileage, which include the \n     effects of traffic, are about 15 percent lower. Light trucks, \n     including vans, S.U.V.'s and pickups, are allowed an average \n     of 20.7 miles a gallon without traffic.\n       But the Bush administration has raised the comparable \n     American standard to 22.2 miles a gallon for the 2007 model \n     year and is now completing a review of whether to raise \n     limits further for 2008. The administration is also \n     considering adopting different standards for different weight \n     classes of light trucks.\n       Over all, average fuel economy in the United States has \n     been eroding since the late 1980's as automakers shifted \n     production from cars to light trucks. It fell in the 2002 \n     model year to the lowest level since 1980. Automakers in \n     Europe have accepted European Union demands to increase fuel \n     economy under different rules that could prove at least as \n     stringent as China's minimums.\n       The Chinese standards would require the greatest increases \n     for full-size S.U.V.'s like the Ford Expedition, which would \n     have to go as much as 29 percent farther on a gallon of fuel \n     in 2008 than they do now in the United States, Mr. An \n     calculated. Sport utility sales in China have more than \n     doubled so far this year, but are still a much smaller part \n     of the overall market than they are in the United States.\n       Because the American standards are fleet averages while the \n     Chinese standards are minimums for each vehicle, the effect \n     of the Chinese rules could be considerably more stringent. A \n     manufacturer can sell vehicles in the United States that are \n     far below average in fuel efficiency if it has others in its \n     product line that offset it by being above average. But under \n     the Chinese rules, the fuel-inefficient models--especially \n     new ones introduced after the standards take effect--would be \n     subject to fines no matter how well their siblings do, Mr. \n     Zhang said, and the maker would not be allowed to expand \n     production of the gas-guzzling models. In Garrison Keillor's \n     phrase, China plans to require that every vehicle be above \n     average.\n       Mr. An said that at the final meetings on the new rules, \n     the only outspoken objections had come from a representative \n     of the Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Company, which \n     makes Jeeps in a joint venture with DaimlerChrysler.\n       According to people who have seen the new standards, many \n     Jeep models sold in China do not now comply with them; \n     neither do the Chevrolet Blazer sport utilities built by a \n     General Motors joint venture in Shenyang. Some of \n     Volkswagen's car models also fall slightly short, these \n     people said. By contrast, Honda's cars, built at a sprawling \n     factory complex here in Guangzhou, the commercial hub of \n     southern China, would comply easily because they use advanced \n     engine technology, these people said.\n       Trevor Hale, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman, declined to \n     comment in detail. ``DaimlerChrysler complies with local \n     regulations where it does business,'' Mr. Hale said in an e-\n     mail response to an inquiry. ``It continues working to \n     improve fuel economy in the vehicles it develops, builds and \n     sells around the world.''\n       Bernd Leissner, the president of Volkswagen Asia Pacific, \n     said that his company's cars would comply because ``it's just \n     a question of how to adapt the engine--it's something that \n     could be done quickly.''\n       The fastest way to improve fuel efficiency is to switch \n     from gasoline to diesel engines, as Volkswagen is starting to \n     do in China. The latest diesel engines are much cleaner then \n     those of a decade ago, but are still more polluting than \n     gasoline engines of similar power.\n       A spokeswoman for General Motors, which is beginning to \n     introduce Cadillac luxury cars in China, said she did not \n     have enough information about the newly drafted rules to \n     comment on them, but that her company's vehicles were \n     comparable in fuel economy to those of rival manufacturers in \n     the same market segments. Executives of G.M. were preparing \n     for an event in Beijing on Tuesday and Wednesday when the \n     company plans to showcase examples of its work on gasoline-\n     saving fuel-cell and hybrid engines for cars.\n       In the United States, G.M. has argued that tighter fuel \n     economy rules are unnecessary because technological \n     improvements will someday improve efficiency anyway. G.M. and \n     other automakers have also contended in the United States \n     that higher gasoline taxes would represent a better policy \n     than higher gas mileage standards, because it would give \n     drivers an economic incentive to choose more efficient \n     vehicles and to drive fewer miles.\n       China is still considering its policy on fuel taxes, but \n     has not acted so far, because higher fuel taxes would impose \n     higher costs on many sections of society, Mr. Zhang said.\n       Another company that could run into trouble over the \n     Chinese mileage standards is Toyota, which on Nov. 6 began \n     selling a locally produced version of its full-sized Land \n     Cruiser sport utility vehicle in China. A spokesman said on \n     Monday that Toyota had not yet heard about the new Chinese \n     fuel economy regulations, which has been prepared with a \n     level of secrecy typical of many Chinese regulatory actions.\n       Japan is also phasing in new fuel efficiency standards \n     based on vehicle weight that allow heavier vehicles only \n     slightly worse gas mileage than lighter ones. American \n     automakers have complained that the Japanese rules \n     discriminate against them because Japanese automakers tend to \n     produce slightly lighter cars anyway.\n       China has more than 100 automakers, as Detroit did a \n     century ago, but the bulk of its output comes from a small \n     number of joint ventures with multinational companies. Total \n     production has more than doubled in the last three years, to \n     about 3.8 million cars and light trucks in 2002, nearly as \n     many as Germany. The United States builds about 12 million a \n     year, Japan about 10 million.\n       The cars that Chinese automakers produce on their own tend \n     to very small and lightweight, but the engines are built on \n     older technology, and may not have an easy time complying \n     with the new fuel economy standards.\n       The government has been encouraging the industry to \n     consolidate, and the new rules may hasten that process by \n     forcing investment in engine designs that small companies may \n     not be able to afford on their own.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, just consider for a moment how much the \nworld has changed technologically over the past 25 years. We have seen \nthe advent of the home computer and the information age. Computers are \nnow running our automobiles, and global positioning system devices are \nguiding drivers to their destinations. Are we to believe that \ntechnology couldn't have also helped those drivers burn less fuel in \ngetting there? Are we going to say that, while even a developing \ncountry like China is transforming, America doesn't have the \nwherewithal to make SUVs that get better fuel economy?\n  We should keep in mind that China is expected to pass the United \nStates in the next 10 years as the largest emitter of manmade carbon \ndioxide, the major greenhouse gas that the vast majority of \ninternational scientists believe is causing global climate change. And, \nit is interesting to note that there is not one mention of climate \nchange in the entire conference report. Not one reference in a report \nof over 1,000 pages that is supposed to shape the Nation's energy \npolicy for the 21st century.\n  Last year's Energy bill--which I remind my colleagues is the bill the \nSenate actually passed this year--had at least three different titles \naddressing climate change, including research on abrupt climate change. \nAlso, the administration's National Energy Policy of May, 2001, stated, \n``Energy-related activities are the primary sources of U.S. man-made \ngreenhouse gas emissions representing about 85 percent of the U.S. man-\nmade total carbon-equivalent emissions in 1998.''\n  Other grave concerns I have involve provisions in the report that \nwill threaten coastal and marine environments and lead to further \ndegradation of our oceans. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Oceans, \nFisheries, and Coast Guard, I am troubled by the ramifications of these \nprovisions, as I strongly believe that any changes to U.S. marine \npolicy should only be developed with contributions and oversight of the \nsubcommittee.\n  For example, under section 321 of title III, the bill grants sole \nauthority for all energy-related projects in the Outer Continental \nShelf to the Secretary of the Interior. Currently, protecting these \necosystems is the responsibility of the Department of Commerce. This \nsection does not suggest that the Department of the Interior should \neven consult with Commerce.\n  Two other sections in this bill would limit the ability of the \nSecretary of Commerce and coastal States to guide, plan, and regulate \nactivities that affect coastal and ocean resources and that occur in \noffshore areas-- a right they currently have under the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act.\n  Further, section 325 would shorten the timeframes for submitting \ninformation and appealing the permitting decisions for offshore \nactivities that are inconsistent with States' coastal management \nplans--regardless of the quality or quantity of information received. \nAnother section, section 330 would limit all appeals or reviews of \noffshore energy action to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nrecord. I believe that the Secretary of Commerce should have the \ndiscretion to develop a record that is relevant to issues on appeal.\n  These provisions are inconsistent with the administration's proposed \nrule amending the appeals processes, and they conflict with the goals \nand purposes of the Coastal Zone Management Act reauthorization bill, \nS. 241, I introduced last January. Moreover, the U.S. Commission on \nOcean Policy, established and appointed by President Bush pursuant to \nthe Oceans Act of\n\n[[Page S15353]]\n\n2000, is poised to present its recommendations to Congress on offshore \nenergy and other ocean-related issues.\n  All of these provisions have serious consequences for marine \nenvironmental health, and they should not be hastily adopted without \nthe thoughtful input of the Commerce Committee, the administration, and \nthe U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy.\n  Moving from our oceans to our air, there are other disturbing \nprovisions in the conference report that have been raised by many of my \ncolleagues. For instance, the report contains a provision delaying \nclean air protections for millions of Americans, leading to thousands \nof additional asthma attacks--and that is of particular concern to me \nas my State of Maine leads the Nation in per capita cases of asthma.\n  Also, I am disappointed that the conference report contains no \nrenewable portfolio standard, or RPS, to raise the amount of renewable \nenergy as a source of electricity nationwide by increasing the \npercentage of electricity produced from wind, solar, geothermal, \nincremental hydropower, and clean biomass that produces electricity \nfrom burning forest waste.\n  The conference report does not ban MTBE that is polluting our ground \nwater for another decade rather than the 4 years in the Senate bill, \nwhile at the same time virtually dismissing pending lawsuits states \nalready have filed against MTBE producers for cleanup. State officials \nin Maine do not approve of extending the ban on MTBE or the fact that \nthe heavy financial burden of cleanup will shift to the communities and \nwater users because MTBE producers receive a safe harbor from lawsuits \nin the report.\n  For hydropower, the conference report provisions give the last say \nfor hydropower permits to industry and does not give equal weight to \nthe agencies/stakeholders process that has worked so well in Maine for \nreaching consensus on hydropower decisions, especially for dam \nremovals.\n  On electricity reliability, the report holds up FERC's ability to go \nforward with its standard market design for regional transmission \norganizations--or RTOs except on a voluntary basis, until 2007. A \nvoluntary only program, however, does not spur the capital needed right \nnow for increased electricity transmission in New England, for \ninstance. I hope my colleagues are aware that the New England RTO kept \nthe great majority of New England's electricity grid working and the \nlights on during the blackout of August of 2003. Actually, the only \ncomponent of the electricity title that effectively addresses the basic \ncauses of the 2003 blackout is the establishment of electric \nreliability organizations that would enforce reliability standards \nthrough improved communication standards and would be overseen by FERC.\n  Regarding consumer protections, the conference report repeals PUHCA, \nthe Public Utility Holding Company Act, that currently protects \nconsumers from higher electricity prices. However, the conference \nreport contains little language that ensures that consumers are \nshielded from higher bills resulting from, for instance, large \nelectricity and gas convergence mergers. Public Power, co-ops and \nmunicipalities, who represent 25 percent of the industry, are \nespecially vulnerable to the lack of adequate consumer protections in \nthe report.\n  Also, the conferees stripped the tradable tax credits for Public \nPower that I and others had included in the Senate Finance Committee \namendment. These tradable tax credits would have allowed Public Power \nto invest in renewable energy and assist them in decreasing their CO2 \nemissions by moving away from burning as much coal as they currently \ndo.\n  On fiscal policy, I do not believe the conference report shows fiscal \nrestraint or uses taxpayer dollars wisely. The fiscal year 2004 budget \nresolution calls for approximately $15.5 billion to be spent on tax \nincentives, and the Senate Finance Committee stayed within this budget \nblueprint. The conference report contains $24 billion in tax incentives \nplus another $5.4 billion in spending and with no offsets.\n  One of my concerns is that important tax incentives that appeared in \nthe Senate and House Energy bills over the past 2 years have not been \nincluded in the conference. Where they have been included, they are so \npared back that I question whether the various industries will take \nadvantage of the smaller energy efficiency tax incentives provided, \nparticularly for the construction, lighting, and heating, ventilation \nand air-conditioning, or HVAC, for commercial buildings.\n  Gone are provisions for tax incentives to promote the use of more \nefficient air-conditioners, even though 70 percent of the energy demand \nin peak periods is for air-conditioners, and that was a significant \nfactor in last August's major blackout in the Northeast. The lack of \nthese provisions that could be instrumental in the short term for \nenergy savings simply does not move the Nation's energy policy forward \ninto this century.\n  The knowledge of alternative and renewable sources has been known for \nover a century as the simple principle of fuel cells --combining \nhydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and pure water--and the \nphotovoltaic principle behind the solar power of the sun, were both \ndiscussed in 1839--164 years ago. We should ask ourselves why, instead \nof our daily diet of approximately 19 million barrels of oil a day, we \nare not also choosing to bolster even more the development of these \nsources of renewable energy for our consumption and to grow our \neconomy.\n  Imagine automobiles driven by fuel cells--our U.S. auto manufacturers \nand the Federal Government are beginning to invest in fuel cells. \nImagine businesses and homes having their own free-standing and \nreliable fuel cells--one of the cleanest means of generating \nelectricity--that Senator Lieberman and I have promoted. Fuel cells can \nprovide electricity instead of our current vast, centralized fossil \nfuel systems that make our air dirtier and less healthy, causing us to \nspend millions more on health care each year. We need to be more \nserious about promoting these technologies.\n  I do not believe that the Energy conference report before us sets the \nNation on the right course for the future and well being of the Nation, \nand I will, regretfully, vote against the conference report with the \nhope that Congress can continue working toward a more meaningful, \nsecure, and balanced energy-efficient future for the Nation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Energy conference \nreport. While I have some serious concerns about the way this bill was \ncreated, I believe our country will be better off with this bill than \nwithout it. On balance, it will advance our interests.\n  This bill takes important, major steps toward developing renewable \nand limitless sources of energy such as ethanol, wind, and biodiesel. \nIt puts us on the road to the development of a new hydrogen fuel cell \neconomy, which is essential if we are to lessen our dependence on \nforeign oil. And it contains important conservation measures by \nimproving efficient standards on appliances and other devices we use in \nour daily lives. If we are serious about security our energy future, I \nbelieve we must implement these measures without delay.\n  Additionally, this bill enhances our ability to develop more \ntraditional sources of energy, while protecting our environment. It \ncontains strong provisions to promote clean coal technology so that we \ncan more effectively use our coal resources without degrading our \nenvironment. The bill also funds a pipeline to access over 30 million \ncubic feet of natural gas in Alaska and bring it to the lower 48 \nStates. And it provides additional incentives for the discovery and \nrecovery of oil and natural gas.\n  There is much in this bill that is positive, and I intend to vote for \nit. Having said that, I know this bill is far from perfect. But in some \nimportant matters, it is a step in the right direction.\n  The bill omits a renewable portfolio standard, RPS, that would have \nrequired utilities to produce 10 percent of their electricity from \nrenewable sources. That is a serious omission. A majority of the Senate \nconferees voted to add this amendment to the conference measure and it \npassed. Unfortunately, the House stripped this amendment out without \neven debating it. I want to make it clear that I have not given up on \nthis issue. I want to inform those who blocked this provision--get \nready. I am going to keep fighting until we get an RPS standards \nenacted into law.\n\n[[Page S15354]]\n\n  Unfortunately, this bill also provides liability protection for the \nproducers of the fuel additive, MTBE. This is a major mistake. \nInsulating the big oil companies, while making the mom and pop gas \nstations of America liable for the costs of cleaning up these \ncontaminated sites is simply wrong and bad policy.\n  I also want to address concerns that the bill waives a number of \nother important environmental provisions. For years, the administration \nhas complained that the process of siting and permitting new energy \nprojects is cumbersome and in the name of efficiency needs to be \nmodified. This measure does that. But let me caution the administration \nfor a moment. While Congress has provided discretion to the appropriate \nagencies in an effort to streamline the process, these agencies will be \nheld accountable if they violate the spirit and trust we have given \nthem. I expect these agencies to make informed decisions based on \npublic input, sound science, and common sense.\n\n  Additionally, as a member and former chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee's Consumer Affairs Subcommittee, let me address the issue of \nconsumer protection. This bill repeals the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act and does not, in my opinion, go far enough to protect \nconsumers from price gouging. Congress will be watching very closely to \nensure that the agencies responsible for preventing market \nconsolidation and market manipulation are doing their job. I believe we \nmust keep pushing to get better protections for consumers. The \nexperience on the west coast in recent years is a painful reminder that \ncorporate power, if left unchecked, can cause serious injury to our \nconsumers.\n  These deficiencies in the Energy bill could have been avoided had the \nmajority party included Democratic conferees in a meaningful dialogue. \nInstead, Democrats were frozen out of the Energy conference. It was a \nflawed and arrogant process that prevented the American people from \ngetting the best of what both political parties had to offer in the \ndevelopment of a national energy policy.\n  However, does the lack of involvement lessen the need for us to take \nsteps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil? Does it lessen our need \nto promote energy efficiency and energy conservation? Does it lessen \nour need to promote the use of renewable energy and renewable fuels and \nvehicles? I believe the answer to all of these questions is no.\n  I will vote for the conference report, because on balance, this bill \nis a net plus for America. But my vote is in no way an endorsement of \nthe manner in which the majority conducted this conference. In the \nfuture, before conferees are appointed, we will insist on a commitment \nthat both political parties be represented in the deliberations of the \nconference.\n  These concerns aside, we must remember that energy is vital to our \neconomy and our way of life. We count on a reliable energy supply for \nour everyday needs--heat, light, electricity, and all of the things \nthat keep our society productive. Our economy would be devastated if we \nlost access to that supply, and were left without alternatives.\n  If, God forbid, terrorists would shut off the supply of oil to our \ncountry tomorrow, our economy would be flat on its back. We now import \n55 percent of the oil we use, much of it from troubled parts of the \nworld. That holds our economy hostage to this growing dependence on \nimported oil, in particular to the Middle East.\n  We need a new energy future that contains strong provisions dealing \nwith conservation, aggressive approaches to renewable and limitless \nsources of energy, and embraces a new hydrogen fuel cell future which \ncan allow us to break our dependence on foreign oil.\n  If a meaningful energy policy is analogous to a novel, then this bill \nis just a first chapter. It is not as comprehensive, as wise, or as \nbold as the American people have a right to expect. Let me reiterate, \nthis is not a be-all-end-all comprehensive Energy bill, no matter who \ntells you it is. I am prepared to continue to modify, amend, and reform \nthis measure as many times and as long as it takes in order to ensure \nit does what it is supposed to do: create a fair and balanced national \nenergy policy, one that works to advance our country's interest.\n  In closing, we are left with two choices: one, do nothing and pray we \ndon't have further blackouts, further price spikes, or God forbid, a \nterrorist strike on our supply of foreign oil; or two, enact the \nproposed energy legislation and use it as the first brick in the \nfoundation of crafting a comprehensive energy policy that will reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil and strengthen our energy diversity and \nsecurity.\n  Given these two choices, I choose action over inaction and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the pending \nbusiness before the Senate is the Intelligence conference report; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge Senate passage of \nthe conference report for the Fiscal Year 2004 Intelligence \nAuthorization Act.\n  On November 20 the conference report was approved by the House of \nRepresentatives. In order to quickly provide the Intelligence Community \nthe authorities it requires in order to pay, house, and equip its \npersonnel for our most sensitive and critical national security work, \nthis legislation should be sent to the President without delay. The \nhorrible terrorist attacks in Turkey underscore the urgency of our \ntask.\n  This conference report is good legislation with important management \nand budget authorities. I will review just a few of them for you.\n  In the conference report, the Senate receded to a number of \nsignificant House provisions of interest. The most significant of these \nis a provision that will consolidate and organize existing \nintelligence-related functions in the Department of the Treasury by \ncreating a new Office of Intelligence and Analysis. This \nadministration-supported provision also creates a new Assistant \nSecretary position.\n  Senate managers also accepted a House provision intended to foster \nbetter information-sharing among Federal, State and local government \nofficials. The bombings in Turkey illustrate that terrorists remain \ncapable of striking at the heart of peaceful societies. We must be \nprepared to meet this continuing threat.\n  The conference report retains a Senate provision on Central \nIntelligence Agency Compensation Reform, with a House amendment to \nensure that Congress will have an opportunity to assess the impact of \nsuch reform before it becomes permanent.\n  The conference report provides important new personal services \ncontracting authority to the Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigations. This authority is intended to permit the Director to \nexercise greater hiring flexibility as was recommended post-9/11 in \norder to bring aboard certain categories of critically-needed skills \nmore quickly.\n  Turning to the budget, when we began to review the President's fiscal \nyear 2004 request I became very concerned at the recent growth in \nintelligence funding. I am still concerned.\n  There is clearly not enough money in future years to fully fund the \nintelligence programs in this year's budget request. That is the sad \nreality of this budget. The intelligence community is stretched thin, \nwith far more requirements than available funds. Too many projects and \nactivities have been started that cannot be accommodated in the top \nline. It does not matter what caused this problem. The problem exists. \nUnless the President directs a dramatic and sustained increase to the \nintelligence budget next year, we will have to make the hard choices \nourselves.\n  A significant issue that must be addressed by the executive branch is \nthe manner in which cost estimates for the procurement of major \nintelligence community systems are conducted. The magnitude and \nconsistency in the cost growth on recent acquisitions indicates a \nsystemic intelligence community bias to underestimate the cost of major \nsystems.\n  This ``perceived affordability'' creates difficulties in the out \nyears as the National Foreign Intelligence Program becomes burdened \nwith content that is\n\n[[Page S15355]]\n\nmore costly than the budgeted funding. This underestimation of future \ncosts has resulted in significant re-shuffling of NFIP funds to meet \nemerging shortfalls.\n  In an attempt to correct this problem, the conference report contains \na provision which would mandate a fundamentally more sound approach to \ncost estimates for major systems. The business-as-usual approach must \nend.\n  There is another area I wish to mention in general terms concerning \nthe analytical capabilities of the intelligence community. All recent \nafter-action reports or studies of intelligence failures point to the \ninability of analysts to process ever-growing quantities of \ninformation. In an effort to correct this problem, the conferees agreed \nto move funds to programs at the Defense Intelligence Agency, the \nNational Security Agency, and the CIA to improve the community's \nanalytic capabilities.\n  My key objectives in formulating the conference report were to ensure \nour Nation's continuing effort to prosecute the war on terrorism and to \nensure that the ``longer view'' about intelligence community \nrequirements is taken into account. I believe that this conference \nreport meets both objectives.\n  We met those objectives because we had bipartisan cooperation when \nand where it counted. I wish to thank the distinguished vice chairman, \nSenator Rockefeller, as well as the distinguished House chairman, \nRepresentative Goss, and his ranking member, Representative Harman, for \ntheir assistance in making the conference report possible. The staff of \nboth intelligence Committees must also be commended for their diligent \nwork on this important legislation.\n  There is no opposition on our side of the aisle. We have worked very \nhard with the House to come up with a good compromise. This bill is \nvitally needed on behalf of national security. A similar bill passed \nthe Senate several weeks ago by unanimous consent.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague, the vice chairman, Senator \nRockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I agree with the chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from Kansas. There is no objection on this side. \nIt has been cleared. There is no objection on our side. I presume the \nbill will be voted through.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished chairman of the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence in recommending passage of the \nconference report on H.R. 2417, the Intelligence Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2004.\n  The bill authorizes appropriations for the Central Intelligence \nAgency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, \nand the intelligence components of the F.B.I. and other U.S. government \nagencies. It also contains a number of important provisions intended to \nlay the foundation for process and organizational changes in the \nintelligence community.\n  The classified nature of U.S. intelligence activities prevents us \nfrom disclosing publicly the details of our budgetary recommendations. \nAs I described to the Senate when our bill was considered in July, 10 \nyears ago I joined a majority of Senate colleagues in voting to express \nthe sense of Congress that the aggregate amount requested, authorized, \nand spent for intelligence should be disclosed to the public in an \nappropriate manner. The House opposed the provision. I continue to \nbelieve that we should find a means, consistent with national security, \nof sharing with the American taxpayer information about the total \namount, although not the details, of our intelligence spending. In \nholding the intelligence community accountable for performance, and the \nCongress and the President accountable for the resources they provide \nto the Intelligence Community, citizens should know the Nation's \noverall investment in intelligence.\n  The bill includes a number of provisions intended to promote \ninnovations in information sharing, human intelligence, and \ncounterintelligence, among other things. Many of these initiatives \nrepresent initial steps rather than solutions, but they are necessary \nto raise the level of awareness in Congress and the executive branch \nregarding a variety of urgent and complex challenges and to lay the \nfoundation for reforms the committee will be considering next year.\n  Section 351 of the bill requires a report on the threat posed by \nespionage in an era when secrets are stored on powerful, classified \nU.S. computer networks rather than on paper. A single spy today can \nremove more information on a disk than spies of yesteryear could remove \nwith a truck. We have already suffered losses, for example, in the \nAmes, Regan, and Hanssen cases, where sloppy computer security \npermitted traitors to exploit large quantities of highly classified \ninformation. Unfortunately, these cases provide a warning that appears \nto have gone largely unheeded. We still do not have a cohesive set of \npolicies and procedures to protect our classified networks from cleared \ninsiders who seek to betray their country, Our reliance on classified \ninformation systems for warfighting and intelligence is growing daily, \nyet hundreds of thousands of individuals have virtually unrestricted \naccess to these critical networks.\n  All but a few Government personnel are honest and patriotic \nAmericans, but the sad fact is that there has not been a day since WWII \nwhen we have not had spies within our Government. There have been over \n80 espionage convictions in the last 25 years. They include personnel \nfrom the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NSA, CIA, FBI, State \nDepartment, the National Reconnaissance Office and the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense. It is a very real and continuing problem and \nthere will undoubtedly be more espionage arrests in the months and \nyears ahead. Espionage is an unfortunate fact of life, and we simply \ncannot afford to operate classified systems in which thousands of \nindividuals enjoy the ability to download or upload classified \ninformation at will.\n  Other countries are seeking to exploit this situation to collect \ndefense secrets, and no doubt contemplate blinding our Government and \ntroops in time of war. We would never permit such broad access to \nweapons in an armory, yet these classified systems are of much greater \nstrategic significance than M-16 rifles, tanks, or 500 pound gravity \nbombs. We simply must develop the policies and capabilities necessary \nto control input and output devices on these systems and monitor their \nuse.\n  Section 352 of the bill calls for a review of our cumbersome, \noutmoded, and many would say ineffective personnel security system. It \nis a fact that almost every spy has held high-level security \nclearances. It is also a fact that few, if any of these individuals \nwere identified through routine security clearance updates.\n  Most people who become spies join the government with no intention of \nbetraying their country. Research by the Defense Department shows that \nmost spies are people who develop grievances as their careers progress, \nat times having developed money and alcohol problems as well, and then \nturn to espionage as a way of feeding their egos and their bank \naccounts.\n  Yet, we give a young, single Navy recruit seeking an intelligence \nassignment the same scrutiny as a 30-year intelligence operative with \nfinancial troubles who routinely travels to countries of concern. \nFurther, even when derogatory information surfaces, sometimes even very \ndisturbing information which raises serious espionage issues, the \ngovernment rarely revokes the clearances we rely on so heavily and \nwhich cost so much.\n  In the information age, we cannot wait 5 to10 years to identify \nemployee problems that may be related to espionage. Too much damage can \nbe done too quickly. We need fresh thinking and recommendations that \nwill provide more effective security for the large sums of money the \ntaxpayer is investing.\n  Section 354 of our bill calls for a review of classified information \nsharing policies within the Federal Government. This is an issue \nclosely related to the foregoing provisions regarding inadequate \nsecurity policies. ATM machines, for example, are a wonderfully \nconvenient and effective means of providing access to banking \nresources--but they could not exist without magnetic cards, personal \nidentification\n\n[[Page S15356]]\n\nnumbers, cameras and locks. Similarly, improved security is not a \nbarrier to more flexible information sharing, it is a fundamental \ningredient. The Joint Inquiry report on the 9/11 attacks highlighted \ninformation sharing as a critical shortcoming that prevented the \ninterception of several hijackers. To help accelerate reform, the Joint \nInquiry requested an administration report by this past June 30 on \nprogress to reduce barriers among intelligence and law enforcement \nagencies engaged in counterterrorism. Unfortunately, no report has been \nsubmitted.\n\n  We have the technology for improved information sharing, and \nsignificant progress is being made. A Terrorist Threat Integration \nCenter has been established, and new guidelines regarding sharing of \ngrand jury information have been promulgated. These are very important \nsteps forward. But to truly break down the barriers to information \nsharing, rather than relying on work-arounds, we need revised policies \non sharing classified information which recognize and exploit the \nopportunities provided by modern information technology. This is \nespecially important as we look to bridging the gap between the \nIntelligence Community and organizations charged with Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Section 355 of the bill identifies a problem that would probably stun \nmost taxpayers. Simply stated, notwithstanding the many billions of \ndollars invested in complex intelligence systems, ranging from \nsatellites, to aircraft, to ships, and land-based collection platforms, \nthere is no capability in the executive branch to independently and \ncomprehensively model the performance of these systems. Consequently, \nnew multi-billion-dollar systems are procured without the ability to \nrigorously evaluate potential trade-offs with other systems.\n  Questions such as these should be asked: Given projected satellite, \naircraft and UAV constellations, what is the marginal value of adding \nspace-based radar satellites? Are there alternative investments that \ncan better satisfy intelligence requirements? Don't senior policymakers \nneed the ability to systematically examine the interactions of these \nmany systems to identify trade-offs that can be achieved?\n  Currently, most of the analysis of proposed collection systems is \nperformed by the agencies seeking to justify their programs, or by \nsenior policy officials who struggle to apply common sense and spread-\nsheet level analysis to systems that often have overlapping \ncapabilities. There is no reason that a rigorous, independent and \ncomprehensive capability cannot be developed to support the \nprogrammatic reviews of the DCI and the Defense Department. This is but \none example, though an important one, of the ways in which we believe \nthe intelligence community can improve its strategic planning and \ndecisionmaking processes.\n  Section 356 of the bill raises an issue of profound strategic \nsignificance for the United States, namely the growing reliance of our \ncountry on hardware and software produced overseas. Although specific \ncases are classified, this is clearly a growing problem.\n  After 1973, when the risks inherent in America's reliance on foreign \noil became clear, many positive steps were taken to ameliorate our \nnational vulnerabilities. Those steps included establishment of a \nstrategic petroleum reserve, establishment of the Central Command, and \nresearch into alternative fuels. Unlike our dependence on foreign oil, \nhowever, our rapidly growing dependence on foreign hardware and \nsoftware creates numerous opportunities for espionage and information \noperations that are extremely difficult to detect. Ironically, the \ncountries identified by the FBI as most actively engaged in economic \nespionage against the United States are leading producers of the \nhardware and software we all use on a daily basis.\n  The plain truth is that even the Defense Department does not know \nwhere most of the hardware and software it uses originates. Moreover, \nthe Government does not have the right to examine source code unless \nvoluntarily supplied. Further, at the present time, there are limited \ncapabilities for analyzing source code that is made available. This \nsituation requires serious attention by senior policymakers, including \nCongress, and the report required by section 356 should help to prompt \na long overdue discussion of these issues.\n  In concluding my remarks, I would like to look beyond our current \nbill to the issues the Intelligence Committee must contend with next \nyear. Other committees share responsibility for reviewing the funding \nand systems needed by the intelligence community, but our committee is \nuniquely positioned to evaluate the intelligence community's \nperformance--both its successes and failures--and to identify the \nchanges required to meet the challenges of the future.\n  In my view, money alone is not sufficient to enable the intelligence \ncommunity to reach its full potential. The current structure of the \nintelligence community is fundamentally unchanged from its \nestablishment in 1947. Serious change is long overdue. I strongly \nbelieve that new structures and authorities, coupled with able and \naggressive leadership, are required to dramatically improve our \nintelligence community's efficiency and effectiveness.\n  In many respects, the organizational issues confronting the \nintelligence community are analogous to those confronting the Defense \nDepartment prior to the Goldwater-Nichols Act. The fundamental problem \nconfronting the Department of Defense prior to Goldwater-Nichols was \nexcessive military service control over military operations, policies \nand budgets. In response, Congress strengthened the weak integrating \nmechanisms in DoD, specifically the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and \nthe Commanders of the Combatant Commands. The difference in military \nperformance before Goldwater-Nichols--e.g., Desert 1, Lebanon, and \nGrenada--and after--Panama, Haiti, and Iraq--is stark and clear. In \nfact, I am convinced that the Goldwater-Nichols Act did more to enhance \nU.S. national security than any weapons system ever procured by the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Although the Goldwater-Nichols reorganization is not a precise \ntemplate for restructuring the intelligence community, the problems are \nfundamentally similar: towering vertical structures--NSA, CIA, DIA, \nNRO, NIMA, the service intelligence components--and relatively weak \nintegrating mechanisms--the DCI and his Community Management Staff. Any \nreorganization proposal needs to address this fundamental problem of \ninadequate integration and coordination. In that regard, I would \nsuggest that the intelligence community's lack of responsiveness to the \nDCI's declaration of war on al- Qaida prior to 9/11 was in part a \nresult of the DCI's weak community management authorities and inability \nto move the system. I am convinced that a strengthened DCI could more \neffectively manage the intelligence community, leading to performance \nimprovements comparable to those achieved by the military in the wake \nof the Goldwater-Nichols Act.\n  A conservative, incremental approach would involve the creation of a \npermanent cadre to staff the DCI much as the Secretary of Defense has \nan OSD staff. This simple change, coupled with aggressive business \nprocess reengineering and ``year of execution budget authority'' for \nthe DCI over NFIP programs, would significantly strengthen the DCI's \nability to manage the intelligence community and respond to new threats \nand opportunities.\n  A more aggressive and far-reaching plan would have to address the \nfundamental changes that have occurred since the current structure was \nestablished by the National Security Act of 1947. Specifically, it \nwould recognize that the once useful distinction between home and \nabroad has become not only irrelevant, but dysfunctional. This is not \nto suggest any need to reduce the protections afforded U.S. persons \nunder the Constitution, merely that globalization and the development \nof cyberspace, combined with the rise of apocalyptic terrorists groups \nempowered by lethal new technologies, require a different, more agile \nstructure that is not impeded by outmoded geographic distinctions. In \nthat regard, we should find ways to more effectively coordinate foreign \nand domestic intelligence.\n  Achievement of any substantial reorganization will require meticulous \nresearch by the congressional oversight committees, a substantial \nhearing record, and sustained interest by the administration. At the \nend of the day,\n\n[[Page S15357]]\n\nincremental steps will be better than none, and a more aggressive \nreorganization require a consensus not only on the Intelligence \nAuthorization Committees, but with the Armed Services Committees as \nwell. As challenging as these issues are, we simply cannot fulfill our \nduty to the American people unless we confront these crucial issues \nwhen Congress returns next year.\n  In conclusion, the important steps we have taken with this measure, \nto include full funding of the administration's requests for \nintelligence activities, are the result of lengthy deliberations on \nmatters as complex as they are vital. It is gratifying to see the work \nthat has been done in both Chambers come together today in a bill we \ncan send to the President. It is a useful first step, but only a first \nstep, towards the development of an intelligence community better able \nto adapt to the rapidly evolving threats confronting our great nation.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the chairman and the Committee staff \nfor their arduous work on this bill. I look forward to making great \nstrides together next year.\n  I urge support for this measure.\n\n\n                  OFFICE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYSIS\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in my capacity as the chairman of \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs regarding the \nConference Report to accompany H.R. 2417, the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act of 2004. Section 105 of the act will create a new \nOffice of Intelligence and Analysis within the Department of the \nTreasury. The Office is to be headed by a newly authorized Assistant \nSecretary for Intelligence and Analysis appointed by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate. It will enhance the Department's access to \nintelligence community information and permit a reorganization and \nupgrading of the scope and capacities of Treasury's intelligence \nfunctions in light of the Nation's counterterrorist and economic \nsanctions programs. This section was drafted with bipartisan \nparticipation and close coordination with the Department of the \nTreasury.\n  The particular terms governing the new office are important to me as \nchairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs over \nlegislative and oversight matters relating, inter alia, to the Nation's \neconomic sanctions laws and the Bank Secrecy Act, and, more generally, \nbecause of the importance of carefully delineating the limitations on \nany part of the U.S. intelligence community that lie within the \nstructure of an executive department of the Government. I have a letter \nsigned by the ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senator Paul S. \nSarbanes, and myself addressed to Secretary of the Treasury John W. \nSnow, as well as Secretary Snow's response. This letter reflects the \nagreement of Treasury about the organization, structure and role of the \nnew Office and Assistant Secretary position created and important \nrelated organizational matters concerning the Financial Crimes \nEnforcement Network and the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n  I request unanimous consent that the two letters be included in the \nRecord. They provide, I believe, a good statement of congressional \nintent with regard to the establishment of the new Office and the new \nAssistant Secretary position. At this time I would yield the floor to \nthe ranking member of the committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \nAffairs, Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator. I simply want to note my agreement \nwith the chairman and with his request to include the two letters in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n           Affairs,\n                                Washington, DC, November 20, 2003.\n     Hon. John W. Snowe,\n     Secretary of the Treasury, Department of the Treasury, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Snowe: A proposed amendment to section 105 \n     of the Intelligence Authorization Act of 2004, H.R. 2417, \n     would create a new Office of Intelligence and Analysis within \n     the Department of the Treasury, The Office would be headed by \n     a newly-authorized Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and \n     Analysis appointed by the President and confirmed by the \n     Senate. The Office would enhance the Department's access to \n     Intelligence Community information and permit a \n     reorganization and upgrading of the scope and capacities of \n     Treasury's intelligence functions in light of the nation's \n     counter-terrorist and economic sanctions programs.\n       We are writing to you to confirm formally, before \n     consideration of the amendment proceeds, your and our mutual \n     understanding of the role of the proposed new Office and \n     Assistant Secretary within the Department of the Treasury. \n     Such confirmation is necessary because of the authority of \n     the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \n     over legislative and oversight matters relating, inter alia, \n     to the Nation's economic sanctions laws and the Bank Secrecy \n     Act, and, more generally, to the Nation's financial system. \n     In that context, the Committee is necessarily concerned with \n     the careful delineation of the functions, and limitations, of \n     any part of the U.S. Intelligence Community that lies within \n     the structure of the Department of the Treasury.\n       Based on discussions between members of our staffs and the \n     Assistant Secretary of the Treasury (Legislative Affairs), we \n     understand that:\n       1. The new Office is to be responsible for the receipt, \n     collation, analysis, and dissemination of all foreign \n     intelligence and foreign counterintelligence information \n     relevant to the operations and responsibilities of the \n     Treasury Department, and to have such other directly related \n     duties and authorities as the Secretary of the Treasury may \n     assign to it. The new Office will replace and absorb the \n     duties and personnel of Treasury's present Office of \n     Intelligence Support (``OIS'') and will carry on OIS' work in \n     the provision of information for use of the Department's \n     senior policy makers.\n       2. The Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis \n     will report to an Under Secretary of the Treasury \n     (Enforcement) as required by the statute. The Assistant \n     Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis will at no time \n     supervise any organization other than the new Office or \n     assume any other policy or supervisory duties not directly \n     related to that Office.\n       3. The Secretary will seek prompt designation of a new \n     appointee for the vacant position of Under Secretary, and \n     ensure the chain of command will be organized and implemented \n     as outlined above.\n       4. Our mutual understanding is that Treasury plans to have \n     an official appointed to a vacant Assistant Secretary \n     position. The official appointed to that position will \n     supervise the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC'') and \n     the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (``FinCEN'') as well \n     as other functions, but he or she will at no time supervise \n     the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. This Assistant \n     Secretary also will report to the Under Secretary referred to \n     in paragraphs 2. and 3., above.\n       5. The general responsibilities of OFAC and FinCEN will not \n     be changed in the course of creating the new Office and these \n     new positions. However, it is anticipated that the new Office \n     will coordinate and oversee all work involving intelligence \n     analysts who work in OFAC and FinCEN (or in other parts of \n     the Treasury) primarily with classified information, in the \n     interest of creating the more robust analytic capability at \n     Treasury that was the articulated reason for the \n     authorization of this new Office. One of the primary tasks of \n     the new Office will be to examine and analyze classified \n     information, in conjunction with the relevant unclassified \n     information already available to OFAC and FinCEN, so that the \n     resultant product can be of use to OFAC and FinCEN as well as \n     to other agencies, under applicable legal rules. Thus, the \n     new Office will have access to all relevant information held \n     by FinCEN and OFAC for national security and anti-terrorism \n     purposes.\n       The expertise of the Department of the Treasury is \n     necessary and integral to our Nation's security and to \n     success in the war on terrorism. We expect within the next \n     year to highlight your efforts in this area in one of the \n     series of Terror Finance hearings to be held by the \n     Committee, and we look forward to hearing at that time about \n     the innovative approaches to counter-terrorism efforts that \n     the proposed revitalization of Treasury's capacity for \n     financial intelligence analysis can produce.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard C. Shelby,\n       Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.\n     Paul S. Sarbanes,\n       Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n     Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 21, 2003.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Development, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shelby: Thank you for your letter concerning \n     creation, in section 105 of the Intelligence Authorization \n     Act of 2004, of the proposed Office of Intelligence and \n     Analysis, to be headed by a new Assistant Secretary for \n     Intelligence and Analysis, within the Department of the \n     Treasury. I have reviewed your letter and it correctly states \n     the commitments made to you on behalf about the role of the \n     proposed new Office and new Assistant Secretary within the \n     Department of the Treasury.\n       I appreciate your input and look forward to working with \n     you, Senator Sarbanes, and\n\n[[Page S15358]]\n\n     your House colleagues to make sure the Treasury Department \n     meets the Congress' expectations. An identical letter has \n     also been sent to Senator Sarbanes.\n       If there is anything that I can do to be of assistance to \n     you, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John W.

Mr. President, we have just concluded a cloture vote which \nwill give us the opportunity to look more carefully at the Energy bill \nthat is before the Senate. I believe such a careful and thorough review \nof the bill is entirely warranted. Indeed, it is not just my opinion \nbut the opinion of countless numbers of Americans and also countless \nnumbers of opinion leaders throughout the country.\n  These are a sample of some of the editorials that have appeared with \nrespect to the Energy bill. The Washington Post calls the bill \n``depleted energy.'' The New York Times says ``a shortage of energy''. \nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution directs: ``Put backroom energy bill \nout of the country's misery.'' The Houston Chronicle: ``Fix the flaws--\nthis proposed energy bill is half a loaf, half baked.''\n  The American people deserve good national energy policy, created \nthrough an open and democratic process. Sadly, the legislation before \nthe Senate is not such a policy nor has it been achieved through an \nopen and transparent and collaborative process. The Energy bill was \ncrafted behind closed doors by members of one political party who chose \nto involve industry but not elected Senators and Congress men and \nwomen. It looks as if the industry got the bill they wanted.\n  We have been told ``take it or leave it.'' I hope we can leave this \nbill behind. I hope this cloture vote signifies such a development.\n  If we leave it behind, one of the salient aspects of the Energy bill \npresented to Members is that it does not leave any lobbyist behind. In \nfact, to borrow a statement from my colleague from Arizona, this bill, \nindeed, leaves no lobbyist behind.\n  There is an Archer Daniels Midland ethanol provision adding $8.5 \nbillion to gas prices over each of the next 5 years while cutting $2 \nbillion a year from the highway trust fund. It seems to me to be \nimplausible, indeed irrational, that we would enhance an industry while \nat the same time depriving our local cities and towns and States of the \nmoney they need to maintain the roads and bridges of America.\n  According to the Denver Post, there is $180 million to pay for \ndevelopment projects in Shreveport, LA, including the city's first ever \nHooters restaurant. I am not sure how that will help our energy policy.\n  Let's not forget the $2 billion that taxpayers bear to clean up the \nmess left by MTBE producers.\n  As the Wall Street Journal wrote:\n\n       We'll say this for the energy bill that is about to come to \n     a final vote in Congress: It's certainly comprehensive. It \n     may not have all that much to do with energy anymore, but it \n     does give something to every last elected Representative.\n\n  This bill utterly fails to establish an energy policy for the 21st \ncentury. It does nothing to address our country's dependence on foreign \noil, an issue I will discuss at length in a few minutes.\n  In addition, it contains so many provisions that will hurt consumers \nand damage the environment that it is impossible to list them all. Here \nare just a few:\n  The bill doubles the use of ethanol in gasoline, which will drive up \ngasoline prices and deny valuable revenue to fix our roads.\n  The bill fails to make the reforms necessary to modernize our \nelectricity grid and enhance reliability by providing a standard set of \nrules for our electricity markets. These rules would have provided \ngreater efficiencies, greater reliability, and reasonably priced \nelectricity that our homes and businesses need.\n  The bill increases air pollution by delaying rules to control mercury \nand ozone pollution, putting millions of Americans at risk for health \nproblems.\n  The bill increases water pollution by exempting oil and gas \nexploration and production activities from the Clean Water Act storm \nwater program.\n  The bill allows drilling on our coastlines by diminishing States' \nrights to review offshore oil development projects and other proposed \nFederal activities to determine if the projects are consistent with the \nState coastal management plans.\n  The bill threatens our national security by failing to reduce the \nNation's dependence on foreign oil and providing billions of dollars in \nsubsidies to build new nuclear powerplants. And the list goes on and on \nand on.\n  The American public deserves an economically sound Energy bill that \nwill strengthen our economy and create good-paying jobs for Americans. \nBut that is not this Energy bill before us.\n  This Energy bill is business as usual. It is a special interest grab \nbag cloaked in the rhetoric that it would create jobs and spur the \neconomy. The cost of the entire bill is estimated to exceed $100 \nbillion, more than $120,000 for each job that the authors claim the \nbill will create. With the tax breaks alone costing American taxpayers \nover $25 billion, this bill adds to the deficit and further reduces \nspending for vital programs, such as education, health care, and water \ninfrastructure.\n  The American public also deserve an environmentally friendly Energy \nbill that will protect our air and water and reduce greenhouse gases. \nBut that is not this Energy bill.\n  This Energy bill will endanger the public's health by allowing the \nenergy industry to increase the pollution it emits into the air and \nwater and limiting environmental review of energy projects.\n  One of the most egregious giveaways to corporations, at the expense \nof the environment and public health, is the product liability \nprotection for MTBE. MTBE is known to cause serious damage to water \nquality nationwide. This immunity provision--which is retroactive to \nSeptember 5, 2003, before virtually all the recent lawsuits involving \nMTBE--would shift $29 billion in cleanup costs from polluting \ncorporations to taxpayers and water customers.\n  My State of Rhode Island and our residents are all too familiar with \nthe dangers of MTBE. After MTBE leaked from an underground storage tank \nat a gas station and found its way into the water system of the Pascoag \nUtility District in Burrillville, RI, in the summer of 2001, more than \n1,200 families were forced to use bottled water for drinking, cooking, \nand food preparation for several months. Subsequent tests showed MTBE \nat such high levels that the State department of health recommended \nresidents reduce shower and bath times and ventilate bathrooms with \nexhaust or window fans. Fortunately, Pascoag's lawsuit against \nExxonMobil to pay for the cleanup was filed before the September 5, \n2003, cutoff date, but many similar suits filed on behalf of residents \nin New Hampshire and other States will be thrown out by this bill. \nThat, to me, is a tragedy.\n  The American people deserve a meaningful Energy bill that will ensure \nour national security by ending our dependence on foreign oil, \ndiversifying our energy resources, and increasing our Nation's energy \nefficiency. But that is not this Energy bill.\n  This Energy bill perpetuates the failed policies of the past 30 \nyears, focusing almost exclusively on squeezing what little domestic \nenergy production\n\n[[Page S15359]]\n\nis available and offering generous incentives to the oil and gas \nindustry while giving little attention to developing alternative \nsources of energy and reducing consumption. We have to face the facts: \nWe cannot drill our way to energy independence.\n  Furthermore, the bill creates new security threats by reversing a \nlongstanding ban on the reprocessing of spent fuel from commercial \nnuclear reactors. It promotes, through the Department of Energy's \nadvanced fuel cycle initiative, joint nuclear research efforts with \nnonweapon states, undermining efforts to curtail new weapons systems. \nThe proliferation of nuclear weapons is one of the most challenging and \ndifficult and serious problems we face, and we are now involving \nourselves with states that do not have nuclear weapons, but we are \ndoing so in a way that we could inadvertently and unintentionally give \nthem insights that are advantages. This is poor proliferation policy as \nwell as, I believe, poor energy policy.\n  Our Nation needs a comprehensive Energy bill, but we must reorder our \npriorities if we want to achieve greater energy independence. \nYesterday's solutions will not meet today's urgent need for energy \nsecurity. Increased efficiency in our homes, our cars, and our \nindustries, renewable energy resources, and new technologies will \nsecure our energy independence.\n\n  We are on a collision course that threatens our economic and national \nsecurity. Worldwide oil consumption is projected to grow by 60 percent \nover the next two decades. For developing countries, the growth is \nexpected to be much higher, possibly as much as 115 percent. China and \nIndia will be major contributors to these increases in demand and will \nrequire imports to meet their needs.\n  Chinese economic expansion is rapidly changing the oil demand map \nthroughout the world. The International Energy Agency estimates that \nChinese demand for oil next year will rise to 5.7 million barrels per \nday. This would account for about a third of global demand growth. \nGrowing global demand will raise prices for U.S. consumers as countries \nrace for the world's remaining oil supply.\n  Two-thirds of the world's proven crude oil reserves are in the Middle \nEast. While experts disagree about when global oil production is likely \nto peak, they agree that when it does, the vast majority of remaining \nuntapped reserves will be left in the Middle East and imports to feed \nour growing global demand for oil will come from the Persian Gulf.\n  What is the result of this increasing global demand? Many countries, \nincluding our allies and trading partners, will compete with us for \nfinite oil supplies as their and our economies rely more heavily on \nimports. This will inevitably stress the delicate balance that exists \namong national interests in the world and give the Middle East a \ndisproportionate leverage in the international arena.\n  America's dependence on imported oil is a major constraint on our \nforeign policy. A substantial portion of our Nation's military budget \nis spent in the Middle East for the defense of oil. Our policy toward \nthe Middle East will not change as long as our economy remains \ndependent on oil from the region. The United States has less than 5 \npercent of the world's population but consumes 26 percent of the \nworld's oil. Oil imports contribute to our trade deficit and heighten \nour economy's vulnerability to oil price spikes. According to the Rocky \nMountain Institute, 53 percent of the U.S. oil supply is imported and \none-fourth is from the 11 countries of the OPEC cartel.\n  Net oil imports cost the United States $109 billion in the year \n2000--29 percent of the then-record trade deficit. Retail oil products \ncost Americans more than one-quarter trillion dollars per year. As long \nas the U.S. economy is dependent on oil, we remain vulnerable to major \noil disruptions anywhere in the world and to domestic price spikes. \nAccording to the Department of Energy, every million barrels of oil per \nday taken out of production increases world oil prices by $3 to $5 per \nbarrel. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development \nestimates that an increase of $10 per barrel would cut U.S. economic \ngrowth by .2 percent and boost consumer prices by .4 percent. A .2 \npercent drop in growth would cost the economy $22 billion.\n  Our economy is extremely vulnerable to variability in oil prices, and \nwe are doing nothing in this legislation to give ourselves a hedge \nagainst those variable oil prices.\n  To achieve energy security, we must wean our economy off its heavy \nreliance on oil. The immediate priority must be to head off growth in \ndemand. Efficiency is the cheapest energy source. Let me say that \nagain. Efficiency is the cheapest energy source--not drilling in Alaska \nor the gulf or any place else.\n  In 2000, America used 40 percent less energy and 49 percent less oil \nto produce each dollar of GDP than in 1975. Why? Because after the 1973 \noil embargo, we were shocked into taking steps to improve our \nefficiency. We raised gas mileage standards. We provided support \nincentives for energy improvements and efficiencies throughout our \nsociety. This savings we have been able to develop since 1975 has been \nfive times our domestic output of oil in that period.\n  So we essentially saved five times more oil than we produced in the \nperiod. We need to use energy in a way that saves money. It is much \ncheaper to conserve energy and increase efficiency than build a nuclear \npowerplant. It is much cheaper and much less deadly to conserve energy \nand increase efficiency than to send troops to protect oil interests in \nthe Middle East, as we have done since the first Persian Gulf war. \nWhile our soldiers in Iraq are fighting for many reasons, we cannot \ndivorce what is happening in the Middle East from our dependence on \noil. This bill may create a few jobs, but will it save lives? Will it \nprevent future military conflicts undertaken to feed America's \naddiction to oil? I don't think so. I think a bill like this should do \nprecisely that.\n  The Energy conference report that we are considering is too heavily \nweighted towards production with minimal emphasis on increasing energy \nefficiency. According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient \nEconomy, the conservation savings in the bill will amount to only about \n3 months of U.S. energy consumption between now and the year 2020. That \nfact bears repeating. Over the next 17 years, this bill conserves only \n3 months worth of energy or 1.5 percent of energy use. The bill could \nhave and should have saved at least four times as much energy through \nconservation.\n  This bill could have taken meaningful steps to secure our energy \nfuture, but the drafters of the bill chose not to. The energy \nconference could have reduced our dependence on foreign oil by \nincreasing CAFE standards, but they did not. In model year 2002, the \naverage fuel economy for cars and light trucks was 20.4 miles per \ngallon, a 22-year low. Yet if performance and weight had stayed \nconstant since 1981, the average fuel economy would have improved 33 \npercent, enough to displace the amount of oil we import from the \nPersian Gulf 2.5 times over. To displace Persian Gulf imports would \nonly take a 3.35 mile-per-gallon increase in the 2000 light vehicle \nfleet. We are risking our soldiers in the Persian Gulf, but we are \nunwilling to raise mileage standards in the United States. If we don't \ndo that, I fear we will be at risk again and again and again--our \ntroops, our economy, and our society.\n  According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, since 1975, the U.S. has \ndoubled the economic activity wrung from each barrel of oil. Overall \nenergy savings, worth about $365 billion in 2000 alone, are effectively \nthe Nation's biggest and fastest growing major energy source, \nequivalent to three times our total oil imports or 12 times our Persian \nGulf imports. Let me say that again. We have the greatest resource \navailable to us. It is not oil under the ground or under the sea. It is \nenergy efficiency. Yet this bill refuses to tap that great resource.\n  During 1977 to 1985, gross domestic product rose 27 percent. Oil use \nfell 17 percent. Net oil imports fell 42 percent, and imports from the \nPersian Gulf fell 87 percent. When we were forced by the embargo in \n1973 to take steps to improve efficiency, the results were palpable, \ndramatic, and beneficial. The key to the huge 1977-85 oil savings was \nbetter mileage for our automobiles. Unfortunately, light vehicle \nefficiency\n\n[[Page S15360]]\n\nstagnated through the 1990s. And we refused to do the obvious and \nincrease those standards.\n  Taking steps to reinvigorate the CAFE program is the best way to \nproduce dramatic savings in oil consumption, those savings that we \nwitnessed in the 1970s and 1980s. That is why I am an original \ncosponsor of S. 794, which would increase fuel economy standards for \npassenger vehicles to 40 miles per gallon by 2015 and for pickup trucks \nby 27.4 miles per gallon. This would save 1.8 million barrels of oil a \nday by 2015, and 3.1 million barrels a day by 2020. This is the Energy \nbill we need, not the one we are considering.\n  Indeed, this approach, a technological approach, is most suited to \nour greatest advantages. We are the Nation of technological innovation. \nWe are the Nation that first ventured into space dramatically and went \nto the moon. I cannot believe that if we give them the simple mission \nof raising gas mileage standards, that our automobile industry cannot \ndo so and do so promptly without losing jobs, without losing market \nshare.\n  While we fail to take action to increase fuel economy standards and \nprovide $100,000 tax loopholes for SUVs, China, already a growing \neconomic power, recognizes the need to reduce its oil demands from the \nMiddle East. In contrast to this bill, China is preparing fuel \nefficiency rules that will be significantly more stringent than those \nin the United States. The Chinese standards call for new cars, vans, \nand sport utility vehicles to get as much as 2 miles a gallon of fuel \nmore in 2005 than the average required in the United States and about 5 \nmiles more in 2008.\n\n  Let me guarantee you, our automobile manufacturers will be trying \ndesperately to sell in that market, and we will be producing cars that \ngo into that market. Yet they will turn to us and say: It is impossible \nto do that here in the United States.\n  The Chinese are more sensitive to the global imbalance in supply and \ndemand for petroleum products than we are. They are taking action--and \nwe can't--because they recognize the economic implications and the \nnational security implications.\n  The Energy bill before us could have reduced our dependence on \nforeign oil and strengthened national security by including a renewable \nportfolio standard for America's electricity industry. A strong \nrenewable portfolio standard would diversify our fuel supply, clean our \nair, and better protect our consumers from electricity price shocks.\n  According to the Energy Information Agency, gradually requiring \nutilities to produce 20 percent of electricity from renewable resources \nsuch as solar and wind is both affordable and feasible. In addition, it \nwould create jobs by spurring $80 billion in new capital investment. \nAgain, this is the Energy bill we need, not the one we are considering.\n  For over 30 years, through four different Presidencies, Americans \nhave been promised that our Government would end the national security \nthreat caused by our dependence on foreign oil. But energy security \nmeans more than drilling in new places for oil and natural gas. It \nstarts with using less energy far more efficiently. It means obtaining \nenergy from sources that are less vulnerable to terrorism or world \npolitics. Unfortunately, it appears that the American people will \ncontinue to wait for a meaningful energy policy that promotes national \nsecurity and reduces our dependency on foreign oil.\n  We faced an important vote today. I believe we made the right vote. \nWe have given ourselves more time to improve this bill, to develop \nlegislation that will meet our economic, our environmental, and our \nnational security needs, to serve the American people in a way which \nwill make them more secure and more prosperous. I hope we use this \nintervening time not simply to return to this legislation but to \nvigorously reform legislation so that we can present the American \npeople a bill that will serve their needs and not the needs of special \ninterests.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday was a national day of mourning \nin Italy. Tens of thousands of people lined a procession route and \ngathered at a basilica in Rome to pay their final respects to 19 \nItalian soldiers killed last week in a truck bombing in Nasiriyah, \nIraq. The soldiers' deaths mark Italy's worst military loss since World \nWar II.\n  The American people share Italy's sorrow over their enormous loss.\n  There is also a profound sense of sorrow today in South Dakota. Two \nof the 17 American soldiers killed last Saturday, when those 2 Army \nBlack Hawk helicopters collided in the sky over the northern Iraqi city \nof Mosul, were from our State.\n  South Dakota lost as many soldiers in that instant as we had lost in \nthe entire Iraq war so far.\n  Today, we mourn our lost sons: Army CWO Scott Saboe; and Army PFC \nSheldon Hawk Eagle.\n  We also mourn the 15 soldiers lost with them, the 405 other U.S. \nservicemembers who have given their lives, so far, in this war, and all \nof the sons and daughters of our allies who have been lost in this war.\n  CWO Scott Saboe was 33 years old, a career soldier with 14 years of \nmilitary service.\n  He leaves behind his wife, Franceska, and their 6-year-old son, \nJustin, who live in Alabama.\n  His father, Arlo Saboe, is a decorated Vietnam war veteran who lost \nhis wife and brother in the last 2 years. His sister, Amy remington, is \nstationed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center near Washington.\n  Willow Lake, where Scott Saboe grew up, is a small town. Only about \n300 people live there. On Sunday, more than half of them stopped by \nArlo Saboe's house to pay their condolences.\n  Before Iraq, Scott Saboe had flown helicopters over the demilitarized \nzone in Korea. As his father told a reporter for the Sioux Falls Argus \nLeader, ``He was willing to go anywhere.''\n  He reportedly was scheduled to return to the United States in 2 weeks \nfor training.\n  Today, at Willow Lake High School, where he played center on the \nfootball team, the flag has been lowered to half-staff.\n  Bill Stobbs, a former teacher and football coach who now is the \nschool's principal, told the Argus Leader:\n\n       He died doing what he loved, and he was a dedicated \n     soldier. That's all there is to it.\n\n  Darin Michalski, a childhood friend, said:\n\n       Most of us can go through our who lives and don't really \n     accomplish anything, and some of us only live to be 33, and \n     we're heroes.\n\n  PFC Sheldon Hawk Eagle was just 21.\n  He lived in Eagle Butte, on the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation, and \nwas an enrolled member of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe--one of about \n90 members of the tribe deployed to Iraq.\n  He was a descendant of the legendary Lakota warrior leader, Crazy \nHorse. His Lakota name was Wanbleoheteka, Brave Eagle.\n  Like Scott Saboe, Sheldon Hawk Eagle grew up in a family that viewed \nmilitary service as a citizen's duty. His grandfather, father and uncle \nall served.\n  Friends and family members describe him as a hard-working, quiet \nyoung man. One of his former teachers remembers his ``nice smile.''\n  His parents died when he was a young boy. He was raised by his aunt \nand uncle, Harvey and Fern Hawk Eagle.\n  His only surviving sibling, his sister, Frankie Allyn Hawk Eagle, \nlives in Grand Forks, ND. He enlisted in Grand Forks, in June 2002, to \nbe close to her.\n  He was deployed to Iraq in March and reportedly had hoped to be home \nthis coming February.\n  Emmanuel Red Bear, a spiritual leader who teaches Lakota language and \nculture at Eagle Butte High School, remembered Hawk Eagle to a reporter \nas an aggressive, but fair, football player who was a model of \nsportsmanship on and off the field.\n  Said Red Bear of Hawk Eagle:\n\n       He was a role model, in his quiet way. The younger kids \n     looked up to him. . . . He really was a modern-day warrior.\n\n  Tribal Chairman Harold Frazier said simply:\n\n\n[[Page S15361]]\n\n\n       He's our hero. He defended our country and protected our \n     freedom.\n\n  News of Scott Saboe's and Sheldon Hawk Eagle's deaths reached their \nhometowns on Sunday. Many people first heard the news first at church \nservices.\n  It had been some time since South Dakota had lost anyone in Iraq.\n  On May 9, CWO Hans Gookezen, of Lead, was killed when the Black Hawk \nhelicopter he was copiloting got caught in a power line and went down \nin the Tigris River.\n  On June 18, PFC Michael Dool of Nemo, was killed while on guard duty \nat a propane distribution center in Baghdad.\n  The crash of the two Black Hawks last Saturday was the deadliest \nsingle incident since the United States invaded Iraq. The military is \ninvestigating whether enemy ground fire have caused the crash.\n  All 17 of the victims were from the Army's 101st Airborne Division--\nthe famed ``Screaming Eagles''--the same unit that parachuted into \nNormandy on D-Day.\n  Like people in every state perhaps, South Dakotans sometimes focus on \nour superficial differences: East River versus West River, Native \nAmerican versus the sons and daughters of pioneers and immigrants. \nToday, we are one State, united in sadness over the deaths of our \nsoldiers, and pride over the noble lives they lived.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise for a few moments to speak to a once \nsilent, now highly visible epidemic that plagues every neighborhood in \nthis country. It is an epidemic that plagues our schools. It is an \nepidemic that plagues our school grounds. It is an epidemic that \nplagues youth in our playgrounds and it plagues older people in the \nworkplace. It is a plague that in many ways is a new problem--a problem \nthat is only really 15, 20, maybe 30 years old--but it is a problem and \na plague that is growing. It is one that specifically hurts children, \nand, indeed, once it attacks our children, it can destroy in many ways \ntheir future quality of life and their future life in terms of \nlongevity. This epidemic, this plague, is childhood obesity.\n  Just this summer, the Food and Drug Administration announced it will \nrequire food labels to list trans fatty acids. Most people do not know \nwhat trans fatty acids are; people do not know exactly what they do. \nBut they do things which make in many ways food taste better. They make \nfoods last longer. They give flavor to foods. They increase shelf life. \nThe problem is that these trans fats contribute to heart disease. Heart \ndisease is the No. 1 killer in the United States of America today.\n  For 20 years, before coming to the Senate, I spent my life in \nmedicine and ended up gravitating to this field of heart disease. It \nwasn't as big of a problem in the late 1970s or early 1980s, but it was \nthere. What bothers me most is that it is skyrocketing today, and it is \nincreasing faster among adolescents--children--than it is among anyone \nelse.\n  It is interesting. If my colleagues are listening to me, the \nlikelihood is one out of every two of you is going to die of heart \ndisease--not just my colleagues but on average around the country. That \nis how common heart disease is in terms of mortality.\n  Various food companies really deserve praise for their plans to \nreduce the level of trans fats in their most popular products. These \nare important advances in public health, and I applaud our food \nmanufacturers for stepping up and taking this leadership position.\n  Ultimately, however, the responsibility for this growing, \nskyrocketing epidemic rests with all of us--individual consumers, \nAmerican consumers--you and me--and all of us because ultimately we \nmake that decision for ourselves in terms of our shopping, in terms of \nhow we conduct our lifestyle, how much exercise we get, and what we \neat.\n  But the point is that we have an epidemic. It is hurting specifically \nchildren. Children are really condemned to a lower quality of life \nbecause of this epidemic. But the good news is that there is something \nwe can do about it; we can reverse these trends.\n  Sixty percent of Americans today are overweight. More than one out of \ntwo are overweight. By itself, obesity might be considered just another \nchoice we have in life, that we just choose, that is what we do, and, \nif it hurts us, that is just the way it goes. It is more than just \nanother choice. It really does come down to what we do, which may not \nbe a choice in part because there may be even a genetic component to \nit. We don't know for sure. But researchers in England believe they \nhave discovered a gene which they are calling an obesity gene that some \nway predisposes some to overeat. It is a choice in terms of lifestyle: \nPeople choose to take the metro or the subway rather than walk. We know \nour children in schools today are exercising a lot less. We know that \nour kids today are spending a lot more time in front of the television \nor at the computer and are less likely to be exercising.\n\n  Whether by choice or by some combination of genes and environment, we \nknow obesity is now a major public health threat in the United States \nof America. Obesity contributes directly to heart disease but also to \ndiabetes. Diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions in our children \ntoday. It directly contributes to other illnesses, including cancer and \nstroke.\n  There are 300,000 deaths a year that can be directly attributed to \nfat. The epidemic is spreading in faster and faster proportions with \nour children. The percentage of kids age 6 to 19 who are overweight has \nquadrupled since the early 1960s. It is not a static problem; it is \ngetting worse.\n  Pick any city in the country. Look at New York City's public school \nchildren, nearly half are overweight; one in four is obese. The problem \nis particularly acute among African-American and Hispanic children, \nespecially Hispanic boys. More Hispanic boys than Hispanic girls are \nobese. In my own State of Tennessee, the statistics are even worse.\n  Nationwide, type 2 diabetes, the kind of diabetes that is associated \nwith obesity, is skyrocketing. At the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, estimates are that one in three Americans born in the year \n2000 will develop diabetes in their lifetime. One in three Americans \nborn today will develop diabetes in their lifetime. This is attributed \nto obesity. It is attributed to being overweight. Among African-\nAmerican and Hispanic children that number is not just one in three \nAmericans, but it is one in two Americans in those populations that \nwill develop diabetes in their lifetime.\n  People say diabetes is bad and that should be reversed. But it is \neven worse than saying it is just diabetes because diabetes itself is \nthe leading cause of kidney failure, which is renal failure. Diabetes \nis the leading cause of heart disease. Diabetes is a leading cause of \nblindness as well as amputations. It all starts as a child, who, in \nthis growing epidemic, is led to be obese.\n  As adults, we know how hard it is to battle the fat or the battle of \nthe bulge. We all struggle with that in our environment of fast food \nand transportation. It is very easy to find excuses not to exercise \nfour times a week for 30 minutes. But imagine struggling with obesity \nwhen you are just 10 years of age, where this is reaching those \nepidemic proportions. Teachers say they see the physical toll on their \nstudents every day. Kids are out of breath walking up the school \nstairs. Kids are not able to participate fully in sports. Kids are not \nable to participate when they do field trips and go outside, activities \nwe associate with playing and vigorous childhood activity. Kick-ball, \njumping rope, and climbing trees for many children today, unlike in the \npast, have become grueling exercises that, indeed, they try to avoid. \nThey say they will not participate because they are embarrassed to \nparticipate.\n  Mr. President, 25 percent of our Nation's children say they do not \nparticipate in any vigorous activity today. That is one out of four \nchildren. Obesity is not only robbing them of those\n\n[[Page S15362]]\n\neveryday pastimes, it is also robbing them of their childhood years. \nObesity is associated with the early onset of puberty among girls.\n\n  According to a study from the University of North Carolina, 48 \npercent of African-American girls begin puberty by age 8; over a \nquarter by age 7.\n  Yes, we are in the midst of a national health crisis. It is harming \nour children in ways that we can observe, but the crisis also occurs in \nways we cannot observe. It threatens their future. It also condemns \ntheir future in many ways to the lower threshold of having other adult \ndiseases if they start as a child being obese. They carry that with \nthem for the rest of their life.\n  It affects what we call their morbidity, the relationship to other \ndisease patterns. It affects their longevity in terms of length of \nlife.\n  There is a lot we can do. We cannot just talk about it. The Surgeon \nGeneral, Dr. Richard Carmona--for whom I have tremendous respect--is so \nalarmed, this month he urged the American Academy of Pediatrics to step \nup the fight against childhood obesity. In the Washington Post \nyesterday, Rob Stein wrote an article ``Obesity on FDA's Plate'' and he \npointed out the Food and Drug Administration has launched an initiative \nto determine how and in what way it can play a role in helping to fight \nobesity, which, as the article points out, has reached epidemic \nproportions in this country.\n  In that article from yesterday, FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan--\nagain, a physician for whom I have great respect and with whom I have \nworked in many capacities before; he is doing a great job at the FDA--\nsaid:\n\n       The issue of obesity challenges us in every aspect of our \n     efforts to protect and advance the public health, and that is \n     why it needs to be front and center of our public health \n     agenda.\n\n  The good news to all this is that there is action in government that \nobesity is both treatable and preventable, which means there are things \nwe can do to reverse the epidemic. We can reverse the trends. We must \nreverse the trends. It is now time to put our minds to it in this body.\n  I am gratified by the action of the HELP Committee which unanimously \napproved recently the IMPACT Act, the Improved Nutrition and Physical \nActivity Act. I urge my colleagues to look at this piece of \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I hope \nwe can bring it to the Senate floor in the near future.\n  Very briefly, this act takes a multifaceted approach. It emphasizes \nyouth education to jump-start healthy habits. We know if they begin in \ntheir early years, they are carried through life. It funds \ndemonstration projects to find innovative ways to improve health, \neating, and exercise and includes vigorous evaluations so we can learn \nwhat works best in reversing this epidemic. It does not attempt in any \nway to control what individual Americans eat or drink. It does not \noutlaw so-called bad foods. It does not try to replicate the $1 billion \ndiet industry that we know exists. It does not try to replicate the \nfitness industry, which is actually doing a wonderful job around the \ncountry.\n  It does have a modest pricetag reflecting on the appropriate role of \nthe Federal Government to set this platform to combat this epidemic.\n  There is no single solution to the growing epidemic of obesity. I \nbelieve we must increase awareness of it first and then implement \nprograms we know will have an impact; look at the medical consequences. \nThat is why I come to the Senate floor to share the medical \nconsequences that are totally avoidable if we act, if we educate, and \nif we adopt practices that we know will work.\n  We do know the consequences of obesity today. We can and should keep \nour kids safe by keeping them fit. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this very important issue. It is a new problem, a growing \nproblem, a problem we are obliged to reverse.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish I listened to the speech before I had \nlunch.\n  On a serious note, Senator Durbin is here and he will start talking \nabout the Medicare bill that will soon be taken up in the Senate. I \nthink the leader would agree that people should come now and start \ntalking about this most important piece of legislation.\n\n  Senator Durbin is in the Chamber to talk about it. I think we should \ninvite all Senators because the time later could be a little more \nconstrictive.\n  I also say, on a serious note, about the speech the distinguished \nmajority leader just gave, one of the reasons the leader has such high \nrespect on both sides of the aisle is we know of his background. It is \nnot often we have someone of his medical talents come to this body. In \nfact, no one has ever had the same background. He uses it in such a \ndignified way, in his charitable work when we are on break, doing \nthings for the less fortunate in Africa and other places. And here, it \nis always good for us to know that when we do deal with health issues, \nhe is here.\n  So I speak for the entire Senate when I say this presentation he just \ndelivered on obesity is something we should all pay attention to \nbecause I know this is not a speech that someone prepared for him; this \nis something he spoke to with his knowledge as one the finest \nphysicians in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments, through the \nChair, from the assistant Democratic leader. One of the great things \nabout these issues is we do have the opportunity here to work together \non both sides of the aisle on issues which affect people broadly. I \nvery much appreciate his comments in that regard.\n  I do also add the point, and reinforce the statement the Senator \nmade, that over the course of the afternoon we would like to shortly--\nand, hopefully, a little bit after 2 or after the appropriate comments \nare made on Medicare--go to Healthy Forests. We are waiting on some \nfinal agreements, but hopefully we can address that today.\n  But what I really want to say is, this is exactly the way to handle \nit. I encourage people right now to come and make their statements and \nmake their points and have the debate on Medicare. The bill is out. The \nbill has been filed. People have access to that bill. I think everybody \nshould take that opportunity, this afternoon, through tomorrow, and \nthrough the weekend, to come to the floor to begin talking about that \nvery important issue.\n  We want to make the very best use of time today, tomorrow, and \nSunday, in all likelihood, and Monday, on that issue as well as others. \nIt may be confusing to people. We will be going back and forth because \nwe have a lot of business to do. So we will be on Medicare, and then we \nwill take up Healthy Forests, and then I encourage people to come back \nand begin Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I join my friend and colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, in saying \nto Senator Frist, thank you for your leadership. We disagree on issues \nfrom time to time, but we agree on some, too. You have been an \nexceptionally good leader on the Republican side. I have said this to \nyou privately, and I want to make it a matter of public record: I think \nyou have been eminently fair to the minority in this Senate. And that \nis, I am sure, not an easy task. There are certainly forces at work in \nyour party, as there are in our party, calling for a different outcome.\n  But I applaud you for your fairness in allowing the minority on this \nside of the aisle an opportunity to debate, offer amendments, to \nexpress our points of view, and bring an issue to a vote. I do not \nthink a member of any legislature--national or State--could ask for \nanything more. I think you have worked long and hard to make that a \nhallmark of your leadership.\n  As a member of the minority, let me say to the Republican leader, \nthank you for your service to this institution. You have been a great \nasset to our Nation and to this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15362-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15362-S15368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MEDICARE AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR SENIORS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me, if I may, address another issue \nwhich is about to come before us. If you follow boxing and have watched \nany big championship fights, you may know that it comes at the end of \nthe evening. During the course of the day and afternoon and the early \nevening hours, there are preliminary fights, and they are interesting, \nbut they are young\n\n[[Page S15363]]\n\nboxers who are untested. But the excitement builds and the attention of \nthe audience builds for the prize fight, the heavyweight championship \nfight, always the last thing on the card.\n  Much the same occurs in Washington, DC. We have a lot of preliminary \nfights that lead up to the championship. You are here witnessing on the \nfloor of the Senate today, and in the closing days of this session, the \nheavyweight fights.\n  We just finished one. That was the Energy bill. This was a \ncontroversial issue of some 1,400 pages that had been debated for \nyears. It came to the Senate floor and just a short time ago was \nbasically stopped. A filibuster prevailed by a bipartisan rollcall \nwith, I believe, six Republican Senators and a number of Democratic \nSenators. The Energy bill was stopped. It was a heavyweight fight \nbecause those supporting the bill include the biggest energy interests \nin America, the big oil companies.\n  Certainly the President and the Vice President and the Republican \nParty, which controls the House and the Senate, were, by and large, \nanxious to pass this bill, and we had a confrontation on the floor and \nmy position prevailed on that. It came as somewhat of a shock to people \nwho follow this Senate. It is not very often that the favored side in \none of these debates loses. And just a short time ago they did, by two \nvotes. They needed 60 votes to stop the debate and move the issue to a \nvote, and the motion to stop that debate did not prevail; it only \nreceived 58 votes.\n\n  Well, the windows are open now, and there is anxious negotiation and \na lot of effort underway to try to find two more votes. And I would \nimagine, in the closing days of the session, we may see this issue \nsurface again. I could express myself in saying I hope it does not, but \nit makes no difference what I hope. I am in the minority here, and the \nmajority will decide whether they have the votes to bring it to \nclosure.\n  That is one of the heavyweight fights. But there are two more coming, \ntwo more that will affect virtually every family in America.\n  One is an omnibus appropriations bill, with five major appropriations \nbills lumped into one, that is now in conference, a conference on which \nI serve; and debate is underway. The debate is behind closed doors, and \nI, frankly, do not know what is happening there. But before we can \nleave, we need to pass that bill. It could include a myriad of issues, \nissues as far-flung as stem cell research in medicine, issues as \ndiverse as education, transportation. All of these issues could come \nbefore us in that large bill. That is another heavyweight fight.\n  But the one I come to address today is one that has received a lot of \nattention across America for a long time, and it is likely to receive \neven more attention in the closing days of the session, both in the \nHouse and in the Senate.\n  The issue is the issue of prescription drugs, particularly for \nseniors. I do not know of a single Member of the Senate who has not \nexpressed support for finding some way to help seniors pay for \nprescription drugs.\n  We all know what has happened here. We have more and more and better \nand better prescription drugs available across America, and a lot of \npeople have learned--in my family and yours, too--that if you take the \nappropriate medication, with the advice of a good physician, your life \ncan be healthier and you can be stronger and more independent.\n  So people try to find the right drugs to keep them healthy and to \nmove along with the happiness of life, trying to avoid going in for \nhospitalization or surgery. Prescription drugs are an important part of \nthat.\n  But, sadly, prescription drugs for seniors in America are not covered \nby Medicare. So unless you are in a hospital receiving those drugs, you \nhave to pay for them. For a lot of seniors, it is too expensive. There \nare people living on fixed incomes under Social Security or relatively \nsmall pensions. They have a few assets left on Earth, maybe a home they \nsaved up for all their lives and a car, and they are trying to figure \nout how to pay several hundred dollars per month for prescription drugs \nthey need, and they can't afford it. So, many do not take the drugs, \nsome take half of what they need, and many find themselves in a \nterrible, perilous personal position.\n  We have come forward and said: We should change Medicare. If Medicare \ncovers your illness when you go into a hospital, why wouldn't Medicare \ncover the drug that would keep you from going into the hospital? That \nmakes eminent sense not just from a human point of view but from an \neconomic point of view. It is money well spent to keep people healthy \nand to pay for prescription drugs.\n  So we had this debate, and it went on for years, and we talked about \nhow to do it, and we did not get much done. But we did finally pass a \nbill out of the Senate, a bill which I supported. It was not the \ngreatest bill. In fact, there were some aspects of it I thought were \npretty bad.\n  Then it went into a conference between the House and the Senate, and \nthey started working out differences. Then something unusual occurred. \nSomeone in the House of Representatives decided that this debate was \nnot about prescription drug benefits for seniors; no; they said this \ndebate is really about the future of Medicare, the whole program.\n  It isn't about adding a benefit for seniors to pay for prescription \ndrugs but how we are going to change Medicare in the future. Republican \nleaders in the House said the best way to change Medicare is to change \nit as a government insurance program and instead let private insurance \ncompanies, HMOs, offer Medicare coverage in the future.\n  My experience as a Senator from Illinois and as a Congressman is that \nHMOs can break your heart. They cost a lot of money. They deny care, \nthey limit your choice in terms of doctors and hospitals, and, frankly, \nwhen the going gets rough and they are not making enough money, they \ncut and run. Is that what we want to hold out as the future of \nMedicare? I don't think so. But a lot of people do.\n  The Republican majority in the House certainly believes that, and \nthat is what they have pushed now in this so-called prescription drug \nbill. It is no longer a bill about just paying for the prescriptions. \nIt is now a bill about changing the face and future of Medicare. That, \nto me, makes a substantial difference in our mission and what we need \nto do.\n  The bill, as it is currently written, is not a bill which I can \nsupport. I guess the biggest disappointment I have is the fact that we \nstarted off with such a valid goal and such a lofty purpose. We were \ngoing to help our mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers \npay for their prescription drugs. Now we have gone far afield. There \nare many who want to change Medicare.\n  Let me ask you: If you stepped back in the course of legislation and \nwanted to determine whether or not it was good for consumers and \nfamilies in America, isn't it fair to say that one of the first \nquestions you would ask is: Where does the money go? Who ends up \nprofiting from this bill, and who ends up losing as a result?\n  Clearly, you want to turn first to the pharmaceutical industry, the \npeople who sell drugs in America. I will readily concede this is one of \nthe most important industries in America. We lead the world in \nbreakthrough drugs and pharmaceuticals. I want to make certain that \nthese drug companies in my State and others are profitable; that with \ntheir profits they can fund research to find new drugs. I want to make \ncertain that those drugs are available to Americans. That is something \non which everybody agrees. But sadly, what we find in this bill is that \nthe pharmaceutical industry is cheering the loudest for the bill to pay \nfor prescription drugs. That leads us to ask some serious and important \nquestions.\n  First, let me show you how profitable drug companies are in America \ntoday. Take a look at the profitability of Fortune 500 drug companies \nversus the profitability for all Fortune 500 companies in the year \n2002. The red bars indicate the profitability of the drug companies, \nthe drug industry median, and the yellow bar is all other Fortune 500 \ncompanies. You can see profits as a percent of revenue in the first \nillustration, 17-percent profit for the drug industry; 3.1 percent for \nthe rest of the Fortune 500 companies. You can see profits as a percent \nof assets, 14 percent. Then when it comes to profits as a percent of \nequity, 27.6 percent for the\n\n[[Page S15364]]\n\npharmaceutical companies; 10.2 percent for the rest of the Fortune 500. \nSo it is very clear that we are talking about a profitable industry.\n  Here is another illustration of the same point. This is an indication \nfrom Fortune magazine of the most profitable industries in America, \nwith 2002 profits as a percentage of revenues. No. 1 on the list is \npharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies are extremely \nprofitable in America today. We understand that. We ought to keep it in \nmind as we discuss how we are going to pay for prescription drugs for \nseniors.\n\n  Then I would like to show you what some of the people who are the \nCEOs of managed care companies earn. Here we have a chart that shows \nthe chairman of Aetna, John Rowe, his compensation, exclusive of stock \noptions, $8.9 million; Anthem, Larry Glasscock, president and CEO, $6.8 \nmillion; CIGNA, Edward Hanway, chairman and CEO, $5.9 million--this is \nexclusive of stock options which are usually considerably more--\nCoventry, Allen Wise, president and CEO, $21.6 million annual \ncompensation; Health Net, senior vice president, $6 million; Humana, \npresident and CEO, $1.6 million--that is pretty small in comparison--\nthen Oxford, Norman Payson, former chairman and CEO, made $76 million; \nPacifiCare--you may have seen the ads that show the whale flopping in \nthe water--Mr. Howard Phanstiel is not a flop when it comes to his \nsalary, $3 million; Sierra Health, Dr. Marlon, chairman and CEO, $4.7 \nmillion; UnitedHealth, Channing Wheeler, chairman and CEO, $9.5 \nmillion; WellPoint, Leonard Schaeffer, chairman and CEO, $21.7 million.\n  The total compensation for these 11 executives at these managed care \ncompanies is $166.3 million. Their average compensation, $15 million.\n  We are struggling to figure out how people who make $200 or $300 or \nmaybe $500 a month can survive. And we are dealing with two industries \nthat are extremely profitable. The obvious question we should ask is: \nWhat is fair? What is fair compensation to the pharmaceutical companies \nand managed care companies, but what is fair to the seniors in America? \nTherein lies the problem.\n  This morning's Washington Post, on page A4 in the first section, I \nthink, is written an article that every Senator should read, and those \nwho follow this debate on prescription drugs.\n  It is entitled ``Drugmakers Protect Their Turf.'' It says: ``Medicare \nBill Represents Success for Pharmaceutical Lobby.'' Let me read a \nlittle bit from this article:\n\n       No industry in negotiations over the $400 billion Medicare \n     prescription drug bill headed to the House floor today \n     outpaced the pharmaceutical lobby in securing a favorable \n     program design and defeating proposals most likely to cut \n     into its profits, according to analysts in and out of the \n     industry.\n       If the legislation passes as Republican leaders predict, it \n     will generate millions of new customers who currently lack \n     drug coverage. At the same time, drug manufacturing lobbyists \n     overcame efforts to legalize the importation of lower-cost \n     medicines from Canada and Europe and instead inserted \n     language that explicitly prohibits the federal government \n     from negotiating prices on behalf of Medicare recipients.\n\n  The pharmaceutical lobby has become the biggest player in Washington, \nDC. When I got here, it was the tobacco lobby. I know it because I \nfought them--beat them a couple times, too--over the course of my \ncareer. They had more money than friends, and they went out to buy a \nfew friends, and they did.\n  Listen to what the pharmaceutical companies have done:\n\n       After objecting for years to proposals to add prescription \ndrug coverage to Medicare, the pharmaceutical lobby recently shifted \nposition and poured enormous resources into shaping this legislation. \nSince the 2000 election cycle, the pharmaceutical industry has \ncontributed $60 million in political donations and spent $37.7 million \nin lobbying in the first 6 months of this year.\n\n  Thirty-seven million dollars on Capitol Hill? You will meet these \nfine men and women in their beautiful suits and well-shined shoes in \nthe lobbies right outside this Chamber. The article goes on to say:\n\n       The lobbying continued in earnest this week with a \n     television and print advertising campaign urging passage of \n     this bill. In one series of witty commercials sponsored by \n     the industry-backed Alliance to Improve Medicare, elderly \n     citizens look into the camera and demand: ``When ya gonna get \n     it done?''\n\n  I think I may have a copy of that ad somewhere around here. You have \nseen it. The fellow is pointing to Congress saying, ``When ya gonna get \nit done.'' That is paid for by the pharmaceutical companies. So if we \nare talking about helping seniors pay for prescription drugs and the \npharmaceutical companies can't wait to see this legislation passed, \nwhat does that tell you? It tells you they are not going to have to cut \ntheir prices. It tells you they are going to make more money. It tells \nyou that ultimately we are not producing a bill which helps consumers \nand families and senior Americans. We are creating a profit opportunity \nfor pharmaceutical companies that already lead the Nation in \nprofitability.\n  The pharmaceutical lobby is so strong in this town that they have \nbeen able to deceive the American people into believing that this \nprescription drug package is somehow going to cause some sacrifice on \nthe part of pharmaceutical companies. It will not.\n  They are the big winners in this, just as the big oil companies and \nenergy companies would have been the big winners in the last bill. This \nis the heavyweight fight, the match you can expect to see in the \nclosing hours of this session.\n  Let me tell you, in closing, what the Washington Post says this \nmorning:\n\n       Perhaps the most striking political victory for the \n     pharmaceutical industry was the decision to reject provisions \n     that would have allowed Americans to legally import drugs \n     from Canada and Europe, where medications retail for as much \n     as 75 percent less than in the United States. Polls show that \n     an overwhelming majority of Americans support that change, \n     and the House approved a measure 243-186. But the Bush \n     administration and the pharmaceutical lobby said the move was \n     dangerous and would cut into future research and development. \n     The provision was dropped from the bill's final version.\n\n  So why would people want to import drugs? I think we know the answer. \nThey are cheaper. The same drug made in the United States by an \nAmerican company, based on research paid for by the Federal Government \nmany times--that same drug for sale in Canada is a fraction of the \nprice. Why? Why is it cheaper in Canada or in Europe, if it comes from \nthe same American drug company? Because we are not importing drugs from \nCanada or Europe; we are importing leadership.\n  The Canadian Government, and governments around the world, have \ndecided to stand up to the pharmaceutical companies and tell them there \nis a limit to how much money they can charge for their drugs. Our \nGovernment is unwilling to do that. This bill will not do that. \nInstead, what seniors have been forced to do--and families, I might \nadd--is to pay high pharmaceutical drug bills, and some are going to \nCanada trying to keep up with the costs. This bill closes that border \nfor the reimportation of drugs from Canada--meaning that America's \nsenior citizens will continue paying the highest drug prices in the \nworld.\n  This is all in the name of a prescription drug benefit for those \nseniors. So it is natural that pharmaceutical companies are spending \nmillions of dollars trying to urge Congress to pass this bill as \nquickly as possible. The ads that they run--some are directly from \ntheir own front organizations, but others come through organizations \nsuch as AARP. I know about AARP because once you reach age 50 in \nAmerica, they start filling your mailbox with solicitations for \nmembership. I have been rejecting those for many years. I don't plan on \nbeing a retired person soon. However, the voters will have the last \nword on that decision.\n  Here is their full-page ad calling for Congress to pass the proposed \nprescription drug Medicare bill. Honestly, I think if you looked under \nthe lid, you would find that AARP money to pay for this ad comes \nthrough the pharmaceutical companies that cannot wait to see this bill \npassed. It means more money for them. They want to cut off the sources \nof drugs coming in from Canada and Europe so they can really charge \nseniors the highest prices in America.\n  Let me give you an illustration of what competition can mean when it \ncomes to drug prices. If you said to people: Do you want price controls \nfrom the Federal Government, they would say: No, no, no, that is too \nmuch Government.\n\n[[Page S15365]]\n\n  But if you say: Would you want your Government to bargain for the \nbest prices for people who need prescription drugs, most people would \nsay: Why, sure. And why wouldn't they? You could say to them: Do you \nrealize we do that now?\n\n  The Veterans Administration does that today; it bargains with drug \ncompanies so veterans get cheaper drugs, and the Veterans \nAdministration pays less. The Indian Health Service does it, and some \ncommunity health centers do it. States also do it through the Medicaid \nprograms. They bargain with them successfully. A lot of people are not \ncovered in those groups--veterans health care, Indian Health Service, \nor Medicaid. They are left totally unprotected, with no bargaining \npower.\n  Look at this chart. These are some fairly common drugs. Xalatan is an \neyedrop. If you buy this at the Federal supply schedule price, it is \n$41 for the prescription. If you go to the drugstore to buy it, it is \n$101. So we manage, through the Federal Government, to bargain with the \ndrug companies and bring prices down for some people.\n  Celebrex, for arthritis, is $108 on the Federal Supply Schedule. That \nis what we pay because we bargain down the price. If your grandmother \ngoes into the drugstore to have that filled, she will pay $173--$65 \nmore.\n  Lipitor, a very valuable and important drug, is $215, based on what \nwe have negotiated and bargained. If you pay the full price at the \ndrugstore, which many American seniors do, it is $446.\n  Plavix, for stroke, is $257. It is $593 at the drugstore.\n  The point I am making is this: This bill is designed so that the \nFederal Government is prohibited from bargaining and negotiating for \nlower prices for seniors across America. That is why the pharmaceutical \ncompanies are so wild to pass it. That is why they want to see this \nenacted as soon as possible. It closes down competition. You can no \nlonger go over the border to buy drugs in Canada or Europe, and you \ncannot find the Federal Government standing up for you and bargaining \nfor seniors to bring down costs.\n  That is why the pharmaceutical companies are salivating. They cannot \nwait. They want to see this thing passed because, frankly, it means \nless competition. So who pays the highest prices for prescription drugs \nin America today? The people who can afford it the least--senior \ncitizens on fixed incomes.\n  Even with the prescription drug benefit in this bill, there is no \ncost containment, no effort to keep the prices under control. So no \nmatter how much money you put into this prescription drug benefit, it \nis going to go bankrupt because prescription drugs go up in cost 10 to \n15 percent a year, and they will continue to. That inflation is going \nto destroy this program, and it is going to destroy seniors, because \nthis Congress and this President refuse to confront the pharmaceutical \ncompanies.\n  In Canada, their government stands up for their people and says to \nAmerican drug companies: We are not going to let you gouge or take \nadvantage of our people when it comes to prescription drugs. Our \nGovernment refuses to do that. As a result, we find ourselves in this \npredicament. AARP and others are pleading for a prescription drug \nbenefit that, frankly, has no cost containment built into it.\n  I came to the floor during this debate and urged colleagues to give \nto the Medicare Program the ability to bargain, which is what we give \nto the Veterans Administration and other Federal agencies, to let \nMedicare go to the drug companies and bargain for the best price for \nMedicare recipients across America. I was summarily defeated. The \npharmaceutical lobby prevailed. I think that answered the basic \nquestion as to whether this bill truly will lead to lower drug prices \nacross America. It will not. It will help some seniors pay for drugs, \nbut the cost of drug prices will continue to skyrocket, and the \ncompetition from Canada and Europe will disappear. It specifically \nprohibits the Federal Government from negotiating on behalf of Medicare \nrecipients.\n\n  This bill rewards pharmaceutical companies and HMOs--insurance \ncompanies. The pharmaceutical companies are going to gain, the Medicare \npurchasing pool is divided to prevent large group purchasing discounts, \nand the House language on reimportation was rejected.\n  There is another element. One of the ways to cut the cost of drugs is \nto encourage the use of generics. Once a drug has been discovered, it \nis the exclusive right of the drug company to sell it under a patent. \nDuring that period of time, nobody else can make that drug and sell it. \nWhen the patent expires, everybody can make the same drug and they do \nit under a generic name.\n  You may remember Claritin, with all the ads on television that showed \nthe happy faces skipping through the field of wildflowers saying, ``I \ndon't sneeze anymore.'' It went off patent and it is now available over \nthe counter. So they came in with Clarinex--I think that is the name.\n  So once you see the generic drugs come in, the prices go down for \nconsumers, and they get the benefit of what was a pretty expensive drug \nfor a long time.\n  We tried in the Senate to make sure there were more generic drugs for \nsale because it is a good way to keep everybody healthy at a lower \ncost. It turns out that the pharmaceutical companies didn't care for \nthat at all. They want people to pay for the more expensive drugs under \npatent. So they ended up weakening the language we had, which would \nhave allowed generics to come to the market more quickly so seniors \ncould take advantage of it. Also, this would weaken the ability of \nStates to negotiate with drug manufacturers.\n  Some States are way ahead of the Federal Government. Oregon is one, \nand my State of Illinois has a plan. The ability of each State to \nbargain for the people living in that State is also restricted by this \nbill because all drugs are paid for through Medicare--something else \nthe pharmaceutical companies wanted. They don't want to have to bargain \nwith anybody. They want to charge top dollar. They don't want any voice \nfrom consumers or Government to reduce their profitability, which is \nalready at record-breaking levels. They have been successful. They \ncannot wait for this bill to pass because they are already profitable, \nand this bill will enhance their profits even more.\n  Under this bill, seniors will receive a benefit that will cover less \nthan 20 percent of the projected drug costs for seniors over the next \n10 years.\n  A break-even point of $810 is what you have to put in, in payments \nand copayments, before you get anything back, which means about 40 \npercent of seniors will either lose money or gain very little under \nthis prescription drug plan.\n  There is also a hole in this plan. It is complicated, but I will try \nto explain it, and it has been changing, even this week.\n  The coverage on this plan, once you make your monthly premium cost \nand once you pay your copayment--and then understand that you have to \npay 25 percent of the cost of the drug itself--the coverage goes up to \na certain point and then it stops. If you are still paying for drugs at \nthat point, you have to go to your pocket to pay out. Then when you \nreach the higher level, it kicks back in again. So there is a period \nwhere you are, frankly, not covered.\n  If you have expensive pharmaceutical costs, you buy into the program, \nyou make your copayment, and you are paying a percentage for each \nprescription you take, at a certain level the Federal help stops. Then \nif you keep paying out of pocket without Federal assistance, it kicks \nin again for catastrophic coverage. Let me try to describe where it is \ntoday.\n  The reports in the news have been, frankly, misleading. They have \nbeen reporting the catastrophic cap in the Medicare prescription drug \nbill is $3,600. It is not true. It is $5,100. So the gap between $2,250 \nand $5,100 is $2,850, the total out-of-pocket expenses for which \nseniors will be responsible is $3,600.\n  We have a situation where at $2,250 worth of costs, the seniors are \non their own. It turns out, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, 30 percent of seniors spend between $2,000 and $5,000 per year \non prescriptions. That is 12.6 million people. It basically means even \nthough prescription drug coverage and this complicated scheme I just \ndescribed has been offered, there is an exposure where seniors will \nhave to pay\n\n[[Page S15366]]\n\nout of pocket, which will be a surprise to many of them, particularly \nwhen they are facing astronomical costs.\n  I had some examples made to give you some idea of what seniors might \nface in my State and others. One involves Mrs. Jones who has arthritis \nand takes Celebrex, which costs about $86 a month. Her husband has high \nblood pressure and takes Norvasc, which costs $152 per month. Under \nthis plan, Mrs. Jones would pay at least $865. If her premium is more \nthan $35 a month, she would pay more. There is no set premium in this \nbill. Mr. Jones will pay at least $1,064, for a combined cost of \n$1,929. This benefit will only cover a third of the drug costs of Mr. \nand Mrs. Jones.\n  There are other elements we ought to look at here. If you want to get \nthe most help from this bill, you have to be in the lowest income \ncategories. That is fair. I think that is the right thing to do. The \npeople struggling to get by should get the first helping hand from our \nGovernment. They decide they are going to look at certain income levels \nas to whether or not you benefit from this prescription drug. Then they \nhave an asset test which, as I understand it, is $6,000. That means if \nyou have assets of $6,000 or more, you don't get the most help.\n  Some of these seniors, I know, have the old family car that may still \nbe worth $6,000, and they would be disqualified when, frankly, they \nhave almost no income and very few other assets on Earth.\n\n  The asset test is extremely low. Six million poor seniors will be \nmade worse off by this bill. They previously paid nothing for drugs. \nThey will now have to pay copays that increase annually.\n  Three million fewer low-income senior citizens will receive enhanced \nbenefits than under the original Senate bill because of the strict \nassets test. Let me give an example.\n  If a senior has an income of $12,000 a year but owns a $6,100 savings \nbond, burial plot, insurance policy, or car worth $6,000 or more, they \nwill not have access to low-income assistance. They will have to pay \nthe full premium, deductible and donut, or the period where the Federal \nprogram does not apply.\n  That means if they have high drug costs, they could pay more than \n$5,000 a year for their medications simply because they own a burial \nplot and an insurance policy. That is what the bill says. That, \nfrankly, is something about which we ought to be concerned.\n  We have to understand that when it comes to this prescription drug \nsituation, most seniors are going to be stunned by it. I might add \nsomething else that is interesting. The decision was made by the \nAdministration and the Republican leaders in Congress that this \nprescription drug plan would not go into effect until after the next \nelection, a very interesting political move.\n  If this is really supposed to help seniors across America, wouldn't \nyou think this President and this Congress would want to put it in \nplace and activate it before the election?\n  The reason they won't is because it is extraordinarily complicated, \nit is unfair to many seniors, and it includes provisions that, frankly, \nseniors won't be happy with at all. So they want to put it off until \nafter the next election, and that is what they have done.\n  One of the other concerns I have is the role of AARP in this whole \nconversation. AARP is an interesting organization. Most of us over the \nage of 50 receive a lot of solicitations. A lot of seniors 50 and older \nacross America have joined. If you look at AARP, it is more than a \nfeel-good operation to try to help seniors pay for trips overseas and \nmaybe give them a few discounts.\n  It turns out it is a major earner of insurance money. Here is a chart \nwhich shows the insurance royalties at AARP over the last several \nyears--insurance royalties which, frankly, indicate $111 million in \n1999 up to $123 million in 2002. The same thing goes for the \ninvestments they have made. We can see that AARP makes a lot of money \nfrom the insurance business.\n  One of the companies they sell insurance with is UnitedHealth Group. \nIt turns out, coincidentally, that UnitedHealth Group could be one of \nthe biggest beneficiaries of the bill that is going to come before us. \nSo AARP comes to this debate not with clean hands.\n  AARP is fronting for an insurance company that has the potential for \ndramatic profitability from this bill. So when AARP announces they are \nfor this bill, they ought to be very honest with the seniors about what \nthat means.\n  AARP receives millions of dollars from the sale of health insurance \npolicies. AARP's insurance-related revenues made up a quarter of their \noperating revenues last year and one-third of their operating revenue \nin 2001.\n\n  They receive royalties from AARP insurance policies marketed to their \nmembers by UnitedHealth Group, MetLife, and others.\n  More than 3 million AARP members have health-related insurance \npolicies from UnitedHealth Group. Last year, UnitedHealth Group earned \n$3.7 billion in premium revenues from their offerings to AARP members.\n  The royalties AARP earned as a result of lending their name to \ninsurance products, as I mentioned, went up to $123 million in 2002. \nThey received so-called access fees from insurance companies of over \n$10 million. They received something called a quality control fee of \nalmost $1 million from insurers.\n  AARP also earns investment income on premiums received for members \nuntil the premiums are forwarded to UnitedHealth Group and MetLife. In \n2002, AARP earned $26.7 million in such investment income.\n  There is a total of $161.7 million in revenue from insurance just in \n2002.\n  According to Advertising Age magazine, AARP and UnitedHealth Group \nhired a direct marketing agency in May to conduct a marketing campaign \nfor their insurance product that could cost $100 million.\n  UnitedHealth Group stands to gain significant portions of the new \nMedicare Advantage market that would be created by this bill, given \nthat it is currently participating in a Medicare PPO demonstration \nproject in eight States.\n  AARP can make a lucrative business even more lucrative by continuing \nits partnership with UnitedHealth Group. Let's take a look at AARP's \nadvertising.\n  Last year, AARP earned $76 million on advertising. Their magazine, \nformerly called Modern Maturity, and now called AARP, The Magazine, has \nthe largest circulation of any magazine in the United States, going to \n21.5 million households.\n  The latest issue has three full-page ads for brand-name drugs, and \nanother for a Pfizer glaucoma kit. It contains four ads for AARP's \nvarious kinds of insurance.\n  Combine that with the four ads for insurance in the November AARP \nBulletin, and that is a lot of insurance advertising. The September/\nOctober AARP magazine and the October bulletin have a combined 14 ads \nfor insurance.\n  There is a direct linkage between AARP and the insurance industry and \nanother industry that stands to profit from this so-called Medicare \nprescription drug bill. It is interesting, too, that when the members \nof AARP were recently asked in a nationwide poll what they thought of \nthis prescription drug bill that is pending before Congress, the \nresults were amazing. A poll that was released 2 days ago showed that \n66 percent of AARP members were somewhat or very unfavorable to the \nlevel of prescription drug coverage which I have just described in this \nbill. Eighty percent of AARP members do not believe this bill does \nenough to encourage employers to maintain current retiree coverage. \nSixty-eight percent of AARP's membership were somewhat or very \nunfavorable to the following statement: This provision is designed to \nincrease the number of seniors receiving their Medicare coverage \nthrough private health plans like HMOs and PPOs by significantly \nincreasing Government subsidies for these plans.\n  So I would just ask this: If AARP is spending all of this money on \nbehalf of their membership to promote a proposal which two-thirds or \nmore of the members of AARP at this point oppose, what is driving this? \nI think it goes back to the earlier explanation. AARP is not acting as \nan advocate for seniors. AARP is acting like an insurance company. AARP \nhas forgotten their mission. They have decided they have a new \nresponsibility: They have to generate money from insurance companies.\n\n[[Page S15367]]\n\n  Frankly, it is a sad situation because for many years AARP was \nrespected across America for being a nonpartisan voice for seniors. \nSadly, at this point in time they are not. As a result, there are very \nfew who are standing up to speak for seniors and what they need.\n  When I take a look at this bill and what it does, it worries me that \nwhat started off as a prescription drug bill to help seniors has become \nso complicated that it is almost impossible to explain. It has gaps in \ncoverage that will leave seniors without any help when they need it the \nmost and instead is trying to dramatically privatize Medicare as we \nknow it.\n  There are forces in Congress, primarily on the Republican side of the \naisle, who want to privatize both Medicare and Social Security. That \nhas been their goal. As a party, they never supported Medicare. Only a \nhandful of Republicans voted for its creation. Over the years, they \nhave made it clear where they stand. There was a time when former \nSpeaker Gingrich and his assistant Richard Armey, who was a Congressman \nfrom Texas, said their goal was for Medicare to ``wither on the vine.'' \nThat does not sound like a group that really is supportive of the \nprogram. Instead, it sounds like a group that will look for every \nopportunity to make sure that Medicare is not as good as it should be.\n  So ultimately what they are proposing is this: They are going to move \nMedicare from the program we know today, a Government-run program with \nlow overhead and low administrative costs that serves all Americans \nuniversally, to a new model which will bring in HMO insurance companies \nto cover senior citizens.\n  Naturally, they are afraid the free market will not work. So they put \nin generous subsidies to these HMOs so that they will lure away seniors \nout of Medicare. Here is how this will work: An insurance company wants \nto insure the healthiest people it can find. Insurance companies do not \ngo out and look for sick people. Insurance companies try, if they can, \nto exclude from coverage anybody who is going to be expensive. \nUnderstandable. If they reduce their risk and exposure, they increase \ntheir profitability. So these HMO companies, which are being designed \nto lure away seniors from Medicare, are going to not only achieve this \nby looking for the healthiest seniors, they get an added boost from our \nRepublican friends, our free market advocates who argue that they need \na subsidy on top of the--billions of dollars in subsidies to these \nHMOs.\n\n  What is wrong with this picture? If one believes in the free market, \nwhy in the world would they subsidize an HMO company: so they could \ntake the healthy people out of Medicare? That is exactly what they want \nto do. What will happen to Medicare then? There will be fewer people in \nMedicare because these Government-subsidized HMOs will be creaming off \nand cherry-picking the healthiest people and those left in Medicare are \ngoing to be poorer and sicker.\n  The net result of that is obvious. At the end of any given year, \nthere is going to be a more expensive per-claimant Medicare cost. There \nwill be sicker people left in Medicare.\n  Those who are opposed to Medicare and behind this idea believe that \nwill drive down the popularity of Medicare. They will be able to stand \non the Senate floor and the House floor and say: See, we showed you; \nMedicare just is not going to work; look how expensive it is for every \nsenior under Medicare.\n  So they will have achieved their dream and goal by reducing the \ncoverage of Medicare and convincing Congress not to stand behind it.\n  That is the goal of those who took what was a prescription drug bill, \nas complicated as it is, and turned it into a bill to privatize \nMedicare. That is what we have coming before us in the next few hours, \nin the next few days.\n  I think, frankly, that when one looks at the HMOs across America, \nthey find that they are doing pretty well. They are pretty profitable, \njust like these pharmaceutical companies. The average compensation of a \nchief executive of the 11 largest insurance companies currently serving \nMedicare was more than $15 million--average compensation, $15 million. \nThe former chairman of Oxford Health Plan--and I mentioned it earlier--\nwas paid $76 million in 2002. According to Weiss Ratings, an insurance \nrating agency, profits for 519 health insurance companies they \nevaluated jumped 77 percent from 2001 to 2002.\n  UnitedHealth Group reported a 35 percent increase. That is the group \nthat is joined at the hip with AARP, and both of them are widely \napplauding this new idea to move seniors out of Medicare into these \nHMOs, to privatize Medicare and raise the premiums seniors would have \nto pay under Medicare. So when we look at this alliance, we can \nunderstand why we have now come to the heavyweight division of the \nprize fights at the close of the congressional session. That is exactly \nwhat we are facing.\n  We have a situation where two of the largest lobbies in this town, \ntwo of the biggest special interest groups, two of the best financed \nindustries in America, pharmaceutical companies and HMO insurance \ncompanies, are anxious to see us pass a bill which means more \nprofitability for them. Sadly, it will be at the expense of the same \npeople we were really trying to help in the first place.\n  When it is all said and done, the seniors will not get a helping \nhand. Drug costs are going to go up. The program they are proposing is \nso complicated, it is impossible to explain, so it is understandable, \nand ultimately Medicare as we know it, a program which has served \nAmerica well for over 40 years, is going to be phased out and \nprivatized and HMOs will take over.\n\n  Some people believe--and I believe they think it passionately--that \nthe free market is the answer to everything. I would say to them, take \na look at what the free market is doing to health insurance in America \ntoday. The free market is at work. The free market is in the process of \ndoing what we expect it to do, increasing profitability. Ask anybody in \nAmerica about health insurance costs or ask any group why they are \ngoing on strike in America. Nine times out of 10 they will say it is \nbecause of health insurance coverage: The company we worked for will \nnot pay for the coverage; there is less coverage, and, frankly, we had \nto go on strike.\n  It is the No. 1 reason for work stoppages and strikes across America. \nIt is the biggest problem in my State when it comes to business \ncomplaints. Health insurance companies are using the free market \nexactly as they are supposed to. They are reducing their exposure and \nrisk, and they are increasing the cost to the people who need help. As \na result, we are finding fewer Americans with worse coverage, and those \nwho have it have worse coverage every single year.\n  The Republicans believe that that is what we should do to Medicare: \nWe ought to let the same HMO companies that are fleecing businesses and \nfamilies across America get their grimy hands on Medicare recipients. \nLet them, with a Government subsidy, lure away the healthiest Medicare \nrecipients and leave the sickest behind. Now, that is good for the \ncompanies. It is not good for Medicare, it is not good for seniors, and \nI believe it is not good for America.\n  We are in a situation where we have an important decision to make. \nSome people have said to me: How can you possibly go back to your State \nand explain that you voted against a prescription drug benefit for \nseniors? Well, I think those people do not understand the seniors I \nrepresent and most seniors across America. These are people wise with \nyears. These are people who have heard a lot of political promises. \nThese are folks who are skeptical when politicians say: I am going to \ngive you the Sun and the Moon. They ask hard questions.\n  When the seniors across America ask hard questions about this \nprescription drug benefit, they are going to be sorely disappointed. \nTwo-thirds of seniors already say what they have heard is not enough. \nThey do not want any part of it. That tells me that they are tuned in \nand following this debate. They want something that is basic, \nuniversal, and fair, something that does not come to them at the cost \nof things they value such as Medicare and Social Security.\n  Unfortunately, this program, which has been designed behind closed \ndoors and is now being unveiled one corner at a time, is not going to \nmeet the needs of seniors across America.\n  In the next few days, I am sure you will hear from my colleagues who \nare\n\n[[Page S15368]]\n\ngoing to come and will explain in detail why this is a bad idea. I \nthink we started off with the right goal, to help seniors pay for \nprescription drugs. Today, with this bill, we will have failed in \nmeeting that goal. That is why I oppose it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am under the impression that there will be \na session of the Senate either tomorrow or on Monday or on Tuesday or \non any number of those days. I am also under the impression that the \nSenate is rapidly, hopefully, approaching a sine die date for \nadjournment.\n  Being confronted with those expectations, I want to make a speech \nabout Thanksgiving. I don't want it to appear in today's Record, \nnecessarily, but I would ask for it to appear in the Record of the last \nday's session prior to Thanksgiving, whatever day that is.\n  I make such a unanimous consent request, that my speech not appear in \ntoday's Record but that it appear in the Record of the last day of the \nsession prior to Thanksgiving.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are printed in a future edition of the \nRecord.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of the conference report to H.R. 1904, \nthe Healthy Forests Restoration Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1904) to improve the capacity of the Secretary of Agriculture \n     and the Secretary of the Interior to plan and conduct \n     hazardous fuels reduction projects on National Forest System \n     lands and Bureau of Land Management lands aimed at protecting \n     communities, watersheds, and certain other at-risk lands from \n     catastrophic wildfire, to enhance efforts to protect \n     watersheds and address threats to forest and rangeland \n     health, including catastrophic wildfire, across the \n     landscape, and for other purposes, having met, have agreed \n     that the House recede from its disagreement to the amendment \n     of the Senate to the text of the bill and agree to the same \n     with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same; that the \n     House recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the \n     Senate to the title of the bill and agree to the same, signed \n     by a majority of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of \nNovember 20, 2003.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the \nconference report on the Healthy Forests Restoration Act.\n  Senators may remember that this bill was passed by the Senate on \nOctober 30 by a vote of 80 to 14. It embodied a bipartisan agreement to \nimprove forest health on both public and private lands. It provides \nFederal land managers the tools to implement scientifically supported \nmanagement practices on Federal forests, in consultation with local \ncommunities. It also establishes new conservation programs to improve \nwater quality and regenerate declining forests on private lands. The \nlegislation will reduce the amount of time and expense required to \nconduct hazardous fuel projects.\n  The conference report retains provisions adopted by the Senate that \nwill protect old growth forests. It improves the processes for \nadministrative and judicial review of hazardous fuel projects. But it \nwill continue to require rigorous but expedited environmental analysis \nof such projects.\n  The conference report specifically encourages collaboration between \nFederal agencies and local communities to treat hazardous fuels that \nthreaten communities and their sensitive watersheds. It provides for \nexpedited environmental analysis of hazardous fuel reduction projects \nadjacent to communities that are at risk to catastrophic wildfire. It \nrequires spending at least 50 percent of Federal hazardous fuels \nreduction funds to protect communities.\n  It requires courts considering legal actions to stop a hazardous fuel \nreduction project to balance the environmental effects of undertaking \nthe project against those of not carrying it out. And in carrying out \nhazardous fuel reduction projects in areas that may contain old growth \nforests, it requires Federal agencies to protect or restore these \nforests.\n  In other areas, it requires agencies to maintain older trees \nconsistent with the objective of restoring fire resilient stands. It \nauthorizes $720 million annually for hazardous fuels reduction \nactivities. It provides grants for removal of hazardous fuels and other \nbiomass to encourage their utilization for energy and other products. \nIt provides for assistance to private land owners to protect and \nrestore healthy watershed conditions.\n  It authorizes research projects designed to evaluate ways to treat \nforests to reduce their susceptibility to insects, diseases and fire. \nIt also authorizes agreements and easements with private landowners to \nprotect and enhance habitats for endangered and threatened species. And \nit encourages more effective monitoring and early warning programs for \ninsect and disease outbreaks.\n  This conference report would not be possible without the active \ninvolvement of Senators on both sides of the aisle who worked hard \ntogether to develop this bill. I especially appreciate the able \nassistance of the distinguished Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo, who \nchairs the Forestry Subcommittee of the Senate Agriculture Committee; \nthe Energy Committee chairman, the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Domenici, and his Forestry Subcommittee chair from Idaho, \nMr. Craig, were also very helpful in guiding this legislation along its \npath passage.\n  The Agriculture Committee also had assistance of Senator Lincoln of \nArkansas and active involvement on her part in developing the bill, and \nwe also had the benefit of suggestions and assistance from Senators \nWyden and Feinstein who came to me early and asked to be a part of the \neffort to develop this bill. They were involved along with many others \nwhose contributions were necessary to make the approval of this bill \npossible.\n  The Agriculture Committee also benefited from the assignment of an \nemployee of the Forest Service, Doug MacCleery, who assisted our staff \nin the development of this legislation. We appreciate his assistance. \nAnd our committee staff did a superb job under the able direction of \nthe Agriculture Committee staff director, Hunt Shipman.\n  Let's not forget, it was President Bush, the President of the United \nStates, who recommended in the first place that Congress act on a \nhealthy forest initiative. It was at his suggestion and his urgings \nthat we pushed and pushed until we finally achieved success, with the \nadoption today by the other body of the conference report, on this \nbill. I must also mention the able assistance of his Secretary of \nAgriculture, Ann Veneman, who provided valuable insight and assistance \nall along the way.\n  I urge the Senate approve this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this is truly a historic day. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, we have worked literally for a decade or more \nto try to find a path forward in the area of finding a solution to the \nproblems we face in our national forests.\n  In recent years, we have seen an average of 4 million acres a year \nburn. We have seen devastating wildfires this\n\n[[Page S15369]]\n\nyear that have destroyed not only tremendous amounts of property and \nenvironment in our forests, but have also taken lives. We have seen \ninsect infestations that have jeopardized the future of one of the most \nincredible environmental resources we have in America, our forests.\n  All of it has occurred while we have been battling in the courts, \ntrying to find a path forward simply to allow our forest managers the \nability to implement their forest management decisions, to deal with \ninsect infestation, to deal with the threat of catastrophic wildfire, \nand to help preserve the great legacy we have in America, in our \nforests.\n  I stand today to thank those in our Senate conference who have worked \nwith us to build and strengthen the bipartisan solution that has \nbrought us to this point.\n  Sitting here beside me is the Senator from Mississippi, Thad Cochran, \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee. Without Senator Cochran's able \nleadership, without his patience and his wisdom in guiding us through \nthis process, we would not be here today. I want to personally thank \nhim. I thank him, as well, on behalf of a grateful Nation for the skill \nand the patience he has given us to help bring this bill forward.\n  Also, I thank Senator Larry Craig, my colleague from Idaho, who has \nworked on this issue tirelessly for the better part of the last decade \nto try to help bring America to an understanding of the need for \nreform, and for helping us work through a bipartisan solution in the \nSenate. Senator Craig deserves great praise and commendation for his \nuntiring work to help give us the possibility of being here today--just \na short time away from successfully passing in both the House and the \nSenate this Healthy Forests legislation.\n  Also, Senator Domenici, chairman of the Energy Committee, has worked \ntirelessly on this issue and he deserves to be thanked for his \ntremendous efforts. Not many people follow it this closely, but there \nis forestry jurisdiction in both the Energy Committee and the \nAgriculture Committee. Senator Cochran chairs the Agriculture \nCommittee, and Senator Domenici the Energy Committee. By coincidence, \nboth of the Idaho Senators chair the respective subcommittees on \nforestry. Senator Craig chairs the subcommittee on forestry in the \nEnergy Committee, and I chair the forestry subcommittee on the \nAgriculture Committee. Together, on the Republican side, we have \ndeveloped a strong team to work in the Senate.\n  I also thank Senator Blanche Lincoln, from Arkansas, for stepping \nforward as the ranking member on the forestry subcommittee and working \nwith me to develop the senate bill that set the mark for improving this \nlegislation and moving it through the Senate. We then expanded that \nbipartisan base and worked with Senators Feinstein from California, \nWyden from Oregon, and others, including additional Republicans and \nDemocrats, all of whom came together to bring a bipartisan solution to \nthe Chamber.\n  It was not easy. There were many who wanted to use this issue to \nfurther their political efforts, to either cause further strife and \nconflict on the issue surrounding our forests or to simply promote some \nagenda that was not consistent with our efforts to move forward on a \nbipartisan basis to protect and preserve our forests.\n  We fought many battles over the last 2 or 3 months, and they were the \nresulting, concluding battles in a crescendo that has been developing \nover the last decade. When we were done, we needed to work with the \nHouse of Representatives. There was concern at that point. There was \nactually another filibuster to stop us from even going into conference \nwith the House because there was concern that the bill would be changed \ntoo much in ways that would not allow us to find a common consensus-\nbased path forward.\n  Yet we have gone on together, again, in that bipartisan fashion that \nwe developed in the Senate to work in a bicameral fashion and \nbipartisan fashion with the House to come together with this \nlegislation that is now before us.\n  As many of us said as we developed this legislation, it is not \nnecessarily what any of us would have written had we had complete \ncontrol over the issue. But it is the result of what can happen if we \nwork across party lines, across the lines of the rotunda between the \nHouse and Senate, and across regional lines in our Nation, to try to \nmake sure that we get past the politics, the partisanship, past the \npersonal attacks, and focus on the principles that will allow us to \nmove forward and develop positive legislation such as that.\n  I am confident this legislation will pass the Senate today. I am \nconfident that when it goes to the President's desk, he will sign it. \nThe United States will have taken a very big step forward in terms of \npreserving one of the great environmental legacies we have--our \nforests; we will have taken a step to protect and preserve our rural \nareas in America; we will have done much to protect our great \nfirefighters, many of whom gave their lives this year, and in previous \nyears, in trying to protect our forests and our communities; we will \nhave put statutory protection in place for old-growth forests in our \nNation; we will have worked to develop small-diameter timber and other \nuses of those parts of our forests that need thinning; we will have \ntaken steps to make sure that rural communities such as Elk City, ID--\nliterally at the end of the road--do not face the potential devastation \na wildfire could cause not only to their economy but to their safety \nand the community at large; we will have protected the wildland urban \ninterface, where so many of the people who now live in urban areas find \ntheir homes and lives and property threatened by the danger of \nuncontrolled wildfire.\n  All of these things will be brought together because we were \nsuccessful today and, over the past few years, in bringing together the \nkind of politics that America wants, the kind of politics that is good \nand beneficial, that helps us to cross the divisions and eliminate \nthose conflicts that so often bring us to a stalemate or a stall on the \nfloor of the Senate or on the floor of the House.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank all Senators and all of the House \nMembers who have done so much to look past their own individual \nconcerns and to work together for the collective good of the whole as \nwe built this strong bipartisan solution to a critical issue facing our \nNation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the conference \nreport on the Healthy Forest initiative.\n  The question of how we effectively and efficiently deal with the \nthreat of wildfire is a complex one, and I have been committed to \nfinding a solution that will provide the Forest Service with additional \ntools, can win approval in the Senate, and can become law. This \nbipartisan compromise meets that test.\n  As I toured the Black Hills National Forest this August, it was clear \nthat the Forest Service needs additional tools to address the \nincreasing fire risk to South Dakota communities. There are currently \nover 460,000 acres of the Black Hills National Forest that are in \nmoderate to high fire risk. And, it is increasing. The Forest Service \nestimates that over 550,000 acres will fall into this category in the \nnext 10 years if we do nothing to address it.\n  It is clear that we must find a way to allow Forest Service personnel \nto spend less time in the office planning, and more time in the forest \nactually clearing high fuel loads.\n  This legislation takes major steps to do just that. The legislation \nprovides communities more flexibility in defining what should be \nconsidered priority areas as well as incentives to work near \ncommunities. It clarifies how much detail is needed for environmental \nanalysis of fuel reduction projects. The conference report adopts the \nSenate-passed streamlined appeals process, expediting decisions for \nfuel-reduction projects while ensuring that the public has an \nopportunity to be heard early in the developmental stages forest \nrestoration projects. And, it includes Senate-passed language \nencouraging speedy disposition of any projects that are challenged in \ncourt without giving undue deference to any party.\n  While the legislation is not exactly how I would have written it, I \nthink it is the best shot we have to get something meaningful enacted \ninto law this year. I am please the House has passed\n\n[[Page S15370]]\n\nthis legislation and encourage my colleagues to pass it, and hope the \nPresident will quickly sign it into law.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. This bill is extremely \nimportant to the west and to my constituents as we look for ways to \nreduce the risk of large and dangerous wildfires that threaten our \nhomes and communities. You just have to look at the devastating fire \nseason Montana went through this past summer to understand why we feel \nso strongly about this issue.\n  I have said that a healthy forests bill must first allow Federal \nagencies and communities to address dangerous fuel loadings on a local \nlevel, quickly and efficiently. Second, it must support small, \nindependent mills and put local people to work in the forests and the \nmills. Third, it must promote and protect citizen involvement and be \nfair to the principals underlying the federal judicial system. And \nfinally, it must protect special and sensitive places.\n  We have achieved that with this legislation.\n  My one disappointment is that the conference committee stripped out \nthe Rural Community Forestry Enterprise Program. I worked together with \nSenators Crapo and Leahy to include this program in the Senate bill, \nfirst in the Agriculture Committee and then as part of the Senate-\npassed bill.\n  The Rural Community Forestry Enterprise Program would bring much \nneeded support for building and maintaining a thriving forest industry \nin rural communities.\n  Just as this industry is important to maintaining the economic \nvitality of these small and often remote communities, it is vital to \nmeeting the objectives of this legislation. We cannot afford to lose \nmore mills and highly skilled forest industry workers in Montana. We \ncannot accomplish needed hazardous fuel reduction work without them.\n  I would like to share with you concerns I heard today about the \nremoval of the Community Enterprise Program from a friend, Jim Hurst, \nthe owner and operator of a small family-owned mill called Owens and \nHurst, in Eureka, Montana.\n  He said:\n\n       Small mill owners like myself and Ron Buentemeier, the \n     General Manager of F.H. Stoltze Land and Lumber Company in \n     Columbia Falls, told you we needed this type of help to make \n     the Small Business Set-Aside program more responsive to the \n     needs of small, independent and mostly family-owned mills \n     across Montana. You responded with the Community Enterprise \n     program.\n       This is an important program and should be put back into \n     the Healthy Forests Bill. Independents have been under long-\n     time family ownership and because of that my family and the \n     other families who own mills know that we each have one heck \n     of a responsibility to our communities. This Community \n     Enterprise program would help the independents who have been \n     impacted the hardest by reduced federal timber supply. They \n     have shown their mettle and have been courageous. We need to \n     keep fighting for small mill owners, operators and the rural \n     communities who depend on these small mills for their \n     livelihood.\n\n  While I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure a thriving forest industry in our rural communities, it \nis imperative to pass this legislation now. I believe we do have a \nserious problem with the buildup of hazardous forest fuels and that we \nneed to do a better job of addressing it now.\n  The legislation has the elements necessary to allow local citizens \nand leaders to make wise decisions that address this problem \nefficiently and effectively and I urge my colleagues to support it. I \nwould like to thank several Senators for their hard work on this bill, \nincluding Senators Wyden, Feinstein, Crapo, Lincoln and Cochran. \nWithout their dedicated efforts and leadership that I was very pleased \nto support, we would not be the close to passing this bill today.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President: I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report for the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003.\n  I especially thank my colleagues--Senator Cochran, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Crapo, Senator Craig, Senator Lincoln, Senator Wyden, and \nSenator Feinstein for the leadership they demonstrated in addressing \nthis national crisis that affects all Americans, particularly those who \nlive in the urban-wildland interface.\n  The conference report is a major step forward toward preventing the \nsevere wildland forest and rangeland fires that have become an annual \nevent. What is more important is that the human tragedy associated with \nwildfires the heartbreak of losing one's home and possessions, the \neconomic losses, and the dangers that wildfires pose to our devoted \nwildland firefighters will be reduced through the sound forest \nmanagement practices provided for in this legislation.\n  The 2002 and 2003 fire seasons have been some of the worst on record \nnationally. Forest fires continue to create extensive problems for many \nAmericans, predominantly for those living and working in the West. In \n2002, Alaska alone experienced fires that burned more than one million \nacres.\n  These catastrophic wildfires caused great damage to our forested \nlands; many were already vulnerable as a result of unaddressed insect \nand disease damage.\n  Deteriorating forest and rangeland health now affects more than 190 \nmillion acres of public land, an area twice the size of California.\n  In my home State of Alaska, the damage caused by the spruce bark \nbeetle, especially on the Kenai Peninsula has been devastating. Over 5 \nmillion acres of trees in south central and interior Alaska have been \nlost to insects over the last 10 years.\n  I am particularly enthusiastic that this legislation authorizes and \nexpedites fuel reduction treatment on Federal land on which the \nexistence of disease or insect infestation has occurred, such as those \non the Kenai Peninsula. Federal land managers will now be able to \nmanage these dead and dying tree stands.\n  The key to long-term forest management on the Kenai Peninsula is to \nmanage the forested landscape for a variety of species compositions, \nstructures and age classes; not simply unmanaged stands. The \nlegislation before us will do just that, and will prevent a \nreoccurrence of the type of spruce bark beetle mortality we have \nexperienced in Alaska.\n  I firmly believe that this conference report is a comprehensive plan \nfocused on giving Federal land managers and their partners the tools \nthey need to respond to a national forest health crisis. The \nlegislation directs the timely implementation of scientifically \nsupported management activities to protect the health and vibrancy of \nFederal forest ecosystems as well as the communities and private lands \nthat surround them.\n  Under this legislation, the Secretaries of the Interior and \nAgriculture will conduct authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects \nin accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act with a \ncritical, streamlined process.\n  Additionally, for those authorized fuel reduction projects proposed \nto be conducted in the wildland-urban interface, the Secretaries will \nbe able to expedite such projects without the need to analyze and \ndescribe more than the proposed agency action and one alternative \naction. In other words, we can now get the work on the ground done \nquickly.\n  Still, the Secretaries must continue to provide for public comment \nduring the preparation of any environmental assessment or EIS for these \nauthorized hazardous fuel reduction projects. The public process is not \nundermined in this legislation.\n  I also support the proposed new administrative review process \nassociated with these authorized fuel reduction projects. Too often we \nhave become mired in administrative appeal gridlock in this country at \nthe expense of communities at risk to wildland fire. We saw such \ndevastation recently in the State of California.\n  This legislation will establish a fair and balanced predecisional \nreview process. Specific, written comments must be submitted during the \nscoping or public comment period.\n  Additionally, civil actions may be brought in Federal district court \nonly if the person has exhausted his/her administrative review process. \nThe legislation will foreclose venue-shopping.\n  It encourages the courts to weigh the environmental consequences of \nmanagement inaction when the potential devastation from fires could \noccur. This provision is important public policy and demonstrates to \nthe American people that the risk of catastrophic\n\n[[Page S15371]]\n\nwildfire must be known, understood and respected in our judicial system \nand acted upon quickly.\n  I am also excited about title 2 of the legislation which will \nencourage the production of energy from biomass. Developing energy from \nbiomass could provide a tremendous boost to the local economy on the \nKenai Peninsula while reducing the dangerous wildland fire risks that \nexists there. That is a win-win solution. The biomass provision is \ninnovative, environmentally sound and a good approach in achieving \nhealthy forests.\n  The bipartisan legislation before us is good for the nation and good \nfor Alaska. I will enthusiastically support its passage today.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, southern California has recently \nexperienced the devastating impacts of wildfire first-hand. More than \n750,000 acres burned, and 24 people died. We have seen how important it \nis to take the appropriate steps to protect our vulnerable communities \nfrom the threat of wildfire, and that is why I am supporting this bill.\n  The bill before us invests in preventing wildfires, rather than just \ntrying to fight them after the fact. Each year, $760 million is \nauthorized for wildfire prevention projects, such as tree and brush \nremoval, thinning, and prescribed burning. In total, the bill would \nallow treatment of 20 million acres. Priority is given to projects that \nprotect communities and watersheds, and at least 50 percent of the \nfunds must be used near at-risk communities. The other 50 percent will \nbe spent on projects near municipal water supply systems and on lands \ninfested with disease or insects. This is a good start at preventing \nfires.\n  I do, however, have to mention my deep disappointment with the House \nRepublican conferees for removing my amendment to help firefighters who \nbattle the biggest fires. I am almost speechless that the House \nRepublicans would turn their backs on our brave firefighters.\n  My amendment, which passed the Senate 94 to 3, would have required \nlong-term health monitoring of firefighters who fought fires in a \nFederal disaster area. These firefighters are exposed to several toxins \nknown to be harmful to long-term health, including fine particulates, \ncarbon monoxide, sulfur, formaldehyde, mercury, heavy metals, and \nbenzene. This amendment was important to the firefighters in my State \nand was supported by the International Association of Firefighters.\n  I pledge to the firefighters, this is not over. I will be back to \ncontinue fighting on behalf of all firefighters who are put at risk in \nFederal disasters.\n  I am also disappointed that the conferees dropped another amendment \nof mine, which was included in the Senate-passed bill. My amendment \nrequired the EPA to provide each of its regional offices a mobile air \npollution monitoring network, so that in the event of a catastrophe, \ntoxic emissions could be monitored and the public could know the health \nrisks.\n  Despite the fact that the conferees dropped my two amendments, I \nbelieve this bill will help protect communities from the threat of \nwildfires, which is why I am supporting it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today's vote to pass the Healthy \nForests legislation is a major bipartisan victory. This is not just \nbecause it is the first major forest bill in 27 years.\n  Much more significantly, we have nourished the middle ground in the \nforest debate that is so often lost in the partisan rhetoric.\n  We actually can create good rural jobs, protect our communities, and \nrestore our forest environment at the same time.\n  Let me repeat this: we can create rural jobs, protect our \ncommunities, and take action to restore the health of our forests at \nthe same time.\n  Ever since I cosponsored the Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group \nAct 5 years ago, I have been working to bring together the rural, \nforest-dependent communities--rather than unnecessarily dividing them.\n  This bill goes a long way to that end throughout the West and the \nNation.\n  There are many people who deserve credit for this bill, but there are \na few Senators in particular to whom I want to give special thanks. \nSenators Pete Domenici and Larry Craig were the best bipartisan allies \nI could ever ask for in terms of how they approached this issue.\n  Even though they are in the majority, Senators Domenici and Craig \nrealized that a forestry bill needed a bipartisan coalition. They \nworked in good faith with me and Senator Wyden from start to finish, \nand I am deeply grateful for it.\n  I also want to thank Senator Cochran, the chairman of the conference \non this bill, for his leadership throughout the process. Senator \nCochran ably and skillfully represented the Senate position in the \nnegotiations. I particularly want to emphasize that his staff conducted \nthe conference in a fine and fair manner throughout, and it's a credit \nto his leadership.\n  There are many others Senators who played critical roles in this \nprocess, including Senators Crapo, Kyl, Lincoln, McCain, Baucus, and \nBingaman.\n  I finally want to thank Senator Wyden, the ranking member on the \nForestry Subcommittee of the Energy Committee. He is as good a ranking \nmember and as good a leader on forestry as the Democrats could ever \nhave.\n  I also want to say that I second his views on the meaning of the \ndifferent parts of the bill in his statement today. As the two \nprincipal Democratic negotiators of this bill, he and I are in complete \naccord as to the meaning of its contents.\n  This legislation H.R 1904, approved by a House-Senate conference \ncommittee today is very similar to a bill passed by the Senate last \nmonth, with priority given toward removing dead and dying trees and \ndangerously thick underbrush in areas nearest communities as well as \ntargeting areas where insects have devastated forests. This is \nespecially important in California, where hundreds of thousands of \ntrees have been killed by the bark beetle, creating tinderbox \nconditions.\n  While the recent wildfires in Southern California have been \ncontained, these deadly fires consumed a total of 738,158 acres, killed \n23 people, and destroyed approximately 3,626 residences and 1,184 other \nstructures. Clearly, we must do everything we can to avert such a \ncatastrophe in the future. The National Forest Service estimates that \n57 million acres of Federal land are at the highest risk of \ncatastrophic fire, including 8.5 million in California, so it is \ncritical that we protect our forests and nearby communities.\n  More than 57 million acres of Federal land at the highest risk of \ncatastrophic fire, including 8.5 million in California. In the past 5 \nyears alone, wildfires have raged through over 27 million acres, \nincluding nearly 3 million acres in California. It is critical that \nCongress acts to protect our forests and nearby communities.\n  The House-Senate agreement both speeds up the process for reducing \nhazardous fuels and provides the first legal protection for old growth \nin our nation's history.\n  Let me describe what the legislation would do.\n  Critically, it would establish an expedited process so the Forest \nService and the Department of the Interior can get to work on brush-\nclearing projects to minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire.\n  Up to 20 million acres of lands near communities, municipal \nwatersheds and other high-risk areas can be treated. This includes \nlands that have suffered from serious wind damage or insect epidemics, \nsuch as the bark beetle.\n  We made an important change to the bill's language in section \n102(a)(4) in the conference report. In the Senate-passed bill, the \ninsect and disease exception was related to infestations, whereas in \nthe conference bill, the exception has been clarified to apply only \nwhere there is a presence of an epidemic of insects or disease. By its \nown terms, an insect or disease-related event of ``epidemic'' \nproportions is different from ``endemic'' insects and disease, which \nare present in a naturally functioning forest ecosystem.\n  Under the final bill, only epidemics are given special treatment. \nThis is an important distinction.\n  A total of $760 million annually for hazardous fuel reduction is \nauthorized by the legislation, a $340 million increase over current \nfunding.\n  At least 50 percent of the funds would be used for fuels reduction \nnear communities.\n  The legislation also requires that large, fire-resilient, old-growth \ntrees be protected from logging immediately.\n\n[[Page S15372]]\n\n  It mandates that forest plans that are more than 10 years old and \nmost in need of updating must be updated with old growth protection \nconsistent with the national standard within 2 to 3 years.\n  Without this provision in the amendment, we would likely have to wait \na decade or more to see improved old-growth protection. And even then \nthere would be no guarantee that this protection--against the threat of \nboth logging and catastrophic fire--would be very strong.\n  In California, the amendment to the Sierra Nevada Framework that is \ncurrently in progress will have to comply with the new national \nstandard for old-growth protection.\n  Let me explain how the agreement improves and shortens the \nadministrative review process and makes it more collaborative and less \nconfrontational. It is critical that the Forest Service can spend the \nscarce dollars in the federal budget in doing vital work on the ground, \nrather than being mired in endless paperwork.\n  The legislation fully preserves multiple opportunities for meaningful \npublic involvement. People can attend a public meeting on every \nproject, and they can submit comments during both the preparation of \nthe environmental impact statement and during the administrative review \nprocess. I guarantee you the public will have a meaningful say in these \nprojects.\n  The legislation changes the environmental review process so the \nForest Service still considers the effects of the proposed project in \ndetail, but can focus its analysis on the project proposal, one \nreasonable alternative that meets the project's goals and the \nalternative of not doing the project, instead of the 5-9 alternatives \nnow often required.\n\n  In the highest priority areas within 1\\1/2\\ miles of communities, the \nForest Service need only study the proposed action and not \nalternatives. There is no relaxation from current law, however, in how \nclosely the Forest Service must study the environmental effects of the \nproject it is proposing to undertake.\n  The legislation replaces the current Forest Service administrative \nappeals with an administrative review process that will occur after the \nForest Service finishes its environmental review of a project, but \nbefore it reaches its decision. This new approach is similar to a \nprocess adopted by the Clinton administration in 2000 for review of \nforest plans and amendments to those plans. The process will be \nspeedier and less confrontational than the current administrative \nappeal process.\n  Next I want to turn to judicial review. I want to emphasize that \ncases will be heard more quickly under the legislation and abuses of \nthe process will be checked, but nothing alters citizens' opportunity \nfor fair and thorough court review.\n  Parties can sue in Federal court only on issues raised in the \nadministrative review process. This is a commonsense provision that \nallows agencies the opportunity to correct their own mistakes before \neverything gets litigated.\n  Lawsuits must be filed in the same jurisdiction as the proposed \nproject.\n  Courts are encouraged to resolve the case as soon as possible.\n  Preliminary injunctions are limited to 60 days, although they can be \nextended if appropriate. This provision sends a signal to courts not to \ndelay important brush-clearing projects indefinitely unless there \nreally is a good reason to do so.\n  The court must weigh the environmental benefit of doing a given \nproject against its environmental risks as it reviews the case.\n  In closing, I want to say that my colleagues and I have been trying \nto come to an agreement on a forest bill for several years. We finally \nbroke through the deadlock.\n  I am deeply pleased that we are enacting this legislation to give the \nresidents of southern California and elsewhere a better chance against \nthe fires that will come next time.\n\n\n                          Section 105(c)(3)(B)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have a question for the Senator from Oregon as to \nthe meaning of one specific provision of the conference report on the \nHealthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. This provision is section \n105(c)(3)(B), which sets forth an exception to the general requirement \nthat parties must participate in the administrative review process \nbefore raising claims in Federal court. I don't understand the \nconference report and statement of the managers as doing anything to \nchange the parties' preexisting obligations as to environmental review \nexcept as explicitly provided in the statute. Do you agree, as the \nranking member on the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests of the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I have the same understanding of this matter as the \nSenator from California.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will oppose the conference report on H.R. \n1904, the so-called Healthy Forests Act. While I have several \nsubstantive concerns about this legislation, let me first speak about \nthe process by which this legislation has come before the Senate.\n  As my colleagues know, there has been a significant and growing \nconcern about the way the other side is operating conference \ncommittees. In fact this conference was delayed several weeks because \nthe minority has continually been excluded from conferences.\n  However, in good faith, I, along with interested Members and their \nstaffs, worked out an agreement on the first six titles of the bill. \nCoincidentally, there were only six titles in the House version of the \nbill. An agreement was reached on those first six titles, and while I \nstill had serious concerns about the substance of the agreement, I did \nnot object to the process moving forward. I did so because I was given \ncommitments that we would work out an agreement between the House and \nSenate on the remaining three titles that were passed by the Senate.\n  But what happened next is absolutely astounding. One half hour before \nthe conference committee was scheduled to meet, I was informed that the \nconference would only consider the first six titles of the bill, and \nthat the remaining titles that were passed by the Senate were ``off the \ntable.''\n  Yet another backroom deal was cut by the other side to exclude the \nminority from any real conference proceedings.\n  These were highly important provisions that were passed by the \nSenate. Of particular importance to me was the Rural Community Forestry \nEnterprise Program, which I authored with Senators Crapo and Baucus. In \nmy State of Vermont we have a good deal of small-diameter trees for \nwhich we need help finding markets. This program would build on the \nexisting expertise of the Forest Service by providing technical \nassistance, cooperative marketing and new product development to small \ntimber-dependent communities. Whether it is producing furniture, \npallets, or other creative new markets, this program would help small \nforest-dependent communities expand economically.\n  Back room deals summarily excluded this, and several other important \ninitiatives in the Senate-passed bill, from consideration in the \nconference committee. That is why I declined to sign this conference \nreport.\n  I will not vote for this conference report because this bill before \nus remains a well-camouflaged attempt to limit the right of the \nAmerican people to know and to question what their Government is doing \non the public's lands.\n  The bill before us is really a solution looking for a problem. So \nlet's take a closer look at the ``solution'' on the table.\n  First, the bill would make it much more difficult for the public to \nhave any oversight or say in what happens on public lands, undermining \ndecades of progress in public inclusion. In this new and vague pre-\ndecisional protest process, this bill expects the public to have \nintimate knowledge of aspects of the project early on, including \naspects that the Forest Service might not have disclosed in its initial \nproposal.\n  The bill gives the Forest Service a real incentive to hide the ball \nor to withhold certain information about a project that might make it \nobjectionable, such as endangered species habitat data, watershed \nanalysis, or road-building information. If concerns are not raised \nabout this possibly undisclosed information in the vaguely outlined \n``predecisional'' process, the Forest Service can argue to the courts \nthat no claims can be brought on these issues in the future when the \nagency, either through intent or negligence, withholds important \ninformation from the public.\n\n[[Page S15373]]\n\n  Essentially, this provision penalizes citizens and rewards agency \nstaff when the agency does not do its job in terms of basic \ninvestigation and information sharing regarding a project. This bill \nmakes other significant changes to judicial review. It will force \njudges to reconsider preliminary injunctions every 60 days, whether or \nnot circumstances warrant it.\n  In many ways, this provision could backfire on my colleagues' goal of \nexpediting judicial review. It will force judges to engage in otherwise \nunnecessary proceedings, slowing their consideration of the very cases \nthat proponents of H.R. 1904 want to fast track. Moreover, taking the \ncourts' time to engage in this process will also divert scarce judicial \nresources away from other pending cases. It is also likely to encourage \nmore lawsuits. Requiring that injunctions be renewed every 60 days, \nwhether needed or not, gives lawyers another bite at the apple, \nsomething they often find hard to resist.\n  Instead of telling the courts when and how to conduct their business, \nwe should instead be working to find a workable and effective approach \nto reducing wildfire risks.\n  This bill does not achieve that, but, with these provisions that \nminimize the public's input, it instead poses a real risk to the checks \nand balances that the American people and their independent judiciary \nnow have on Government decisions affecting the public lands owned by \nthe American people.\n  Sadly, this bill plays a bait-and-switch trick on communities \nthreatened by wildfires. It is not fair to roll back environmental \nlaws, public oversight, or judicial review under the guise of reacting \ntoe devastating wildfires. It will do nothing to help or to prevent the \nkid of devastation that southern California recently faced. It is a \nspecial interest grab-bag shrouded behind a smokescreen.\n  We should be offering real help and real answers, instead of allowing \nfear to be used as a pretext for taking the public's voice out of \ndecisions affecting the public's lands and for ceding more power to \nspecial interests.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I understand we can proceed to adopt the conference \nreport on a voice vote since there is no objection to that. First, I am \nhappy to yield to the assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will not object. I simply came to the \nfloor to congratulate the distinguished Senator from Mississippi and \nthe Senator from Idaho for an extraordinary job on a very difficult \nsubject on which they have worked for years. I commend them both so \nmuch for this very important piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the conference report.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15373-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15373-S15376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak a few minutes about \nthe upcoming Medicare conference report that will be before this body--\nI don't know when--maybe Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. Before I do so, I \nwould like to thank and compliment many people who helped bring this \nlegislation to this point. For many years, many of us in Congress have \nurged the passage of prescription drug benefits legislation for \nseniors. We have been close to passage many times in the last several \nyears.\n  I remember last year, for example, about this time when Congress was \nclose to adjournment. I called a meeting together in my office for one \nlast chance--Senator Kennedy, Senator Snowe, myself, Senator Hatch, and \nother Senators who were vitally concerned about passing prescription \ndrug legislation. We worked mightily. We worked very hard. At the very \nend, the talks collapsed. It didn't work, largely for political, \npartisan reasons, I might add, and we were not able to get a bill \npassed.\n  Here we are again. We are at the brink. We are on the verge. We are \nvery close to getting prescription drug legislation passed. This time I \nvery much hope that all of us--as Senators and House Members--put \npartisan differences aside and suspend judgment. That is, we should \nlook at the legislation, look at the facts, and not listen to the \nrhetoric from various groups, to see what really makes sense.\n  There are a number of people I wish to thank at this time--the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Chuck Grassley, who has worked very \nhard; Senator Breaux, also a member of the committee; Senator Olympia \nSnowe, a member of the committee.\n  In addition, Congressman Bill Thomas, chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, has worked extremely diligently. The Speaker of the House, \nthe majority leader of the House, Tom DeLay; the majority leader of the \nSenate, Bill Frist--there are many people who have worked very hard. I \nthank them very much for their efforts and for their work.\n  One person I also wish to thank is Senator Ted Kennedy. Senator \nKennedy worked very hard to help us pass prescription drug legislation \nin the Senate not too many weeks ago. He worked very hard. He worked \nwith me. He worked with the minority leader. He worked with the \nmajority leader. He worked with various Members of the Senate who were \ncritical to passage of the bill.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for his yeoman's work to help pass \nprescription drug benefits legislation in the Senate. He also worked \nvery hard to help get a conference report put together. He spent a good \ndeal of time with the conferees, with myself, with the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, Mr. Daschle, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist, and \nmany other people trying to help get prescription drug legislation \npassed. I regret at this point that he and I have a different view of \nthis bill. He believes there are certain flaws in this bill. I think \nthis is a good bill and should be passed. Nevertheless, Senators should \nknow that Senator Ted Kennedy has done a great job in helping move this \nlegislation to the point it is today. Without his efforts, this bill \nwould be flawed in many areas. He helped make this, in my judgment, \nquite a good bill.\n  Why should we pass prescription drug benefits legislation? I suppose \nthe main reason is that times have changed so dramatically. In 1965, \nwhen Medicare was enacted--and it was enacted by a large vote margin--\nprescription drugs were not necessary. Most senior citizens were more \nconcerned with doctors, office calls, and hospital visits for their \nmedical concerns, rather than prescription drugs.\n  Look what has happened in the last 38 years since the Medicare Act \npassed. Prescription drugs and generic drugs are so vitally important \ntoday. They replace procedures. They help prevent the onset of disease. \nOften times, the medications people take tend to prevent, forestall, \nand delay all kinds of maladies. They are really important, much more \nimportant today and getting more important every day.\n  In addition, prescription drugs are becoming more expensive--much \nmore expensive--and it is putting seniors in a bind. Many low-income \nseniors are in a real bind.\n  I worked at a pharmacy during one of my work days at home. I have \nworked at many different jobs in Montana. I show up at 8 o'clock in the \nmorning with a sack lunch. I have worked in sawmills, I have waited \ntables. One day I was working in a pharmacy in Montana. I saw senior \ncitizens walk up to the pharmacist in a quiet voice and ask how perhaps \nthey could change their\n\n[[Page S15374]]\n\nmedication or what prescription should they cut back on because they \ncouldn't afford to pay for them all.\n  Seniors couldn't afford to pay it. It was stunning, and it was sad. \nIt was a revelation to me. You hear about it, but when you see it, it \nhas a real effect. It happens. Many low-income seniors are having a \nvery difficult time trying to make ends meet. Sometimes it is a \ntradeoff between buying prescription drugs, buying food, and paying the \nrent. It happens way too frequently, and it is just not right for our \ncountry, the United States of America, to let this happen.\n  This legislation does a good job in remedying this situation. First \nof all, it is $400 billion of prescription drug benefits for seniors \nspread out over 10 years--$400 billion. That is a lot of money, but we \nhave a lot of seniors who have great needs.\n  Under this legislation, seniors will find they will not have to pay \nall the cost of the drug but, rather, 25 percent, and the rest will be \npicked up by Medicare, the Federal Government, through the mechanism \nthat is designed in this bill. They will only pay a quarter. But if you \nare a low-income senior, you are in a much better position under this \nlegislation.\n  One-third of United States seniors are classified as low-income. A \nfull one-third are low-income. Under this bill, low-income citizens \nwill find that 90 percent of their benefits are covered--90 percent. \nThat means low-income people can get the prescription drugs they need \nand will not have to walk up to that pharmacist and, in a hushed, quiet \ntone, ask what tradeoff, what drugs that person should cut back on \nbecause he or she cannot afford them.\n  If you are a low-income senior--and one-third of Americans are low-\nincome. In my State, that is about 46,000 seniors who will be affected; \nthere are about 46,000 seniors in the State of Montana who are low-\nincome, out of about 140,000 seniors statewide. The general rule for \nall seniors is 75 percent of your prescription drug costs; if you are \nlow-income, 90 percent of your prescription drugs will be paid for.\n  This is good legislation. We are here at a time when people in our \ncountry are asking us, Should we help our seniors or should we not?\n  Let me mention a couple additional reasons why I support this bill.\n  First of all, it helps rural America. Mr. President, there is an \nextra $25 billion in this bill for rural health care. The $400 billion \nI mentioned earlier all goes to benefits for seniors, either directly \nor indirectly. But $25 billion extra goes for providers and $25 billion \nis for rural America.\n  Why is that so important? It is so important because of the cost and \nthe strain of the practice of medicine in rural America. We run the \nrisk of not having good, adequate health care in rural parts of our \ncountry. We have all talked to many doctors and nurses who practice in \nrural parts of our country. They talk about the hours. They want to \nserve their patients. Believe me, they want to serve their patients, \nbut after a while there comes a time when they are just worn out.\n  In rural parts of America, there are often pathologists--or \npulmonologists or other specialists--who have to be on call all the \ntime or on call every second or third day. Why? Because there are fewer \nof them in rural America than in urban America. The costs, believe it \nor not, are also very high in rural America--in many cases higher than \nin cities. There are the transportation costs, the cost of distances, \nthe travel costs, for patients, doctors, and suppliers.\n  Our State of Montana is a low-income State, unfortunately. Our per \ncapita income in Montana is low, but we are in the middle of all the \nStates when it comes to cost of living. We are about the bottom when it \ncomes to family income, but we are in the middle when it comes to \ncosts. It is because we are a rural State, and this is true for rural \nparts of all States.\n  This bill finally helps address the unlevel playing field that has \nexisted between urban and rural America. Now rural America, finally \nafter many years, gets its fair share.\n  When I first came to the Senate years ago, I realized just how hard \nit was for rural America to get a square deal, particularly in health \ncare. It was stunning. Every year since I have been here, I have been \nworking to try to get rural America a square deal compared with urban \nAmerica. I was part of an organization--and I still am--called the \nRural Medicare Caucus. In fact, I chaired it for a few years. Every \nyear I am here, I have--as I know my good friend from Montana, the \nPresiding Officer has--worked to help to make sure that rural parts of \nthe country are getting a fair deal. This is not rhetoric. This is \nreal. After all of these years, finally rural America gets a fair deal.\n  I also support this legislation and strongly advocate for its passage \nbecause it makes sure that senior citizens, wherever they live in our \ncountry, get a universal Medicare prescription drug benefit. Now, this \ncertainly is true in the first years after this legislation is \neffective, but it is also true in the future. It is also true when \npreferred provider organization plans are designed to come into effect. \nIt is also true in the year 2010 when in six regions of the country, \nthere may be demonstration projects selected to test a new system \ncalled premium support.\n  In all respects, all seniors in all parts of the country, in all \nyears, will have access to the same prescription drug benefit as any \nother senior, in any other part of the country, in any other year. This \nbill does not undermine traditional Medicare fee-for-service. The drug \nbenefit is universal and nationwide in all respects. The bill does not \nundermine traditional Medicare--that is, Part A and B--during the years \nin which it is in effect. In a few moments I will return to this and \nwill explain in greater detail.\n  This bill also very much helps address an issue that is on the minds \nof a lot of Senators--retiree coverage. When the bill was debated in \nthe Senate, the prediction was that companies, States, municipalities, \nand nonprofit organizations might drop their retiree coverage because \nthe bill, when passed, would provide government drug benefits to \nseniors. The thinking was why should companies not just go ahead and \ndrop their retiree coverage.\n  Well, when the Senate took up this legislation, the CBO, which is the \norganization we rely upon for estimates, said that the drop rate might \nbe about 37 percent. Since then, they have revised their numbers and \nthey have come up with other figures. In short, if one compares apples \nwith apples, the conference report that will soon be before this body \nresults in a retiree droppage rate that is about 50 percent less than \nthe bill that passed this body by a vote of 76 to 21. Maybe it is 45 \npercent. Stop and think about that for a moment.\n  For Senators who voted for the Senate bill, they can be comforted and \nrelieved that retiree droppage rate is estimated by CBO to be about \nhalf of what it was in the Senate bill.\n\n  Let's focus a little bit on the retiree provisions. Essentially, \ncompanies receive about $88 billion under this bill for their retiree \nbenefits. The net effect is that it will discourage companies from \ndropping--not encourage droppage. We all are very concerned that \ncompanies across America are beginning to cut back, and have cut back, \non the number of retirees who have health care benefits or on the \nnature of the benefits. It is happening in America. It is happening in \nAmerica as the world becomes even more competitive with global \ncompetition and as companies strive to cut down on their costs to \nincrease their profit margins. One of the ways they can do so is cut \nback on employee and retiree benefits. This is happening. We know it is \nhappening.\n  This legislation tends to discourage companies from cutting back. It \ntends to help companies keep coverage. It discourages dropping retiree \ncoverage--it does not accelerate it. Again, it is because of the \nadditional dollars that are going to companies. The companies still get \nthe tax deduction for their health benefit plans. That is unchanged. In \naddition, under this legislation, the payments to the companies for \nretiree coverage are tax free. One could even say perhaps there is a \nlittle double-dipping because the assistance is tax free. This is a \ntremendous additional financial benefit to companies, to nonprofits, to \ncities, and other plans to encourage them to keep their coverage. It is \na bonus. It is an incentive. This is another reason passage of this \nlegislation is important--because it helps companies keep their retiree \nhealth plans. As a result, employers\n\n[[Page S15375]]\n\nwill tend less to drop retiree coverage. They will probably tend to \nmaintain and increase it.\n  There is also a myth about this bill that is there is a coverage gap \non prescription drug coverage that will leave seniors out in the cold. \nWell, the truth about this so-called donut hole gap is the majority of \nseniors will never reach the spending level where they would not have \ncoverage. Even more important, seniors who are low-income get full \ncoverage in the benefit gap.\n  Of course, we wish we had more money to give a complete benefit to \neveryone without any donut hole, but we do not have an infinite number \nof dollars. We only have $400 billion. It sounds like a lot, and it is \na lot, but if we are going to give a universal drug benefit to seniors \nthat is honest, that makes sense, that does something, not over the top \nbut that makes sense for all seniors, it would cost a lot more than \n$400 billion. We have limited ourselves to $400 billion, and at $400 \nbillion there are going to be some people who will not get quite the \nsame benefit as other people, but they will all get the benefit.\n  I might add that if we looked at each State, the number of seniors \nwho have coverage for prescription drugs varies. In some States it is \nvery high. In some States it is low. Compare that with the passage of \nthis bill, every State gets about 96.6 percent. That is virtually 100-\npercent coverage. That is a big improvement.\n  Let's take the State of Delaware, for example. I know the Senators \nfrom Delaware know their State a lot better than I. Today, about 27 \npercent of seniors in Delaware have no drug coverage. Only 3.4 percent \nwill be without coverage once this bill is enacted. Let me restate this \npositively; 27 percent of seniors in Delaware today do not have drug \ncoverage. When this bill passes, virtually every Delawarean will have \ndrug coverage.\n  The same is true of the State of California. Now about 21 percent of \nCalifornia's seniors and disabled live without prescription drug \nbenefits. This bill will reduce this number to 5 percent. Again, most \nseniors, in California and in every other State, would benefit as a \nconsequence of this legislation.\n  I would like to address some concerns others have raised regarding \nthis bill. The concerns are that this legislation undermines \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare--that this is the beginning of \nundermining Medicare, the camel's nose under the tent. This is the \ncharge.\n  What are the facts? The bottom line: Fee-for-service Medicare, \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare as we know it today, is held \nharmless under this bill. This is the bottom line. So if you are a \nsenior in the United States of America you can decide that you want to \nkeep traditional Medicare and that you do not want to join a private \nplan--any of the plans that may or may not exist in the future. That \nis, it is voluntary. A senior can either join or not join. It depends \non what he or she wants to do. It is an honest choice because fee-for-\nservice traditional Medicare remain what it is today. It is held \nharmless. That is, the deductible doesn't change, the copay doesn't \nchange, the benefits don't change. What exists today is what exists \nunder this legislation. I hope Senators listen to that. I hope staffs \nof Senators listen to that. I hope the others who are listening, who \nare concerned about the bill, listen to that.\n  Let me explain this in greater detail. The bill finally provides a \nprescription drug benefit for senior citizens. We have had this \nopportunity many times in the past. We now have the chance to seize \nthis opportunity. The bill also makes some changes in the general \nMedicare structure in terms of setting up some health care plans in the \nfuture, assuming the plans actually take shape, form, and come into \nexistence. They don't exist today. I am referring to regional PPOs; \nthat is, regional preferred provider organizations. They don't exist \ntoday. There are other managed care companies called HMOs in many \ncities. They exist in the cities primarily because they can cherry-pick \ncounties. They can pick the counties in which they want to provide \nservice, and if they do not want to pick one county because it is less \nprofitable, they do not have to. If they want to serve another county \nbecause it is more profitable for them, they do. This is the way HMOs \noperate today. This is the system today.\n  This legislation says, beginning in the year 2006, our country will \nbe divided up into various regions. Insurance companies will be allowed \nto offer Medicare services, including drugs, in any of the regions. The \nquestion remains, What about traditional fee-for-service? What happens \nto traditional fee-for-service in an area where a company sets up a \nplan? What if one wants to remain in traditional Medicare? The answer \nis, fee-for-service is held harmless. There is no change in fee-for-\nservice.\n  If regional PPOs serve a region, it has to serve the entire region. \nIt can't choose this part of this State and that part of that State. It \nhas to serve the entire region--people in the cities, people in the \nrural parts of that region. Everybody has to get the same deal.\n  The senior living in one of these regions has a choice. The senior \ncan stay in traditional fee-for-service Medicare or can join the plan. \nBut fee-for-service Medicare is held harmless. There is no change to \ntraditional Medicare.\n  Obviously, this does not undermine traditional Medicare as we know \nit. This bill builds up and strengthens Medicare. There are additional \ndollars here for hospitals, for doctors, for providers who will provide \ntraditional Medicare. So this bill does not in any way undermine \ntraditional fee for service. In fact, Medicare is held harmless under \nthis legislation.\n\n  Some people say: That's OK, Max, we understand that, but what we are \nreally concerned about is the so-called premium support demonstration \nareas. Their argument is, in those areas, traditional fee-for-service \nis undermined. Private plans will pull away seniors, and it will be \nunfair to seniors who remain in Medicare. It is the beginning of the \ndemise of traditional fee-for-service Medicare, they argue.\n  That is not true. It is nonsense. Look at the facts. Look at what is \nin the legislation.\n  Let me just remind Senators that this legislation is now available \nfor Senators to look at. Thank goodness, because when they look at it, \nthey are going to see what is and is not included. I just ask Senators \nto trust me long enough to suspend judgment on it so they can go look \nat the legislation and make up their own minds. That is what the \nSenators are supposed to do--make up their own minds. I am urging \nSenators to suspend judgment for a little while, listen to what I am \nsaying, because I think when they do look at the legislation, they will \nsee that what I am saying is true. But you do not have to take it on my \naccount. Just please do not make up your minds until you read what is \nactually in the legislation. You will see, even in the supposed premium \nsupport demos, and there might be up to six cities in the country, that \nfee-for-service Medicare is held harmless. There is no change in fee-\nfor-service in any respect, deductibles and on--except for one. That \none possible change is the Part B premium.\n  However, this legislation ensures that seniors who happen to live in \none of the six demonstration areas can keep the same fee-for-service \nMedicare. If it happens that your Part B premium goes up as a result of \nthe demonstration--it may or may not go up--but if it does, the \nlegislation says there can be no more than a 5 percent increase on your \nPart B premium. This is the only possible way a senior citizen could be \nadversely affected in these demonstration projects.\n  Another point regarding these demonstrations. I have heard various \nfigures that the demos are going to affect 10 million fee-for-service \nbeneficiaries. We have all heard the 10 million figure. It is what some \nSenators suggest.\n  It is not true; it is untrue.\n  How many seniors might possibly be affected? Let's get an unbiased, \nobjective opinion.\n  We asked the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office: Mr. CBO, what is \nthe answer? How many seniors may potentially be in an area where they \nwould be faced with a choice, stay in fee-for-service Medicare or join \none of these premium support organizations? How many could be adversely \naffected? The answer is not 10 million. CBO says: We think it is \nbetween 670,000 and 1 million. 10 million is the figure of scare \nrhetoric. The actual facts are 670,000 to 1 million.\n  There are many other instances where there is a lot of rhetoric \nfloating\n\n[[Page S15376]]\n\naround. But if you look at the facts, if you read the legislation that \nis now available, you will find it is really good legislation and all \nthese worries and exaggerated claims about the bill are just not true.\n  I have a couple of additional points regarding premium support. It is \na time-limited demonstration. It exists only for 6 years, starting in \n2010. It would take an act of Congress to change it, an act to expand \nit. It cannot be extended or expanded by the Secretary or anybody else.\n  Fact No. 2, the demonstration will only affect limited areas of the \ncountry--up to six areas of the country only.\n  Fact No. 3, low-income beneficiaries are totally protected in any of \nthese areas where premium support might occur.\n  Facts No. 4 and No. 5. There is no requirement for beneficiaries to \nenroll in the private plans. None. There is no inducement to enroll in \nany of these plans unless the plan happens to be a lot better than \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare which this bill strengthens.\n  How does this bill undermine traditional fee-for-service Medicare? \nHow?\n  The fact is, it doesn't.\n  I will close by saying this is a good bill. It provides prescription \ndrug benefits for seniors. Seniors need and deserve this help. It \nprovides $400 billion of help. We are not going to have this \nopportunity again. It is true that this bill is not perfect. But I \nthink on the whole it is a very good. This bill is much closer to the \nSenate bill than it is to the House bill. It is about one-quarter away \nfrom the Senate bill. It is about three-quarters away from the House \nbill. Seventy-six Senators voted for the Senate bill. I think that the \n76 Senators who voted for the Senate bill will find that in many \nrespects, this bill is better than the Senate bill they supported. \nAdditionally, when my colleagues look at the facts of this bill, they \nare going to find that this is pretty good legislation. It is something \nwe should pass.\n  I hope people will look at the actual language and look at the facts \nand will support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief. My colleague from Oregon \nand I wish to mention only briefly the health bill which was passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15376-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, my colleague from Oregon is on the Senate \nfloor. We thought for a few moments we would talk about something that \njust passed the Senate which we think is landmark forestry legislation. \nIt has come in several forms over the last year and a half. But we here \nin the Senate call it Healthy Forests. The President calls it Healthy \nForests.\n  The House and Senate have worked together over the last year to try \nto resolve an issue that the American public has seen in the form of \ndevastating wildfires across our public land and forests for the last \nseveral years. Of course, we watched the tragedy of San Bernadino in \nsouthern California and the greater Los Angeles area just in the last \nmonth and a half that was truly devastating not only to 3,700 homes and \nhuman life but hundreds of thousands of acres of wildlife habitat and \nwatershed.\n  Clearly, as chairman of the Forestry Subcommittee of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, Senator Wyden and I have been working for \nthe last several years to resolve this issue. My colleague from Oregon \nis the ranking member of that Forestry Subcommittee. We have known that \nthe team effort in a bipartisan way to resolve this issue would produce \na resolution. The answer is that it has.\n  The Senate and the House just passed a conference report that has our \nfingerprints all over it. Frankly, we are mighty proud of it. It moves \nus in the right direction of active management of these dead and dying, \nbug-infested, and drought-impacted forested areas that are creating \nphenomenal fuel loads that the American public has seen played out in \nwildfires across our western public land and forests for the last good \nnumber of years. It is a clear step in the right direction. It is a \ncautious step. We certainly do not take away the right of appeal, but \nwe limit it.\n  We don't want an effort on the part of the Forest Service to do what \nwe asked them to do to be tied up in the courts endlessly in many \ninstances as it has been over the last several years. We also want them \nto be selective. We targeted most of our efforts in what we call the \nwildland- urban interface which will impact most of those forested \nareas where there is a substantial human presence in the form of homes \nand, obviously, communities.\n  At the same time, we also recognize that the problem exists elsewhere \nacross our forested landscape. We allow that treatment of those areas \nwith caution.\n  We have designated old growth definitions for protection. We have \nalso limited it in the next decade to 20 million acres. For those \ncritics who would suggest that this is a ``ticket to log,'' that is \npurely political rhetoric to solve a political constituency problem \nthat they have because they can't justify anymore the phenomenal loss \nof wildlife and watershed and habitat that we have seen over the last 4 \nor 5 years.\n  It is a cautious approach. It is certainly going to be limited in \ncharacter. Why? Because we want to prove to the American people that \nthere is a way to manage our forests in a right and reasonable fashion; \nthat it does not do what we did historically 40 years ago--logged by \nclear-cut or logged with substantial problems of erosion and watershed \ndegradation and all of that.\n  This is a new day. We want to treat our forests differently. But we \nalso understand that if we don't do something, our forestry experts \nhave told us that we could see devastating wildfires for decades to \ncome that will destroy the watershed, the wildlife habitat, and release \nhuge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere; and, oh, yes, by the way, \ndestroy a very valuable resource in the form of timber that might in \nsome areas be allowed for logging or for reasonable approaches of \ncommercial value of the thinning and cleaning.\n  All of that said, we have worked hard to produce a bill. My colleague \nfrom Oregon is on the Senate floor. I will yield to him for any \ncomments he would want to make. We have other colleagues here who I \nthink are going to address the issue of prescription drugs and Medicare \nreform.\n  But today is an important day in the Senate in the area of forestry \nand forest and public land management. I am proud of the work we have \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I want to \ncommend Senator Craig. He and I have been working with Senator \nFeinstein in particular on this legislation in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. We have really been a triumvirate with respect to \nthis issue.\n  I am so pleased to have a chance to be on the Senate floor today to \nspeak on this conference report. This is the first forest management \nbill to pass both Houses in the U.S. Congress in 27 years. The fact is, \nthe forestry legislation that is now on its way to the President of the \nUnited States will protect our communities. It will offer the first \nlegal protection for old-growth trees, and it will create jobs.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, just noted, this \nlegislation came together because at every stage of the process \nSenators said we want to get beyond the old rhetoric. We want to get \nbeyond the polarization that has dominated this issue in the past, and \nwe want to, in particular, take meaningful action to protect our \ncommunities.\n  That is what this legislation has been all about. The fires in the \nWest, as the Senator from Idaho has known through his field hearings \nand other such sectors, have literally be infernos. We just felt it was \ncritical to take steps to ensure that the rural West wouldn't be \nsacrificed.\n  I am proud today to rise in support of the conference report on H.R. \n1904. This conference report is based upon the Senate-based wildfire \nbill compromise\n\n[[Page S15377]]\n\nbrokered by Senators Feinstein, Craig, Cochran, Domenici and myself \npassed by the Senate on October 30. With the good faith efforts of \nRepresentatives Pombo, Goodlatte, and my friend and colleague from \nOregon, Representative Walden, this conference report has made only \nminor changes to the Senate approved version. This legislation will get \nus back on track restoring forests, protecting the environment, and \nputting people back to work in rural communities.\n  This conference report is the first forest management bill to pass \nboth houses of the United States Congress in 27 years. The last time \nCongress was able to send a forest management bill to the President of \nthe United States, the President was Gerald Ford and it was the \nNation's bicentennial. The bill was the National Forest Management Act \nof 1976.\n  The world has changed a lot in the last 27 years. Forest management \nand forest-related economies have changed dramatically. Americans have \ngrown more interested in protecting the environment while using natural \nresources to support rural communities like those in my home state of \nOregon. The conference report we passed today reflects some of those \nchanges: it contains the first ever statutory recognition and \nmeaningful protection of old growth forests and large trees, while \nstreamlining a National Environmental Policy Act process that has \nseemed to favor paperwork over forest health.\n  This conference report will streamline restorative forestry in \nforests at risk of unnaturally catastrophic fires resulting from 100 \nyears of fire suppression. It provides the authorities and guidelines \nfor the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to treat unhealthy \nforests while preserving public input and protecting old growth it's a \ntruly balanced approach to forest health.\n  There were times when I was not sure this day would come. After the \nSenate passed our version of H.R. 1904 on October 30, 2003, there was \ndoubt and disagreement on how to proceed with the House of \nRepresentatives. As a solution to the gridlock threatening the final \npassage of wildfire legislation, Senator Feinstein and I proposed \ninformal meetings. The staffs of the two Houses reached the agreement \non Title I, the forest health title, through these informal meetings \nthat allowed for a formal conference on all the rest of the Titles. \nThat conference was held Thursday, November 20. I lost a couple of \nprovisions for Oregon that I cared deeply about. But, I am overall \npleased that the forest health provisions worked out so diligently by \nboth Houses were preserved intact.\n  The Senate said there were four features that were particularly \nimportant to us to maintain in the legislation.\n  First, we said we have to have the funding to do the job right. We \nare not going to get this work done without funding to get this work \ndone on the ground. I am very pleased with the conference report in \nthat it keeps that funding intact. I am very pleased that the \nconference report will authorize $760 million annually for the \nprojects, a $340 million increase over current funding. It also ensures \nthat we spend the money in the right place. That is in the area known \nas the wildland/urban interface. The Senate took one approach, the \nHouse had other ideas. With some very minor tweaking, this, too, was \npreserved in terms of the work done by the Senate.\n  On the old-growth part of the legislation, I am especially pleased \nbecause all Americans value these unique treasures, our very large old-\ngrowth trees. Professor Jerry Franklin of the University of Washington \nis considered the leading authority on this subject. He says our \nprovisions with respect to old growth are a major step forward. I \nam particularly pleased and honored to have Dr. Franklin's comments on \nthis. He is the authority, as Chairman Craig knows, on this subject. \nFor those who have followed the environmental aspects of the forestry \nlegislation, let the word go out that Professor Jerry Franklin from the \nUniversity of Washington, one of the most distinguished scholars in \nthis field--not just now but at any time--believes this is a \nsignificant step forward in terms of environmental protection.\n\n  We were able to protect the public involvement aspect of forestry \npolicy. Citizens all across this country--whether in Senator Dodd's \npart of the world in Connecticut or any other part of the country--feel \npassionately about their natural resources and want to be involved in \nthe debate over this process. As Senator Craig has noted, we have \nstreamlined the process but we have preserved every single opportunity \nfor the public to comment. Every opportunity that exists today, for the \npublic to comment on forestry legislation, has been preserved in this \nbipartisan compromise.\n  Finally, the Senate conferees did very well at defending the Senate \ncompromise. The Senate kept the number one issue the environmental \ncommunity was concerned about off the table and preserved the Senate \ncompromise position on judicial process. In negotiating this bill, I \ndid not accept the notion that any special deference beyond the \ndeference that is ordinarily due should be given to any agency \ndeterminations under the Act, except where explicitly provided in the \nstatute's text. In fact, the conference report expressly rejected the \nHouse bill's language giving special deference to agency \ndeterminations.\n  This section, section 106 of Title I, limits venue for these \nhazardous fuels reduction cases exclusively to the district court for \nthe district in which the federal land to be treated is located. It \nalso encourages expedited review of jurisdictional and substantive \nissues leading to resolution of cases as soon as practicable. In \naddition, this section limits the duration of any injunctions and stays \npending appeal to 60 days and provides an opportunity to renew an \ninjunction and stay pending appeal. It also requires the parties to the \naction to present updated information regarding the status of the \nauthorized hazardous fuel reduction project in connection with such \ninjunction and stay renewals. This last provision is intended to \nprovide an incentive and opportunity for the parties to the complaint \nto work together to resolve their differences or explain to the judge \nwhy that is not possible over time.\n  This section also directs the courts to balance the impact to the \necosystem likely affected by the project of the short- and long-term \neffects of undertaking the agency action, against the short- and long-\nterm effects of not undertaking the agency action. There can be \nenvironmental risks associated with both management action and \ninaction. America is acutely aware that the past few fire seasons have \nbeen among the worst in modern history in terms of effects on natural \nresources, people and private property. Air pollution problems are \nrising and wildland fires have forced thousands to evacuate. In 2002 in \none state alone, Colorado, 77,000 residents were evacuated for periods \nof a few days to several weeks. Seventeen thousand people in Oregon's \nIllinois Valley were on half-hour evacuation notice the same year. In \n2002, millions of dollars of property damage included the destruction \nof over 2300 homes and other buildings. It is becoming increasingly \nevident that while one cannot uncut a tree, similarly one cannot unburn \na forest. In hazardous fuel reduction projects it is important to focus \non the removal of the right vegetation to modify fire behavior--\nprimarily surface and ladder fuels.\n  At the same time, there can also be adverse environmental \nconsequences of hazardous fuel reduction projects, including but not \nlimited to loss of wildlife habitat, increased sedimentation in \nstreams, soil compaction, and fragmenting of unroaded areas. As \ndocumented by the General Accounting Office, poorly designed vegetation \ntreatments in the past have contributed to increased fire risk by \nremoving the large and fire resistant trees, while leaving highly \nflammable smaller trees behind.\n  This Act is intended to foster prompt and sound decision making \nrather than perfectly executed procedures and documentation. \nEnvironmental analyses should concentrate on issues that are essential \nto the proposed projects rather than on amassing needless detail. \nSection 106 is intended to reinforce Congress's desire that the \ntotality of circumstances be assessed by the courts to assure that \npublic interest in the environmental health of our forests will be \nserved.\n  Let me be more specific about a few of the other provisions of this \nlegislation. The Senate also prevailed in\n\n[[Page S15378]]\n\nkeeping the Senate funding requirements and levels, preserving the \nSenate NEPA language on at-risk lands outside the wildland urban \ninterface; preserving the Senate old growth and large tree protections, \nand preserving the Senate administrative appeals process.\n  The legislation changes the environmental review process so the \nForest Service still considers the effects of the proposed project in \ndetail, but can focus its analysis on the project proposal, one \nreasonable alternative that meets the project's goals and the \nalternative of not doing the project, instead of the 5-9 alternatives \nnow often required. In the highest priority areas within one mile and a \nhalf of communities, the Forest Service need only study the proposed \naction and no alternatives. There is no relaxation from current law in \nany areas, however, in how closely the Forest Service must study the \nenvironmental effects of the project it is proposing to undertake.\n\n  The changes that were made to the Senate compromise on H.R. 1904 \ninclude more relief and respect for rural forested communities. This \nconference report allows a single action alternative to be analyzed \nunder the National Environmental Policy Act inside the wildland urban \ninterface defined as 1.5 miles from the community boundary. Within the \narea identified for protection as the wildland urban interface under a \ncommunity fire plan, the agency is not required to analyze the ``no \naction'' alternative under NEPA, but is required to analyze two action \nalternatives. This conference report also limits the treatment of \ndiseased forests to those with epidemics, whereas the Senate compromise \nallowed the treatment of forests with only an infestation of bugs.\n  This conference report preserves all current opportunities for public \ninput and appeal, while streamlining the appeals process and \neliminating some of its worst abuses. Not one current opportunity for \npublic comment would be lost under the compromise. The compromise will \nrequire the Forest Service to rewrite their appeals process using the \npre-decisional appeals and comment process that has been used by the \nBureau of Land Management since 1984. It works by encouraging the \npublic to engage in a collaborative process with the agency to improve \nprojects before final decisions have been rendered upon them by the \nagency. This model places a premium on constructive public input and \ncollaboration, and less emphasis on the litigation and confrontation of \nthe post-decisional appeals process currently used by the Forest \nService. The compromise is designed to move from the current model of \nconfrontation, litigation and delay to one which places a premium on \nconstructive, good faith public input. Whereas in the past, parties \ncould ``sandbag'' the appeals process by not raising salient points in \nhopes of later derailing the entire proposed action in the courts, \nparties would not be allowed to litigate on issues they had failed to \nraise in the comment or appeal period unless those issues or critical \ninformation concerning them arose after the close of the appeals \nprocess--as a result of the revised agency decision.\n  This conference report provides the first-ever statutory recognition \nand meaningful protection of old growth forests. Never before has \nCongress recognized by statute the importance of maintaining old growth \nstands. Under the compromise, the Forest Service must protect these \ntrees by preventing the agency from logging the most fire-resilient \ntrees under the guise of fuels reduction under these new authorities.\n  The issue of old growth continues to be the subject of considerable \nscientific inquiry and debate. What is not subject to debate is the \nspecial character and ecological value of old growth. Clearly, it is \nthe intent of Congress that in interpreting the provisions of section \n102(e), federal agencies affirmatively recognize the special importance \nof old growth forests while maintaining the deference they are due \nunless their determinations are arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of \ndiscretion.\n  This legislation is designed to address past mismanagement of federal \nforests, and to protect old-growth so that we don't repeat the mistakes \nof the past. The majority of old-growth stands are healthy, and don't \nrequire management. In some old-growth stands in the drier parts of the \nwest, where natural fire regimes have been disrupted by a century of \nfire suppression, silviculture with a minimum of disturbance can be \nappropriate that will restore natural forest structure and fire \nregimes.\n  Where old growth stands are healthy, as they are throughout much of \nthe forest on the west side of the Cascade Ridge in Oregon, the \ncompromise requires that they be ``fully maintained.'' Section 102(e) \nof the conference addresses the treatment by the Forest Service and \nBureau of Land Management of old growth stands that may occur on \nauthorized hazardous fuels treatment projects. Since recently issued \nresource management plans of the two agencies are supposed to provide \nguidance on the treatment of old growth Section 102(e) directs the \nagencies to rely on the old growth definitions contained in resource \nmanagement plans that were established in the ten-year period prior to \nthe enactment of the legislation.\n  Older plans must be reviewed, and if necessary, revised and updated, \nto take into account relevant information that was not considered in \ndeveloping the existing definitions or other direction relating to old \ngrowth. Any revision or update must meet the requirements of subsection \n102(e)(2), which requires the Secretary, in carrying out authorized \nhazardous fuels treatment projects, to fully maintain, or contribute \ntoward the restoration of, the structure and composition of \nstructurally complex old growth stands according to the pre-fire \nsuppression old growth conditions characteristic of the forest type, \ntaking into account the contribution of the stand to landscape fire \nadaptation and watershed health, and retaining the large trees \ncontributing to old growth structure. Nothing in the bill is intended \nto prohibit or restrict establishing other standards for old growth \nstands where purposes other than hazardous fuel management are being \npursued under other authorities.\n  The intent of section 102(e)(4) is to avoid disrupting resource \nmanagement plan revisions that are already underway. Comprehensive \nrevision of older resource management plans may be preferable to \nseparate amendments or updates for old growth standards, and the bill \nallows additional time for operating under older plans where revisions \nare in progress.\n  In negotiating this bill, I did not agree to the imposition of any \nmore restrictive standards than the ``substantial supporting evidence'' \nexplicitly set forth in the statute for members of the public's \nidentification of old growth stands during scoping in subsection \n102(e)(4)(C).\n\n  The compromise makes it less likely that old growth will be harvested \nunder current law by mandating the retention of large trees and \nfocusing the hazardous fuels reduction projects authorized by this bill \non thinning small diameter trees.\n  In moving this legislation, it was my intent to see that the right \nwork get done in the right way in the right place using the right \ntools. In other words, to see that the risk of catastrophic fire is \nreduced through legitimate hazardous fuel reduction activities.\n  These activities are referenced in Section 101(2) of the bill and are \nspelled out in detail in the Implementation Plan for the Comprehensive \nStrategy for a Collaborative Approach for Reducing Wildland Fire Risk \nto Communities and the Environment, dated May 2002. That document lists \nthe following tools as being appropriate for hazardous fuel reduction: \nprescribed fire, wildland fire use, and various mechanical methods such \nas crushing, tractor and hand piling, thinning, and pruning.\n  In other words, this bill does not authorize a new wave of large tree \ncommercial timber sales. It must be noted that the bill emphasizes the \navoidance of the cutting of large trees in Section 102(f), where it \nspecifically states that protects must focus largely on small diameter \ntrees, thinning, strategic fuelbreaks and prescribed fire to modify \nfire behavior and that projects maximize the retention of large trees.\n  Section 104(f) requires the agencies to focus on small diameter \ntrees, thinning, fuel breaks and prescribed fire to modify unnaturally \nsevere fire effects, and to maximize the retention of large trees. \nLarge trees are important ecological components of most forest systems. \nIn particular, they are often more fire and insect resistant\n\n[[Page S15379]]\n\nthan smaller diameter trees, and therefore, with rare exceptions do not \ncontribute to hazardous fuels overloads. They are also considered to be \ncritical ecological legacies because they are essential to the desired \nfuture structure and composition of forests. However, large trees are \nnow often underrepresented components of many forest types. In those \nforest types, forest health will not be restored without a diversity of \nage classes and types, including large trees.\n  Section 102(f) deals with federal agency treatment of large trees in \nauthorized hazardous fuels treatment projects outside of the areas \nidentified under section 102(e) and requires the Forest Service and \nBureau of Land management to maximize the retention of large trees, as \nappropriate for the forest type, to the extent that the trees promote \nfire-resilient stands. From an ecological standpoint, and in regards to \nmodifying future fire behavior, large trees are the very last ones that \nshould be removed, if at all.\n  This is an appropriate limitation in that the last trees that need to \nbe removed from an ecological sense, as well as to modify fire \nbehavior, are the large trees. The clear intent of this legislation is \nto focus primarily on surface fuels such as brush and dead and down \nwoody material and ladder fuels consisting of small diameter trees and \nsaplings.\n  This direction is very important to me and I intend on remaining \nvigilant and responsive to concerns where projects veer from this \nimportant direction.\n  This conference report restores balance to healthy forests \nlegislation by authorizing $760 million annually for these projects. \nThis is a $340 million authorized increase over the currently \nappropriated level of $420 million for hazardous fuel reduction \nprojects. The conference report maintains the requirement that at least \n50 percent of funds spent on restorative projects to be spent to \nsafeguard communities which face the greatest risks from fire.\n  This conference report also includes improved monitoring language \nthat will help Congress track the successes and failures of this \nlegislation. Section 104(g) requires the Secretaries to monitor and \nassess the results of authorized projects and to report on the progress \nof projects towards forest health objectives. This evaluation and \nreporting will help guide the agencies in future hazardous fuels \nreduction treatments in existing project areas and in other project \nareas with similar vegetation types.\n  The Senate intends that treatments authorized under this Act be \ndirected to restoration of fire-adapted ecosystems as well as hazard \nreduction. The threat of uncharacteristically severe fires and insect \nand disease outbreaks decreases when the structure and composition of \nfire-adapted ecosystems are restored to historic conditions. Thus, \nsection 104(g)(4) directs agencies to evaluate, among other things, \nwhether authorized projects result in conditions that are closer to the \nrelevant historical structure, composition and fire regime.\n  The Senate recognizes that fire ecologists have learned that fire is \na landscape process and that treatments are most effective when \nconducted in accordance with landscape- or watershed-scale analyses. \nSection 104(g)(4) requires the agencies to evaluate project results in \nlight of any existing landscape--or watershed--scale direction in \nresource management plans or other applicable guidance or requirements. \nManagers should also evaluate and use available relevant scientific \nstudies or findings.\n  Section 104(g) also requires the Secretaries, in areas where \nsignificant interest is expressed, to establish a multiparty monitoring \nand evaluation process in order to assess the environmental and social \neffects of authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects and projects \nimplemented pursuant to section 404 of this Act. Many forest-dependent \ncommunities support multiparty monitoring, which simply means that \ncommunities and individuals may participate with the Federal agencies \nin monitoring the projects. The Managers recognize the importance of \nmultiparty monitoring as a way to rebuild trust between rural \ncommunities and the agencies.\n  In conclusion, we have a lot of work to do. We will have others raise \nquestions about the ramifications of this legislation as it relates to \nthe National Environmental Policy Act and other concerns. We want to \nget this done and implemented properly. As Chairman Craig and I have \nseen in the subcommittee on forestry, we know, for example, it will be \ntough to get all the funds that are going to be necessary to do these \nprojects on the ground. Our bipartisan coalition is committed to doing \nthat. Then we can turn our coalition to looking at other areas where we \ncan find common ground and move forward in the natural resources area.\n  A lot of people never thought we would get to this day. Look at the \neditorials that have been written, some of the interest groups with \nrespect to this legislation, and some of the attacks made on Members. I \nrecall some of those to which Senator Feinstein was subjected. She \nshowed the courage to make it clear she would hang in there and work to \nget this legislation enacted.\n  We had a lot of Members of the Senate on both side of the aisle say \nthey would put the public interests first, they would concentrate on \nprotecting communities. That is what has brought us to this day.\n  I want to thank the following Senate staff for all their hard work on \nthis important legislation: Lance Kotschwar and West Higginbothom of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee staff, Frank Gladics and Kira Finkler \nof the Senate Energy and Natural Resources staff, Calli Daly of Senator \nCraig's staff, John Watts of Senator Feinstein's staff and Sarah \nBittleman and Josh Kardon of my own staff. Josh Penry and Doug \nCrandall, staff from the House Resources Committee, did yeomen's work \nto get this bill to conference. These folks, and many others, put in \ncountless and numerous evenings and weekends into this bill and they \ndeserve our appreciation for their hard work and dedication.\n  This legislation will now go to the President's desk for his \nsignature. I look forward to that happening. Just this week it snowed \nin Oregon--the fire season has passed for another year but it will come \nagain next year as sure as the spring follows the winter. With this \nbill in place as law I am hopeful that we will be a bit better \nprepared.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15379-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15379-S15385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes and comment on the \nupcoming debate on Medicare. Let me begin by expressing my appreciation \nand my respect for those who have worked on this issue for a great deal \nof time. I have nothing but the highest admiration for my colleagues, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Breaux, Senator Kennedy, and \nothers who have spent a great deal of time over the last number of \nmonths trying to put together a proposal to provide Americans with a \ncomprehensive prescription drug benefit while not undermining the core \nprogram of Medicare which has served millions of Americans so well for \nthe past 38 years. Whatever other views I may have on this proposal, it \ndoes not diminish my respect for the efforts they have made to put this \nbill together. I begin on that note.\n  Let me state the obvious. I don't know of many other programs that \nhave enjoyed as widespread and as deep and profound a degree of support \nin our Nation's history as the Medicare Program. I cannot think of \nanother program which has done as much for as many people as Medicare \nhas over the past 38 years. When you look back at the statistics of the \npoor in America prior to 1965, without exception, the poorest group of \nAmericans were older Americans, our senior citizens. That was, of \ncourse, because they had left the labor force and to what extent they \nhad any coverage at all, it was usually lost upon their retirement. As \nhappens when people age, health problems often emerge, people become \nsicker and require more help. America could only watch as parents and \ngrandparents got sicker and poorer and faced great difficulty making \nends meet.\n  Through a very extensive and elaborate and lengthy debate, our \npredecessor Congress, both in this body and\n\n[[Page S15380]]\n\nin the House of Representatives, under the leadership of Lyndon Baines \nJohnson, in 1964, giants in this body, crafted the Medicare Program. In \nfact, President Johnson went to Missouri, to the home of Harry Truman, \nwho had been such a great advocate of universal health care, to sign \nthat historic piece of legislation into law. There have been a lot of \nother things we have done over the years, such as Title I of elementary \nand secondary education, that might come close--certainly Social \nSecurity--I suspect if we had to pick two programs this Government has \nfashioned in the 20th century that have meant as much to such a \ncritical part of our society, one would certainly have to identify \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  It is with that background that I rise this afternoon to express my \ndeep concern and worry over what we may be doing in the next few hours \nin a rather hasty manner. That does not mean to suggest that the \nconferees and others who have worked a long time on this have acted in \nhaste; although I disagree with their product, I respect the amount of \ntime and effort they have put into this. The Presiding Officer and this \nSenator are the only two Members present at this moment, and our \nability to go through this and to understand what is about to happen in \nthe coming days is rather limited.\n  Sometime tomorrow, Sunday, or Monday, but certainly no later than \nthat, we will be asked to vote up or down on a conference report that \ndoes something all Members have wanted to do for years--provide a \nprescription drug benefit for older Americans under the Medicare \nprogram. Knowing, as we all do, that had we been writing the Medicare \nbill in the year 2003 for the very first time, or several years ago, we \nwould never have considered a Medicare proposal without the inclusion \nof a prescription drug benefit. But those who wrote the bill in 1964 \nwere not confronted with the terribly high cost of prescribed \nmedicines. At that time, there simply were not that many pharmaceutical \nproducts out there, so prescription drugs were not as major a factor as \nthey are today. The idea of providing basic healthcare services was \nwhat originally drove Congress to enact the Medicare Program.\n  Obviously, the world has changed. So the need for a prescription drug \nbenefit today, given the tremendous costs our elderly face every single \nday across this country, where they literally, without any exception at \nall, are forced to make choices about whether or not to take the drugs \nthey have been prescribed, to have a meal, or to pare back on their \nprescriptions so as to spread them out over a longer period of time so \nthey will not have to go back in and pay for the drugs which they \ncannot afford, in which case they are not getting the full benefit of \nthe prescriptions because they are self-medicating themselves, and in \nmany cases can do far more harm than not taking a drug at all, as any \ngood doctor can tell you--that is the reality today fro millions of our \nsenior citizens.\n  It is my belief that if we were solely dealing with the prescription \ndrug benefit piece of this package, it would pass 98 to 2, maybe 100 to \n0. There is no doubt in my mind that would be the case. If that were \nthe only issue before the Senate, that would clearly be the outcome. \nAlthough I would quickly tell you there are parts of this prescription \ndrug benefit that could be drawn far more wisely and far more fairly in \nmany ways, I could not argue over the fact that a $400 billion \nappropriation over the next 10 years offered a good start.\n  But also just as quickly I would say to my colleagues, if we were \ndealing with the portion of this package dealing with the structural \nreform of Medicare, and they were standing alone just as I suggested a \nmoment ago if the prescription drug benefit package were standing \nalone, the parts of this package instituting structural changes to \nMedicare would not get 10 votes. I don't know of many people who would \nsupport a Medicare package that had the sections this bill does that \nwould so dramatically alter Medicare. The only reason it is getting any \nconsideration at all is that we have lured people into this on the \nprescription drug benefit aspects of this conference agreement.\n  So if you set that aside for a minute and begin to look at the \nstructural side of this, and understand how many years it originally \ntook to put together the Medicare program, what a difference it has \nmade in people's lives--when you consider the tremendous salvation this \nhas been to people--and then recognize the direction in which we are \nabout to go if this conference agreement is adopted--and I suspect it \nmay be--then it will not take long, in my view, when you will find what \nwe saw only a few years ago, with the Congress coming back in to \nreverse itself in 2006 or shortly thereafter when the provisions of \nthis bill go into place.\n  The more you look at the structural side of this particular proposal, \nthen the more people are going to be concerned about what they are \ndoing. So I applaud those who have worked on the prescription drug side \nof this bill. But I have great concerns about what this conference \nreport would do to the foundation of Medicare.\n  In June of this year, when S. 1 was before this Senate, I based my \nsupport for that measure on the belief that it offered a strong, though \nnot complete, first step towards ensuring prescription drug coverage \nfor America's seniors and strengthening the overall structure of the \nMedicare Program.\n  This conference report, I say with deep regret, can now be accurately \ncharacterized, in my view, as a misguided step down the wrong path. The \nagreement before us today will lead us down the path towards greater \nprivatization of Medicare, towards a greater burden on our States \ntrying to meet the needs of their own low-income senior citizens, and \ntowards an overall weakening of the Medicare Program.\n  A very simple way to describe this, as we look at the great success \nthe Medicare program has enjoyed over the past 38 years, is to remember \nthat this is a universal program. This program says to everybody who \nreaches a certain age, regardless of how healthy you are, or how \nwealthy you are, or how poor you are, or how sick you are, you can \nqualify and be a part of this Medicare Program. We are about to do \nsomething now that is going to say to those who are wealthier and \nhealthier, you can move off into private plans, in which case the only \nones who will be left within traditional Medicare are those who are \nless wealthy and those who are most sick.\n  Now, you do not have to have a Ph.D. in mathematics to understand \nwhat the outcome will be if this conference report is adopted. If \nMedicare becomes a program of poor, sicker people because wealthier, \nhealthier people have left, as I believe they will under this bill, \nthen you have just forced either a reduction of benefits or increased \ncosts for those under traditional Medicare--those who can least afford \nit.\n  There is no other outcome you can draw from that which we are about \nto do. That is the eventual outcome. It fundamentally changes and \nalters the basic concept that was part of the plan passed in 1965--its \nuniversality.\n  The underlying concept of wealthy, healthy people joining with \npoorer, sicker people--being together--has been the cornerstone of this \ntremendously successful program. When you begin to pick off those who \nare wealthier and healthier, for all the obvious reasons, into private \nplans, the sicker and poorer people will be left with either Medicare \nbenefits getting cut or premium costs going up. That is the sadly \npredictable outcome of this legislation, Mr. President.\n  Medicare is first and foremost a program to protect our Nation's \nseniors from the often insurmountable costs associated with securing \nquality health care services. Prior to its inception in 1965, as I \nmentioned, many seniors--the overwhelming majority, in fact--faced \nabject poverty as a result of skyrocketing health care costs. The \ncreation of the Medicare Program provided a critical safety net for \nthose seniors and allowed them to retain both their access to quality \nhealth care, as well as their financial security.\n  Earlier this year, and prior to the Senate's consideration of the \nunderlying legislation, I had the opportunity to convene a series of \nforums in my home State of Connecticut on health care issues in an \nattempt to frame the scope of this debate for them. At those forums, I \nheard from my constituents on many matters regarding health care. I \nheard from seniors who literally could not afford to fill \nprescriptions--and I know my colleagues have heard\n\n[[Page S15381]]\n\nthe same stories--called for by their doctors. I heard from elderly \nMedicare beneficiaries forced to choose between purchasing groceries or \nfilling their prescriptions. I heard from seniors who were forced to \nskip dosages of their medicines in an attempt to stretch their limited \nsupplies of these needed medicines. I heard from Medicare beneficiaries \nrequiring more than 10 prescribed medicines a day unable to afford even \nhalf of those prescriptions.\n\n  Clearly, what I heard from hundreds of my own constituents is their \ngrave concern over the present lack of a prescription drug benefit \nunder the Medicare Program.\n  When Medicare was first enacted, few could have envisioned the \ntremendous costs associated with prescription medicines. However, it is \nthe great need for prescription drug coverage under Medicare that was \nfirmly behind my initial support for S. 1. Sadly, however, the \nconference report before us simply does not go anywhere near far enough \nto provide sufficient coverage for prescription medicines for the great \nmajority of Medicare beneficiaries. That said, we cannot turn our backs \non what this bill would do for Medicare beneficiaries with severely \nlimited incomes. This bill says, if you make under $13,470, \nrepresenting 150 percent of the federal poverty level, then you will \nget real help under this bill. But if you make anything more than \n$13,470, which is what two-thirds of our seniors citizens do, then you \nare going to be offered little in the way of help under ths bill. That \nis why it is my belief the prescription drug benefit aspect of this \nbill should be greatly strengthened.\n  But I believe for most seniors that it is terribly unrealistic to \nsuggest that someone making more than $13,470 can somehow manage to \nafford the cost of their prescription medicines, particularly if they \nhave costs that would push their spending into the bill's gap in \ncoverage, or donut hole, as it is often described. But, nonetheless, \nthat is the direction we are going with this conference agreement.\n  The emerging bill contains a gap, as I mentioned, of more than \n$2,800, twice the size, by the way, contained in the Senate-passed \nlegislation. Under this conference agreement, Medicare beneficiaries \nwith costs within this so-called donut hole will be forced to pay for \nthe full cost of their prescribed medicines as well as the monthly \npremium of an estimated $35--and I stress the word ``estimated''; I \nwill get to that in a minute--and receive absolutely no financial \nassistance whatsoever.\n  Only 4 percent of seniors in the country make over $80,000 a year. \nTwo-thirds of seniors make somewhere above $13,470. The idea that \nsomehow people are going to have enough money, as a senior, trying to \npay a home mortgage or pay whatever obligations they have, not to \nmention food and other things, and also be able to pick up as much as \n$2,800 a year for prescription drugs, is, I think, terribly \nunrealistic.\n  This bill would require Medicare to move dangerously toward \nprivatization, which is what I want to get back to, because it is the \nside of this bill calling for structural change to the Medicare program \nthat causes me the greatest concern and greatest worry, and undermines \nthis incredibly fine program. I can't tell you how disappointed I am in \nthe AARP for endorsing this conference agreement. I truly wish that \nAARP's affiliates across the country had been heard on this issue \nbefore their national leadership decided that they would support this \nbill and disregard the 38 years of history when it comes to Medicare \nand the millions of people who have greatly benefitted from its \ncoverage.\n  As one who has witnessed firsthand the tumult and confusion created \nby Medicare+Choice organizations entering and then quickly withdrawing \nfrom communities in my home State of Connecticut, I can say assuredly \nto my colleagues here today that this would establish a dangerous \nprecedent that may very well lead to the devolution of the Medicare \nProgram as we know it.\n  Also of great concern to me is the effect this legislation will have \non employers that have already provided their retirees with \nprescription drug coverage. In my State of Connecticut, more than \n225,000 Medicare beneficiaries, fully one-third of my State's senior \ncitizens, receive coverage for their prescribed medicines from their \nformer employers. Under this bill, about 40,000 of those elderly will \nlose this coverage as a result of employers dropping their prescription \ndrug plans.\n  I don't know the numbers in every other State, but if 40,000 of my \n225,000 beneficiaries presently with prescription drug plans from their \nformer employers are going to be dropped from their prescription drug \nprograms, how many in other States are going to be? Where do the States \nof other Senators fall in this category?\n  I additionally have another 74,000 people in my State--and I \nrepresent a small State with a little more than 3.5 million people--who \nqualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. These beneficiaries--and there \nare 6.4 million of them across the country that are eligible for both \nMedicare and Medicaid--will face increased prescription drug costs \nunder the underlying bill. There will be a significant cost increase \nfor those people who fall within both Medicare and Medicaid if this \nconference report is adopted. So even before we start talking about \nwhat will happen in the year 2010 and down the road under this bill, \nMr. President, we are going to witness significant numbers of people \nlose their present coverage or be forced to withstand both higher costs \nand diminished benefits.\n  Also very troubling to this Senator in the underlying conference \nagreement is its unqualified support for private for-profit insurers at \nthe expense of traditional fee-for-service programs. Particularly \ndisturbing are the provisions securing $12 billion to be solely \nreserved for these private insurers in order to entice them to enter \nthe Medicare market. Twelve billion dollars is going to the private \ncompanies, just so they can compete against the traditional Medicare \nprogram. They are calling this competition. Back in the Roman Empire, \nthey had a competition like that. You would go to the forum and on one \nside were the lions. Under this bill is a similar situation, private \ninsurers will get $12 billion to compete, but Medicare will not get \nanything. Under this bill, we are going to cap Medicare spending and \nthen say: Go out and compete against enriched private plans.\n  I was born at night, Mr. President, but not last night. I know and \nmost other people know, without a great deal more knowledge about this, \nthat if you provide $12 billion, as this bill does, to private \ncompanies to go out and compete against a company that doesn't get that \nkind of help, do you know who is going to win that competition? I \nwonder. I wonder what the outcome will be there. Yet that is what this \nbill does. Twelve billion dollars reserved for private insurers in \norder to entice them to enter the Medicare market. The inclusion of \nthis provision truly represents a solution in need of a problem, Mr. \nPresident. Traditional Medicare already serves 89 percent of all \nMedicare beneficiaries and the addition of $12 billion to entice \nprivate plan participation is wholly unwarranted and unnecessary.\n  In fact, this bill will also prohibit the Medicare program from going \nout and forming a consortium to drive down the cost of prescription \ndrugs. Under this bill, you are violating the law if you go out and do \nthat. While we are going to provide $12 billion instead to others to \nallow them to compete with Medicare, we will not allow Medicare itself \nto go out and lobby or negotiate to lower the costs of prescription \nmedicines. The traditional Medicare Program is a proven success and \nwould be better served if this valuable funding of $12 billion were \ndirected toward further strengthening its foundation.\n  Lastly, the conference agreement before us today establishes the \ndangerous precedent of instituting so-called cost containment measures \nthat could directly lead to severe cuts in what Medicare covers and \njust as severe increases in the costs Medicare beneficiaries will be \nforced to bear. Very specifically, the conference report calls on the \nCongress and the administration to address Medicare's costs when \ngeneral revenue spending on Medicare reaches 45 percent of the \nprogram's total cost.\n\n  Can anyone cite for me any other Federal agency where that kind of \nprovision has been imposed? There is not one--not one. Yet this bill \ngoes out and places this kind of a restraint on Medicare, and on no \nother part of our Government do we do it, only on Medicare.\n\n[[Page S15382]]\n\nIt is my belief that the adoption of this purely arbitrary cap, which \nyou will find nowhere else, will lead to almost certain erosion of \ncritical programs, scope of coverage, and affordability.\n  Today, nearly 40 years after Medicare's inception, we find ourselves \nat a crossroads. I can truly say that I am somewhat stunned that we are \nabout to make a decision on a program that has worked so well for so \nlong within a matter of hours here, without any of us fully \nunderstanding--at least most don't seem to understand--the implications \nof what we are about to do. How could you take a program that has \nworked so well for so many people and, in the waning days of a session, \nwith just a few hours remaining, get up and ask the Congress to do what \nwe are about to do here? I don't understand how we could allow this to \nhappen. We are on the cusp of fundamentally altering a program that has \nworked so well for this nation's elderly and most frail citizens.\n  Again, Mr. President, we find ourselves at a crossroads. The \nopportunity is before us to move Medicare toward the future without \nthreatening its proven availability to provide for the health and well-\nbeing of our Nation's senior citizens. Sadly, however, this conference \nagreement before us represents an opportunity lost, an opportunity not \nonly to add comprehensive coverage for prescribed medicines under the \nMedicare Program, which would have been a great success story, but also \nan opportunity to strengthen the Medicare Program for future \ngenerations.\n  So it is with great sadness that I find myself, only months after \noriginally supporting the underlying legislation when it was first \nconsidered by the Senate earlier this year, now having to oppose this \nconference agreement in its current form. Under the guise of providing \nneeded prescription drug coverage under the Medicare Program, this \nconference agreement falls far short of addressing this need for the \ngreat majority of our Nation's nearly 41 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Forty-one million Americans take note. Over the weekend, in the next \n72 hours, a program that has served you for 40 years, serving more than \n40 million people presently, is going to be fundamentally altered \nunless this body, and only this body, stands up and says: Stop. Go \nback. Let's rethink this before we go out and make the kind of changes \nthat are being proposed in this legislation.\n  While there have been numerous articles and commentaries written \nabout this plan over the last number of days, people trying to attract \nattention, numerous editorial comments that I have found tremendously \ncompelling, I come back to the basic point that this is dangerous \npolicy. I put my colleagues on notice; I tell you this will happen.\n  In the Senate passed bill, which, again, I supported, in order to \nreceive prescription drug coverage, there had to be two drug-only \nproviders available. However, this conference agreement calls for only \none of these plans and an HMO. This is a fundamental change. Let me \ndescribe what this can mean in the clearest terms I have seen written \nabout this.\n  Under the conference report, we have now learned that the Medicare \nguaranteed fallback is only triggered if a senior does not have a \nchoice of two private plans, one of which can be an HMO. Again, that \nwas not in the Senate bill and it is in the conference report before \nus.\n  In order to receive prescription drug coverage under this bill you \nhave two choices: One, you can choose traditional Medicare and receive \nno prescription drug coverage. Two, you can choose to keep traditional \nMedicare and purchase a drug-only plan. The problem is that there is no \nlimit on the monthly premiums these drug-only plans can charge. When \nyou hear about the $35 cost of premiums for these plans, you must \nremember that this is only an estimate. If there is only one provider \nof the drug-only plan in your area--and that is all there has to be \nunder this bill the monthly premium could be $100 or more. Nothing in \nthis bill caps what the premium should be on a monthly basis for the \ndrug coverage. That is what the offer is under this bill.\n  In other words, it will be permissible for only one insurer to offer \nthe new Medicare drug benefit and charge whatever premium they desire, \nas long as there is also an HMO option in the area. This type of \narrangement strategically avoids the protection of a traditional \nMedicare fallback benefit from being made available to seniors. As a \nresult, seniors in these regions, many of which will be rural areas, \nwill be financially forced into HMOs just to obtain an affordable drug \nbenefit. In the meantime, they will lose their choice of doctors.\n  Does this sound familiar? Earlier this year, President Bush and his \nadministration made clear that he wanted to reform Medicare by \nproviding a prescription drug benefit, but only to those seniors who \nwere willing to go into a private insurance plan and HMOs. This \ncompromise has been designed to help achieve that goal.\n  So that it is further understood, it is important to note that the \nSenate required that there be at least two private stand-alone options \nfor Medicare beneficiaries. This would have ensured that there would at \nleast be competition for premiums for the new stand-alone drug benefit. \nSome have argued that the competition between the drug-only plan and an \nHMO or PPO will force down the premium of the drug-only plan. The fact \nis, drug-only plans cannot compete on an even playing field with PPOs \nor HMOs. This is because HMOs and PPOs are provided additional \nsubsidies under this bill and, by definition, offer a wide variety of \nservices that give these plans a competitive advantage over the stand-\nalone drug plans. Any losses on the drug side can be offset by gains on \nthe medical side, in a sense.\n  This is yet another example of how all financial incentives are \ndesigned to advantage the private HMOs and PPOs over traditional \nMedicare. People need to understand the fundamental changes in this \nbill that will greatly alter the very structure of the Medicare \nprogram.\n  I have taken a lot of time this afternoon, Mr. President, and I \napologize to my colleagues. But I feel very strongly about this \ncritically important issue. Last week in this body we had a filibuster \nthat went on for 4 days because people were upset over the nomination \nof 4 judges. I contend that perhaps there ought to be a filibuster on \nthis legislation as nearly 41 million Medicare beneficiaries are going \nto be adversely affected if this legislation is adopted by this body.\n  Here we are toady, Mr. President, down to the waning few hours of the \nsession, and we are about to consider fundamentally altering and \nsetting back Medicare for years to come. When the roll is called on \nthis, I will vote no. I will seek other options between now and then to \nsee if there is a way to delay consideration of this until we have more \ntime to examine more fully the implications of this bill. Under the \nguise of providing needed prescription drug coverage under Medicare, \nthe conference agreement before us today offers far too little coverage \nfor the great majority of Medicare beneficiaries, while at the same \ntime institutes structural reforms to the underlying Medicare program \nthat will significantly weaken its ability to provide for the health \nand well being of our nation's senior citizens. It should be soundly \nrejected. I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I didn't interrupt the Senator from \nConnecticut, so I hope my colleagues will let me give my remarks in \nrebuttal unhindered by any other obstacles.\n  It is about time that we pass a prescription drug bill for Medicare. \nIt is about time that we strengthen and improve Medicare, as we have \nbeen telling the voters for three elections.\n  In the 2000 election, it was an issue. It was an issue on the floor \nof the Senate last summer. It didn't pass last summer because the other \nparty in this body wanted an issue for the election coming up last \nfall. The leader of the other party took it away from his own chairman \nof the committee, so there could not be a bipartisan bill put together.\n  In the Senate, nothing gets done that is not done in a bipartisan \nway. Maybe a lot of people don't like that about the Senate, but it has \nbeen that way for 214 years, and our country has functioned well. This \nis the only body in our political system where minority interests\n\n[[Page S15383]]\n\nare protected. We are going to have broad, bipartisan support for this \nbill, and we are going to pass it because when Republicans won the last \nelection, we won it because there were a lot of things buried in this \nbody by the leadership of the other party because they wanted issues \nfor that election and because they thought they would increase their \nstrength in this body and get more of what they wanted this year than \nlast year.\n  But they miscalculated. The people of this country put the \nRepublicans in charge of this body. But they didn't put the Republicans \nin charge of this body to do things just in a partisan way because we \nin the majority party know that nothing gets done here that doesn't \nhave some bipartisanship with it.\n  As chairman of the committee of jurisdiction over Medicare, taxes, \ninternational trade, and a lot of other social programs, I have the \nprivilege of having a good working relationship with the former \nchairman of this committee, now the ranking Democrat, Senator Baucus. \nWe started out on Medicare prescription drugs, like we did on some \nother issues this year, to put together a bipartisan approach so that \nwe could deliver on the promises of the last several elections--not \njust the last election, but the last several elections. Both political \nparties have been saying that we are going to strengthen and improve \nMedicare, and one of those strengthenings and improvements is going to \nbe a universal and comprehensive and voluntary prescription drug \nprogram.\n  We are about to deliver on it, and people on the other side don't \nlike it because they had an opportunity and they lost that opportunity \nbecause they wanted to do something in a partisan way. Previous \nspeakers on the other side have raised this point about the AARP \nbacking this plan. They are saying they are caving in to political \npressure.\n  It seems as though, as far as the other side is concerned, the only \ntime the AARP is political, in the eyes of the Democratic Party, is \nwhen AARP agrees with the Republican Party.\n  Senator Baucus and I have been working together, and we will bring to \nthe Senate, after the House passes it tonight, a bipartisan, bicameral \ncompromise out of conference, which will deliver on the promises of the \nlast three elections. We are even going to deliver on the promise of \nthe Democratic Party, where they were going to provide prescription \ndrugs for seniors. The only thing I can think is that they regret it. \nThey had an opportunity a year ago, when they were in the majority and \nwhen our President wanted to work with them, to do it, and they didn't \ntake advantage of it.\n  I want to speak about this product that we have before us. It was \njust yesterday, after 4 months of conferencing, that the conferees \nagreed to a bipartisan breakthrough on a conference report that will \nmake comprehensive prescription drug coverage a reality for our 40 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries, both seniors and disabled. After 4 \nmonths of hard work, the conferees approved a sweeping package of new \nprescription drug benefits and other program improvements that makes \ngood on our commitment to our seniors.\n  I am urging all my colleagues to support it. Since 1965, seniors have \nhad health insurance without prescription drugs. By reaching agreement \nyesterday, the conferees came one step closer to changing that. The \nSenate can make history by improving this compromise report.\n  This important breakthrough came because of the tireless work of our \ncommittee members, both Democrats and Republicans, over the last 5 \nyears. Senators Frist and Breaux led the way on prescription drugs \nbefore any of us were listening. Senators Snowe, Hatch, and Jeffords, \nalong with Senator Breaux and this Senator, carried the torch as \nmembers of the Finance Committee, but also because we wanted to do \nthings in a bipartisan way. We even called that a ``tripartisan way'' \nbecause Senator Jeffords lists himself not as a Republican or Democrat \nbut as an Independent. That is an effort we have exceeded in the bill, \nbut it was an effort that somewhat blazed the trail to where we are \ntoday, and I am glad to have been a part of it.\n  Finally, this breakthrough came because of the President's unyielding \ncommitment to getting something done for seniors once and for all. Last \nDecember 10, I had an opportunity to meet with the President, as he \nknew I was going to be the new chairman of the Senate Finance Committee \nafter the Republicans had won control of the Senate. We, in fact, had \nthat meeting, anticipating all this time we had to work to get ready, a \nlong time before Congress even convened. At that meeting, the President \nsaid two things that I remember. I did not take notes, but I remember \nvery well that he was willing to commit political capital to this \neffort and that he was willing to put money in his budget for that \neffort.\n  The President delivered on both of those statements because his \nbudget put $400 billion in over 10 years for this bill. That is exactly \nwhat we in the Senate wanted. We approved that last March. By June, the \nSenate Finance Committee had reported out a strong bipartisan bill by a \nvote of 15 to 6, building upon the agreement with the President and the \nagreement of the Senate for $400 billion for the budget.\n  The Senate, as you know, passed S. 1 on strong bipartisan grounds in \nJune. The other body passed a similar bill, H.R. 1, that same night. I \nbelieve the committee report is measurably better than either S. 1 or \nthe House bill, H.R. 1. It contains improvements, refinements, and \nchanges that are better for seniors and better for the doctors and the \nhospitals that serve them.\n  We have come a very long way in getting to this point, and I am proud \nof where we have ended up. I will do everything I can to ensure \nsuccessful passage of this conference report over the next few days.\n  Of course, the conference report can't and won't be all things to all \npeople. Like any compromise, no one is left perfectly happy. That \nprobably means that the conference committee came out just about at the \nright place. I urge all my colleagues to go beyond the perfect and to \nfocus on the good that the conference agreement accomplishes.\n  The greatest good at the heart of this conference report is a \ncomprehensive prescription drug benefit that will give immediate \nassistance starting next year and continuing as a permanent part of \nMedicare to every senior. Not only is it comprehensive, it is \nuniversal, and if nobody wants to participate in it, they don't have \nto. It is voluntary as well.\n  The conference report provides affordable comprehensive prescription \ndrug coverage on a voluntary basis to every senior in America. The \ncoverage is stable, it is predictable, and it is secure. Most \nimportantly, the value of the coverage does not vary based on where you \nlive and whether you have decided to join a private health plan. For \nIowans and others in rural America who have been left behind by most \nMedicare private health plans, this is an important accomplishment that \nI insisted on way back as early as January of this year. I haven't \nbudged on that commitment and that protection is in this conference \nagreement.\n\n  Overall, the conference agreement relies on the best of the private \nsector to deliver drug coverage, supported by the best of the public \nsector to secure consumer protection and important patient rights. This \ncombination of public and private resources is what stabilizes the \nbenefit and helps keep costs down.\n  Keeping costs down is essential not just for seniors but for the \nprogram as a whole. Throughout this bill, we have targeted our \nresources very carefully, giving additional help to the poorest of our \nseniors. Consistent with the policy of targeted policymaking, we have \nworked hard to keep existing sources of prescription drug coverage, \nsuch as employer-sponsored benefits, and to do it in a viable way.\n  This conference agreement goes great distances to keep employers in \nthe game providing drug coverage, as they do now, to their retirees \nunder those plans that were promised to people after retiring from \ntheir employment.\n  We all worried very much when we passed this bill in June that, as \nCBO scored our Senate bill, it might cause 37 percent of the \ncorporations to drop their employees on the Government plan. The House \nbill had a 32-percent drop rate, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. As a result of the conference activity and what we have done to \nshore up existing retiree plans, that percentage is now much less than\n\n[[Page S15384]]\n\n20 percent due to the substantial investment made by conferees to \nensure that employers can continue offering the good coverage they have \nfor a long period of time.\n  The conference report includes additional subsidies. It also includes \nregulatory flexibility that will do much more to help, rather than \nthreaten, employer-sponsored coverage for those who currently receive \nit.\n  Still, we all must acknowledge that decisions about scaling back \ncoverage or dropping it altogether are bound to be made regardless of \nwhether we pass this conference report. But I am confident that the \nbalanced policies before us are a very good deal for employers and \ntheir retirees.\n  I want to make it very clear to people listening who might be \nworrying about corporation retirees losing their health coverage \nbecause of something we are doing here, we are doing our darndest to \nsupplement these plans and to give regulatory flexibility so these \nplans are not dropped. But Congress cannot pass a law that says \ncorporation X, Y, or Z, some day, if they decide they want to dump \nthem, might be dumped. That could be happening in some corporation in \nAmerica today. This law is not even on the books. That happened in my \nState earlier this year and last year and the year before, not because \nCongress was talking but just because that was the policy of that \ncorporation. It is something they felt they couldn't afford any longer, \nand they did it.\n  That could happen even after we pass this legislation, but where \nwould we be if we didn't pass this legislation? The 35 percent of the \nseniors today who have no coverage whatsoever, and probably never have \nhad it in retirement, will still not have drug coverage. Also, the \ncorporations that dump their plans might not have anything either. By \npassing this legislation, even considering all the resources--about 20 \npercent of this legislation contains resources for these corporations \nto keep their plans--if they would drop them, at least these people \nhave something on which to fall back.\n  I would think that is a better situation than the uncertainty of, Is \nmy corporation going to dump me or are they not going to dump me?\n  If they are dumped, then they have zilch, unless they want to buy an \nexpensive Medigap policy or something like that. So we are trying to \nhave a safety net for all seniors, and we are trying to do it in a way \nthat is very helpful. So I want to make that very clear. We cannot \nforce corporations--never could and never will be able to--to say they \nhave to provide health care coverage and prescription drug coverage for \ntheir retirees. But we do have a plan that is very good for people who \ndo not have prescription drugs or people who might have prescription \ndrugs today but tomorrow might not have it. This is a safety net and a \ndarn good safety net.\n  Beyond just prescription drugs, the conference report is a milestone \naccomplishment for improving traditional Medicare, especially in rural \nAmerica. The conference report includes the best rural improvement in \nthe Medicare equity package that Congress has ever passed. The rural \nhealth care safety net is coming apart in rural areas. It is difficult \nto recruit doctors to rural areas because of low reimbursement. The \nconference report begins to mend that safety net.\n  As many in this Chamber know, hospitals, home health agencies, and \nambulance companies in rural America lose money on every Medicare \npatient they see. Rural physicians are penalized by bureaucratic \nformulas that reduce payments below those of their urban counterparts \nfor the same service. The conference report takes historic steps toward \ncorrecting geographic disparities that penalize rural health care \nproviders. Providers in rural States such as Iowa practice some of the \nlowest cost, highest quality medicine in America. This is widely \nunderstood by researchers, academics, and citizens of those States, but \nnot by Medicare.\n  Medicare instead rewards providers in high-cost, inefficient States \nwith bigger payments that have the perverse effect of incentivizing \noverutilization of services and poor quality. This is very noted in my \nState.\n  The Des Moines Register has been very clear in informing the people \nof my State that Iowa is 50th in reimbursement in Medicare on a per \nbeneficiary basis over a year, 50th of the 50 States, but yet under \nindices we are fifth or sixth in quality of care.\n  Over at the other end, there is Louisiana, No. 1 in reimbursement, \nabout $7,000 per beneficiary per year compared to about $3,400 for \nIowa, the lowest of the 50 States. More money to be spent on Medicare \nfor seniors' medical care does not guarantee quality of care because \nLouisiana is listed 50th in quality of care. So we want to make sure \nthat where one is getting high-quality delivery of health care, there \nis reimbursement that takes that into consideration. So the conference \nreport begins to reverse that trend.\n  It also includes long overdue pilot programs that will test the \nconcept of paying for performance and making bonus payments for high-\nquality health care. This benefits taxpayers and, most of all, \npatients.\n  Beyond prescription drugs and beyond rural health care, the \nconference report goes at great length to give better benefits and more \nchoices--the right to choose is very basic in this bill--available to \nour seniors. It specifically authorizes preferred provider \norganizations--we call them PPOs--to participate in Medicare, something \nthe current law does not fully allow. The idea is that these kinds of \nlightly managed care plans more closely resemble the kinds of plans \nthat we in the Federal Government have and close to 50 percent of \nworking Americans have. Baby boomers then, when they go into \nretirement, will be able to compare fee-for-service 1965 model Medicare \nwith these new PPOs. I think they are going to find new PPOs closer to \nwhat they had in the workplace than traditional Medicare, but they have \nthe right to choose. We think they ought to have that right, too, \nbecause traditional Medicare has not kept up with changes in the \npractice of medicine like the private health plans employees have in \nthe workplace.\n\n  PPOs have the advantage of offering the same benefits of traditional \nMedicare, including prescription drugs, but they do that on an \nintegrated, coordinated basis. So this creates new opportunities for \nchronic disease management and access to innovative new therapies. \nUnlike Medicare+Choice, we set up a regional system where plans will \nbid in a way that does not allow them to choose the most profitable \ncities and towns. They cannot do cherry-picking. Systems like this work \nwell for Federal employees such as the postmaster in my hometown of New \nHartford, IA. He has a choice of several plans. We want to give that \nsame choice to his parents, who today have only Medicare and nothing \nelse.\n  Are PPOs right for everyone? It is the right to choose that is \nimportant about this bill. Let the seniors decide. Our bill sets up a \nplaying field for PPOs to compete for beneficiaries. We believe PPOs \ncan be competitive and offer a stronger, more enhanced benefit than \ntraditional Medicare. But let me be clear, no senior has to choose \nPPOs. My policy has been to let seniors keep what they have, if they \nlike it, with no change. All seniors, regardless of whether they choose \na PPO, can still get prescription drugs. They do not have to choose \nthat, but they can choose that as an add-on to traditional Medicare if \nthey want.\n  So I hope I have protected all of my colleagues, and maybe my \ncolleagues do not need any protection, insisting on the voluntariness \nof this and the right to choose. I think it is pretty essential for \npeople who are older, who do not want change in their life, not to have \nto make a change in their life.\n  I fear maybe, as the Senator from Iowa, that somebody is going to \ncome up to me someday and say: Grassley, just leave my Medicare alone.\n  They do not follow Congress closely, but they read here and there and \nthey get nervous: What Senator is taking away their Medicare? I can say \nto Mary Smith in Columbus Junction, IA: You do not have to worry about \nanything. If you are satisfied with the Medicare you have, you can keep \nit. If you want to join a prescription drug program to add to it, you \ncan do that, but you do not have to worry about Medicare. If you like \nit the way it has been all your life, we are leaving it alone.\n  I think that sounds like protection for Senator Grassley, but I am \nconcerned about the cynicism my seniors\n\n[[Page S15385]]\n\nhave about Government, maybe because they do not study it as much as we \ndo or understand it as much as we do. I want to reduce that cynicism, \nbut I want them to have confidence in their Medicare as well. I think \nthis right to choose gives them that confidence.\n  The conference report also includes other important policies that I \nbelieve make a much stronger, better bill. First, we make wealthier \npeople pay a slightly higher premium. Why should someone who makes \n$80,000 a year or more pay exactly the same price for coverage as \nsomeone who makes $30,000 a year? The conference report makes wealthy \nseniors pay slightly more, and this is a very important and rational \nstep toward stabilizing Medicare's growth.\n  The conference report also injects new and transparent accountancy \nrules into Medicare, making the trustees show in a comprehensive way \nwhat all of Medicare's assets and liabilities truly are. There are also \nexpedited procedures for committee consideration of legislation that \naddresses any future Medicare funding crisis without changing the \nSenate rules.\n\n  Finally, and in my view most importantly, the conference agreement \nauthorizes health savings accounts. I have been a long-time supporter \nof medical savings accounts. Now they are going to be called health \nsavings accounts. Such tax-favored accounts encourage responsible \nutilization of health care services. They offer low-cost insurance to \nfarmers and other self-employed people. For too long, medical savings \naccounts have languished under regulatory inflexibility. The provisions \nin the conference report go to great length to make medical savings \naccounts a stronger, more accessible option for more Americans, and I \nthink that is very appropriate because it adds to the right to choose.\n  We are in a unique moment in our history as far as health insurance \nlegislation is concerned. We have a limited opportunity to deliver on \nour promises to get this done once and for all.\n  Let me remind everyone, there is $400 billion sitting in front of \nAmerica's seniors. If we let partisan disagreement prevent us from \nsnatching it up for them, shame on us because, what do you think the \nchances are next March of this Senate adopting a budget with $400 \nbillion set aside for Medicare? I think the chances of that happening \nare not very good.\n  Let's not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. I urge my \ncolleagues to continue in the bipartisan tradition of the Finance \nCommittee and deliver a balanced bipartisan product that does right by \nour seniors.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15385-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15385-S15390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n VISION 100--CENTURY OF AVIATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Ernest Hollings,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: I have received your November 13, \n     2003 letter regarding the issue of contracting out functions \n     performed by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees. \n     Your letter requested clarification on the status of \n     ``contracting out'' of FAA functions related to flight \n     services and the certification or maintenance of air traffic \n     control equipment used in the national airspace system. I \n     understand that you are not advocating that the FAA in-source \n     any functions currently performed by contractors or cease \n     work and analysis already underway. As you know, several \n     months ago the FAA initiated a competitive sourcing process \n     with respect to the FAA's Automated Flight Service Stations \n     (AFSS). Under the FAA's current schedule, the final source \n     selection decision with respect to the AFSS competition will \n     occur early in fiscal year 2005.\n       During this fiscal year we have no plans to initiate \n     additional competitive sourcing studies, nor will we displace \n     FAA employees by entering into binding contracts to convert \n     to private entities any existing FAA position directly \n     related to our air traffic control system.\n       I look forward to working with the Committee on the \n     important challenges facing the Federal Aviation \n     Administration. The Conference Report contains many \n     provisions which will provide us with important tools to \n     enhance aviation safety, security, and capacity. Thank you \n     for your efforts on this important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Marion C.

John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I have received your November 13, 2003 \n     letter regarding the issue of contracting out functions \n     performed by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees. \n     Your letter requested clarification on the status of \n     ``contracting out'' of FAA functions related to flight \n     services and the certification or maintenance of air traffic \n     control equipment used in the national airspace system.

The Conference Report contains many \n     provisions which will provide us with important tools to \n     enhance aviation safety, security, and capacity. Thank you \n     for our efforts on this important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Marion C. Blakey,\n                                                    Administrator.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is about to \nvote on the Conference Report to H.R. 2115, the FAA reauthorization \nbill. This legislation is critical to our Nation's air transportation \nsystem, providing necessary funding for aviation safety and security \nfor fiscal years 2004 to 2007.\n\n[[Page S15386]]\n\n  CIvil aviation generates more than $900 billion in GDP every year, \nand we all know that it has faced very difficult economic times. Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, Congress has passed a number of bipartisan aviation \nbills to aid the industry and, more importantly, to assure that the air \ntraveling public could continue to rely on this vital transportation \nmode. Among the many bills enacted, we established the Transportation \nSecurity Administration (TSA) to oversee aviation security; we provided \ngrants and loans to help the airline industry through their difficult \neconomic times; and we extended terrorism insurance to the aviation \nindustry. Without these important measures, the aviation industry would \nbe in far worse condition.\n  The Conference Report pending before us is as important to the health \nof our aviation system as any of the other bills I just mentioned. This \nmulti-year FAA authorization legislation is needed by airports, so that \nairport construction projects don't come to a halt and cause layoffs in \nthe construction sector. It is needed by aviation manufacturers and by \nthe airline industry. Above all, it is needed by our air travelers, who \nrely on a safe and security air transportation system.\n  The Conference Report on H.R. 2115 authorizes over $60 billion in \naviation spending over the next four years to improve our Nation's \naviation system. It includes: $14.2 billion for security, safety and \ncapacity projects for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP)--over 50 \npercent of this funding is likely to be spent on safety projects. In \nfiscal year 2004 alone, this funding will create approximately 162,000 \ndirect and indirect jobs. However, the AIP funding ONLY becomes \navailable if this Conference Report is signed into law--the passage of \nthe transportation appropriations bill is NOT sufficient to make the \nfunds available; $13.3 billion to modernize the air traffic control \nsystem; $31 billion to operate the FAA's air traffic control system and \nto support the FAA's safety programs; $1.6 billion for aviation \nresearch and development; $2 billion for airport security projects, \nand, $500 million for the Essential Air Service program. The majority \nof this funding will come from the Aviation Trust Fund, which is \nsupported by taxes paid by the users of the system.\n  Although this Conference Report provides a great boost for the \nmodernization of the aviation system and for increasing capacity and \nefficiency, there are also numerous provisions in the Conference Report \nthat will improve aviation safety and security.\n  In support of improving safety, the Conference Report strengthens FAA \nenforcement against the users of fraudulent aircraft parts; increases \npenalties that the FAA may impose for safety violations--fines have not \nbeen adjusted since 1947, and as such, are sometimes simply treated as \nthe cost of doing business by the entity being fined; and requires the \nFAA to update and improve its airline safety oversight program.\n  In support of improved aviation security, the Conference Report \nincludes $500 million per year to finance security capital improvements \nat airports--including the installation of explosive detection systems. \nAfter September 11, almost $500 million per year in AIP funds were \ndiverted to security projects from safety and capacity projects. \nAlthough this may have been justifiable immediately after September 11, \nin the long run, a continuation of such diversion could be detrimental \nto the aviation system; extends the Secretary of Transportation's \nauthority to provide War Risk insurance to airlines against terrorism; \nexpands the armed pilot program to include cargo pilots; requires the \nTSA to improve the security at foreign repair stations that conduct \nwork on U.S. aircraft; authorizes compensation to general aviation \nentities for losses resulting from security mandates; and provides for \ncertification and better security training for flight attendants.\n  In order to improve air transportation service, especially to smaller \nand rural communities, the Conference Report contains a number of \nprovisions. The report reauthorizes the Essential Air Service (EAS) at \ncurrent funding levels; establishes a number of EAS pilot programs to \ngive communities flexibility in how they receive EAS service; makes \npermanent the Small Community Air Development program; establishes a \nNational Commission on Small Community Air Service to make \nrecommendations on how to improve air service to such communities; and \nincludes a Sense of Congress that airlines should provide the lowest \npossible fare for all active duty members of the Armed Forces.\n  Further, for large airports in Western States and smaller airports in \nthe East, it frees up more takeoff and landing slots at Reagan National \nAirport.\n  The Conference Report addresses numerous environmental issues. It \nstreamlines environmental review of projects to increase airport \ncapacity and improve aviation safety and security; authorizes grants to \nairports to permit them to purchase or retrofit low emission vehicles \nat airports; and authorizes projects that improve air quality and give \nairports emission credits for undertaking such projects.\n  I want to recognize all the hard work that Senator Lott, as Chairman \nof the Aviation Subcommittee, has put into the bill this year. Last \nwinter, many in the aviation community predicted that Congress would \nnot enact an aviation reauthorization bill this year. Senator Lott \nwould not even consider such a scenario and kept us on a schedule where \nthe Conference Report was actually completed before the August recess. \nThis was only possible, as always, due to the work and cooperation on \nthis bill from the ranking Democratic members of the Commerce Committee \nand its Aviation Subcommittee, Senators Hollings and Rockefeller.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Dorgan for his work in brokering the \ncompromise that allowed us to move forward with this Conference Report \ntoday. And I want to thank the administration, especially Secretary \nMineta and FAA Administrator Blakey, in working long and hard with us \nto get a final compromise on the issue of privatization.\n  I urge my colleagues to support final passage of the Conference \nReport and send it to the President.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \npassage of H.R. 2115, Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization \nAct. I am pleased that we have finally reached agreement on this \nimportant legislation and can now move forward on enacting this bill \ninto law. This comprehensive reauthorization bill will provide $60 \nbillion in funding for FAA operations, including some $14.2 billion for \nairport grants that will create an estimated 600,000 jobs and support \nfor key aviation projects in communities across the country.\n  Achieving consensus on the conference report has not been easy, and \nwhile I think all of us should be encouraged by the results of these \nefforts, we should take this opportunity to fully consider and \nappreciate the critical role that compromise has played in achieving \nthis positive result. Colleagues on both sides of the aisle have \nexpressed their concerns about the process by which the FAA Conference \nReport was deliberated and produced. FAA reauthorization bills have \nalways been moved out of Congress with little controversy, but after \npassing a bill on the Senate floor with unanimous support and \ncooperating on developing the bulk on the FAA Reauthorization bill, \nDemocrats were cut out of the process. This was an unacceptable \ndevelopment that violated the spirit of this body, and ultimately it \nled to the creation of flawed legislation.\n  For three months after it was filed, there was a lack of will in \nCongress to pass the FAA Conference Report in the form that the \nRepublican leadership demanded. As a result, FAA projects went \nunauthorized after the fiscal year ended, and in an effort to end the \nstalemate they had created the House Leadership was forced to recommit \nthe legislation on October 28, 2003. At this time, they stripped out \nthe most troubling provision in the bill--language that allowed for the \nimmediate privatization of 69 of FAA's air traffic control (ATC) towers \nand the entire ATC system in 2007. However, the Senate remained \nunsatisfied with the bill's lack of protection for the Nation's ATC \nsystem after it was recommitted, and we voted against cloture 45-43 on \nNovember 17, 2003.\n  Prior to the vote, I worked with Senators McCain, Rockefeller, and \nLott\n\n[[Page S15387]]\n\nto seek commitment from the Bush administration to impose a 1-year \nmoratorium on the contracting out or privatization of any ATC functions \nso that the Senate Commerce Committee can properly conduct its \noversight responsibilities of this matter. The Committee plans to hold \nhearings on this subject next year, and we will also request detailed \nanalyses from the Government Accounting Office and the Department of \nTransportation Inspector General (DOT IG) in an effort to determine how \nto best enhance safety, the steps that should be taken to keep pace \nwith future growth, and the best way for the Federal Government to get \nthere.\n  Today, we have received the proper commitment from the Bush \nadministration to proceed in this manner. Under the arrangement, the \nFAA has agreed not to proceed with the privatization or outsourcing of \nany FAA air traffic separation and control functions in fiscal year \n2004. The written agreement includes a prohibition on contracting out \nthe maintenance and certification of the systems and equipment in the \nair traffic control system in the National Airspace System. In \naddition, the Administration has committed to maintaining the existing \nFederal relationship with the Nation's Flight Service Stations, with \nthe understanding that they will be allowed to continue on-going \nevaluations of how best to revamp the entire program. The DOT IG's \noffice has estimated that consolidation of the FSSs, combined with a \nnew computer system, could provide a better arrangement and save $500 \nmillion over 7 years.\n  With this understanding in place, I am pleased that we can now move \nforward with broad support for a multi-year reauthorization of FAA \nprograms. Indeed, H.R. 2115 has many good provisions in it that will go \na long way towards improving and enhancing our aviation system as we \nmove into the 21st Century. I would like to add that conservative \nestimates by the FAA show that the formula funding in this legislation \nwill provide more than $112 million and at least 5,325 jobs in my home \nState of South Carolina over the next 4 years. I look forward to \npassing the bill.\n  Finally, I want to thank Chairman McCain, Senator Lott, the Aviation \nSubcommittee Chairman, and Ranking Member Rockfeller for all of their \nhard work over the last several days and for the long months that they \nput in prior to that. We came together with a common purpose--to pass \nthis Conference Report--and with bipartisan cooperation have developed \ncomprehensive legislation that provides the American people the proper \nlevel of safety, security and financial support.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to finally be able to \nsupport the adoption of the Federal Aviation Administration conference \nreport.\n  The process that allowed us to get to this point has been unlike any \nother that I have ever experienced in my 19 years in the Senate, but we \nhave secured a commitment from the administration that they will not \nmove forward with contracting out any air traffic control functions, \nwhich has prevented the Senate from passing this report. I am pleased \nthat my colleagues have confirmed this commitment.\n  Over the last year, I have worked closely with Senators McCain, \nHollings, and Lott on developing this important legislation. I thank \nthem for all of their efforts on getting this bill done. It has not \ngone as easy as any of us would have liked, but the debate on \nprivatization is important as it is fundamentally a debate on safety \nand security. Senator Lautenberg should be commended for his \nunrelenting commitment to making sure the United States has the safest \nand most secure air traffic control system in the world.\n  We have secured an agreement on this issue that all parties can \naccept, but it does not mean that this debate is over. I know my \ncolleagues have committed to holding hearings on this issue, and we \nwill be closely monitoring the administration's actions in this area.\n  The reauthorization of the FAA is a vitally important piece of \nlegislation. It would be the first genuine economic stimulus bill that \nthe Senate has passed this year.\n  No question exists that since the tragedy of September 11, aviation \nin this country has been permanently changed. Over the last 2 years, we \nhave seen a decrease in the demand for air travel, hundreds of \nthousands of aerospace and aviation employees have lost their jobs and \nthe economic pain has rippled through the economy. We cannot have a \nsustained economic recovery in this country until we have a healthy and \nvibrant aviation industry.\n  This bill provides the foundation for the resurgence of an essential \nsector of our economy.\n  I cannot emphasize the importance of a vibrant and strong aviation \nindustry. It is fundamental to our nation's long-term economic growth. \nIt is also vital to the economic future of countless small and local \ncommunities that are linked to the rest of the nation and world through \naviation.\n  Just as the aviation industry is a catalyst of growth for the \nnational economy, airports are a catalyst of growth for their local \ncommunities. In my State of West Virginia, aviation represents $3.4 \nbillion of the state's gross domestic product and directly and \nindirectly employs over 51,000 people.\n  Aviation also links our Nation's small and rural citizens and \ncommunities to the national and world marketplace. My home State of \nWest Virginia has been able to attract firms from Asia and Europe \nbecause of reliable access to their West Virginia investments.\n  Without access to an integrated air transportation network, small \ncommunities can not attract the investment necessary to grow or allow \nhome grown businesses to expands. A modern and adequately funded \naviation network is fundamental to making sure that all Americans can \nparticipate in the global economy. This bill makes sure the United \nStates will continue to have the best aviation system in the world.\n  This legislation builds upon our commitment to improving the aviation \ninfrastructure of the nation that started with the landmark Aviation \nInvestment and Reform Act for the 21st Century. I believe that this \nlegislation meets the challenges facing the FAA and the aviation \nindustry in the years ahead.\n  This $60 billion bill focuses on improving our Nation's aviation \nsafety and air service development, and aeronautical research. While my \ndistinguished colleagues have provided an excellent overview of the \nbill, I would like to highlight some areas for the bill that I believe \nare particularly important.\n  No higher goal exists than the safety and security of the Nation's \nairports and airspace. Over the past 24 months, we have worked every \nday to improve security in our airports and on our airplanes. However, \nuntil this bill, we had fallen short on providing funding to make sure \nour Nation's airports have the resources available to make the required \nimprovements.\n  Airports estimate that they have $3 billion in unmet security \ninfrastructure needs. Airports have been forced to tap their expansion \nand development funds to pay for security. It makes no sense to raid \nfunds for safety improvements for security improvements. The security \nof our Nation is a Federal responsibility and the Federal Government \nmust pay for it.\n  One of the most important provisions in this bill is the \nestablishment of a $500 million fund to assist airports with capital \nsecurity costs. This new fund is intended to stop the diversion of \nairport development funds meant for safety and capacity enhancements. \nWe will be able to pay for new security requirements while \nsimultaneously improving safety and expanding capacity.\n  Even in these difficult budgetary times, we were able to modestly \nincrease the Airport Improvement Program funding, which will provide \nthe economy a real stimulus through direct and indirect job creation. \nAirport development is economic development as airports are economic \ndevelopment for their local communities. It is estimated that U.S. \nAirports are responsible for nearly $507 billion each year in total \neconomic activity nationwide. Investment in airport infrastructure is a \nreal economic stimulus that creates both immediate jobs and long-term \neconomic development.\n  In order to facilitate airport development, I am pleased that this \nbill includes much of the text of the legislation that Senator \nHutchinson and I worked on last Congress to streamline and expedite the \nairport development\n\n[[Page S15388]]\n\nprocess. This country needs to expand its airport infrastructure. \nWithout a substantial increase in this area, aviation delays would \nincrease resulting in billions of dollars of costs to the economy.\n  Finally, we have authorized a significant increase in aeronautical \nand aviation research in order to preserve America's leadership in \nthese industries.\n  Today, we also meet the challenge of making sure our small and rural \ncommunities have access to the nation's air transportation network. I \ncontinue to be very concerned that air carriers are abandoning small \nand rural markets. We cannot let these communities go without adequate \nand affordable air service--their future depends upon it.\n  I am enormously pleased that the bill extends and expands the Small \nCommunity Air Service Development Program, which I fought for in AIR \n21. In West Virginia, Charleston used funding from this program to \nattract new service to Houston, which has been a hugh success. \nParkersburg was recently awarded a grant and already working on \nimplementing its initiatives to improve air service to new hubs. This \nprogram has proven an innovative and flexible tool for communities to \naddress air service needs.\n  Many of our most isolated and vulnerable communities whose only \nservice is through the Essential Air Service Program have indicated \nthat they would like to develop innovative and flexible programs \nsimilar to those communities who received Small Community Air Service \nDevelopment grants to improve the quality of their air service.\n  It is for this reason that I, along with Senator Lott, developed the \nSmall Community and Rural Air Service Revitalization Act of 2003. The \nFAA conference report incorporates the basic provisions of this \nlegislation. The FAA Bill reauthorizes the Essential Air Service, EAS, \nprogram and creates a series of new innovative pilot programs for EAS \ncommunities to participate in to stimulate passenger demand for air \nservice in their communities.\n  By providing communities the ability to design their own air service \nproposals, a community has the ability to develop a plan that meets its \nlocally determined needs, improves air service choices, and gives the \ncommunity a greater stake in the EAS program.\n  Small and rural communities are the first to bear the brunt of bad \neconomic times and the last to see the benefits of good times. The \ngeneral economic downturn and the dire straits of the aviation industry \nhave placed exceptional burdens on air service to our most isolated \ncommunities. The Federal Government must provide additional resources \nand tools for small communities to help themselves attract adequate air \nservice. The Federal Government must make sure that our most vulnerable \ntowns and cities are linked to the rest of nation. This legislation \nauthorizes the tools and resources necessary to attract air service, \nrelated economic development, and most importantly expand their \nconnections to the national and global economy.\n  This bill meets the challenges facing our aviation system--increasing \nsecurity, expanding airport safety and capacity, and making sure our \nsmallest communities have access to the network. We can all be proud of \nthis bill.\n  Again, I thank Senator McCain, Senator Lott, and Senator Hollings for \nall their hard work to improve aviation in this country.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I have a question for the subcommittee chairman \nabout section 808 of the conference report concerning international air \ncargo shipped through Alaska.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to answer the Senator's question. This provision \nwas adopted in the Senate after being offered by the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chairman. Is it the Chairman's \nunderstanding that section 808 only addresses international cargo and \ndoes not address the carriage of cargo which first originates in \nAlaska?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct. Section 808 will allow carriers to \ninterline cargo in Alaska so long as the cargo has an ultimate origin \nand/or destination outside of the United States. It does not allow \nforeign carriers to carry or transfer cargo with an ultimate origin and \ndestination both in the United States.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my colleagues for explaining that this important \nprovision allows carriers to interline cargo in Alaska, with an \nultimate origin and/or destination outside of the United States, but \ndoes not allow foreign carriers to carry or transfer cargo with an \nultimate origin and destination both in the United States.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of the \nconference report accompanying H.R. 2115, which reauthorizes the \nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n  Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act would provide \njust under $60 billion over the next 4 years for FAA activities. These \nare much needed funding improvements because we find ourselves in one \nof the greatest transition periods as a country, and as proponents of \nthe aviation industry, in the history of our nation. With the slow \nrecovery of the industry and the economy since the attacks of 9/11 it \nis important we pass this legislation immediately.\n  As a member of the conference, my colleagues and I addressed several \nimportant issues and challenges. One of the most important achievements \nis the progress made in funding the Airport Improvement Program, which \nis funded at $3.4 billion in 2004 and increases $100 million each year \nending at $3.7 billion in 2007. This is a necessary increase, as we \nneed to constantly improve our Nations' airport infrastructure \nespecially in rural and underserved areas.\n  Mr. President, as you know, several provisions in or absent from the \nbill have bogged down its passage. As a member of the conference, even \nI do not support all provisions in this bill, but I understand the \nimportance of the bill as a whole and the potential pitfalls our \ninfrastructure will take if not enacted.\n  I do not intend to discuss the entire report, but there are several \ncritical provisions I would like to briefly address which greatly \naffect my State of Montana and my constituents.\n  The first provision is intended to make additional slots available to \nimprove access to the Nation's Capital for cities located beyond the \n1,250 mile service perimeter at Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport, DCA. I am particularly concerned that small and midsized \ncommunities in the west, especially in Montana and neighboring states, \ncontinue to have far fewer service options to reach DCA than \ncommunities located in any other area of the country. This is due to \nthe fact that the most important hub airport serving the northern tier \nand intermountain region, Salt Lake City, is located outside the DCA \nperimeter.\n  Network benefits are critical to improving this situation, and it is \nvery important that the Department of Transportation consider and award \nthese limited opportunities to western hubs that connect the largest \nnumber of cities to the national transportation network. Salt Lake City \nis a prime example. That airport serves as a primary transportation hub \nfor the intermountain west. I was very disappointed that Salt Lake City \nreceived only a single flight from the prior AIR-21 allocation, while \nother hubs servicing the southwest region received two, or even three \ndaily flights. Increased service at Salt Lake City should be a \npriority, because of the many critically underserved communities in the \nnorthern tier and intermountain west that will receive significant \nnetwork benefits from additional flights at that hub.\n  The second issue is the Essential Air Service Program, EAS. As you \nknow, the EAS program provides subsidies to carriers for providing \nservice between small communities and hub airports and is, no pun \nintended, essential to my state. This report authorizes approximately \n$500 million for EAS, and I am extremely supportive of that level.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report also contains a provision, which \ndirects the DOT to establish a pilot program for up to 10 EAS \ncommunities located within 100 miles of a large hub, and those \ncommunities will be required to pay 10 percent match of the EAS \nsubsidy. While this provision does not affect my Montana EAS \ncommunities, I am still extremely unsupportive of this provision. If \nany Montana communities were asked to pay this match, there is no way \nthey could come up with the funds. I want this body to know I will\n\n[[Page S15389]]\n\nfight expansion of this pilot program in future authorizations. While \nwe need to work on possible alternatives to EAS, we cannot ask small \ncommunities across the Nation to fork out funds they do not have for a \nservice they deserve and need.\n  Finally, this report contains language based on two amendments I \noffered on the Senate floor during debate earlier this year. The first \nasks for a report from the Secretary of Transportation on any actions \nthat should be taken with respect to recommendations made by the \nNational Commission to Ensure Consumer Information and Choice in the \nAirline Industry. The second amendment authorizes compensation to \nGeneral aviation businesses for losses incurred after the attacks of 9/\n11. General aviation is an extremely important piece of this country's \naviation backbone and we need to keep their perspective in mind \nwhenever any aviation legislation is addressed whether it deals with \nsecurity or overall aviation policy.\n  In summation, we have crafted a fair and necessary piece of \nlegislation that needs immediate passage. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport final passage of this critical piece of legislation that will \naide all aviation sectors across this Nation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have serious concerns about several \nprovisions found in the FAA reauthorization conference report. Before \nthe Senate passed S. 824, the FAA reauthorization bill, we expressly \nprohibited additional privatization of air traffic controllers. We also \neliminated a proposed cost-sharing requirement for local communities \nthat participate in the essential air service program. This requirement \nwould have placed an insurmountable burden on many remote communities \nstruggling to maintain commercial air service. While I understand that \nAdministrator Blakey today has promised our Senate colleagues to \nforestall privatization until the next fiscal year, I am concerned that \nthe window is nevertheless open for eventual privatization and would \nnot support such a result.\n  I remain concerned about the provisions in this bill affecting the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, NEPA. As I discussed in my statement \nof November 17, 2003, the legal obligations of Federal agencies to \nevaluate aviation projects under Federal environmental laws have not \nbeen repealed by the language in this bill, nor should they be. If \nbetter coordination is the intent of this legislation, there is ample \nauthority contained in the existing NEPA statute and regulations for \ncoordination among Federal agencies in performing required \nenvironmental reviews of these projects. The confusing statutory \ndirections contained in this bill are both unnecessary and \ncounterproductive if the desired result is efficient project \ncompletion.\n  I am disappointed that this conference report contains these \nprovisions, and I will work to ensure that the FAA scrutinizes the \npotential consequences of privatization of air traffic controllers if \nthat issue arises next year. In addition, as the ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I will continue to conduct \noversight pertaining to the implementation of environmental laws for \nthese and other Federal projects.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the final \nconference report to the FAA reauthorization bill, I would like to take \na moment to thank Chairman McCain and subcommittee Chairman Trent Lott, \nfor their assistance regarding a provision that is very important to my \nhome State.\n  For years, I have been working with the FAA and the Jackson Hole \nAirport to reduce the noise that is produced by older private jets. As \nsome of my colleagues know, the Jackson Hole Airport is the only \ncommercial airport that is located in a national park. Since 1983, the \nJackson Hole Airport has operated under a ``land use agreement'' with \nthe Secretary of the Interior. This agreement requires the airport to \nimplement technological advances to reduce aircraft noise.\n  However, the FAA has prevented the airport from instituting a Stage 2 \nrestriction on older ``noisy'' private jets even though the Air Noise \nCapacity Act of 1990 includes a provision that allows folks to enforce \npre-existing noise control measures. Currently, only a small portion, \n2.6 percent, of the airport's operations are conducted by older noisy \njet aircraft. However, these old noisy jets have a disproportionately \nhigh noise impact on Grand Teton National Park and the National Elk \nRefuge. Because the FAA has failed to recognize the grandfathered \nstatus of the Jackson airport, I offered an amendment to the Senate \nversion of the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  On June 12 the Senate unanimously agreed to my amendment. I am \nthankful for Senator McCain's and House Chairman Don Young's \nunderstanding regarding the need to protect Grand Teton National Park \nand the National Elk Refuge from the high levels of noise that older \nprivate jets produce. The provision is supported by the Jackson Airport \nBoard, Grand Teton National Park, the Town of Jackson, Teton County, \nand U.S. Department of the Interior.\n  Mr. President, the Jackson Hole Airport is a commercial service \nairport located on Federal land within Grand Teton National Park. It \noperates under a long-term lease agreement with the Department of the \nInterior. That agreement contains noise control measures, including \ncumulative and single event noise limits, and requirements for an \nairport-adopted noise control plan.\n  Section 825 of the conference report authorizes a commercial service \nairport that does not own the airport land and is a party to a long-\nterm lease with a Federal agency, such as the Department of the \nInterior, to restrict or prohibit Stage 2 aircraft weighing less than \n75,000 pounds, to help meet the noise control plan contained in its \nlease.\n  It is my understanding that the conferees did not intend to limit \napplication of section 825 to only those noise control measures that \nare expressly referred to as ``plans,'' but intended the term to refer \nto the range of noise control requirements and standards imposed by \nthese Federal lease agreements.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Wyoming is correct. The conferees \nintended ``plan'' to refer to the range of requirements and standards \ncontained in a Federal lease, which together constitute its plan to \nlimit airport-generated noise. Section 523 of the Senate bill, \nintroduced by the Senator from Wyoming, would have given similar \nauthority to the Jackson Hole Airport Board. The conference substitute \nwill permit the Jackson Hole Airport, and others if subject to similar \nFederal lease requirements, to adopt these measures.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Vision \n100-Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act. This bill authorizes \ncritical aviation infrastructure and operations spending for the fiscal \nyears 2004 through 2007. The bill also makes important legislative \nadjustments for our aviation security program at the Transportation \nSecurity Administration.\n  I represent a State with tens of thousands of aviation workers. I \nappreciate fully the essential contribution that our Nation's aviation \nindustry makes to our national economic prosperity. As the former \nchairman and now ranking member of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I spend a considerable amount of my time seeing to it \nthat the needs of our national aviation enterprise are adequately \nfunded.\n  As my colleagues are aware, consideration of this FAA authorization \nbill has been delayed for an extraordinary period of time over the \nissues surrounding the Bush administration's stated desire to privatize \ncertain aspects of our Nation's air traffic control system.\n  At one time, this legislation included language that specifically \nauthorized the FAA Administrator to privatize the controller workforce \nat scores of air traffic control towers, including the air traffic \ncontrol tower at Boeing Field in Seattle. Senators who are not familiar \nwith the geography of the greater Seattle area may not be aware that \nBoeing Field sits right between Seattle-Tacoma International Airport \nand downtown Seattle. It is extraordinarily close to our port, our \ncentral business district, our major sporting venues--Safeco Field and \nthe Seahawks Stadium. It is also a major installation for the Boeing \nCompany and a busy general aviation airport.\n\n[[Page S15390]]\n\n  In the wake of the events of September 11, 2001, I cannot support a \nproposal to contract out the air traffic control function to the lowest \nbidder in the heart of this critically important corridor.\n  Immediately after September 11, this Congress passed legislation to \ntake the air passenger screening function out of the hands of private \nbidders and place it in the hands of a federalized screening force. For \nthe life of me, I do not understand why the Bush administration wants \nto take the exact opposite approach when it comes to the highly skilled \npersonnel that actually control the movement of our aircraft.\n  The administration has also cited an interest in privatizing other \naspects of our Nation's national air traffic control enterprise, \nincluding the employees at our Nation's flight service stations and the \ntechnicians that maintain our Nation's air traffic control equipment.\n  These privatization ideas have not been adequately explained or \nadequately justified to the Congress or to the public. It has not been \ndetermined that such contracting out activities would actually improve \nupon the exemplary safety record that we currently enjoy with our air \ntraffic control system. I, along with many of my colleagues, have deep-\nseated doubts about the safety ramifications, the security \nramifications and whether there will be any real financial benefit to \nthe taxpayer as a result of such a privatization scheme. It was for \nthese reasons that I and 42 of my Senate colleagues, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, were required to vote against bringing debate on this bill \nto a close on November 17, and why I joined 55 of my colleagues in \nsupport of a measure to explicitly exclude privatization of our air \ntraffic control towers during the initial debate on the Senate bill. At \nthat time, we did not have what I considered to be adequate assurances \nfrom the FAA that they would not be launching into these privatization \nschemes in the very near future.\n  I am pleased that we have now overcome this hurdle and the \nadministration has given us assurances that they will not engage in any \ncompetition studies or outsourcing activities for air traffic \ncontrollers or for maintenance and technician personnel during fiscal \nyear 2004. This will give the Congress some time to review the \nadministration's plans in detail, which I intend to do during next \nyear's appropriations' hearings process. Also, with the written \nassurance now in hand that no outsourcing activities related to our air \ntraffic control system will take place in 2004, we can, if need be, \nwork on putting sufficient safeguards in the 2005 Transportation \nAppropriations Act if we feel that the administration is heading in the \nwrong direction when it comes to protecting safety and security.\n  It is for these reasons that I am relieved by the administration's \nnew letter on this topic which I understand has already been put into \nthe Record. I am glad that we have overcome this hurdle.\n  This bill will provide investments in critical infrastructure and \noperations at our Nation's airports. Furthermore, it will allocate \nneeded funding to continue our efforts to improve the security of \naviation system.\n  For these reasons, I support this important conference report today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request of the Senator \nfrom Maine is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I see the Senator from North Dakota. If \nthe Senator has a very brief comment to make, I yield to him.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Maine. Let me say with respect to the unanimous consent she just \noffered to pass the FAA conference report, I would like to say that \nSenator Lautenberg has led the fight in this Chamber to try to prevent \nthe privatization during this coming fiscal year of those who work for \nthe FAA. That fight required us to go through one cloture vote and the \nmajority did not invoke cloture. As a result, the FAA conference report \nwas not passed.\n  Since that time, I and Senators Lautenberg, Hollings, Lott, \nRockefeller and others have engaged in discussions with the \nadministration. I want to point out that the letter just printed in the \nRecord by unanimous consent is from Marion Blakey. She says:\n\n       During this fiscal year we have no plans to initiate \n     additional competitive sourcing studies, nor will we displace \n     FAA employees by entering into binding contracts to convert \n     to private entities any existing FAA position directly \n     related to our air traffic control system.\n\n  I point out that the reason we were able to move this conference \nreport tonight was because the administration has agreed they will not, \nduring this fiscal year, privatize those positions in the FAA. That is \na very important position, one that my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, \nfrom New Jersey, fought very hard for. We have achieved that commitment \nfrom the administration.\n  For that reason, we were able to move that FAA reauthorization. Let \nme say how pleased I am because it is so important to virtually every \nregion of this country. The investment in the Airport Improvement \nProgram and the other things that provide strength to the FAA system is \nvery important to our country.\n  Let me thank my colleague from Maine. I wanted to explain the \ncircumstances that have led to this point and especially say I have \nbeen pleased to work with Senator Lott, in many contacts over recent \ndays, to try to accomplish this and again say that my colleague from \nNew Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, deserves a pat on the back for forcing \nthis result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EFFECT ON OTHER LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this Act limits the authority of the National \n     Capital Planning Commission.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent to engage \nin a colloquy with the Senator from Alaska, and I yield to the Senator \nfrom Alaska for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \ntoday and engage in this colloquy with the Senator from Maine. I thank \nthe Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak about opening a \nNational Women's History Museum near the National Mall.\n  Currently, the National Women's History Museum is without a home. It \nis accessible online, but Americans need a physical location for the \nNational Women's History Museum so a history from every State can be \ncollected, viewed, and analyzed.\n  Recognizing the Senator from Maine and this Senator from Alaska have \na connection, both of us coming from Northern States, both of us coming \nfrom States with populations that are relatively small, both States \nhave a history that demonstrates a history of pioneering women. Alaska \nand Maine have historically afforded opportunities that might not be \navailable to women in other States.\n  Throughout Alaska's and Maine's history, women have had perhaps more \nopportunities because our populations are isolated, and you are forced \nto be a little more self-reliant.\n  Women of Alaska and Maine, as their male counterparts, are ingrained \nwith the ability to make do with what we have. I ask the Senator from \nMaine if she would agree with some of my statements?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I certainly do agree with the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska. Both of us have had the opportunity \nto serve in public office. Both of us come from States that are small \nin population but large in the impact that women have had on our \nNation's history. We are from States with rich histories of \naccomplishments by women of all backgrounds and cultures.\n  For example, the legendary Senator Margaret Chase Smith was the first \nwoman in history to serve in both the U.S. House and the Senate.\n  Pauline Elizabeth Hopkins, who has been called the dean of African-\nAmerican Women Writers, and who has been considered one of the most \nprolific black female writers in the beginning of the 1900s, was born \nin Portland, ME.\n  Mary Gabriel, of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, was a famous Native-\nAmerican basket weaver, largely credited with reviving the art in the \nState of Maine.\n  Brenda Commander is the first woman to be elected as chief of Maine's \nMaliseet Indian Tribe.\n  Is the Senator from Alaska aware of similar accomplishments by \nAlaskan women?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. We have a history, as I have said, of pioneering \nwomen, women who perhaps have done the unexpected, who have reached out \ninto areas that we would not anticipate, at a time we would not \nanticipate, women such as Kate Carmack, who is especially important in \nAlaska's history. Kate was an Athabascan woman who married an American \ntrader. She is actually credited with discovering the first gold in \nBonanza Creek, which started the Alaska gold rush in 1896.\n  As the story is told, when Kate first discovered the gold, it was \nfrozen in\n\n[[Page S15392]]\n\nthe mud. Kate and her husband did not have the grub stake, if you will. \nThey did not have the cash necessary to do the digout that winter. So \nthey literally were sitting on the largest gold discovery in history. \nKate's resourcefulness as a skin sower and her skill as an outdoorsman \nearned enough cash for the family to pull together that grub stake to \nhit ``pay dirt'' when the ground thawed the next spring.\n  When we think of women like Kate Carmack in Alaska, who braved some \npretty tough, some pretty difficult conditions, I ask the Senator from \nMaine if she has any similar stories from her State?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I certainly do. That is a wonderful story of a truly \ncourageous woman.\n  We have many women such as that throughout Maine's history. Josephine \nPeary was one such woman. She was married to the great explorer, Robert \nE. Peary, who was the first to reach the North Pole, not that far from \nAlaska. They lived together on Eagle Island in Casco Bay, ME. Josephine \nbegan exploring when she accompanied her husband to Greenland on a \njourney sponsored by the Academy of Natural Sciences that would last \nfor a year and a half. That travel, in 1892, made Josephine the first \nwoman in history to be a member of an Arctic exploration team.\n  I understand that women in Alaska also have been pioneers in \nexpanding opportunities for women to work outside of the home. I wonder \nif the Senator from Alaska might expand on that.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. We have a lot of firsts that, again, when we look at \nAlaska's history and recognize we did not become a State until 1959, it \nis a very recent history, but yet women's involvement in some very \nimportant firsts have gone back so many years prior to statehood it \nreally gets your attention.\n  Historically, Alaskan women were employed in jobs that women in other \nareas of the country could only dream about. In 1915, Anchorage \nemployed its first female principal in the Anchorage School District, \nour largest community now, 3 years before World War I and 5 years \nbefore women's suffrage was ratified.\n  A year later, 1916, and still 4 years before national women's \nsuffrage passed, Lena Morrow Lewis is believed to be the first woman to \ncampaign for Alaska's territorial seat in the U.S. Congress. She did \nnot win, but she was certainly followed by other pioneering women in \nthe workforce.\n  Marvel Crosson was the first female licensed pilot in Alaska in 1927. \nMildred Herman became the first woman admitted to the Alaska Bar \nAssociation in 1934. And Barbara Washburn was the first woman to climb \nMount McKinley, the tallest mountain in North America.\n  This is all long before Alaska became a State. Other opportunities \nfor women, as we flip through the history books, become very apparent. \nA woman by the name of Nell Scott became the first woman to serve in \nthe Alaska State legislature in 1937. This was a year before the \nNational Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was passed, which established \na minimum wage.\n  Blanche McSmith was the first Black woman to serve in the Alaska \nState legislature. Sadie Neakok was the first Native Alaskan woman to \nserve as a magistrate in Alaska in 1960, during the same time period \nwhen the struggle for civil rights was raging in the South. Blanche and \nSadie began serving in Alaska in very prominent roles 4 years before \nthe Civil Rights Act was passed.\n  Could the Senator from Maine describe for me some of the pioneering \nwomen in her State.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would love to share that information with the Senator \nfrom Alaska. It is just fascinating to hear the many firsts that women \nfrom her State have established.\n  The Senator from Alaska obviously has a great deal of pride in the \nhistory of women in her State.\n  In Maine, too, we have women who have played influential roles \nthroughout history, but especially in the field of literature.\n  I am sure all of my colleagues know well the story of Harriet \nBeecher. She wrote ``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in 1850 while pregnant with \nher seventh child. She began writing the book while residing in \nBrunswick, ME. Her deep religious faith and dedication to bringing to \nlight the problems with slavery encouraged ``Hattie'' to write with \nsuch passion that she quickly finished and continued to write an \naverage of a book a year to support her family.\n  Another famous Mainer, Martha Ballard, also made important \ncontributions. She lived in Hallowell, ME, and was a midwife and a \nhealer. She faithfully maintained a diary from 1785 to 1812, and her \nmeticulous records have provided us with a rare glimpse into the daily \nlife in Maine in the late 1700s and the early 1800s. Her contributions \nand life were only recently highlighted when Laurel Ulrich documented \nher work in a Pulitzer Prize winning book ``The Midwife's Tale.''\n\n  America's first female novelist, Sally Sayward Barrell, also known as \nMadam Wood, was born in York, ME, in the southern tip of our State. She \nwrote five gothic novels, first under the signature of ``A Lady of \nMassachusetts,'' and then, later, under the signature of ``A Lady of \nMaine'' when Maine was granted statehood in 1820.\n  Another pioneering woman was Dorothea Dix. She was born in Hampden, \nME, in 1802, and is considered a groundbreaking reformer in the area of \ntreatment for individuals suffering from mental illness. She traveled \nthe Nation advocating for a more compassionate, holistic approach to \nthe treatment of those suffering from mental illness. She was truly \nahead of her time. She also successfully lobbied Congress to establish \nthe first and only national Federal mental health facility which would \nbecome a world premiere mental health and research center.\n  I ask my colleague to further expand on how Alaska has supported \nwomen and their accomplishments.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Well, as the Senator has noted, her home State of \nMaine and Alaska both have a very rich history of groundbreaking women, \nwomen who have been pioneers, women who have reached out. I think our \nStates have demonstrated the very supportive nature of moving women \nforward in their prosperity.\n  In Alaska, as a for instance, since we are talking about ``for \ninstances and firsts,'' the very first bill ever passed by the \nTerritory of Alaska was the Shoup women's suffrage bill in 1913.\n  That was our first bill as it related to women's rights. Seven years \nbefore women's suffrage was ratified in the rest of the country and 46 \nyears before Alaska became a State, our territorial legislature's first \nbill was related to women's rights.\n  I ask the Senator from Maine, in terms of your role model throughout \nyour political career, who would you cite as that role model, that \nindividual?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would reply to my friend and colleague from Alaska \nthat my role model and inspiration was the great Senator Margaret Chase \nSmith. She served as Senator from Maine the entire time I was growing \nup. She served in the Senate from 1949 to 1972. I realize how fortunate \nI was to have as a role model this courageous, smart, and brave woman \nwho did so much and set so many firsts for America. I have often \nthought that the path for my colleague Olympia Snowe and myself to the \nSenate was paved by the remarkable Senator Margaret Chase Smith.\n  I remember well my very first meeting with Senator Smith. I was a \nsenior in high school. I was in Washington for a special program, and \nshe spent nearly 2 hours talking with me. She talked about national \ndefense, her service on the Armed Services Committee and, most of all, \nabout her decision to speak out against the excesses of Joseph \nMcCarthy. That was an extraordinarily brave thing to do, but it was \ntypical of Senator Smith, who had a courageous and independent spirit.\n  She was the first to do so many things. She was the first Republican \nSenator elected to the Senate. I would note that when I was elected to \nthe Senate, Maine became the first State to send two Republican women \nto the Senate to serve at the same time. She was the first woman to \nserve in both the House and the Senate. She was the first woman to be \nbacked by a major political party in a Presidential election. Long \nafter it became commonplace for women to serve in the highest ranks of \nour Government, Senator Smith will always be acknowledged and \nremembered and honored in Maine for her dignity and her courage.\n\n[[Page S15393]]\n\n  Although I didn't realize it at the time, when I look back at her \nmeeting with me, I realize that that was the first step in a journey \nthat led me to run for her seat 25 years later. I am so proud to hold \nthe seat once held by the legendary Senator Margaret Chase Smith.\n  Women such as those the Senator from Alaska has spoken of and whom I \nhave talked about today are the reason we are so proud to sponsor a \nbill that, at no cost to the taxpayers, directs that the Old Post \nOffice Annex be made available to house the National Women's History \nMuseum. We need a place for our country to honor the contributions of \nwomen, particularly for young girls who are coming to Washington to be \nable to go to this museum and learn about some of the remarkable women \nwho have changed American history, about whom the Senator from Alaska \nand I have talked today. Women's history needs a place in our capital \nand in our collective American history.\n  I ask my colleague from Alaska if she would agree with that \nsentiment. She has been such a leader in getting this bill through.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I couldn't agree more with the Senator from Maine. \nJust in the discussion we have had this evening about some of the women \nfrom my State and their pioneering enterprises and hearing the stories \nabout the women of Maine, I would love to be able to go somewhere and \nspend the time to do more research, to find out more about these \npioneering women, not only in Alaska and Maine but all of the States in \nbetween. By having the women's history museum here in Washington, DC, \nwe will be able to do that.\n\n  Women have played such a crucial role in the development of my State, \nas you have heard, and certainly in the development of yours. By \nencouraging women's history of all of our respective States, we can see \nand celebrate this common history from as far apart as Maine to the \neast and Alaska in the west.\n  Those frontier women, women of independent spirit, demonstrated self-\nreliance, themes that embody all American women and the American \nspirit. I, too, am most proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and thank \nthe Senator from Maine for her leadership in moving this forward so \nthat we do have a place to house these great collections.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for \nparticipating in this discussion tonight. She certainly continues that \nproud tradition in Alaska of women who have made a real difference. I \nam honored to serve with her. She does an extraordinary job. I also \nthink we would be remiss in not recognizing the contributions of our \nPresiding Officer today, the Senator from North Carolina, Mrs. Dole, \nwho also has established so many firsts in American history. I know \nthat she, too, will be prominently featured in this museum once it \ncomes about.\n  I think we can take great pride in being here tonight and knowing we \nhave passed this legislation unanimously.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15393-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15393-S15394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, tonight we got some good news. I \nwant to just say a few words about the FAA bill because we have \nresolved the issue on air traffic control. The good news is that \ntonight we scored a victory, a victory for safety and a victory for \nhomeland security.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I held up the FAA traffic control bill \nin order to get some assurance that the safety and security of the \nflying public would not be jeopardized by the privatization of the air \ntraffic control system. I am pleased to announce that we have now \nreceived an assurance from the administration regarding fiscal year \n2004. Until the end of this fiscal year, the administration has agreed \nnot to privatize any components of our air traffic control system. The \ncontrollers are protected, the technicians are protected, the flight \nservice station controllers--all of those units that make up the air \ntraffic control system--are protected. We have a letter stating the \nadministration's assurance.\n  Some of my colleagues have asked why I was doing this: Why do you \nfeel so strongly about it? I put it in personal terms. I told them: \nBecause I don't want my grandchildren or your grandchildren or the \ngrandchildren of our constituents put in danger by a risky \nprivatization scheme. That is what was at stake here.\n  I extend my thanks to many of my colleagues for their support in this \nfight, specifically our Commerce Committee ranking member, Senator \nHollings, and the subcommittee ranking member, Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Dorgan, and the leader and assistant leader of our caucus, \nSenators Daschle and Reid. They always stayed strong and said ``safety \nfirst.''\n  Senator Lott has been an honest broker throughout this process. He \nkept the discussions alive.\n  It was a tough fight. But at the heart of this fight was the reality \nthat it was a bipartisan decision. In June of this year, 11 Republicans \nvoted to prevent privatization, to stand up for safety. I know we often \nget pressured to vote with our caucus or vote with our party's \nPresident, but sometimes you just have to stand up for your \nconstituents' safety, and that is what my Republican friends did here.\n  Within days of returning to the Senate earlier this year, I learned \nthat the administration intended, through this A-76 process, to \nprivatize air traffic control. In my previous 18 years, I had an active \ninterest in aviation and the air traffic control system. But the moment \nI learned of the administration's actions, I knew I would spend much of \nthis year fighting to prevent that action from taking place. We won a \nSenate vote to prevent privatization. We fought off the terrible first \nconference report. We fought the pending conference report until we \nreceived the assurances that we got tonight.\n  But the fight is not over, and I will continue to push for a \npermanent prohibition. In the words of California's current Governor, \nI'll be back. We are going to fight this again, and we will keep \nfighting it until it goes away for good.\n  I am reminded, 700 million people fly in our skies every year, \nroughly 2 million a day. Our system is going to be pushed to the limits \nof capacity in these next couple of weeks in what will be the busiest \ntravel day of the year. I hope travelers will rest assured knowing that \ncontrol of the skies will be in the hands of professionals, the \nGovernment employees who make up the air traffic control system.\n\n  This is the greatest air traffic control system in the world, most \nsafe, most efficient. There are 15,000 Federal air traffic controllers \nand thousands of professional systems specialists and flight service \nstation controllers. These are the men and women who keep our skies \nsafe and secure.\n  But there are some obvious lessons we need to heed, those of \nSeptember 11, when the air traffic control system worked flawlessly to \nbring home safely some 5,000 airplanes in just a couple of hours. These \nare the lessons from other countries that have tried this. They were \nleft with just what could be expected: Less safety, more delays, and \nmore cost in the end.\n  There are lessons from the space program.\n  I look forward to examining these issues during the policy debate to \nwhich our chairman is committed. I hope there can be an adequate \ndiscussion for the American people so they can learn how, after next \nyear, the White House proposes to put their safety and security at \nrisk--if they do, all for the benefit of the profit motive.\n  I would like to mention one other item in this bill that is of \nparticular importance to the State of New Jersey. Our great State has a \nproud history of aviation with a number of public use airports. \nCertainly the occupant of the chair understands since aviation in \nAlaska is the lifeblood of that beautiful State. Our great State has a \nproud history with a number of public use airports, and now some of \nthese airports are disappearing, giving way to urban sprawl and \ndevelopment. To help stem this problem, a key provision in this bill \nestablishes a pilot program\n\n[[Page S15394]]\n\nwhich offers additional tools to States to enable them to preserve \nthese public use airports. I am hopeful this program will be used to \nkeep these important facilities for general aviation, corporate, and \nagricultural uses, and the medevac and firefighting uses which depend \non sufficient airport facilities to continue to operate.\n  I commend the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Chairman McCain, \nfor working with me on this provision.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a brave \nyoung man who just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq. Rodney \n``Jimmy'' Estes II is from my hometown of Louisville, KY. A few months \nago, Jimmy was dressed in fatigues fighting the war on terror in the \nIraqi desert. But today, you can find him wearing red and white and \nplaying football for the University of Louisville Cardinals--my \nfavorite team.\n  Jimmy Estes, a 1998 graduate of St. Xavier High School, turned down a \nfootball scholarship to Georgetown College to follow in his \ngrandfather's footsteps--to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. The day \nafter graduation, he left Kentucky for boot camp at Parris Island. And \non January 7, 2003, Jimmy was called to active duty.\n  As a member of the Alpha Company, 8th Tank Battalion, Jimmy was on \nthe front lines in An Nasiriyah, Iraq. During his time in the country, \nhe experienced some of the war's most intense fighting. In his tank, he \nworked as the loader and operated the 240-millimeter gun on top of the \nvehicle. Jimmy and his comrades are unsung heroes in one of our troops' \nfinest hours. They were the lead tank in the rescue mission of PVT \nJessica Lynch.\n  To pass the hours in Iraq, Jimmy played football with his fellow \nsoldiers, reminding him of his lifelong dream--to play football for the \nUniversity of Louisville Cardinals. Following his tour of duty, which \nended this past May, Jimmy returned home and enrolled at U of L. \nDetermined to play football, Jimmy spent his summer preparing to try \nout for one of four walk-on positions. And just like on the \nbattlefield, Jimmy succeeded. Not only is he a wide receiver on his \nuniversity's football team, he also continues to serve his Nation as a \nMarine reservist.\n  Jimmy's bravery, humility, and determination should be commended. On \nbehalf of this grateful Nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nthanking Corporal Estes for his dedicated service. As a proud U of L \nalum and most importantly, a football fan, I wish Jimmy and his \nteammates a winning season. Go Cards!\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article, ``For Jimmy Estes, that was \nwar; this is football'' from my hometown paper, The Courier-Journal, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Oct. 10, 2003]\n\n            For Jimmy Estes, That Was War; This Is Football\n\n                             (By Pat Forde)\n\n       The war wasn't so bad until bedtime.\n       Jimmy Estes spent the dusty desert days in the company of \n     his M1A1 Abrams tank crew or with the other members of Alpha \n     Company, 8th Tank Battalion. On the dull days the Marines \n     opened care packages or talked about family, sports and what \n     they'd give for cold water and hot showers. On the deadly \n     days they went out and killed Iraqis because it was their \n     job, and when the battles around An Nasiriyah were done, the \n     soldiers rehashed them in detached terms.\n       But at the end of the day, when Cpl. Rodney J. Estes II \n     would lie down and stare up at the inky Arabian night, he was \n     alone with the whole thing. It was just him and the horror: \n     the dead women and children, the dogs tugging at corpses, the \n     Iraqis he personally shot in combat, the bullets they shot at \n     him that pinged off the tank's armor.\n       It was just him and the heroism: Estes and his mates rode \n     the lead tank on the famous Jessica Lynch rescue mission, \n     laying down fire and securing the perimeter before Army \n     Rangers and Navy SEALs went into Saddam Hussein General \n     Hospital to retrieve America's most famous POW.\n       He took all of it to bed with him.\n       ``Those were some lonely nights,'' Estes said.\n       It was during those lonely nights that he made a vow: ``If \n     I get out of here and make it home alive, I'm going to do it. \n     ``\n       Go to college. And play football. For his hometown team, \n     the University of Louisville.\n       Today Jimmy Estes is alive and well and a 23-year-old walk-\n     on wide receiver for the Cardinals.\n       He saw enough death in the desert to learn that dreams can \n     come with an expiration date--probably not one of your \n     choosing. A young man who had drifted along without plan or \n     purpose since graduating from St.Xavier High School in 1998 \n     had an epiphany in Iraq.\n       ``Absolutely, it changed me,'' said Estes, who hadn't \n     played organized football in six years. ``I kind of piddled \n     around at jobs here and there, not anything I'd call a \n     career. If I hadn't gotten deployed, to be honest, I don't \n     know where I'd be right now.\n       ``I don't take things for granted like I used to. I realize \n     how lucky I am. I realize life can end.''\n       Now his life is just restarting. He is a justice \n     administration major in the classroom, with designs on \n     becoming a football coach. On the field he is a humble \n     freshman who hasn't even dressed out for a game.\n       Yet there is no bigger hero in the U of L football program.\n       Said offensive lineman Will Rabatin, Estes' friend since \n     grade school: ``I'm proud to know him.''\n       No more proud than Estes is to have this long-shot college \n     football experience. Think of all the coddled athletes out \n     there, complaining that a full ride isn't enough. Then listen \n     to Estes, who's been through more than those guys can ever \n     imagine and now cherishes the chance to pay his way \n     through college and play on the scout team.\n       ``He's just a great kid to have around,'' said offensive \n     coordinator and wide receivers coach Paul Petrino. ``Every \n     day when we start out doing ball drills, he has a lot of \n     enthusiasm, a lot of fire. You can tell he loves being \n     here.''\n       ``I look forward to going out there every day,'' Estes \n     said. ``I really appreciate the opportunity. It's just so \n     great to be a part of it.''\n       In the weeks before the invasion of Iraq, the Marines \n     played touch football in Kuwait all the time. Tankers against \n     tank maintenance. In combat boots. In the desert.\n       Talk about your sandlot games.\n       For Estes, this was a continuation of his life long love of \n     sports. When he played flag football in grade school, all the \n     kids on the sidelines were squirting each other with water \n     bottles, oblivious to the game. Jimmy was running the \n     sidelines, keeping pace with the action and imploring his \n     coaches to put him in.\n       When he was 6 he persuaded his father, Rodney, a retired \n     Louisville police officer, to get him out of school early for \n     the first two days of the NCAA basketball tournament. Jimmy \n     sat in front of the television from noon until midnight each \n     day, transfixed.\n       At age 7 he was reading Sports Illustrated cover to cover.\n       Later on he played at St. Martha for Rabatin's father, once \n     catching the winning\n\n[[Page S15395]]\n\n     touchdown pass in the Toy Bowl. Then it was on to St. X, \n     where he played little his final year after a disagreement \n     with the coaches.\n       ``He just didn't have a positive experience,'' his father \n     said. ``Part of that was his fault.''\n       Estes' only football option was a partial scholarship to \n     Georgetown College. He turned it down to follow in his \n     grandfather's footsteps--into the Marine Corps and into a \n     tank.\n       ``That broke my heart when he didn't take that scholarship \n     to Georgetown,'' Rodney Estes said. ``You know how you \n     envision going down there on Saturdays to watch your son and \n     walk around campus?''\n       Instead, a day after graduation from St. X, Estes was off \n     to Parris Island for boot camp as a Marine reservist. Higher \n     education--and football--flickered out of sight.\n       In 1999 he had talked to UofL assistant Greg Nord and then-\n     coach John L. Smith about walking on, but he never followed \n     through. He worked a job here and a job there and performed \n     his duties with the reserves. Life was standing still.\n       ``He kind of had his head up his--in other words,'' said \n     Lance Cpl. Nick Rassano, a 2000 Trinity graduate who was in \n     the same tank in the Middle East with Estes.\n       Then last Jan. 7, the phone rang at Ruby Tuesday, where \n     Estes was bartending. The order was expected but still \n     jarring: Report for active duty.\n       He told his family the news at dinner that night. Two days \n     later he was gone--but not without some prescient final words \n     from his father.\n       ``Remember,'' Rodney Estes told his oldest son, ``the way \n     you handle yourself out there probably says a lot about how \n     you'll handle the rest of your life.''\n       First stop was Camp Lejeune, N.C. Then he was on a ship 30 \n     days to Kuwait, for a month of preparation, some touch \n     football and the last decent meals for a long time.\n       Finally, after a month in Kuwait, Estes and the rest of the \n     American military force invaded Iraq.\n       ``I was a policeman 25 years, and I'm not the kind of guy \n     who gets overly worried,'' Rodney Estes said. ``But I tell \n     you, that night he left I thought, `This could be the last \n     night I ever see him.' When your own kid goes off, that puts \n     you through some changes.\n       ``I'd wake up in the middle of the night and watch CNN. I \n     watched so much TV I was about to drive myself crazy.''\n       Over in Iraq, the A-8 Marines were pushing hard toward An \n     Nasiriyah and what ultimately would be some of the most \n     intense fighting of the war. The first day of combat was the \n     worst, as Estes watched a rocket-propelled grenade blow up an \n     American vehicle and kill several soldiers.\n       He said they arrived in the area to find the streets \n     flooded with sewage that stalled half of Alpha Company's 14 \n     tanks--including his, christened the ``Think Tank'' because \n     of the crew's propensity for making maintenance errors.\n       When the tanks bogged down, the Iraqis lit up. They were \n     firing on foot, from orange-and-white taxis and from SUVs.\n       Estes was the loader in his tank but also was charged with \n     manning the 240-millimeter gun on top of the vehicle. With \n     the upper half of his body in view, he exchanged fire with \n     the enemy.\n       Welcome to the terror and exhilaration of warfare, Cpl. \n     Estes.\n       ``It was a heck of an adrenaline rush,'' he said. ``I was \n     scared, excited, all those things. I think of it like going \n     into a big game, only times 100. Obviously, the stakes are \n     much higher.\n       ``You get a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach. I \n     didn't freeze or tense up, but I definitely had \n     butterflies.''\n       Asked if he personally shot anyone, Estes looked down \n     briefly and answered yes. There was no bravado in his voice.\n       ``The first time you see somebody get hit with a round is a \n     crazy feeling,'' he said. ``It's a sick feeling. But when you \n     sign up to be a Marine, that's something you obviously know \n     can be part of the job.\n       ``I can't sit here and describe the feelings you get. I can \n     tell you what I saw, but in no way does it simulate what it \n     was like.''\n       There is no simulation. Just late-night assimilation--\n     alone, lying on your back and staring at the sky in a strange \n     and dangerous land.\n       One day the Think Tank crewmen got the call to be part of a \n     hush-hush mission. They were to be the lead among three tanks \n     escorting a group of Special Ops forces into town. It had the \n     potential to be dangerous. Estes' tank commander had him \n     clear out space inside the tank, in case they needed it to \n     transport bodies.\n       They originally were told that the target was a Saddam \n     look-alike. They had no idea that they were going to play a \n     part in the most dramatic--and later controversial--event in \n     the war.\n       In the early hours of April 1, their tank led a group of \n     other vehicles carrying Special Operation Unit Task Force 20 \n     into Nasiriyah, storming into position around the hospital. \n     Night-vision goggles on, Estes laid down suppression fire \n     with the 240-mm gun for a few minutes and set up a perimeter \n     before the Rangers and SEALs went in.\n       Lynch was rushed out and loaded onto a helicopter, though \n     most involved in the rescue still didn't know the particulars \n     of what happened. Estes' tank remained in position for hours \n     afterward.\n       At one point he was told to hand some Special Ops soldiers \n     a tank shovel. They used it to dig up a shallow grave outside \n     the hospital, locating the bodies of several Americans from \n     Lynch's 507th Maintenance Company.\n       It wasn't until days later that the Think Tank crew was \n     able to piece together the story and realize that their \n     mission was the rescue dominating news coverage at home.\n       ``We didn't realize how big a deal it was until we saw it \n     on the cover of Newsweek,'' Rassano said.\n       To Estes the mission was important for one other reason: He \n     never again discharged his weapon. A series of moves to other \n     cities resulted in nothing more noteworthy than a couple of \n     utterly uneventful weeks guarding a bridge.\n       With the action centralizing on Baghdad, there wasn't much \n     to do other than reading the Sports Illustrateds and eating \n     the beef jerky sent from home. Finally, Alpha Company pulled \n     out and returned to Kuwait on May 5.\n       The war was over for Cpl. Estes. It was time to act on his \n     vow.\n       During the interminable 38-day voyage back to America, \n     Estes e-mailed his father and told him his plans: He was \n     going to enroll at U of L and walk on to the football team. \n     Rodney Estes was thrilled.\n       Jimmy returned to Kentucky on July 2, and he and the rest \n     of his battalion were feted at Fort Knox. He obviously was \n     thrilled to see his family--his father, mother, stepmother, \n     stepsister and two half-siblings.\n       Especially his 11-year-old half-sister, Jennifer Estes. He \n     thought of her often when he saw children her age caught in \n     the calamity of war.\n       ``He's crazy about her,'' Jimmy's dad said. ``He's not \n     exactly a sensitive kid by any stretch of the imagination, \n     but I think some of the things he saw over there affected \n     him.''\n       To help put the war behind, Estes plunged into his future \n     plans. After about a week of acclimation, he began working \n     out six days a week toward his goal of becoming a Cardinal.\n       A depressing and debilitating diet of MREs--the scarcely \n     edible Meals Ready to Eat--had killed his appetite. By the \n     end of the war Estes could eat barely half an MRE a day, and \n     he lost a significant amount of weight and muscle mass.\n       But that could be overcome with work, and he was driven. \n     His first couple of calls to U of L graduate assistant Sam \n     Adams, in charge of the walk-on program, went unreturned. \n     Finally, Adams called back.\n       He said that Estes couldn't walk on until classes started, \n     but in the meantime the coaches wanted to look at some \n     videotape of him. He had nothing significant to show since \n     his days on the St. X junior varsity. Nevertheless, Adams \n     told him to report for a one-day group tryout.\n       Estes arrived in excellent physical condition, performed \n     well in the fitness tests and was one of four walk-ons chosen \n     for the team. After U of L upset Kentucky to open the season \n     Aug. 31, he reported for his first practice as a Louisville \n     Cardinal.\n       ``It was awesome that first day, just putting on the \n     equipment again,'' he said. ``I was looking around saying, \n     `I'm playing with a Division I football program. Four months \n     ago I was shooting at Iraqis running around with AK-47s.' ''\n       Today life is easy. The 18-hour days don't pile up for \n     weeks on end. The food is edible. There are no tank repairs, \n     no missions, no imminent danger.\n       The load so many student-athletes find so difficult is like \n     vacation to Jimmy Estes.\n       ``All you've got to do is go to class and play football,'' \n     Rassano said. ``That's got to be the easiest thing he's done \n     all year. After going through there, everything's easier.\n       ``The whole experience kind of straightened him out. I'm \n     real proud of Jimmy.''\n       A good many Cardinals have no idea what Estes was going \n     through while they were in spring practice. But a few have \n     seen the USMC tattoo on the 5-foot-11, 200-pound \n     receiver's left shoulder and inquired, and a few others \n     have heard a story or two about the walk-on soldier.\n       He doesn't hide his history, but he doesn't broadcast it, \n     either. He's not looking for hero status in the locker room.\n       ``The coaches can't give me any special treatment, and I \n     don't want it,'' he said. ``I'd always heard stories of \n     people coming back (from a war) and thinking the world owed \n     them something, or they were messed up mentally. I didn't \n     want that. I just wanted to make that experience a \n     positive.''\n       U of L will play Army tomorrow. Estes has been where none \n     of the celebrated West Pointers has gone yet: into combat for \n     his country.\n       He is a Cardinal worthy of a salute from the Cadets.\n       Yet he wasn't even supposed to be at the stadium. Instead, \n     he was scheduled for real military work: a reunion with Alpha \n     Company at Fort Knox for their first weekend of reservist \n     training since the war.\n       But at practice yesterday head coach Bobby Petrino informed \n     Estes that he will be dressing out and joining the squad if \n     he can get a furlough from Marine drills.\n       Estes plans to wear two uniforms tomorrow; he'll be in Papa \n     John's Cardinal Stadium in the afternoon after meeting up \n     with his mates in the morning. He's looking forward to seeing \n     the men with whom he shared a life-altering experience--and \n     telling them about his college football career.\n       ``I don't think a whole lot of them really believed me,'' \n     he said with a smile.\n       But it's true. A desert dream that materialized on lonely \n     nights under an inky Arabian sky has come true.\n\n[[Page S15396]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15394-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15394-S15396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO CPL RODNEY ``JIMMY'' ESTES II\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a brave \nyoung man who just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq. Rodney \n``Jimmy'' Estes II is from my hometown of Louisville, KY. A few months \nago, Jimmy was dressed in fatigues fighting the war on terror in the \nIraqi desert. But today, you can find him wearing red and white and \nplaying football for the University of Louisville Cardinals--my \nfavorite team.\n  Jimmy Estes, a 1998 graduate of St. Xavier High School, turned down a \nfootball scholarship to Georgetown College to follow in his \ngrandfather's footsteps--to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. The day \nafter graduation, he left Kentucky for boot camp at Parris Island. And \non January 7, 2003, Jimmy was called to active duty.\n  As a member of the Alpha Company, 8th Tank Battalion, Jimmy was on \nthe front lines in An Nasiriyah, Iraq. During his time in the country, \nhe experienced some of the war's most intense fighting. In his tank, he \nworked as the loader and operated the 240-millimeter gun on top of the \nvehicle. Jimmy and his comrades are unsung heroes in one of our troops' \nfinest hours. They were the lead tank in the rescue mission of PVT \nJessica Lynch.\n  To pass the hours in Iraq, Jimmy played football with his fellow \nsoldiers, reminding him of his lifelong dream--to play football for the \nUniversity of Louisville Cardinals. Following his tour of duty, which \nended this past May, Jimmy returned home and enrolled at U of L. \nDetermined to play football, Jimmy spent his summer preparing to try \nout for one of four walk-on positions. And just like on the \nbattlefield, Jimmy succeeded. Not only is he a wide receiver on his \nuniversity's football team, he also continues to serve his Nation as a \nMarine reservist.\n  Jimmy's bravery, humility, and determination should be commended. On \nbehalf of this grateful Nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nthanking Corporal Estes for his dedicated service. As a proud U of L \nalum and most importantly, a football fan, I wish Jimmy and his \nteammates a winning season. Go Cards!\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article, ``For Jimmy Estes, that was \nwar; this is football'' from my hometown paper, The Courier-Journal, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Oct. 10, 2003]\n\n            For Jimmy Estes, That Was War; This Is Football\n\n                             (By Pat Forde)\n\n       The war wasn't so bad until bedtime.\n       Jimmy Estes spent the dusty desert days in the company of \n     his M1A1 Abrams tank crew or with the other members of Alpha \n     Company, 8th Tank Battalion. On the dull days the Marines \n     opened care packages or talked about family, sports and what \n     they'd give for cold water and hot showers. On the deadly \n     days they went out and killed Iraqis because it was their \n     job, and when the battles around An Nasiriyah were done, the \n     soldiers rehashed them in detached terms.\n       But at the end of the day, when Cpl. Rodney J. Estes II \n     would lie down and stare up at the inky Arabian night, he was \n     alone with the whole thing. It was just him and the horror: \n     the dead women and children, the dogs tugging at corpses, the \n     Iraqis he personally shot in combat, the bullets they shot at \n     him that pinged off the tank's armor.\n       It was just him and the heroism: Estes and his mates rode \n     the lead tank on the famous Jessica Lynch rescue mission, \n     laying down fire and securing the perimeter before Army \n     Rangers and Navy SEALs went into Saddam Hussein General \n     Hospital to retrieve America's most famous POW.\n       He took all of it to bed with him.\n       ``Those were some lonely nights,'' Estes said.\n       It was during those lonely nights that he made a vow: ``If \n     I get out of here and make it home alive, I'm going to do it. \n     ``\n       Go to college. And play football. For his hometown team, \n     the University of Louisville.\n       Today Jimmy Estes is alive and well and a 23-year-old walk-\n     on wide receiver for the Cardinals.\n       He saw enough death in the desert to learn that dreams can \n     come with an expiration date--probably not one of your \n     choosing. A young man who had drifted along without plan or \n     purpose since graduating from St.Xavier High School in 1998 \n     had an epiphany in Iraq.\n       ``Absolutely, it changed me,'' said Estes, who hadn't \n     played organized football in six years. ``I kind of piddled \n     around at jobs here and there, not anything I'd call a \n     career. If I hadn't gotten deployed, to be honest, I don't \n     know where I'd be right now.\n       ``I don't take things for granted like I used to. I realize \n     how lucky I am. I realize life can end.''\n       Now his life is just restarting. He is a justice \n     administration major in the classroom, with designs on \n     becoming a football coach. On the field he is a humble \n     freshman who hasn't even dressed out for a game.\n       Yet there is no bigger hero in the U of L football program.\n       Said offensive lineman Will Rabatin, Estes' friend since \n     grade school: ``I'm proud to know him.''\n       No more proud than Estes is to have this long-shot college \n     football experience. Think of all the coddled athletes out \n     there, complaining that a full ride isn't enough. Then listen \n     to Estes, who's been through more than those guys can ever \n     imagine and now cherishes the chance to pay his way \n     through college and play on the scout team.\n       ``He's just a great kid to have around,'' said offensive \n     coordinator and wide receivers coach Paul Petrino. ``Every \n     day when we start out doing ball drills, he has a lot of \n     enthusiasm, a lot of fire. You can tell he loves being \n     here.''\n       ``I look forward to going out there every day,'' Estes \n     said. ``I really appreciate the opportunity. It's just so \n     great to be a part of it.''\n       In the weeks before the invasion of Iraq, the Marines \n     played touch football in Kuwait all the time. Tankers against \n     tank maintenance. In combat boots. In the desert.\n       Talk about your sandlot games.\n       For Estes, this was a continuation of his life long love of \n     sports. When he played flag football in grade school, all the \n     kids on the sidelines were squirting each other with water \n     bottles, oblivious to the game. Jimmy was running the \n     sidelines, keeping pace with the action and imploring his \n     coaches to put him in.\n       When he was 6 he persuaded his father, Rodney, a retired \n     Louisville police officer, to get him out of school early for \n     the first two days of the NCAA basketball tournament. Jimmy \n     sat in front of the television from noon until midnight each \n     day, transfixed.\n       At age 7 he was reading Sports Illustrated cover to cover.\n       Later on he played at St. Martha for Rabatin's father, once \n     catching the winning\n\n[[Page S15395]]\n\n     touchdown pass in the Toy Bowl. Then it was on to St. X, \n     where he played little his final year after a disagreement \n     with the coaches.\n       ``He just didn't have a positive experience,'' his father \n     said. ``Part of that was his fault.''\n       Estes' only football option was a partial scholarship to \n     Georgetown College. He turned it down to follow in his \n     grandfather's footsteps--into the Marine Corps and into a \n     tank.\n       ``That broke my heart when he didn't take that scholarship \n     to Georgetown,'' Rodney Estes said. ``You know how you \n     envision going down there on Saturdays to watch your son and \n     walk around campus?''\n       Instead, a day after graduation from St. X, Estes was off \n     to Parris Island for boot camp as a Marine reservist. Higher \n     education--and football--flickered out of sight.\n       In 1999 he had talked to UofL assistant Greg Nord and then-\n     coach John L. Smith about walking on, but he never followed \n     through. He worked a job here and a job there and performed \n     his duties with the reserves. Life was standing still.\n       ``He kind of had his head up his--in other words,'' said \n     Lance Cpl. Nick Rassano, a 2000 Trinity graduate who was in \n     the same tank in the Middle East with Estes.\n       Then last Jan. 7, the phone rang at Ruby Tuesday, where \n     Estes was bartending. The order was expected but still \n     jarring: Report for active duty.\n       He told his family the news at dinner that night. Two days \n     later he was gone--but not without some prescient final words \n     from his father.\n       ``Remember,'' Rodney Estes told his oldest son, ``the way \n     you handle yourself out there probably says a lot about how \n     you'll handle the rest of your life.''\n       First stop was Camp Lejeune, N.C. Then he was on a ship 30 \n     days to Kuwait, for a month of preparation, some touch \n     football and the last decent meals for a long time.\n       Finally, after a month in Kuwait, Estes and the rest of the \n     American military force invaded Iraq.\n       ``I was a policeman 25 years, and I'm not the kind of guy \n     who gets overly worried,'' Rodney Estes said. ``But I tell \n     you, that night he left I thought, `This could be the last \n     night I ever see him.' When your own kid goes off, that puts \n     you through some changes.\n       ``I'd wake up in the middle of the night and watch CNN. I \n     watched so much TV I was about to drive myself crazy.''\n       Over in Iraq, the A-8 Marines were pushing hard toward An \n     Nasiriyah and what ultimately would be some of the most \n     intense fighting of the war. The first day of combat was the \n     worst, as Estes watched a rocket-propelled grenade blow up an \n     American vehicle and kill several soldiers.\n       He said they arrived in the area to find the streets \n     flooded with sewage that stalled half of Alpha Company's 14 \n     tanks--including his, christened the ``Think Tank'' because \n     of the crew's propensity for making maintenance errors.\n       When the tanks bogged down, the Iraqis lit up. They were \n     firing on foot, from orange-and-white taxis and from SUVs.\n       Estes was the loader in his tank but also was charged with \n     manning the 240-millimeter gun on top of the vehicle. With \n     the upper half of his body in view, he exchanged fire with \n     the enemy.\n       Welcome to the terror and exhilaration of warfare, Cpl. \n     Estes.\n       ``It was a heck of an adrenaline rush,'' he said. ``I was \n     scared, excited, all those things.

I \n     didn't freeze or tense up, but I definitely had \n     butterflies.''\n       Asked if he personally shot anyone, Estes looked down \n     briefly and answered yes. There was no bravado in his voice.\n       ``The first time you see somebody get hit with a round is a \n     crazy feeling,'' he said. ``It's a sick feeling.

Estes' tank remained in position for hours \n     afterward.\n       At one point he was told to hand some Special Ops soldiers \n     a tank shovel. They used it to dig up a shallow grave outside \n     the hospital, locating the bodies of several Americans from \n     Lynch's 507th Maintenance Company.\n       It wasn't until days later that the Think Tank crew was \n     able to piece together the story and realize that their \n     mission was the rescue dominating news coverage at home.\n       ``We didn't realize how big a deal it was until we saw it \n     on the cover of Newsweek,'' Rassano said.\n       To Estes the mission was important for one other reason: He \n     never again discharged his weapon.

Nevertheless, Adams \n     told him to report for a one-day group tryout.\n       Estes arrived in excellent physical condition, performed \n     well in the fitness tests and was one of four walk-ons chosen \n     for the team. After U of L upset Kentucky to open the season \n     Aug. 31, he reported for his first practice as a Louisville \n     Cardinal.\n       ``It was awesome that first day, just putting on the \n     equipment again,'' he said. ``I was looking around saying, \n     `I'm playing with a Division I football program. Four months \n     ago I was shooting at Iraqis running around with AK-47s.' ''\n       Today life is easy. The 18-hour days don't pile up for \n     weeks on end. The food is edible. There are no tank repairs, \n     no missions, no imminent danger.\n       The load so many student-athletes find so difficult is like \n     vacation to Jimmy Estes.\n       ``All you've got to do is go to class and play football,'' \n     Rassano said. ``That's got to be the easiest thing he's done \n     all year. After going through there, everything's easier.\n       ``The whole experience kind of straightened him out. I'm \n     real proud of Jimmy.''\n       A good many Cardinals have no idea what Estes was going \n     through while they were in spring practice. But a few have \n     seen the USMC tattoo on the 5-foot-11, 200-pound \n     receiver's left shoulder and inquired, and a few others \n     have heard a story or two about the walk-on soldier.\n       He doesn't hide his history, but he doesn't broadcast it, \n     either. He's not looking for hero status in the locker room.\n       ``The coaches can't give me any special treatment, and I \n     don't want it,'' he said. ``I'd always heard stories of \n     people coming back (from a war) and thinking the world owed \n     them something, or they were messed up mentally. I didn't \n     want that. I just wanted to make that experience a \n     positive.''\n       U of L will play Army tomorrow. Estes has been where none \n     of the celebrated West Pointers has gone yet: into combat for \n     his country.\n       He is a Cardinal worthy of a salute from the Cadets.\n       Yet he wasn't even supposed to be at the stadium. Instead, \n     he was scheduled for real military work: a reunion with Alpha \n     Company at Fort Knox for their first weekend of reservist \n     training since the war.\n       But at practice yesterday head coach Bobby Petrino informed \n     Estes that he will be dressing out and joining the squad if \n     he can get a furlough from Marine drills.\n       Estes plans to wear two uniforms tomorrow; he'll be in Papa \n     John's Cardinal Stadium in the afternoon after meeting up \n     with his mates in the morning. He's looking forward to seeing \n     the men with whom he shared a life-altering experience--and \n     telling them about his college football career.\n       ``I don't think a whole lot of them really believed me,'' \n     he said with a smile.\n       But it's true. A desert dream that materialized on lonely \n     nights under an inky Arabian sky has come true.\n\n[[Page S15396]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15396-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 MILITARY SNIPER WEAPON REGULATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in the November 3, 2003 edition of Air \nSafety Week a connection was drawn between airline safety and gun \nsafety. And, while some people may think there is no connection between \nairline safety and gun safety, the connection is serious. Attention has \nbeen paid to potential vulnerabilities of commercial aircraft to \nterrorists armed with shoulder-fired missiles. A more pedestrian but an \nequally deadly potential threat looms from terrorists armed with .50 \ncaliber sniper rifles.\n  The .50 caliber sniper rifle is among the most powerful weapons \nlegally available. These weapons are not only powerful, but they're \naccurate. According to the House Government Reform staff report, the \nmost common .50 caliber weapon can accurately hit targets a mile away \nand can inflict damage to targets more than four miles away. The thumb-\nsize bullets, which come in armor-piercing and incendiary variants, can \neasily punch through aircraft fuselages, fuel tanks, and engines.\n  These weapons pose a serious threat to planes both in the air and on \nthe ground. According to a recent Violence Policy Center report, \naircraft landing are particularly vulnerable, as illustrated by the \ntestimony of Ronnie G. Barrett, President of Barrett Firearms \nManufacturing. As an expert witness during a 1999 criminal trial, \nBarrett was asked about the relative difficulty of hitting a stationary \ntarget and a moving target, such as a motorcycle or an airplane. He was \nasked about shooting at an airplane ``coming in to land . . . \ndescending over 120 miles an hour.'' He testified: ``If it is coming \ndirectly at you, it is almost as easy. Just like bird hunting. But yes, \nit is more difficult if it is horizontally, or moving from left to \nright . . . '' In other words, according to Barrett, shooting at a \nmoving object coming directly at one is ``almost as easy'' as a \nstationary target, an answer that is consistent with detailed \ninstructions given in a variety of U.S. Army manuals about engaging \naircraft with small arms.\n  Despite these facts, long-range .50 caliber weapons are less \nregulated than handguns. Buyers must simply be 18 years old and submit \nto a Federal background check. In addition, there is no Federal minimum \nage requirement for possessing a .50 caliber weapon and no regulation \non second-hand sales.\n  I believe the easy availability and the increased popularity of the \n.50 caliber sniper rifle poses a danger to airline safety, as well as \nhomeland security. That's why last year I cosponsored Senator \nFeinstein's Military Sniper Weapon Regulation Act. This bill would \nchange the way .50 caliber guns are regulated by placing them under the \nrequirements of the National Firearms Act. This would subject these \nweapons to the same registration and background check requirements as \nother weapons of war, such as machine guns. This is a necessary step to \nprotecting the safety of airline travelers.\n  The .50 caliber sniper rifle is among the most powerful and least \nregulated firearms legally available. Tighter regulation is needed. I \nurge my colleagues to support Senator Feinstein's bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15396-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In San Antonio, TX, on October 26, 2003, Allen Everton, age 74, was \nbeaten to within inches of his life. His assailant believed that \nEverton was gay, and while hitting the elderly man with a baseball bat, \ncalled him a ``freaking faggot.'' Mr. Everton died 11 days later of \nnatural causes, but I can only imagine how scarred he must have felt \nafter being the victim of a senseless attack.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15396-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15396-S15397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a fellow Iowan \nand a true American hero PVT Kurt R. Frosheiser. Private Frosheiser was \nkilled while serving our country in Operation Iraqi Freedom on November \n8, 2003, when his humvee was struck by an improvised explosive device \nin Baghdad. Private Frosheiser was only 22 years old at the time of his \ndeath.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate, my fellow Iowans, and all \nAmericans to join me today in paying tribute to Private Frosheiser for \nhis bravery and for his dedication to the cause of freedom. Private \nFrosheiser had a deep desire to serve his country, and we are all \nindebted to him for his service and for his sacrifice.\n  In an interview with the Des Moines Register, Private Frosheiser's \nmother, Jeanie Hudson, said the following about her son: ``He loved \nthis land and its principles. He loved Iowa. It's an honor to give my \nson to preserve our way of life.''\n  Throughout our history, we have found extraordinary men and women who \nare willing to give their lives to defend our country and families \nwilling sacrifice those who they love most to the cause of freedom. It \nis with great sadness, but also great pride, that I honor one such \npatriot today on the floor of the Senate, PVT Kurt Frosheiser.\n  Today we honor a fallen patriot, but we must also remember to pay \ntribute to the loved ones whose grief we share. My deepest sympathy \ngoes out to the members of Private Frosheiser's family, to his friends, \nand to all those who have been touched by his untimely passing. May his \nmother, Jeanie, his father, Chris, his step-father, Daniel, his sister, \nErin, and his twin brother, Joel, be comforted with the knowledge that \nthey are in the thoughts and prayers of many Americans, and that they \nhave the eternal gratitude of an entire nation.\n  Kurt Frosheiser did not die in vain. He died defending the country he \nloved. May he always be remembered as a true American hero.\n\n\n                          Sgt Ross A. Pennanen\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to pay homage to Sergeant Ross \nPennanen, who, in the words of his father, ``gave the ultimate \nsacrifice for his country--his life.'' Sergeant Pennanen, or ``Penn'', \nas his friends called him, was a dedicated defender of America who \nlearned the value of serving his country from his father's example in \nthe United States Air Force. For his service and his sacrifice, I am \nproud to honor him on the Senate floor today.\n  Sergeant Pennanen was assigned to C Battery, 2nd Battalion, 5th Field \nArtillery Regiment, III Corps Artillery at Fort Sill, OK. A native \nOklahoman whose mother and father live in Ada and Midwest City, \nrespectively, Sergeant Pennanen grew up in McLoud and joined the Army 2 \nyears ago at the age of 34 in hopes of improving himself and emulating \nhis father. He was himself a good father who spent a lot of time with \nhis 7-year-old son, Gage.\n  Sergeant Pennanen died tragically on November 2 when a CH-47 Chinook \nhelicopter in which he was riding crashed in Fallujah, Iraq. He was a \ngood soldier: he received the Army Commendation Medal two days before \nhis death. Despite questions about his age, Sergeant Pennanen proved a \n``gung-ho'' example for his fellow soldiers. According to his \nstepmother, ``He didn't keep up with them. He set the pace out in front \nof them.''\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I ask that we pay tribute to Sergeant \nPennanen and the men and women like him, who know the true meaning of \nservice and sacrifice. These men and women have tasted freedom, and \nwish to ensure that freedom for those who have never experienced it. I \nhonor the memory of our sons and daughters who have died for this noble \ncause.\n  We could not have asked for a better soldier or diplomat of humanity \nthan Sergeant Ross Pennanen. I am proud of him, and proud of the \ncommitment he showed to winning the freedom of those he did not know. \nMy prayers are with his family for the loss of such a special man.\n\n\n                           PVT JASON M. WARD\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a \ncourageous young Oklahoman who died\n\n[[Page S15397]]\n\nwhile defending his Nation. Private Jason M. Ward grew up in the great \nState of Oklahoma, and was a 1997 graduate of Broken Arrow High School.\n  Private Ward joined the military in April 2002, although he had been \nseriously considering military service for years. He married his high \nschool sweetheart after graduating, and when Jason and Jordan welcomed \ntheir first son shortly thereafter, the duties of fatherhood took \npriority. After having another son 4 years later, Jason and Jordan \nbegan discussing Jason's longtime military aspirations and decided that \nit would be a good time for him to pursue a lifelong career in the \nmilitary.\n  Private Ward was a member of the 1st Armored Division, stationed at \nFort Riley, KS. His unit was sent to the Middle East in March to \nprotect the freedom of this fellow Americans, and he was highly \ninvolved in the outstanding and courageous work of that unit. \nUnfortunately, Private Ward fell ill, and was scheduled to return to \nthe U.S. for treatment when he unexpectedly passed away. His sudden \ndeath has left his young family with questions that none of us can \nanswer, but we can tell them with confidence that Private Ward was \nserving his Nation with honor until this tragedy took his life.\n  Private Ward was only 25 years old when he died. I hope his friends \nand family know that he died a true hero, worthy of the respect and \ngratitude of every American because of his contribution to defending \nhis country. His loved ones will miss him dearly, and our thoughts and \nprayers are with them today. And though we are all grieved by the loss \nof this man, we will never cease to be proud of him--Oklahoma's son and \nAmerica's hero--Private Jason M. Ward.\n\n\n                         spec dustin k. mcgaugh\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I stand today to honor the memory of a \nbrave young American who gave his life defending the Nation. He felt a \ncall to serve his country, to be part of something bigger than himself, \nand ultimately, paid the highest price.\n  SPEC Dustin K. McGaugh, of Derby, KS, was a firing specialist \nassigned to the Army's 17th Field Artillery Brigade stationed in Fort \nSill, OK. His mother, Marina Hayes, lives in Tulsa, OK, where he \ngraduated from high school in 2001.\n  On September 30 in Balad, Iraq, he died tragically from a non-hostile \ngunshot wound. He gave his life for the freedom of millions of \nAmericans, and also for the peace and prosperity of the Iraqi people \ncrippled by a totalitarian regime.\n  Specialist McGaugh had a heart for the less fortunate. According to \nhis fellow soldiers, he would leave the safety of his Jeep and give \ncandy to the Iraqi children. Imagine an American soldier who truly \ncared for the least among us, and performed simple acts of kindness to \nhis fellow humans. Imagine an American soldier who represented America \nwith a noble heart, and reminded us all of the freedoms we take for \ngranted. Specialist McGaugh was that soldier.\n  His compassion is a microcosm of the American spirit, the spirit that \ndrives us to fight oppression around the world. The Iraqi people are an \noppressed people, and Specialist McGaugh showed us how our inherent \nhumanity can overcome even the broadest of differences. He refused to \nsit idly and watch the tyranny in Iraq take place any longer. It is for \nthe sake of these broken, defeated people that Specialist McGaugh \nrisked his life on a daily basis. It is for these people that he gave \nhis life in the end. He was a true American hero.\n  His twin sister Windy said that her ``kid brother'' became her hero. \nSpecialist McGaugh should not only be his sister's hero, but the \nNation's hero as well. He set a high example of what it means to be an \nAmerican and what it means to be human. It is for men like Specialist \nMcGaugh that I am proud to be a part of this great country. He was a \nspecial soldier, but more importantly, a special man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15397-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15397-S15398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, earlier this week, an article in the \nWashington Post highlighted concerns about limits on the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation's ability to pursue terrorists who try to buy guns. \nAfter September 11, 2001, the FBI launched an initiative to notify \nFederal law enforcement officials and other national security officials \nwhen suspects on the FBI's terrorist watch list attempt to purchase a \nfirearm. However, according to the Washington Post article, an \ninterpretation of current law by the Attorney General has precluded \nFederal agents from obtaining any details about gun purchase \ntransactions unless the purchaser is identified by the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System as a prohibited buyer.\n  The Post article cited situations in which law enforcement officials \nhave not been able to pursue known terrorists armed with a firearm. \nAccording to the Washington Post, as many as 21 suspects on the FBI's \nterrorist watch list have attempted to buy guns since the spring of \n2003. According to Justice Department officials cited in the Post \narticle, the rules established by the Attorney General prevent Federal \nofficials from sharing information with investigators about legal gun \nbuyers, even if these gun buyers are suspected terrorists.\n  Law enforcement officials told the Post that the FBI frequently does \nnot know the whereabouts of suspected terrorists on its watch lists. In \nsuch cases, learning where a suspected terrorist bought a firearm and \nwhat address they provided could be extremely helpful to \ncounterterrorism investigators.\n  To assist the FBI in monitoring and apprehending suspected \nterrorists, Senator Lautenberg introduced the Terrorist Apprehension \nAct. This bill would require NICS to alert the FBI, Department of \nHomeland Security, and local law enforcement officials anytime an \nindividual on a terrorist watch list attempts to buy a firearm.\n  I believe this is common sense homeland security legislation, and I \nhope the Congress will enact it quicky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15398-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15398-S15399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nS. 1896, THE TAX RELIEF EXTENSION ACT, AND H.R. 1664, THE ARMED FORCES \n                            TAX FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I express my support for \nrepealing the Medicare physician fee cut. The issue of reimbursements \nfor physicians who treat Medicare patients has been an ongoing battle. \nCurrently, these reimbursements are inadequate and inefficiently paid \nthrough a bureaucratic system. Some physicians have been even been \nforced to refuse Medicare recipients due to these inappropriate \nreimbursement levels. With so many Medicare recipients who need medical \nservices in South Carolina, the situation with low reimbursements poses \na challenge to both physicians and patients.\n  I have supported updating and increasing the reimbursements \nphysicians receive under the Medicare program. The schedule of fee cuts \nfor these reimbursements has been temporarily suspended due to the \nactions of Congress. I supported legislation to repeal physician fee \ncuts for both fiscal year 2002 and 2003. However, in October 2003, the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, reported that the \nphysician fee cut for 2004 would be 4.5 percent. This necessitates a \nfurther repeal to ensure this fee cut does not move forward.\n  While annual repeals of the physician fee cuts are vital, I also \nsupport a substantive change to the reimbursement calculations so \nphysicians are not held in limbo each year regarding their fee updates. \nI am hopeful that Congress will address this issue in a comprehensive \nmanner.\n  Since I support legislative action to make sure this cut is repealed \nand to ensure future repeals are dealt with effectively, I am \nexceedingly concerned that the most current repeal in the Medicare \nphysician fee cut is contained within the mammoth Medicare prescription \ndrug bill. This blocks me voting solely on the merit of the repeal.\n  I have many reasons a to why I plan to oppose the Medicare \nprescription drug bill conference report. None of my reasons are \nconcerns with the Medicare physician fee cut repeal. Rather, my \nopposition stems from the lack of real cost containment of the program, \nexclusion of true Medicare reform, the weakening of the premium support \nissue, the treatment of ``dual eligibles'' coverage, and other issues \nrelated to oncology drugs, durable medical equipment, DME, and local \npharmacies.\n  It frustrates me that this latest repeal is in a bill with literally \ndozens of other Medicare provisions in a $400 billion dollar bill. \nWhile I cannot support the Medicare prescription drug bill, I will \ncontinue to support the repeal of next year's Medicare physician fee \ncut and addressing the ongoing issue of fee cuts in a comprehensive \nmanner. I am hopeful that our leadership will give us a vehicle for a \nstraight up or down vote on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15399-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15399-S15400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO RALPH BUNCHE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is difficult to know exactly how to \npay tribute to Ralph J. Bunche for his extraordinary contributions to \nscholarship, diplomacy, civil rights, social justice and international \ncooperation and development. The Senate has approved H. Con. Res 71, \n``Recognizing the importance of Ralph Bunche as one of the great \nleaders of the United States  . . . The year-long centennial \ncommemoration of his birth, which is now well underway, involves many \nmore professional societies, educational institutions and public-policy \norganizations than it is possible to list; among them are the American \nPolitical Science Association, the Association of Black American \nAmbassadors, the American Library Association, the Council on Foreign \nRelations, Facing History and Ourselves, national foundation, the \nNAACP, the National Urban League, the New York Public Library, numerous \nUnited Nations Associations and dozens of colleges and universities in \nthis country and abroad. At UCLA, Ralph Bunche's alma mater, the \nAfrican American Studies center has been renamed in his honor. I am \nespecially pleased to note that the American Academy of Diplomacy has \nchosen to honor Ralph Bunche by sponsoring the two-year Philip Merrill \nFellowship for the two-year M.A. program at the Paul H. Nitze School of \nAdvanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Ralph Bunche received the first \ndoctoral degree in government and international relations ever awarded \nby Harvard University, thereby earning the title ``Dr. Bunche.'' But \nBenjamin Rivlin, who is Co-Chair of the Ralph Bunche Centenary \nCommittee, has told us that he was specifically instructed to ``cut out \nthis doctor business'' when as a young soldier he was assigned to work \nfor Ralph Bunche in the OSS sixty years ago.\n  The vast array of tributes now being paid to Ralph Bunche reflects \njust how extraordinary a person he was. Born in Detroit and orphaned at \neleven, he went to live with his grandmother, Lucy Johnson, in what is \ntoday the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n  By all accounts, Lucy Johnson was as extraordinary as her illustrious \ngrandson. Writing in the Reader's Digest many years after her death, \nDr. Bunche called her ``My Most Unforgettable Character . . . Caucasian \n`on the outside' and `all black fervor inside.' '' One of his teachers \nsaid of her, ``I have never forgotten the emanation of power from that \ntiny figure.'' Ms. Johnson's remark to the principal of Jefferson High \nSchool, where Dr. Johnson was valedictorian of his class and a varsity \nathlete, is especially memorable. In a disastrously misguided effort at \nflattery, the principal is reported to have said, ``We never thought of \nRalph as a Negro,'' to which Ms. Johnson replied: ``Why haven't you \nthought of him as a Negro? He is a Negro and he is proud of it. So am \nI.''\n  From his grandmother Ralph Bunche learned the fundamental lessons of \nself-respect and respect for others. He also took from her a passion \nfor education. It was she who insisted that he go to UCLA, where he \nmajored in international relations and was valedictorian of the Class \nof 1927. Upon his graduation from UCLA, Bunche received a fellowship \nfor graduate study in political science at Harvard. Shortly after \nenrolling he received what was to be his grandmother's last letter. \nWriting just a week before her death, she asked, ``Will you finish at \nHarvard this year?''\n  Ralph Bunche did indeed receive his Master's degree at the end of \nthat year, but he did much more. In the small African American \ncommunity at Harvard at that time he made lifelong friendships with, \namong others, the future Judge William Hastie and the future cabinet \nmember Robert Weaver. He completed his Ph.D. in 1934, receiving the \ngovernment department's annual award for the best dissertation. And \nwhile working toward his degree he also taught at Howard University-- \nAmerica's ``black Athens'' --where he helped organize the political \nscience department at a time when, according to Kenneth Clark, the \ndistinguished psychologist who was a student at the time, ``the seeds \nof a legal and constitutional attack on racial segregation were being \nsown in the intellectual soil of Howard University.''\n  Although bent on an academic career, Ralph Bunche postponed research \nin South Africa to work closely with Gunnar Myrdal on Myrdal's historic \nand highly influential study of race in this country, ``An American \nDilemma.'' With the outbreak of World War II he was brought into the \nnewly-established OSS for his expertise on Africa, and in 1944 he moved \non to the State Department. The following year he served as an advisor \nto the American delegation at the San Francisco Conference, where the \nCharter establishing the United Nations was signed, and in 1946 he \njoined the U.N. Secretariat, where he remained until shortly before his \ndeath. As Brian Urquhart, who first went to work for Ralph Bunche in \nthe U.N. Secretariat in 1954, later observed, ``Public service had\n\n[[Page S15400]]\n\ncalled him, and he responded with all of his ability and strength.''\n  Ralph Bunche went on to become the U.N. Undersecretary-General, but \nhe is probably best remembered as the recipient of the 1950 Nobel Peace \nPrize, which he was awarded for negotiating the armistice that ended \nmilitary hostilities between the new State of Israel and its enemies. \nHe was not only the first African American to receive the prize, he was \nalso the first person of color; as an American, he joined the \ndistinguished community of U.S. laureates that included Presidents \nTheodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, Jane Adams and Nicholas Murray \nButler.\n  In his own view, however, the Nobel Prize was not at all his most \nsignificant accomplishment, and his initial reaction upon being \ninformed of the award was to decline it: ``Peacemaking at the U.N. was \nnot done for prizes,'' he explained. He agreed to accept only when the \nargument was put to him that it would be good for the United Nations. \nRather, Ralph Bunche gave a quarter-century of dedicated service to the \nUnited Nations, working day in and day out to build and secure \nharmonious relations among free and prosperous nations.\n  Ralph Bunche touched the life of everyone who knew him. He is \nremembered as ``brilliant,'' with ``an uncanny ability to produce \nstupendous amounts of work over long sustained periods of \napplication;'' as someone who ``play(ed) to win, but always played \nfair;'' as ``a man of extraordinary kindness and compassion (who) never \nturned his back on those in trouble;'' as a person. Kenneth Clark has \npaid him an eloquent and enduring tribute as ``above all the model of a \nhuman being who by his total personality demonstrated that disciplined \nhuman intelligence and courage were most effective instruments in the \nstruggle for social justice.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15400-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CBO SUMMARY OF S. 1522\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Finally, S. 1522 would \n     rename GAO as the Government Accountability Office.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 1522 would increase direct \n     spending for retirement annuities and related health benefits \n     by about $1 million in fiscal year 2004, by $19 million over \n     the 2004-2008 period, and by $40 million over the 2004-2013 \n     period. Several provisions of S. 1522 could affect GAO \n     employee compensation costs, but the net budgetary effect of \n     such provisions would depend on how GAO exercises its new \n     authorities and on whether future agency appropriations are \n     adjusted to reflect any savings or costs. Finally, we expect \n     that any additional discretionary costs associated with \n     changing the agency's name would not be significant.\n       S. 1522 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act (UMRA) \n     and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Estimated costs to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     impact of S. 1522 on direct spending is shown in the \n     following table. The costs of this legislation fall within \n     budget function 800 (general government).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                        By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  2004     2005     2006     2007     2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     2013\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated budget authority....................................        1        3        5        5        5        5        4        4        4        4\nEstimated outlays.............................................        1        3        5        5        5        5        4        4        4        4\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Basis of estimate\n       Direct spending\n       S. 1522 would give GAO permanent authority to offer \n     retirement to employees who voluntarily leave the agency \n     early. GAO's existing buyout authority, which will expire on \n     December 31, 2003, allows the agency to offer certain \n     employees a lump sum payment of up to $25,000 to voluntarily \n     leave the agency. In addition, certain qualified employees \n     who leave (whether they collect a separation payment or not) \n     are entitled to receive immediate retirement annuities \n     earlier than they would have otherwise. CBO estimates that \n     extending this authority would increase direct spending by $1 \n     million in 2004, by $19 million over the 2004-2008 period, \n     and by $40 million over the 2004-2013 period.\n       Based on information provided by GAO about use of its early \n     retirement authority over the past several years, CBO \n     estimates that each year about 35 agency employees would \n     begin receiving retirement benefits three years earlier than \n     they would have under current law. Inducing some employees to \n     retire early results in higher-than-expected benefits from \n     the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF). CBO \n     estimates that the additional retirement benefits would \n     increase direct spending by $1 million in 2004, by $16 \n     million over the 2004-2008 period, and by $32 million over \n     the 2004-2013 period.\n       Extending GAO's buyout and early retirement authority also \n     would increase direct spending for federal retiree health \n     benefits. Many employees who retire early would continue to \n     be eligible for coverage under the Federal Employees' Health \n     Benefits (FEHB) program. The government's share of the \n     premium for retirees is classified as mandatory spending. \n     Because many of those accepting the buyouts under the bill \n     would have retired later under current law, mandatory \n     spending on FEHB premiums would increase. CBO estimates these \n     additional benefits would increase direct spending by less \n     than $500,000 in 2004, by $3 million over the 2004-2008 \n     period, and by $8 million over the 2004-2013 period.\n       Spending subject to appropriation\n       The authorities provided by S. 1522 would allow GAO to \n     create a performance-based employee compensation system to \n     govern basic pay adjustments, pay retention for employees \n     affected by reductions in force, relocation reimbursements, \n     and annual leave accruals beginning in fiscal year 2006. \n     (Under existing law, GAO is required to follow personnel \n     management policies determined by the Office of Personnel \n     Management.) Implementing the new authorities that would be \n     provided by S. 1522 could affect GAO's total costs of \n     providing employee compensation, but CBO cannot predict any \n     cost or saving associated with these new authorities, or the \n     net effect of all such changes on the Federal budget. \n     Ultimately, the net budgetary effect of the proposed \n     authorities would depend on the features of the compensation \n     system adopted by GAO and on how the agency applies that new \n     system to individual employees. Moreover, any resulting \n     savings or costs would only be realized if the agency's \n     annual appropriations are adjusted accordingly.\n       Providing GAO with the option of providing voluntary \n     separation payments could also increase GAO's costs, but CBO \n     estimates that any new costs would average less than $500,000 \n     annually over the 2004-2013 period. Section 2 of the bill \n     would allow GAO to offer certain employees payments of up to \n     $25,000 to voluntarily leave the agency. The bill also \n     requires that GAO make a deposit amounting to 45 percent of \n     each buyout recipient's basic salary toward the CSRDF. Unlike \n     an increase in retirement benefits, these two payments would \n     be from the agency's discretionary budget and are thus \n     subject to appropriation. Since GAO's current buyout \n     authority was first authorized in October 2000, no one at the \n     agency has received a buyout payment. As such, CBO expects \n     that relatively few employees would receive a buyout payment \n     over the next 10 years and that the cost of any buyout \n     payments and required deposits toward the CSRDF would be \n     negligible in any given year.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 1522 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets of State, \n     local, or tribal governments.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Ellen Hays, Geoffrey \n     Gerhardt, and Deborah Reis.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter of \ngreat importance related to Russia's continued participation in the \nGroup of Eight, or G-8. Senator McCain and I submitted today a \nresolution calling on the President of the United States and the \nSecretary of State to work with our partners in the G-8 to condition \nRussia's continued involvement on its meetings the basic norms and \nstandards of a democratic government.\n  The G-8 is a gathering of the world's wealthiest industrial \ndemocracies. It is\n\n[[Page S15401]]\n\nimportant that we do not lose sight of this world. It is well and good \nthat all of the G-8 members are wealthy industrialized nations, but the \nreal thing that binds us, the real thing that makes it a club worth \njoining is the fact that all of the participants are democracies. It is \nfor this reason that China is not a member.\n  When President Clinton discussed Russia's joining the G-8 back in \n1997 when Russia participated in the summit in Denver, he attributed \nRussia's participation to ``President Yeltsin's leadership and to the \ncommitment of the Russian people to democracy and reform.''\n  But the actions of President Yeltsin's successor, President Putin, \nover the past 3 years raise serious concerns about Russia's continued \ncommitment to democracy. This drift away from democratic practices \ncannot and should not be ignored. The list of offending actions is long \nand disturbing. Since 2000, President Putin has seized control of \nnational television networks and otherwise limited the freedom of \nexpression to the point that the group ``Reporters without Borders'' \nranks Russia 121st out of 139 countries in its worldwide press freedom \nindex. The recent arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky set off alarm bells \nbecause of its blatant political motives, despite claims otherwise. \nPresident Putim's government has attempted to control the activities of \nnongovernmental organizations, religious organizations, and other \npluralistic elements of Russian society in an attempt to mute criticism \nof the government. Russian troops in Chechnya have been allowed to \nsuppress the rights of Russian citizens with impunity, including in the \nconduct of recent elections that fell far short of minimal \ninternational standards of freedom and fairness. And the list could go \non.\n  Continued membership in the G-8 is very important to Russia and to \nPresident Putin personally. We should use this leverage to get Russia \nback on the democratic track. Allowing Russia to continue its \ninvolvement in the G-8 and to host the 2006 G-8 Summit while continuing \nto undermine democracy makes mockery of the very principles that bind \nthe G-8 countries together. We need to take steps not to ensure that \nRussia lives up to the commitments it made when it joined this club of \nindustrialized democracies. To do otherwise would be to shirk our \nresponsibilities as a leader of the democratic world. I urge my fellow \nSenators to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15401-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15401-S15402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL RETIREMENT PLANNING WEEK\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to illuminate the merits of \nNational Retirement Planning Week, which is currently underway. \nNational Retirement Planning Week is organized by a coalition of \nfinancial industry and advocacy organizations to raise the awareness of \nthe importance of retirement planning. I applaud the coalition for its \nefforts to increase public awareness of this critical topic.\n  The need to adequately prepare for retirement has significantly \nincreased due to the growth in life expectancy and reduction in \nemployer-provided retirement health benefits. In addition, increasing \ndebt burdens confronting many families will make a comfortable \nretirement more difficult to achieve.\n  Americans are living longer. According to the U.S. National Center \nfor Health Statistics, in 1950, an individual 65 years of age was \nexpected to live an additional 13.9 years. This grew to 17.9 years by \n2000. These additional years, many or most in retirement, will require \nAmericans to have saved and invested additional financial resources to \nhelp meet their living expenses in retirement. Furthermore, the fastest \ngrowing segment of the population is made up of those 85 years and \nolder, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n  While Americans have been living longer, employers have been reducing \nthe health benefits provided to retirees. According to the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation and Health Research and Education Trust, 38 percent \nof all large firms offer retirement benefits in 2003. This is a \nsignificant reduction from the 66 percent that offered retiree coverage \nin 1988. As employers continue to stop providing coverage and as health \ncare costs continue to increase, proper planning is imperative for \nindividuals to pay for healthcare expenses that may not be covered by \nMedicare.\n  In addition, another important component of preparing for retirement \nis to effectively manage and pay down debt. According to the Federal \nReserve, consumer borrowing through auto loans, credit cards, and other \ndebt increased by $15.1 billion in September, which brings the total \nconsumer debt to $1.97 trillion. Substantial consumer debt will likely \nresult in individuals having to work additional years beyond their \npreferred retirement age in order to pay off their credit cards and \nother consumer debts.\n  Obtaining home equity loans and refinancing mortgages to take cash \nout of homes may make it harder for working Americans to retire at the \nage and with quality of life they desire. Thirty-two percent of all \nmortgage refinancings in the third quarter of this year involved cash-\nouts of additional money beyond the existing loan balance, according to \nFreddie Mac. Although this is significantly lower than the record 93 \npercent in 1989, the additional debt brought on by these refinancings \ncan significantly extend the time and cost of paying off a mortgage.\n  There is a greater need for larger nest eggs and better debt \nmanagement. Unfortunately, defined benefit pension plans have become \nmuch less common and are not available for most working Americans to \nhelp meet these increasing costs. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, 72 percent of pension plan assets were held by \ndefined benefit plans in 1975. Unfortunately, by 1998, this percentage \nfell to 48 percent. Changes in the contributions to pension plans and \nbenefit payments between 1975 and 1998 also reflect the significant \nshift towards defined contribution retirement plans. Defined \ncontribution plans require that employees be much more involved in \ntheir preparation for retirement. Employees must be aware of their \nalternatives in participating in their employer's plan. The matching \ncontributions made by employers can provide employees with an immediate \nreturn on their investment. Employees must fully understand the \nimportance of planning for retirement and the significance of \nparticipating in tax-advantaged employer plans and investment options \nthat can be used, such as Individual Retirement Accounts, IRAs, to \nensure that they will have sufficient resources for retirement. In \naddition, defined contribution plans require employees to manage their \ninvestments and make important asset allocation decisions. If employees \ndo not have a sufficient level of financial literacy they will not be \nable to adequately manage their retirement portfolio.\n  Despite the need to ensure that employees have adequate resources for \nretirement, fewer employers are sponsoring plans and fewer employees \nare participating in employer-sponsored plans. According to a \nCongressional Research Service analysis of the Census Bureau's Current \nPopulation survey, the number of 25-to 64-year old, full-time employees \nin the private sector whose employer sponsored a retirement plan fell \nfrom 45.1 million in 2001 to 42.8 million in 2002. The survey also \nindicated that, among this population, participation in an employer \nsponsored retirement plan fell from 55.8 percent in 2001 to 53.5 \npercent in 2002. More employers must sponsor retirement plans and more \nemployees need to participate in them. Working Americans will be in a \nbetter position to retire on their terms by starting to prepare for \nretirement early and utilizing investment vehicles that have \npreferential tax treatment such as 401(k) plans and Individual \nRetirement Accounts. A long-term time horizon allows investors to reap \ngreater benefit from the compounding of their returns.\n  An important component of retirement security is financial and \neconomic literacy, which should be at higher levels in our country. We \nmust do more throughout the lives of individuals to ensure that they \nare financially and economically literate and can make informed \nfinancial decisions and participate effectively in the modern economy. \nWithout a sufficient understanding of economics and personal finance, \nindividuals will not be able to appropriately manage their finances, \nevaluate their credit opportunities, and successfully invest for their \nlong-term financial goals.\n\n[[Page S15402]]\n\n  Starting with our youth, it is necessary to fund the Excellence in \nEconomic Education, EEE, Act, which provides resources for teacher \ntraining, evaluations, research, and other activities in K-12 \neducation. There is no better time to instill in individuals the \nknowledge and skills that they need to make good decisions throughout \ntheir lives than during their years in elementary and secondary \neducation.\n  I have also introduced S. 1800, the College LIFE, or Literacy in \nFinance and Economics Act, to address needs in this area for the \ncollege population. We must give students access to the tools that they \nneed to make sound economic and financial decisions once they are on \ncampus. Without an understanding of finance and economics, college \nstudents are not able to effectively evaluate credit alternatives, \nmanage their debt, and prepare for long-term financial goals, such as \nsaving for a home or retirement. I am working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to come up with a package based on S. 1800 that \ncan be included in the Higher Education Act.\n  I also appreciate the work done by my colleague from New Jersey, \nSenator Corzine, in developing and introducing S. 386, the Education \nfor Retirement Security Act of 2003. The legislation authorizes grants \nfor financial education programs targeted towards mid-life and older \nAmericans to increase financial and retirement knowledge and reduce \ntheir vulnerability to financial abuse and fraud. I am a cosponsor of \nthis legislation which will help Americans prepare for retirement.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to improve \neconomic and financial literacy. I also want to express my appreciation \nfor the significant efforts made by Senators Sarbanes, Enzi, Corzine, \nAllen, Stabenow, and Fitzgerald to improve economic and financial \nliteracy. Our efforts need to continue so that individuals will be able \nto make informed decisions and be able to pursue their long-term \nfinancial goals, particularly into their golden years of retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15402-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President. As we approach this holiday season of \nThanksgiving, I want to draw attention to National Adoption Month as we \ncelebrate it this month.\n  I am joining my colleagues on the Congressional Coalition for \nAdoption this month to increase awareness and knowledge of the \nobstacles that children in foster care face while waiting to be adopted \nand to encourage more families to consider adopting.\n  Currently, there are 580,000 children in the foster care system in \nAmerica, 126,000 of whom are waiting to be adopted. Yet, only 20 to 25 \npercent of foster children waiting for adoption will ever find an \nadoptive family before aging out of government care. The foster care \nsystem has been extremely important in rescuing abused and neglected \nchildren. However, the foster care system was designed to be a \ntemporary situation, but it is increasingly becoming a permanent \nguardian for many children. This is particularly true for children who \nare not adopted in their early years or who find themselves in foster \ncare at an older age. Of the 126,000 children waiting to be adopted \napproximately half are 9 years of age or older.\n  Every year an average of 100 children in South Dakota, and 25,000 \nchildren nationally, age out of the foster care system at the age of \n18, often with very little if any support system in pace. These \nchildren often face the challenges of homelessness, college \nnoncompletion, unemployment, and a lack of health care. Transitional \nliving and mentoring program can alleviate some of these concerns but \nprograms face the strains of staff shortages and underfunding. I must \ncommend the South Dakota Coalition for Children for working to secure \nMedicaid coverage for children that age out of the foster care system \nuntil they reach the age of 22. This eliminates one serious concern \nmany former foster care youths face with they are no longer in \nGovernment care, but it does not replace the support of a loving \nfamily.\n  On November 22, 2003, courts across the country joined State \nagencies, children in foster care and hopeful parents to finalize \nadoptions and demonstrate the large number of children waiting for \nsafe, stable, permanent homes.\n  As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday and gather with our families, \nwe should not forget those children still waiting for a loving, \npermanent family to be thankful for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15402-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       HONORING ARVILLA ``BILLIE'' CAMPBELL ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I honor Arvilla ``Billie'' Campbell \nof Meridian, ID, who is approaching her 100th birthday on January 21, \n2004. Arvilla's impressive longevity is matched by her positive \ncontributions to home and country. I am sure that her six children, 19 \ngrandchildren, and 48 great-grandchildren join me in paying tribute to \nthis great women.\n  Arvilla was born and raised in Preston, ID, where she attended high \nschool at the Preston Academy. In 1923, she married Elgin Campbell, and \nthe couple had six children together. Her children report that Arvilla \nset a great foundation for each of their lives through the principles \nshe taught. Arvilla recognized the important of a strong work ethic, \ntelling her children that you only get what you work for. Arvilla \nherself was a hard worker, doing all she could during the Great \nDepression to ensure that her family had what they needed. She was \nknown to comment that though the family may have been broke, they were \nnever poor. Arvilla taught her children to have pride in their \nappearance and made sure they had impeccable decorum and proper speech \nat all times. Arvilla was also active in the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter Day Saints, and she taught many children over the occurs of many \nyears of service.\n  Arvilla also taught love of country, a fact reflected in the lives of \nher children. Remarkably, all six of her children have served or are \naffiliated with the Armed Forces. She encouraged them to serve in the \nmilitary because she believes freedom is a privilege that deserves \neffort and sacrifice. All four of Arvilla's sons have served in combat. \nE. Stewart Campbell served in the Navy, starting in World War II \nthrough the Vietnam War, attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel. \nGarth K. Campbell served in the Pacific Theatre of World War II as a \npetty officer in the Navy. Bruce E. Campbell served in the Korean War \nas a corporal in the Army. Doug Campbell served in both the Korean and \nVietnam wars as an Army platoon sergeant. Helen Campbell Harden, one of \nthe Arvilla's daughters, is married to John Harden, an Army warrant \nofficer in the Army. Ruth Campbell Rivers, another daughter, is also \nclosely connected to the military: her husband Gerald is a lance \ncorporal in the Marine Corps. America has benefited from the efforts of \neach of these individuals, and Arvilla is to be commended for her \nchildren's unselfish service to the United States.\n  I wish Arvilla a Happy Birthday. She has been a great teacher, \nexample, and citizen of Idaho. I wish her health and happiness on this \nexciting day, and join with family and friends in honoring her \ncontribution to Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15402-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15402-S15403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GENE BOYT\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I stand today to pay tribute to a \ngreat American and a great Oklahoman. Gene Boyt was a member of our \nNation's ``Greatest Generation'' and served his country during World \nWar II in the United States Army. He died at the age of eighty-six in \nChickasha, OK.\n  After being assigned to the Philippines as a lieutenant in the \nEngineering Corps, he was taken captive by the Japanese on April 9, \n1942. As a prisoner, he was forced to march 90 miles in 6 days in what \nhas become known as the Bataan Death March. The prisoners marched \nwithout food or water, and many were executed or died along the way \nfrom exhaustion and dehydration. After surviving the grueling journey, \nLieutenant Boyt spent 3\\1/2\\ years in Japanese prisons.\n  Gene Boyt knew what persecution meant. He knew what it meant to stand \nup for the cause of freedom, for the honor and integrity of the United \nStates. Gene Boyt knew what it meant to defend this country from \nenemies determined to destroy it. He knew\n\n[[Page S15403]]\n\nwhat it meant to suffer for what he believed.\n  I stand today proud to be an American because men like Gene Boyt \nlived and died protecting that right. He was awarded the Purple Heart, \nthe Bronze Star, three Presidential Citations, the Philippines's \nPresidential Citation Medal, and the Oklahoma Medal of Valor.

Mr. President, as this is National Employer Support \nof the Guard and Reserve Week, it seems an appropriate time to speak on \nthe honorable Americans serving in our National Guard and Reserve.\n  To fight our wars and to meet our military responsibilities, the \nUnited States supplements its regular, standing military with a capable \nband of citizen soldiers, reservists who serve nobly and continue to \nmake the ultimate sacrifice for this country. At present, there are \nabout 165,000 national guardsmen and reservists on active duty--more \nthan half of the 300,000 called to active duty since September 11. They \nserve admirably around the world, performing critical wartime functions \nin Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. This country does not go into \nbattle without members of the National Guard and Reserve, and we should \nbe grateful for their service.\n  Instead of gratitude, members of the Guard and Reserve find the Bush \nadministration's military agenda leaving them behind. In addition, \nearlier this year, the Republican majority in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives sought to cut reservist pay by 40 percent for normal \npeacetime training requirements. The Republican majority in the U.S. \nSenate blocked efforts to extend health care benefits to Guard and \nReserve members. Just this month, the Republican majority in Congress \nvoted against legislation by Senator Durbin that would have provided \nsupplemental income for Federal employees who are called up to active \nduty. These efforts are wrong and demonstrate the misplaced priorities \nof the Republican Party.\n  To make matters worse, the Bush administration recently announced \nthat it would require thousands of National Guard and Army Reserve \ntroops to extend their tours of duty up for an additional six months. \nThis extension will cause significant economic difficulties for the \nreservists, their families, their employers, and our national economy.\n  Beyond the hardship of leaving their families, their homes and their \nregular employment, more than one-third of military reservists and \nNational Guard members face a pay cut when they're called for active \nduty. Many of these reservists have families who depend upon that \npaycheck and can least afford a substantial reduction in pay.\n  The United States Chamber of Commerce estimates that 70 percent of \nmilitary reservists called to active duty work in small- or medium-size \ncompanies. The continued activation of military reservists to serve in \nIraq and the broader war on terrorism has imposed a tremendous burden \non many of our country's small businesses. Too many of these \nbusinesses, when their employees are asked to leave their jobs and \nserve the Nation, are unable to continue operating successfully--\nresulting in severe financial difficulty and even bankruptcy. Large \nbusinesses have the resources to provide supplemental income to \nreservist employees called up for active duty and to replace them with \na temporary employee. However, many small businesses are unable to \nprovide this assistance or temporarily cover the reservist's duties.\n  The Federal Government has an obligation to help small businesses \nweather the loss of an employee to a call-up and a duty to protect \nsmall business employees and their families from suffering a pay cut to \nserve our Nation. It is imperative that we help families of reservists \nmaintain their standard of living while their loved one protects our \ncountry abroad.\n  That is why I have proposed creating a Small Business Military \nReservist Tax Credit, which does two things. First, it provides an \nimmediate Federal income tax credit to any small business to help with \nthe cost of temporarily replacing a reservist employee that has been \ncalled up to active duty. Second, it provides a tax credit to small \nbusinesses that pay any difference in salary for an employee who is \ncalled up. This tax credit is worth up to $12,000 to any small business \nand up to $20,000 for small manufacturers.\n\n  It is common knowledge that small businesses continue to be our most \neffective tool at creating new jobs and spurring economic growth \nnationwide. Small businesses employ over 50 percent of the Nation's \nwork force. Across the country, small businesses are currently creating \n75 percent of new jobs. Furthermore, many of these small businesses \nprovide quality goods and services that are a vital link in the supply \nchain for national defense. Many of these small companies need \nimmediate help to keep their business going while their employees \nencounter tremendous personal sacrifice in service of our country.\n  This assistance will immediately help struggling entrepreneurs keep \ntheir small businesses running during the loss of an employee to \ntemporary military service. It will also help the families of military \nreservists cope with the financial burden of their absence. In this way \nwe ensure that we preserve our great tradition of citizen soldiers at \nsuch a critical time in the Nation's history.\n  In his speech designating this week National Employer Support of the \nGuard and Reserve Week, President Bush recognized several large \nbusinesses for their support of the Guard and Reserve. I, too, commend \nthese big corporations for their support of our reservists and \nguardsmen, but the President has again showed that he doesn't \nunderstand the plight of our military reservists and their smaller \nemployers. The fact is big businesses, like those the President \nrecently honored, aren't going out of business if one of their \nreservist employees is called up. Small businesses may.\n  My legislation provides a real solution--helping small businesses \nmaintain productivity and helping make up the difference for reservists \nwho face pay cuts when they're deployed--not just a pat on the back \nthat this week provides. I urge the President and all of my colleagues \nto support my proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15403-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15403-S15404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING NOR-LEA GENERAL HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I recognize the outstanding \nachievement of a hospital in my home State of New Mexico. Nor-Lea \nGeneral Hospital, which is located in Lovington, New Mexico, was \nrecently honored as one of the Nation's ``Top 100'' Hospitals by \nSolucient Corporation, a healthcare information company, in their 10th \nNational Benchmarks for Success study. Nor-Lea was recognized because \nthey have demonstrated superior clinical, operational, and financial \nperformance in overall service.\n  I am proud to recognize Nor-Lea Hospital for its strong commitment to \nhelp the community. Too often we hear about hospitals that are \nstruggling; hospitals asserting they can not save money and improve \npatient services and thus are not able to meet the needs of their \ncommunities.\n  Nor-Lea represents the exception. They represent the value of \nmanagement, not only to save money, but also to improve efficiency. \nNor-Lea is demonstrating what kind of performance is possible when this \nis done and they are setting new targets for performance improvement \nacross the industry.\n  Nor-Lea General Hospital is a 25-bed Medicare-certified facility. \nMedicare, Medicaid, private insurance and private pay are accepted for \nservices rendered. Nor-Lea General Hospital offers comprehensive \noutpatient services, which include a state-of-the-art laboratory \nfacility with national lab affiliations, radiology services, MRI, bone \ndensitometry, fluoroscopy, x-ray, ultrasound, and respiratory services.\n\n[[Page S15404]]\n\nThe hospital also has a newly enlarged emergency room which is open 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week. Each month about 385 individuals utilize \nthis emergency room.\n  Nor-Lea was recognized as a top performing ``Small Community \nHospital'' because of their higher survival rate and because they spend \nless money, release patients from the hospital faster, and have fewer \nemployees. In short, Nor-Lea treats more of the sickest patients, while \nmaintaining high customer service and preserving profits in a difficult \nmarketplace.\n  Congratulations, Nor-Lea General Hospital. I hope that your success \nwill be a catalyst for continuous hospital performance \nimprovement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15404-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING LINDA BARKER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to publicly commend \nLinda Barker, a resident of Sioux Falls, SD, on her selection as the \nrecipient of the Sioux Falls Development Foundation's annual Spirit of \nSioux Falls Award.\n  The Spirit of Sioux Falls Award is given annually in memory of the \neight people who were killed when then South Dakota Gov. George \nMickelson's plane crashed in 1993. This year, the recipient was Linda \nBarker, a member of the community who has shown leadership and \ncommitment to the economic development in Sioux Falls. Dan Scott, \nPresident of the Sioux Falls Development Foundation, said that Linda, \nwho is currently a member of the Board of Directors for the Development \nFoundation, was chosen because she ``has been an incredibly valuable \nmember of the Board of Directors. Not just because she has attended the \nmeetings, but because she has been in our office on a weekly basis \noffering any kind of help the staff needed.''\n  During her service with the South Dakota Development Foundation, she \nwas instrumental in a number of ways. In addition to her work with the \nForward Sioux Falls program, her leadership helped the Development \nFoundation acquire enough land to serve as development parks for the \nnext fifteen years. According to Mr. Scott, they are now well prepared \nto handle the needs in the development park arena for the future. She \nwas also instrumental in serving as chairman of the membership \ncommittee--essentially revitalizing and reenergizing their membership \neffort, raising the number from 350 to 400 members.\n  Linda's involvement in the Sioux Falls area comes from her love of \nthe community. In her thirteen years as part owner of Business Aviation \nServices in Sioux Falls, she was instrumental in helping the company \nmore than quadruple its business, increasing sales from $4 million to \n$18 million annually. The company has also added 100 employees and it \nnow owns or manages 48 aircraft, compared with six in 1990, when Linda \njoined the ownership team. Dale Froehlich, president and chief \nexecutive officer of Business Aviation, said Linda's success is \n``because of her unwillingness to give up, even in the dreariest of \nsituations.'' It is this type of hard work and dedication that led \nLinda to her success and her subsequent recognition with the Spirit of \nSioux Falls Award.\n  This prestigious award is a reflection of her extraordinary \nleadership, skill and commitment to South Dakota. I am pleased that her \nsuccess is being publicly recognized, and I am confident that her \nachievements will serve as an exemplary model for talented South \nDakotans throughout our state. People of all ages need to think more \nabout how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local \nlevel to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. \nCitizens such as Linda Barker are examples to all of us. She is an \nextraordinary individual who richly deserves this distinguished \nrecognition. I strongly commend her hard work and dedication, and I am \nvery pleased that her efforts are being publicly honored and \ncelebrated.\n  It is with great honor that I share her impressive accomplishments \nwith my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15404-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE REVEREND DR. AVERY ALDRIDGE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I want to call my colleagues' \nattention to the loss of one of the most influential civic and \nreligious leaders in Flint, MI, Dr. Avery Aldridge, who passed away at \nthe age of 78 on November 1, 2003. He is greatly mourned by his wife \nand family, his church community, and people in my home State of \nMichigan who knew and loved him as a man of great faith, devoted to his \nfamily, and a voice for justice and equality in the African American \ncommunity.\n  Dr. Aldridge was born in Widener, AR on February 9, 1925, the fourth \nof nine children. He completed his secondary education in Memphis, TN, \nand from there was inducted in the Army in 1943. He served as a \nSergeant during World War II, defending the cause of freedom for his \ncountry until his honorable discharge in 1946. He then settled in \nFlint, MI where he married Mildred Light and had two children, Karen \nand Derrick. Dr. Aldridge and his wife were dedicated members of \nAntioch Baptist Church where he served as General Superintendent of the \nSunday School and was later ordained into the ministry.\n  In December, 1956, Dr. Aldridge founded Foss Avenue Missionary \nBaptist Church with his wife, Mildred, and two others. The church has \ngrown through the years to a congregation of two thousand families, \nwith 50 auxiliaries and committees, an elementary and secondary school, \na credit union, an activity center and a free clothing center. Dr. \nAldridge also led Foss Avenue to initiate a small business center to \ntrain youth for employment, provide food baskets to those in need, \norganize a prison ministry and annually provide Thanksgiving Day dinner \nto all incarcerated in the Genessee County Jail. Dr. Aldridge's vision \nand leadership also supported four missionaries to Africa, and led to \nthe founding of Concerned Pastors for Social Action (CPSA), the CPSA \nCourier, a weekly community and religious publication, and Faith Access \nto Community Economic Development (FACED), a community development \norganization.\n  Dr. Aldridge was a lifelong learner and furthered his education at \nMoody Bible Institute in Chicago and the University of Michigan-Flint. \nHe believed strongly in the value of education and supported black \ncolleges across the country, as well as scholarships for local youth. \nBecause of his work, he was awarded several honorary degrees through \nthe years.\n  Dr. Avery was committed to serving the needs of people and improving \nthe quality of community life. He rose to prominence in Flint during \nthe civil rights movement of the 1960s, and was a calming influence in \nthe city during tensions in the wake of the Detroit riots in 1967. He \nbecame known as ``The Rights Activist,'' serving on local, State, and \nnational commissions, including the Flint Human Relations Commission, \nthe Flint Housing Commission, the Michigan AIDS Policy Commission, and \nthe National Holiday for Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission.\n  I know my colleagues join me in paying tribute to the life and \nministry of Reverend Dr. Avery Aldridge who will be missed by the many \npeople whose lives he touched. I hope his family takes comfort in \nknowing that his legacy will stand as an inspiration for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15404-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15404-S15405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR FINALIST\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor and \npleasure to recognize Richard Roberto of John F. Kennedy High School in \nPaterson, NJ as one of six finalists for the National High School \nPrincipal of the Year.\n  The impact that Mr. Roberto has made on the students and faculty at \nJohn F. Kennedy High School cannot be overstated. His leadership has \nproduced remarkable results for students--indeed, test scores are \nhigher at John F. Kennedy, in part, I am sure, because he created an \nextended year program for juniors and established freshman houses to \npersonalize the learning environment. He also administered the \nexpansion of eight career academies. These academies provide small \nlearning communities in which students can explore diverse interests. \nAs you can see, students have thrived under Mr. Roberto because of his \nefforts to develop opportunities for their success.\n  Not only has his work affected students, but his staff development \nprogram, which includes a focus on core curriculum content, has \nfostered collaboration among all the teachers at\n\n[[Page S15405]]\n\nJohn F. Kennedy High School. Through newsletters, needs assessments, \nteachers surveys, and collaborative groups Mr. Roberto has instituted \nwhole school reform that concentrates on the needs of all members of \nhis faculty.\n  I congratulate Mr. Roberto on his success in building a school \nenvironment that facilitates communication and creates a learning \nenvironment enabling student success. His dedication, innovation, and \nleadership are qualities that every principal in our Nation should \nhave. It is with great admiration that I acknowledge Mr. Roberto as a \n2003 Principal of the Year finalist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15405-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15405-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Office laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15405-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 189.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \npension coverage and savings opportunities and to provide other pension \nreforms; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, together with Senators Hatch and \nSnowe, I am introducing, the Retirement Account Portability and \nImprovement Act of 2003. This legislation improves the portability of \nretirement savings by eliminating unnecessary complexities and barriers \nin the retirement savings system, and helps preserve retirement savings \nby giving American workers tools that will help them consolidate their \nretirement savings into one easily managed account.\n  In brief, this bill will make a number of improvements in the \nretirement savings system to help families preserve retirement assets. \nIt will, for example, enhance the portability of retirement savings by \nexpanding rollover options in traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and SIMPLE \nPlans. The bill also clarifies that when employees are permitted to \nmake after-tax contributions to retirement plans, those after-tax \namounts may be rolled over into other retirement plans eligible to \nreceive such rollovers. This clarification will make it easier for \nworkers to move all elements of their 401(k) of 403(b) savings when \nthey change jobs and move between private sector and the tax-exempt \nsector.\n  In addition, the bill builds on defined contribution plan reforms \nenacted in 2001 by requiring a shortened vesting schedule for employer \nnon-elective contributions, such as profit-sharing contributions, to \ndefined contribution plans. As a result, employer contributions will \nbecome employee property more quickly, helping workers to build more \nmeaningful retirement benefits. This new vesting schedule corresponds \nto rules for 401(k) matching contributions enacted in 2001.\n  Another provision in the bill would end an unfair tax penalty faced \nby non-spouse beneficiaries. Today, when an employee dies, the benefits \nin that employee's retirement account are paid out to a non-spouse \nbeneficiary in one payment. The beneficiary must pay tax on the entire \namount, and is often forced into a higher tax bracket as a result of \nthe payment. A provision in this bill would allow non-spouse \nbeneficiaries--siblings, children, domestic partners, parents--to roll \nover the money from the plan to an IRA. This will prevent an immediate \ntax bite to grieving beneficiaries and allow them to withdraw the money \nfrom their IRA over five years or over their own life expectancy.\n  The bill also helps preserve retirement savings by allowing plans to \ndesignate default IRAs or annuity contracts to which employee rollovers \nmay be directed. Employers should be more willing to establish default \nIRA and annuity rollover options as a result, making it easier for \nemployees to keep savings in the retirement system when they change \njobs.\n  For workers who leave a job without claiming their retirement \nbenefits, the bill improves on the automatic rollover provisions \nenacted in 2001, by allowing certain small distributions from \nretirement plans to be sent to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation \n(PBGC), ensuring that participants are ultimately reunited with their \nearned benefits. The bill also expands the scope of the PBGC's \nsuccessful Missing Participants program that matches workers with lost \npension benefits.\n  Employees of state and local governments, including teachers, will \nbenefit from a number of this bill's technical corrections that will \nfacilitate the purchase of service credits in public pension programs, \nallowing state and local employees to more easily attain a full pension \nin the jurisdiction where they conclude their career. The bill also \ncontains provisions that would clarify eligibility rights of certain \nstate and local employees who participate in a Section 457 deferred \ncompensation plan.\n  Congress must take every opportunity to encourage American workers \nnot only to save for retirement, but also to preserve those hard-earned \nretirement savings. These portability improvements offer one set of \ntools for making it easier to navigate the retirement savings system \nand reach retirement with an adequate nest egg. There are many pressing \nand complex retirement issues that demand attention, but I am hopeful \nthat this legislation, narrowly focused on portability, can be \nconsidered quickly and on its own merits.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1912\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

                     ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1913. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reform \nthe system of public financing for Presidential elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, along with Senator Russ Feingold, I am \nproud today to introduce the Presidential Funding Act of 2003. This \nlegislation will improve and reform the presidential public financing \nsystem. With major presidential candidates opting out of public \nfinancing for their 2004 primary campaigns, reform of the system of \nfinancing presidential nominations is needed more than ever.\n  The presidential public financing system has been in place for three \ndecades and has achieved broad public acceptance. From 1976 to 2000, \nevery major party presidential nominee has accepted public financing \nfor the general election and, nearly all of the nominees have also \naccepted it for their primary elections. A total of 46 Democrats and 29 \nRepublicans have accepted public financing for the presidential \nprimaries during this period.\n  Since its creation, the presidential financing system has worked non-\nideologically, with victories for three Republicans and two Democrats. \nIt has also provided for competitive elections. In the five races that \nhave been run under the system involving an incumbent president, \nchallengers have won in three of those elections. This system of \nvoluntary spending limits in exchange for public funding has been a \nnonpartisan success.\n  Last year's enactment of a ban on soft money addressed what had \nbecome a basic problem for the effectiveness and credibility of the \npresidential system. For the system to continue serving the nation \neffectively, its remaining problems now must be solved. This \nlegislation will repair and revitalize the presidential campaign \nfinance system in the following ways.\n  First, our legislation increases the overall spending limit for the \npresidential primaries and provide more public matching funds for \npresidential primary candidates.\n  The overall spending limit in the primaries for publicly financed \ncandidates has failed to keep pace with reality. This was demonstrated \nwhen in 2000, public financing and spending limits for the primaries \nwere rejected and a record $100 million in private contributions was \nspent to gain the Republican party's nomination--more than twice the \namount that the publicly financed candidates were allowed to spend. \nDuring the 2004 presidential primary period, it is expected that \nRepublicans will raise and spend as much as $200 million.\n  Our legislation increases the individual contribution limit from \n$1,000 to $2,000. Therefore, it will be easier over time for other \ncandidates to reject public financing and raise private money in excess \nof the overall primary spending limit, thereby worsening the \ncompetitive disadvantage of publicly-financed candidates.\n  In addition, the ``front-loading'' of presidential primaries has \ncreated a much shorter nominating period--now likely to end by early \nMarch--and a longer actual general election period than existed when \nthe presidential financing system was created in 1974. As a result, a \npotential ``gap'' exists in funds available for a publicly financed \nnominee to spend between gaining the party nomination in March and the \nparty's summer nominating convention, when the nominee receives public \nfunds for the general election. This creates a further competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  To address these problems, our legislation increases the overall \nspending limit for the presidential primaries to $75 million from the \n$45 million limit in effect for the 2004 presidential election. This \nwould equal the $75 million spending limit in effect for the general \nelection, which applies to a much shorter period than the primaries.\n  The amount of public matching funds for individual contributions in \nthe primaries is also increased from the current one-to-one match to a \nfour-to-one match for up to $250 of each individual contribution. This \nwould greatly increase the value of smaller contributions in the \npresidential nominating process, as was intended by the presidential \nfinancing system. It would decrease the reliance on larger \ncontributions, provide more public funds to meet the higher spending \nlimit, and improve the ability of publicly financed candidates to run \ncompetitive elections.\n  When the $1000 individual contribution limit was doubled last year, \nincreasing the potential role of private contributions in the \npresidential financing system, no similar adjustment was made to \nincrease the role of public matching funds. A new four-to-one multiple \nmatch for up to $250 of each individual contribution would accomplish \nthat goal.\n  In addition, the threshold for qualifying for matching public funds \nin the primary has not changed since the system was established. Our \nlegislation increases the qualifying threshold should be increased by \nmore than doubling the threshold to require candidates to raise $15,000 \nin each of 20 states in amounts of no more than $250 per individual \ndonor. Although the existing threshold has worked well during the \nhistory of the current system, a higher qualifying amount is \nappropriate for the future, especially since candidates would now be \neligible to receive greater amounts of matching funds.\n  Second, our legislation requires a candidate to opt in or out of the \npublic financing system for the entire presidential election, including \nboth the primary and general election.\n\n[[Page S15412]]\n\n  The purpose of the presidential public financing system is to allow \ncandidates to run competitive races for the presidency without becoming \ndependent on or obligated to campaign donors. That purpose is \nundermined when a candidate opts out of the system to raise and spend \nlarge amounts of private money for a primary or general election race. \nSuch candidates should not be able to reject public financing and then \nget the system's benefits when it suits their tactical advantage. A \ncandidate should have to opt in or out of the system for the whole \nelection.\n  Third, our legislation repeals the state-by-state primary spending \nlimits and allows publicly financed primary candidates to receive their \npublic matching funds before January 1st of the presidential election \nyear.\n  The State-by-State primary spending limits have not worked. The \nlimits have proven to be ineffective and have served to unjustifiably \nmicromanage presidential campaigns.\n  Under current law, primary candidates can begin to raise private \ncontributions eligible to be matched beginning on January 1 of the year \nbefore a presidential election year. They are not eligible, however, to \nreceive any of the matching public funds until January 1 of the \npresidential election year. With the current ``front-loaded'' primary \nsystem, and with the nomination likely to be decided in the early \nmonths of a presidential election year, primary candidates need to be \nable to spend more funds at an earlier period than before. As a result, \nunder our legislation, presidential primary candidates will be eligible \nto start receiving matching public funds on July 1 of the year before a \npresidential election year.\n  Fourth, our legislation provides additional public funds in the \npresidential general election for a publicly financed candidate facing \na privately financed candidate who has substantially outspent the \ncombined primary and general election spending limits.\n  As more wealthy individuals decide to spend their personal wealth to \nrun for public office, the potential grows for an individual to spend \nan enormous amount of personal wealth to seek the presidency. There \nalready have been candidates for the U.S. Senate and in mayoral races, \nfor example, who have spent as much in personal wealth on their races \nas each major party presidential nominee received in public funds in \n2000 to run their general election campaign.\n  In addition, with the increased individual contribution limit, a \npresidential candidate could decide to forgo public funding and raise \nand spend private contributions far in excess of the spending limits \nfor publicly financed candidates.\n  To address this potential problem, our legislation makes a publicly \nfinanced major party nominee eligible to receive an additional $75 \nmillion for the general election race, when a privately financed \ngeneral election candidate has spent more than 50 percent above the \ntotal primary and general election spending limit for the publicly \nfinanced candidate.\n  In other words, once a presidential general election candidate has \nspent more than a total of $225 million to seek the presidency, a \npublicly financed major party nominee, subject to a spending limit of \n$75 million for the primaries and $75 million for the general election, \nwould receive an additional $75 million for the general election race.\n  Fifth, our legislation increases the funds available to finance the \npresidential public financing system.\n  Currently, the public financing system is funded by a voluntary $3 \ncheck-off available to taxpayers on their tax forms on an annual basis. \nThis mechanism will not raise sufficient resources in the long term to \nfinance the costs of a revised presidential system.\n  The $3 tax check-off is increased to $6 and indexed for inflation to \nhelp ensure there are sufficient funds available for future \npresidential elections. In addition, the Federal Election Commission \n(FEC) is authorized to conduct a public education campaign to explain \nto citizens why the check-off exists and how it works, including the \nfact that it does not increase the tax liability of taxpayers.\n  The current presidential public financing law creates a priority \nsystem that allocates available public funds from the check-off to the \nnomination conventions, the presidential general election and the \npresidential primaries in that order. This order of priority does not \nmake sense.\n  Our legislation revises the order of priority for use of public funds \nto make funding of the general election candidates the first priority, \nfunding of the primary election candidates the second priority, and \nfunding of the nomination conventions the third priority.\n  Furthermore, a U.S. Department of the Treasury ruling prohibits \ntaking into account the tax check-off revenues that will be received in \nApril of the presidential election year in determining at the start of \neach presidential election year the total amount of funds available to \nbe given to eligible candidates from the fund. This has had the effect \nof artificially lowering the amount of funds available and creating \ntemporary shortfalls for primary candidates during the opening months \nof the presidential election year at the time when they need the funds \nthe most.\n  Our legislation revises the law to require the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury (as it used to do) to estimate at the end of the year prior to \na presidential election year the amount of check-off funds that will be \nreceived in the presidential election year and to take these funds into \naccount in determining the total amount of funds available under the \npresidential system.\n  Finally, our legislation implements the soft money ban to ensure that \nthe parties and federal officeholders and candidates do not raise or \nspend soft money in connection with the presidential nominating \nconventions.\n  Despite the passage of the new campaign finance law and its ban on \nsoft money, federal officeholders and national party officials have \ncontinued to raise soft money to finance the national nomination \nconventions on the fictional premise that such funds are not in \nconnection with a ``federal election'' but rather are for municipal or \ncivic purposes.\n  The reality is that a presidential nominating convention is defined \nas a ``federal election'' election under the campaign finance law. \nFurthermore, federal officeholders and candidates and national party \nofficials who raise soft money for the conventions are subject to \nprecisely the same kind of problems of corruption and the appearance of \ncorruption that the new law prevents by banning soft money.\n  To reaffirm that the soft money ban applies to the presidential \nnominating conventions, our legislation explicitly prohibits the \nnational parties and federal officeholders and candidates from raising \nand spending soft money to pay for the presidential nominating \nconventions, including for a host committee, civic committee or \nmunicipality.\n  The highly expensive, front-loaded, nationalized, primary system \nrequires that we more than ever fix the presidential public funding \nsystem. We must continue to promote competition in order to give voters \nchoices. Our legislation not only saves the existing system but \nimproves it as well. It not only shores up the financial foundations of \nthe system but it would also bring more donors into the system, making \nfinancial participation more democratic. It would give our citizens a \nstake in their government. It is our hope that with the enactment of \nthis legislation, candidates will no longer take small donors for \ngranted and finally hear their voices. In return, all of our citizens \nwill feel reconnected to the presidential financing process that at \ntimes, has left them behind.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is pleasure to join my friend and \ncolleague Senator McCain in introducing a bill to repair and strengthen \nthe presidential public financing system. The Presidential Funding Act \nof 2003 will ensure that this system that has served our country so \nwell for over a generation will continue to fulfill its promise in the \n21st century.\n  The presidential public financing system was put into place in the \nwake of the Watergate scandals as part of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct of 1974. It was held to be constitutional by the Supreme Court in \nBuckley v. Valeo. Every major party nominee for President since 1976 \nhas participated in the\n\n[[Page S15413]]\n\nsystem for the general election. The system, of course, is voluntary, \nas the Supreme Court required. In the last election, then-Governor \nGeorge W. Bush opted out of the system for the presidential primaries, \nbut elected to take the taxpayer funded grant in the general election. \nHe appears ready to make the same choice in this election, and so far \ntwo of the Democratic presidential candidates have decided not to seek \nfederal matching funds in the primaries. Before 2000, almost all \nserious candidates for President had participated in the system.\n  It is unfortunate that the matching funds system for the primaries is \nbecoming less viable. The system reduces the fundraising pressures on \ncandidates and levels the playing field between candidates. It allows \ncandidates to run viable campaigns without becoming overly dependent on \nprivate donors. The system has worked well in the past, and its \nadvantages for candidates and for the country make it worth repairing \nso that it can work in the future. If we don't repair it, the pressures \non candidates to opt out because their opponents are opting out will \nincrease until the system collapse from disuse.\n  At the outset, I want to emphasize that this bill is not designed to \nhave any impact on the ongoing presidential race. It will take effect \nonly after the 2004 elections. Therefore, there is no partisan purpose \nhere. Once again, Senator McCain and I are working together to try to \nimprove the campaign finance system, regardless of any partisan impact \nthat these reforms might have. Second, we do not expect Congress to \ntake action on this bill during an election year. Instead, our hope is \nthat by introducing a bill now we can begin a conversation with our \ncolleagues and with the public that will allow us to take quick action \nbeginning in 2005 so that a new system can be in place for the 2008 \nelection.\n  The bill makes changes to both the primary and general election \nsystem to address the weaknesses and problems that have been identified \nby both participants in the system and experts on the presidential \nelection financing process. First and most important, it eliminates the \nstate-by-state spending limits in the current law and substantially \nincreases the overall spending limit from the current limit of \napproximately $45 million to $75 million. This should make the system \nmore viable for serious candidates facing opponents who are capable of \nraising significant sums outside the system. The bill also makes \navailable significantly more public money for participating candidates \nby increasing the match of small contributions from 1:1 to 4:1. Thus, \nsignificantly more public money will be available to those candidates \nwho choose to participate in the system.\n  One very important provision of this bill ties the primary and \ngeneral election systems together and requires candidates to make a \nsingle decision on whether to participate. Candidates who opt out of \nthe primary system and decide to rely solely on private money cannot \nreturn to the system for the general election. And candidates must \ncommit to participate in the system in the general election if they \nwant to receive federal matching funds in the primaries. The bill also \nincreases the spending limits for participating candidates in the \nprimaries who face a non-participating opponent if that opponent raises \nmore than 33 percent more than the spending limit. This provides some \nprotection against being far outspent by a non-participating opponent.\n  The bill also sets the general election spending limit at $75 \nmillion, indexed for inflation, which is about what it is projected to \nbe in 2008. And if a general election candidate does not participate in \nthe system and spends more than 33 percent more than the combined \nprimary and general election spending limits, a participating candidate \nwill receive a grant equal to twice the general election spending \nlimit.\n  This bill also addresses what some have called the ``gap'' between \nthe primary and general election seasons. Presumptive presidential \nnominees have emerged earlier in the election year over the life of the \npublic financing system. This had led to some nominees being \nessentially out of money between the time that they nail down the \nnomination and the convention where they are formally nominated and \nbecome eligible for the general election grant. For a few cycles, soft \nmoney raised by the parties filled in that gap, but the Bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 thankfully has now closed that loophole. \nThis bill doubles the amount of hard money that parties can spend in \ncoordination with their candidates, allowing them to fill the gap once \nthe party has a presumptive nominee.\n  Fixing the presidential public financing system will obviously cost \nmoney, but our best calculations at the present time indicate that the \nchanges to the system in this bill can be paid for by doubling the \nincome tax check-off on an individual return from $3 to just $6. The \ntotal cost of the changes to the system is projected to be around $175 \nmillion over the four-year election cycle. Of course, these projections \nmay change as we get more data from the 2004 elections. But even a \nsomewhat larger cost would be a very small investment to make to \nprotect the health of our democracy and integrity of our presidential \nelections. The American people do not want to see a return to the pre-\nWatergate days of unlimited spending on presidential elections and \ncandidates entirely beholden to private donors. We must act now to \npreserve the crown jewel of the Watergate reforms and assure the \nfairness of our elections and the confidence of our citizens in the \nprocess.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1914. A bill to prohibit the closure or realignment of inpatient \nservices at the Aleda E. Lutz Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter in Saginaw, Michigan, as proposed under the Capital Asset \nRealignment for Enhanced Services initiatives; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would prevent the closure of the Saginaw Veterans Administration \nMedical Center in Saginaw, MI.\n  As of August 2003, there were almost one million veterans in lower \nMichigan and Northwestern Ohio. These one million veterans are served \nby four V.A. Medical Centers--Saginaw, Detroit, Ann Arbor and Battle \nCreek--and 12 Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), all located \nin lower Michigan or Toledo, OH.\n  Regrettably, the Department of Veterans Affairs' Capitol Asset \nRealignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) Commission is recommending \nclosing all acute care beds at the Aleda E. Lutz Department of Veterans \nAffairs Medical Center in Saginaw, MI. The geographic range for the \nacute services in Saginaw is vast. The facility essentially covers half \nof Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Therefore, closing these inpatient beds \nin Saginaw would have a devastating impact on veterans who live in \nCentral and Northern Michigan.\n  If the Saginaw facility were to close, a veteran who lived in \nMackinaw City would have to drive 281 miles to the Detroit facility or \n272 miles to the Ann Arbor facility for medical care. Under ideal \nconditions these trips would take six hours instead of the current two \nhour trip that it would take to reach the existing Saginaw facility. \nAsking a veteran to go from Mackinaw City to Detroit is like asking a \nveteran to go from southeast Michigan to Buffalo, New York to get acute \ncare.\n  How can we ask veterans, many of whom are sick and frail, to travel \nsix hours to get necessary inpatient services? Going through a major \nillness is tough enough for our veterans. The closing of this hospital \nwould add insult to injury.\n  This bill seeks to stop this closure and ensure that the thousands of \nveterans who live in central and northern Michigan have access to the \nmedical services they deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1914\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S15414]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \nthe issuance of tax-exempt bonds for certain air and water pollution \ncontrol facilities, and to provide that the volume cap for private \nactivity bonds shall not apply to bonds for facilities for the \nfurnishing of water, sewage facilities, and air or water pollution \ncontrol facilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am proud to offer the Clean Air and \nWater Investment and Infrastructure Act.\n  Texas, like many States, faces increasingly difficult challenges in \nimproving air and water quality.\n  The Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency to set \nair quality standards and establishes deadlines for State and local \ngovernments to achieve those levels. Today, more than 90 communities \nacross the country are out of compliance with the Clean Air Act. These \nso-called ``non-attainment'' areas are threated with regulatory \nsanctions, such as loss of federal highway funding, if they do not meet \nmandated ozone levels by 2007.\n  Texas has four non-attainment areas: Beaumont-Port Arthur, Dallas-\nFort Worth, El Paso and Houston. The Houston area alone needs an \nestimated $4.1 billion annually in order to meet Federal air quality \nstandards.\n  These communities will not achieve compliance without assistance. Too \nmany industrial plants need to install expensive equipment. If these \nenvironmental investments do not become more affordable, communities \nwill either suffer sanctions or force industrial facilities to close \nand move offshore, causing substantial economic hardship.\n  Texas and many areas of the country, especially in the Southwest and \nWest, also face critical water and wastewater problems. Investments in \nsources of clean water must be made or we will face shortages in the \ncoming decades. However, necessary water infrastructure improvements \nare extremely expensive. According to the Texas State water plan, the \ncost of water supply acquisition projects, water and wastewater \ntreatment, and other infrastructure projects in Texas through 2050 will \nbe more than $100 billion.\n  Currently, air and water pollution control facilities cannot be \nfinanced by tax-exempt bonds. Even if they could, they would be limited \nby a cap which sets the total amount of tax-exempt private activity \nbonds issued by a state. Given the demands of other projects, such as \nhousing, relatively few of the air and water pollution projects would \nhave an opportunity to access this financing option.\n  In order to help us meet the challenges, I am introducing the Clear \nAir and Water Investment and Infrastructure Act. My bill will allow \nfederal tax-exempt bonds to be used by private firms for air and water \npollution control projects. Given the importance of these critical \nprojects, these bonds also would be issued outside the constraints of \nthe private-activity bond caps. The Texas Water Development Board \nestimates this could save 30 percent in financing costs for water \nprojects.\n  For example, this bill would allow tax-exempt debt to be used to \nfinance private systems along the Gulf Coast that desalinate seawater \nand brackish groundwater, and to install air pollution facilities on \nelectric utility plants. States and communities would have an important \nnew tool for addressing air and water pollution control needs.\n  Pollution control is a problem for all of us. It is to everyone's \nbenefit to develop ways to promote public and private partnerships \nwhich can finance projects to improve air and water quality. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1917\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat qualified homeowner downpayment assistance is a charitable \npurpose; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am please to introduce today, along \nwith my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, legislation that \nwill further one of the most important public policy goals we have as a \nNation--the goal of homeownership. Homeownership is a significant part \nof the American dream. It has been called the backbone of our economy. \nIt is widely considered the primary means by which American families \ncreate middle-class wealth and build financial security.\n  Homeownership is all those things and more. It is the cornerstone of \nhealthy communities across our Nation. It is good for families, good \nfor our schools, good for our neighborhoods. Equity in homes is the \nleading source for collateral for small business start-up borrowing, \nand home equity loans are the leading provider of funds for a college \neducation. Some experts even say home owners are more likely to vote.\n  Despite the many benefits, there are still too many Americans for \nwhom the\n\n[[Page S15415]]\n\nAmerican dream of homeownership is unreachable. There are too many \nAmerican families who pay rent month after month, never accumulating \nequity, never experiencing the joy of raising their children in a home \nthey own, and look forward to passing along to future generations. That \nis especially true among Americans from minority populations. Though \nnationwide nearly 70 percent of Americans own their own home, \nhomeownership rates among African-Americans and Hispanics is less than \n50 percent.\n  There are any number of obstacles to homeownership, but there is one \nproblem that is widely considered the single biggest obstacle: the lack \nof funds for a down payment. Again, this is disproportionately true \namong minority families, which frequently have less accumulated wealth \nthat can be used for a down payment.\n  President Bush has proposed creating the American Dream Down Payment \nFund, which would provide down payment assistance to 40,000 families \nevery year. I support that effort, and I applaud President Bush for \nproposing this bold new initiative. The President has set a goal of \nincreasing the number of minority homeowners by at least 5.5 million by \nthe end of this decade, which the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment estimates would create $256 billion in economic activity. I \nbelieve that is an important goal for us as a Nation.\n  I also believe that as we work to find ways for the Federal \nGovernment to increase homeownership, we need to encourage the private \nsector to do the same. There are a number of non-profit organizations \nin our country doing just that by providing a gift of down payment \nassistance to potential homeowners. These gifts of down payment \nassistance go to families and individuals who have the income to afford \na mortgage, but who would otherwise be prevented from buying a home \nbecause they lack funds for a down payment. Last year non-profit \norganizations provided gifts of down payment assistance to over 85,000 \nhome buyers--and the number will likely be much higher this year. One \norganization alone has helped over 160,000 individuals and families \nbecome homeowners, by providing a gift of funds for a down payment. And \nall without collecting a single dime of government funding.\n\n  That is why I am so pleased to be introducing this legislation today. \nI want to be sure the private sector can continue playing such a vital \nrole in increasing homeownership by providing down payment assistance. \nAlthough many charities holding tax exemptions under section 501(c)(3) \nof the Internal Revenue Code provide down payment assistance, IRS \nregulations do not clearly address down payment assistance programs.\n  Our legislation will clarify that, under certain circumstances, the \nprovision of down payment assistance to American families for use in \npurchasing low or moderate price homes constitutes charitable activity. \nRather than developing our own standard for eligible home purchases, we \nhave relied on the National Housing Act rule for FHA-insured loans. Our \nprovision applies to purchases of a principal residence if the amount \nof the mortgage is less than the maximum mortgage amount eligible for \nFHA insurance in the geographic area in which the home is located. That \nwill ensure that a charitable down payment assistance program is not \nused to support the purchase of rental properties or expensive homes.\n  Our legislation also includes one other provision designed to protect \nthe Treasury. Home sellers often contribute to charitable down payment \nassistance providers in connection with the sale of a home. Those \ncontributions are used to replenish the pool to make available gift \nassistance for other home buyers. Although the contributions are being \nmade to a charity, they are not charitable in nature; they are expenses \nof selling a home. The legislation clarifies that a party to a home \nsale transaction may not claim a charitable contribution deduction for \na contribution to a down payment assistance provider made in connection \nwith the sale.\n  Although IRS regulations do not clearly address down payment \nassistance programs, our legislation merely codifies current practice. \nAs a result, I do not anticipate that the legislation will result in a \nsignificant change in tax revenues.\n  Non-profit providers of down payment assistance help tens of \nthousands of Americans every year become homeowners. These \norganizations are changing lives, changing families, changing our \ncommunities--and they are doing it all without a single dime of \ntaxpayer funds. I am pleased my colleague from California, Senator \nFeinstein, has joined me in introducing this legislation. I ask all of \nmy colleagues to join us in this important effort.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, to introduce \nlegislation that will promote the American dream of homeownership.\n  Our legislation will specify that providing homeownership down \npayment assistance to American families constitutes a charitable \nactivity under the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  As the cornerstone of middle-class wealth in our nation, we should be \ndoing everything possible to promote broad investment in owner-occupied \nhousing. Today, we have that chance.\n  It should not be a surprise that homeownership among low to moderate \nincome families is lower than for those with higher incomes. The single \nbiggest obstacle to achieving this dream is the lack of a downpayment.\n  Across America there are organizations that assist low to moderate \nincome families with that first important step toward homeownership. In \nCalifornia, one of these groups, the Nehemiah Corporation, helps \nliterally thousands of families each year by providing down payments.\n  While the Federal Government provides tax incentives for increased \nhomeownership, we should make it easier for the private sector to \nprovide their own brand of incentives. Importantly, this legislation \nwill do several things to ensure that the private sector continues to \nhave the tools it needs to provide this important assistance.\n  One, our legislation will specify that homeownership down payment \nassistance to American families constitutes a charitable activity.\n  Currently, Internal Revenue Service regulations do not clearly \naddress the special circumstances of those organizations that provide \ndownpayment assistance to families.\n  Two, our bill is structured to ensure that a charitable down payment \nassistance program is not used to support the purchase of rental \nproperties or expensive homes.\n  Three, our legislation is designed so that the taxpayers do not pick-\nup the tab. Since, home sellers often contribute to charitable down \npayment assistance providers in connection with the sale of a home, \nthose contributions are not charitable in nature; they are an expense \nrelated to selling a home.\n  This legislation clarifies that a party to a home sale transaction \nmay not claim a charitable contribution deduction for a contribution to \na down payment assistance organization made in connection with the \nsale.\n  And, although Internal Revenue Service regulations do not \nspecifically address down payment assistance programs, our legislation \nmerely codifies current practice.\n  This legislation will ensure the continued growth of this essential \nsegment of the financial services market at no cost to the taxpayers.\n  And, as my friend from Pennsylvania has said, equity in homes is the \nleading source for collateral for small business start-up borrowing.\n  At a time when the economy still fails to produce jobs, the expansion \nof small business and the employment they provide is essential to the \nhealth of our economy.\n  It is a win-win situation in the truest sense of the term and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1922. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to comply \nwith the World Trade Organization rulings on the FSC/ETI benefit in a \nmanner that preserves manufacturing jobs and production activities in \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The American \nManufacturing Jobs Bill of 2003--which will\n\n[[Page S15416]]\n\nprovide a tax rate cut for all manufacturers who employ American \nworkers. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator John \nBreaux. On October 1, 2003, the Senate Finance Committee approved on a \nbipartisan basis S. 1673, the centerpiece of which resolves the FSC/ETI \nissue by replacing the export tax benefit with a reduction in the tax \nburden on domestic manufacturing companies.\n  I applaud S. 1673, a balanced piece of legislation crafted by \nChairman Charles Grassley, R-IA, and ranking member Senator Max Baucus, \nD-MT. I am, however, concerned that the domestic manufacturing benefit \nin S. 1673 is not applied equally to all U.S. manufacturers. This bill \nincludes a provision--a ``haircut''--that provides less of a benefit to \ncompanies that also manufacture abroad.\n  For example, a company that has 55 percent of its manufacturing in \nthe United States and 45 percent abroad will calculate its benefit \nunder the bill and then reduce that benefit by a fraction--the \nnumerator of which is the gross receipts from domestic manufacturing \nover the same derived from worldwide manufacturing.\n  This company thus suffers twice. First, the domestic manufacturing \nbenefit in S. 1673 is less valuable than the benefit currently provided \nunder FSC/ETI. Second, this company's manufacturing benefit is further \nreduced by the ``haircut'' merely because it also has overseas \nmanufacturing operations in order to be closer to their markets.\n  The ``haircut'' is a discriminatory measure that hurts both foreign-\nowned and U.S.-owned companies alike. It is structured so that the more \na company manufactures abroad, the less of a manufacturing rate cut it \ngets. The ``haircut'' makes the United States a less competitive \nlocation for current and future investment because multinational \ncompanies will believe they are being ``cheated'' and discriminated \nagainst.\n  At a time when American manufacturing jobs are leaving our country in \nrecord numbers, Congress should support all companies that employ \nAmericans. U.S. companies with global operations employ more than 23 \nmillion Americans--9 million of which are in manufacturing jobs--this \nis tantamount to three out of every five manufacturing jobs in this \ncountry. Foreign-owned companies with U.S. operations employ more than \n2 million manufacturing workers in the United States. It is these many \nof millions of manufacturing workers who will suffer if the ``haircut'' \nremains and companies are therefore discouraged to invest in the United \nStates.\n  Moreover, the ``haircut'' is inconsistent with historic tax and trade \npolicies to encourage U.S. companies to open up facilities outside the \nUnited States. In fact, there is an entire department--the Department \nof Commerce--set up to assist U.S. companies going global and then to \npromote and facilitate those same companies' efforts once they have \nestablished themselves in-country. I am also concerned that the \n``haircut'' invites mirror legislation in other countries and may \ninvite another WTO challenge to this legislation.\n  I believe we have a duty to encourage the retention and creation of \nmanufacturing jobs in the United States. We must not treat U.S. jobs \ncreated by multinational companies as ``less worthy'' than U.S. jobs \ncreated by strictly domestic manufacturers. Congress should be in the \nbusiness of rewarding all well-paid, manufacturing jobs that are \ncreated in the United States, not just those created by domestic \nmanufacturers. I believe that by eliminating the ``haircut'' and \nproviding a tax rate cut for all manufacturers who employ American \nworkers, we can help to revitalize the U.S. manufacturing sector. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of this important legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1922\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The National Film Preservation Board and the National Film \nPreservation Foundation were created by Congress under the auspices of \nthe Library of Congress, to help save America's film heritage. Today, I \nam introducing the ``National Film Preservation Act of 2003,'' which \nwill reauthorize and extend the ``National Film Preservation Act of \n1996.''\n  We first acted in 1988 in order to recognize both the educational, \ncultural, and historical importance of our film heritage, and its \ninherently fragile nature. The ``National Film Preservation Act of \n2003'' will allow the Library of Congress to continue its important \nwork in preserving America's fading treasures, as well as providing \ngrants that will help libraries, museums, and archives preserve films, \nand make those works available for study and research. These continued \nefforts are more critical today than ever before. Fewer than 20 percent \nof the features of the 1920s exist in complete form and less than 10 \npercent of the features of the 1910s have survived into the new \nmillennium.\n  The films saved by the National Film Preservation Board are precisely \nthose types of films that would be unlikely to survive without public \nsupport. At-risk documentaries, silent-era films, avant-garde works, \nethnic films, newsreels, and home movies are in many ways more \nilluminating on the question of who we are as a society than the \nHollywood sound features kept and preserved by major studios. What is \nmore, in many cases only one copy of these ``orphaned'' works exists. \nAs the Librarian of Congress, Dr. James H. Billington, has noted, ``Our \nfilm heritage is America's living past.'' I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the ``Film Preservation Act of 2003'' so that America's past \ncan survive in order to enlighten and entertain future generations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1923\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n    TITLE I--REAUTHORIZATION OF THE NATIONAL FILM PRESERVATION BOARD\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to provide for the coverage of milk production under \nthe H-2A nonimmigrant worker program; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Dairy Farm \nWorkers Fairness Act.\n  Family dairy farms are critically important to our agricultural \neconomy and to the rural way of life in many parts of the country. \nThese farms support the rural economy by supporting the local tax base \nand many local businesses. The working landscape created by our farms, \nespecially a patchwork of small farms, is also the best antidote for \nthe urban sprawl that is overtaking so much of the country. And, of \ncourse, the availability of fresh, locally produced milk is an amenity \nthat we have come to take for granted. To support our rural economies, \nthe working landscape and our local food supply systems we need to help \nsmall family dairy farms survive and thrive.\n  The most difficult challenge to the family dairy farm, after the \nvolatility in milk price, is finding and hiring workers. In my home \nState of Vermont, dairy farms are not only an important part of our \neconomy; they are an institution that has come to define our landscape. \nVermont's beauty lies in the green fields, the red barns and the cows \ngrazing on the hillside. When a farm family sells their land, which in \nmany cases may have been worked by them and their ancestors for 5 or \nmore generations, the decision is often driven by the non-stop, 7 day a \nweek, 365 days a year work schedule. As fewer rural residents choose to \nwork in agriculture, these farmers have been forced to take on more \nthemselves. The whole family can end up working without vacations, sick \nleave or having weekends off. Although dairy farming might not seem \nseasonal, the burden becomes particularly heavy during the growing \nseason when planting, haying, harvesting and storage of feed must all \noccur.\n  Dairy farmers are being forced to explore other options to find a \npredictable source of qualified labor. While other agricultural \nbusinesses in the country benefit from the temporary workers qualified \nunder the H2A Work Visa Program, dairy farms do not. The job of milking \ncows on dairy farms has been judged under the current H2A program to \nnot meet the definition of temporary or seasonal and is thus excluded. \nThe largest labor need on dairy farms during the growing season, \nremains the need for assistance with milking. The cows must be milked \ntwo or three times a day by hired help so the farmer is able to take on \nthe more complex and specialized work of operating large machinery to \nplant and harvest. While the work of milking is not seasonal or \ntemporary, the need for additional labor to accomplish the\n\n[[Page S15420]]\n\nwork is seasonal and temporary. I believe the exclusion of dairy \nfarming under the H2A program is an unintended problem in definitions, \nand our legislation is designed to fix that glitch. We must do this out \nof fairness, so that dairy farms can benefit from the same access to \nlabor that other farms have, and more importantly to help our farms \nsurvive.\n  Recently, I heard from a farmer who owns and operates, along with his \nwife, a small dairy farm in central Vermont. The couple is nearing \nretirement age and have no children of their own. They had attempted to \nfind a farm hand that could live on the farm and help with milking and \nsome of the heavier chores. After placing ads in the paper and working \nwith the state of Vermont's Department of Employment and Training, it \nbecame clear that their best option was to hire a family friend who had \na strong desire to learn farming. Since the young man was from Honduras \nthey began the visa process only to have their request for \ncertification by the U.S. Department of Labor denied because their need \nwas considered neither temporary nor seasonal. This farm plays such an \nimportant role in their rural Vermont community that I heard from \nseveral other constituents who asked for my assistance on this family's \nbehalf. The couple continues to work their land but in doing so they \nare straining their health and pushing themselves harder than they \nshould. They continue to operate their farm because they do not want to \nsell it since it is land that has been farmed for generations.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would allow this family farm, \nand so many others like it, to avail themselves of a labor source that \nexists for virtually every other farm in this country. By creating a \nperiod based on the summer growing season, dairy farms will be able to \nbring on extra help during the busiest part of the year, providing much \nneeded relief for our farm families. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting dairy farms across the United States by cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1924\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrestore the medicare program and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would allow us to help our providers and patients now.\n  If we immediately pass this bill, we can make our providers whole and \nthen go back to the drawing board to get a better Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit bill.\n  The bill includes all of the provider givebacks in the Conference \nReport accompanying H.R. 1, the Medicare Prescription Drug and \nModernization Act of 2003.\n  It includes all adjustments, word for word, for the rural provisions, \nphysician updates, graduate medical education, GME, and home health \nservices.\n  It does not add new language.\n  It does not include any provider cuts or premium increases in H.R.1.\n  Congress should pass these provisions on their own to help hospitals, \nphysicians, and patients and not hold them hostage to a prescription \ndrug bill that privatizes Medicare and provides a mediocre benefit to \nmost seniors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1926\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

HEALTH CARE THAT WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS: CITIZENS \n                   HEALTH CARE WORKING GROUP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In order to improve the health care system, the \n     American public must engage in an informed national public \n     debate to make choices about the services they want covered, \n     what health care coverage they want, and how they are willing \n     to pay for coverage.\n       (2) More than a trillion dollars annually is spent on the \n     health care system, yet--\n       (A) 41,000,000 Americans are uninsured;\n       (B) insured individuals do not always have access to \n     essential, effective services to improve and maintain their \n     health; and\n       (C) employers, who cover over 170,000,000 Americans, find \n     providing coverage increasingly difficult because of rising \n     costs and double digit premium increases.\n       (3) Despite increases in medical care spending that are \n     greater than the rate of inflation, population growth, and \n     Gross Domestic Product growth, there has not been a \n     commensurate improvement in our health status as a nation.\n       (4) Health care costs for even just 1 member of a family \n     can be catastrophic, resulting in medical bills potentially \n     harming the economic stability of the entire family.\n       (5) Common life occurrences can jeopardize the ability of a \n     family to retain private coverage or jeopardize access to \n     public coverage.\n       (6) Innovations in health care access, coverage, and \n     quality of care, including the use of technology, have often \n     come from States, local communities, and private sector \n     organizations, but more creative policies could tap this \n     potential.\n       (7) Despite our Nation's wealth, the health care system \n     does not provide coverage to all Americans who want it.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to provide for a nationwide public debate about \n     improving the health care system to provide every American \n     with the ability to obtain quality, affordable health care \n     coverage; and\n       (2) to provide for a vote by Congress on the \n     recommendations that result from the debate.\n       (c) Establishment.--The Secretary, acting through the \n     Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, shall establish \n     an entity to be known as the Citizens' Health Care Working \n     Group (referred to in this section as the ``Working Group'').\n       (d) Membership.--\n       (1) Number and appointment.--The Working Group shall be \n     composed of 15 members.

Such additional hearings do not have to be \n     completed within the time period specified in paragraph (1) \n     but shall not delay the other activities of the Working Group \n     under this section.\n       (3) The health report to the american people.--Not later \n     than 90 days after the hearings described in paragraphs (1) \n     and (2) are completed, the Working Group shall prepare and \n     make available to health care consumers through the Internet \n     and other appropriate public channels, a report to be \n     entitled, ``The Health Report to the American People''.

Mr. President, ever since the events of September 11, \n2001 awakened this Nation to the very real dangers of the world we live \nin, we have been struggling to defend ourselves against terrorism. Our \naviation system remains a primary target for terrorists, and we must be \nevery vigilant in the fight to keep that system safe. The economic \nviability, not to mention safety and security, of our country is at \nstake in that fight.\n  Nowhere is this more obvious than in New York. Not only did we bear \nthe brunt of the worst terrorist attack in our Nation's history, but we \nalso depend on our airports to fuel our state economy. John F. Kennedy \nAirport in Queens is the Nation's premier international gateway and \ncontributes approximately $30 billion to the regional economy while \nemploying 35,000 people. LaGuardia Airport, also in Queens, handles \nover 20 million passengers a year despite having only two 7000-foot \nrunways on 680 acres. Our airports in Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, and \nBuffalo have seen strong growth in recent years with the arrival of \nlow-cost carriers.\n  Unfortunately, our economic and physical security remains at risk \nbecause we still have not developed a way to effectively scan each \npiece of passenger luggage for explosives. We have recognized that in \nthe current world environment, we must scan each bag, but technology \nhas not kept up with our needs. The current technology used in most \nairports in this country is known to have a false-positive rate of \napproximately 20 percent. This means that machines incorrectly identify \n20 percent of all bags going through them as containing explosives, \nthus slowing down the process considerably as well as costing time and \nmoney. Even more dangerous is the false-negative rate of these \nmachines. This number, the percentage of bags going undetected through \nthese machines with bombs inside of them during test runs, should be \nclose to zero. The actual false-negative rate is not publicized for \nobvious reasons, but it is known to be well above zero.\n  I am proposing a bill today that seeks to create a major incentive \nfor firms to invent a bomb-scanning technology that actually works. It \nwill award $20 million to any firm that can successfully produce a \nmachine that has a false-positive rate less than 10 percent, a false \nnegative rate less than 2 percent, and is feasible for deployment en \nmasse at our Nation's airports. Although we are currently spending \nmoney on researching this technology, that funding is clearly not \ngetting us there fast enough. This new award will help to spur the \nprivate sector to develop new technology that will make a major \ndifference in the safety of our aviation system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Dayton, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1928. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to protect \nconsumers against predatory practices in connection with high cost \nmortgage transactions, to strengthen the civil remedies available to \nconsumers under existing law, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in July of 2001, and continuing through \nJanuary of the following year, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs held a series of hearings to shine a bright light on the \ndeceptive and destructive practices of predatory mortgage lenders. At \nthose hearings, the Committee heard from housing experts, community \ngroups, legal advocates, industry representatives and victims of \npredatory lending in an effort to determine how best to address this \nterrible problem. Today, I am introducing legislation, the ``Predatory \nLending Consumer Protection Act of 2003,'' along with a number of my \ncolleagues, that would begin to address the problems that came to light \nin those hearings.\n  Homeownership is the American Dream. Indeed, the Committee has \nalready passed legislation this year that would authorize a new $200 \nmillion downpayment assistance program to ensure that more people can \nachieve this goal.\n  We have taken this step because homeownership is the best opportunity \nfor most Americans to put down roots and start creating equity for \nthemselves and their families. Homeownership has been the path to \nbuilding wealth for generations of Americans, wealth that can be tapped \nto send children to college, pay for a secure retirement, or simply \nwork as a reserve against unexpected emergencies. It has been the key \nto ensuring stable communities, good schools, and safe streets. Common \nsense tells us, and the evidence confirms, that homeowners are more \nengaged citizens and more active in their communities.\n  Little wonder, then, that so many Americans, young and old, aspire to \nachieve this dream.\n  Unhappily, predatory lenders cynically play on these hopes and dreams \nto cheat people out of their wealth. These lenders target lower income, \nelderly, and, often, uneducated homeowners for their abusive practices. \nStudy after study has shown that predatory lenders also target \nminorities, driving a wedge between these families and the hope of a \nproductive life in the economic and financial mainstream of America.\n  We owe it to these hardworking families to provide protections \nagainst these unscrupulous players.\n  Let me share with you one of the stories we heard at our hearings. \nMary Ann Podelco, a widowed waitress from West Virginia, used $19,000 \nfrom her husband's life insurance to pay off the balance on her \nmortgage, thus owning her home free and clear. Before her husband's \ndeath, she had never had a checking account or a credit card. She then \ntook out a $11,921 loan for repairs. At the time, her monthly income \nfrom Social Security was $458, and her loan payments were more than \nhalf this amount. Ms. Podelco, who has a sixth grade education, \ntestified that after her first refinancing, ``I began getting calls \nfrom people trying to refinance my mortgage all hours of the day and \nnight.'' Within 2 years, having been advised to refinance seven times--\neach time seeing high points and fees being financed into her new \nloan--she owed $64,000, and lost her home to foreclosure.\n  Ms. Podelco's story is all too typical. Unfortunately, most of the \nsharp practices used by unscrupulous lenders and brokers, while \nunethical and clearly abusive, are not illegal. This bill is designed \nto address that problem by tightening the interest rate and fee \ntriggers that define high cost loans; the bill improves protections for \nborrowers receiving such loans by prohibiting the financing of \nexorbitant fees, ``packing'' in of unnecessary and costly products, \nsuch as single premium credit insurance, and limiting prepayment \npenalties. Finally, it protects these consumers' rights to seek redress \nby prohibiting mandatory arbitration, as the Federal Trade Commission \n(FTC) proposed unanimously in 2000.We often hear about the importance \nof improved enforcement as a way to combat this\n\n[[Page S15471]]\n\nproblem. As the FTC pointed out, mandatory arbitration prevents \nhomeowners from exercising any of their rights to enforce existing law.\n  We cannot extol the virtues of homeownership, as we so often do, \nwithout seeking at the same time to preserve this benefit for so many \nelderly, minority, and unsophisticated Americans who are the targets of \nunscrupulous lenders and brokers. This legislation will help achieve \nthis important goal. This bill has been endorsed by the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, the National Consumer Law Center, ACORN, National \nConsumer Reinvestment Coalition, Consumer Federation of America, the \nNAACP, the Self-Help Credit Union, the National Association of Local \nHousing Finance Agencies, the National Community Development \nAssociation, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, and the \nNational League of Cities, among others.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1928\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that the approved application under the \nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for the drug commonly known as RU-\n486 is deemed to have been withdrawn, to provide for the review by the \nComptroller General of the United States of the process by which the \nFood and Drug Administration approved such drug, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation, the RU-486 Suspension and Review Act of \n2003. The abortion drug RU-486 increases in infamy as its lethal nature \ncontinues to reveal itself. As my colleagues may remember, in \nSeptember, RU-486 claimed two more lives, one of whom was an 18-year-\nold woman. Holly Patterson, a resident of the San Francisco suburb of \nLivermore, died from an infection caused by fragments of her baby left \nin\n\n[[Page S15474]]\n\nher uterus after she was administered RU-486 at a Planned Parenthood \nfacility. This tragedy underscores the dangerous nature of this drug.\n  The available data from the U.S. trials of RU-486 raises serious \nquestions in my mind as to whether or not this drug truly is ``safe'' \nfor the women who use it. Women who participated in the U.S. trials of \nthis drug were carefully screened, and only those who were in the most \nphysically ideal condition were accepted. Even so, among these \nphysically ideal participants, troubling results emerged. Two-percent \nof the women participating hemorrhaged; one-percent had to be \nhospitalized; several others required surgery to stop the bleeding--\nsome of whom needed blood transfusions; and one woman in Iowa, after \nlosing between one-half to two-thirds of her total blood volume, would \nhave died if she had not undergone emergency surgery. If these side-\neffects occurred in the most physically ideal candidates, what about \nthose who are not in the physically ideal category? Is this drug \n``safe'' for women? I believe medical results suggest it is not.\n  The bill I am introducing today will require the suspension of the \nFood and Drug Administration's approval of RU-486. Following this \nsuspension, the General Accounting Office is directed to review the \nprocess the FDA used to approve RU-486 and to determine whether the FDA \nfollowed its own guidelines. If it is determined that the FDA violated \nits guidelines, RU-486 will be suspended indefinitely. Monty and Helen \nPatterson, the parents of Holly Patterson, have expressed their firm \nsupport for this legislation and have requested that it be known as \n``Holly's Law'' in honor of their daughter whose life was prematurely \nended. I ask that their open letter on this subject be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The Food and Drug Administration should not have authorized this \ndangerous drug. RU-486 is perilous both to the baby and to the woman \nwho uses it. I urgently call on my colleagues in this Chamber to \nsupport ``Holly's Law'' to prevent more unnecessary deaths.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                Livermore, CA,\n\n                                                November 20, 2003.\n       Dear Sir or Madam: The Alameda County Coroner's report has \n     validated what we already believed to be true. Holly has died \n     from an RU-486 chemical induced abortion. There are no quick \n     fixes for a pregnancy or magical pills that will make it go \n     away. Our family, friends and community are all deeply \n     saddened and forever marred by Holly's tragic and preventable \n     death.\n       Holly lived as an adult by law for only 19 days, yet she \n     became pregnant when she was just 17 years old. We now know \n     that she learned about her pregnancy in the second week of \n     August and was so distraught over her unplanned pregnancy \n     that she sought help for depression from her family doctor on \n     September 10, 2003--the very day that she began the drug \n     induced abortion process.\n       Holly was a strong, healthy, intelligent and ambitious \n     teenager who fell victim of a process that wholly failed her, \n     beginning with the 24-year-old man who had unprotected sex \n     with her, impregnated her, and then proceeded to facilitate \n     the secrecy that surrounded her pregnancy and abortion. Under \n     this conspiracy of silence, Holly suffered and depended on \n     the safety of the FDA approved pill administered by Planned \n     Parenthood and emergency room treatment by Valley Care \n     Medical Center where she received pain killers for severe \n     cramping and was sent home. On Saturday and Sunday, Holly \n     cried and complained of severe cramping and constipation, and \n     even allowed us to comfort her but could not tell us what she \n     was really going through. On September 17, 2003, she \n     succumbed to septic shock and died while many members of our \n     family waited anxiously, yet expectantly in the Critical Care \n     Unit for her to recover until we were forced behind the \n     curtain when it was clear that she was dying.\n       And in those last moments of her life feeling utter \n     disbelief and desperation we formed a circle just beyond the \n     curtain and prayed aloud, cried and screamed, ``We love you, \n     Holly'' hoping beyond hope that those words would ring out \n     and save her life. And the other members of our family who \n     drove and flew from all over the country to be by her side \n     did not make it in time to say, ``I love you'' just one last \n     time. Holly was not alone, unloved, unprotected or \n     unsupported; she had a large family who willingly supported \n     her throughout her short life and tragic death.\n       In the weeks since we buried Holly's body we are now able \n     to recall and share the memories of our daughter's brilliant \n     blue eyes, engaging smile, laughter, unwavering determination \n     and sheer gentle beauty that invoked our natural instinct to \n     protect and love her, but we will never be able to forget \n     those last moments of her life when she was too weak to talk \n     and could barely squeeze our hands in acknowledgement of our \n     words of encouragement. ``We love you, Holly'', ``Just hang \n     in there, the whole family is coming,'' ``You fight this \n     Holly, you can do it.''\n       Because Holly has died this way, we have educated ourselves \n     about the grave dangers of this drug, become conscious of the \n     current lack of parental notification/consent laws in \n     California and now recognize the critical need for accurate, \n     impartial sources of information and resources for parents, \n     teenagers and young women who want to learn about the real \n     dangers and risks of unplanned pregnancy and abortion and the \n     dire need for a national movement to encourage prevention and \n     open dialogue in the home about unplanned pregnancy and \n     abortion.\n       We will actively support ``Holly's Law'' in Congress by \n     Reps. DeMint, Bartlett and Senator Brownback to suspend and \n     review the abortion drug RU-486, the Tell-A-Parent (TAP) \n     bill, which requires parental notification laws in California \n     and a campaign to encourage prevention and open dialogue \n     about unplanned pregnancy and abortion in the home.\n       As parents, we cannot allow our beautiful Holly's horrible \n     death to be in vain. RU-486 has caused serious injury and has \n     been implicated in the deaths of other young women. Now it \n     has killed our daughter. We have learned that the initial \n     trials were rushed and the drug was lumped in and approved \n     with drugs designed for life threatening illnesses such as \n     cancer and AIDS. Pregnancy is a natural process that a \n     woman's body is designed to support and has never been \n     classified as a life threatening illness. We need help to \n     develop a website and provide a place for teenagers and women \n     to report their stories and testimonials of their experience \n     on the serious and adverse affects using RU-486.\n       The FDA has failed to carry out its mission of ensuring RU-\n     486 is a safe and effective abortion drug regimen. According \n     to the FDA, it is ``responsible for protecting the public \n     health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of \n     human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical \n     devices, our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products \n     that emit radiation.'' Holly has already paid the ultimate \n     price. The RU-486 abortion drug should not be either a Pro \n     Life or Pro Choice issue. The most primary concern here must \n     be the health and welfare of our children and young women. \n     Hopefully, all parents can learn from Holly's horrible death \n     and our loss.\n       According to Danco Laboratories, the abortion drug's \n     distributor, the RU-486 regimen fails to work 7-8 percent of \n     the time. Over a year ago the FDA received 400 reports of \n     adverse reactions to the drug including several deaths.\n       Holly is yet another victim who was subject to an \n     unacceptable risk to a drug that has a significant failure \n     rate. And we demand that FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan and \n     Health and Human services Secretary, Tommy Thompson take RU-\n     486 off the market immediately pending an extensive \n     investigation by the Comptroller General of the United States \n     before more parents suffer and women die.\n       We respectfully request the name of the bill that is to be \n     presented to the House of Representatives, an Act as the \n     ``[RU-486 Approval and Review Act of 2003]'' to be known as \n     ``Holly's Law.'' With actively support a bill that halts the \n     use of the drug that took Holly's young life.\n       We demand an investigation by the FDA and the California \n     State Health Department as to why abortion clinics like \n     Planned Parenthood are not following FDA approved regulations \n     to administer the drug. We question the purity of the drugs \n     they administer, especially when they are made in foreign \n     countries, such as China.\n       In addition to the dangers of this drug and its \n     administration, we believe that health care providers such as \n     Valley Medical Center don't appear to be fully prepared to \n     evaluate and treat patients with RU-486 complications in \n     emergency situations. Holly was in the hospital twice and \n     died within 20 minutes before her follow up appointment with \n     Planned Parenthood.\n       FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan and Health and Human \n     Services Secretary, Tommy Thompson should now have enough \n     evidence to pull this drug from the market. How many more \n     teenagers and young women will have to pay the price with \n     their health or with their life, before the FDA decides to \n     act?\n       Currently in California, teenage girls under the age of 18 \n     can't get their ears pierced or go on a school trip, but they \n     can have a medical or surgical abortion without parental \n     knowledge or consent. This prevents parents from being able \n     to talk to their children about a pregnancy that would allow \n     them to keep a baby or to be able to follow the abortion \n     process.\n       The first line of defense for a child is a parent. Kids \n     wouldn't be walking into clinics under a veil of secrey if \n     parents were notified first hand where they could talk to \n     their children about abortion risks. We have now learned that \n     Holly first sought a pregnancy test in the months leading up \n     to her pregnancy while she was still 17 years old. We know \n     now that a parental notification law would have brought \n     Holly's activity to our attention and her needless death \n     could have been prevented if we had been aware and \n     intervened.\n       We actively support the Tell-A-Parent (TAP) ballot \n     initative sponsored by Life on\n\n[[Page S15475]]\n\n     The Ballot www.LifeontheBallot.org. With enough petitions, \n     this initiative will be on the 2004 ballot and requires \n     parental notification 48 hours prior to an abortion in \n     California. As parents, we are concerned about the health and \n     welfare of all daughters; we are ``Pro Holly'' and look to \n     our California Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein to \n     support this initiative for the safety and protection of all \n     young women in California.\n       Finally, we have suffered greatly with the realization that \n     it's not enough to avoid the issue or talk to our children \n     about why we don't want them to be involved in an unplanned \n     pregnancy or abortion, but as parents, we must also talk \n     about the tragic realities of unwanted pregnancy and abortion \n     and reassure both, our daughters and sons that while we don't \n     want this to happen, we will support them. We must focus on \n     prevention and they must be told that they are not alone in \n     this or any other unfortunate circumstances, regardless of \n     the outcome.\n       We feel strongly that this country needs a national \n     campaign to promote open and frank discussions in the home \n     about unplanned pregnancy and the options that are available \n     to our daughters who find themselves in this unfortunate \n     predicament. We are eager to support such a campaign designed \n     to bring about awareness, encourage parental involvement, and \n     provide accurate information to minors, women, and parents \n     about abstinence, birth control, unplanned pregnancy, \n     abortion, parenting, and adoption options.\n       While parents would prefer that their daughters abstain \n     from sex and many do, we must deal with the reality that many \n     don't. In addition to unplanned pregnancy, girls can contract \n     HIV and other STIs. As parents we need to prevent unplanned \n     pregnancy instead of relying upon abortion clinics and \n     agencies to educate our children and provide them with \n     inaccurate information. No parent wants to see his or her \n     teenage or college age daughter in the unfortunate situation \n     that Holly was faced with.\n       We have lost our daughter, Holly, but we can still help to \n     prevent this terrible tragedy from happening in other \n     families. Holly's drive and determination to accomplish her \n     goals gives us strength to pursue these critical issues in \n     her name. Holly's memory and light will live on in our \n     hearts, family, friends and our work. We will actively \n     support the bill to suspend and review ``Holly's Law'' in \n     Congress by Reps. DeMint and Bartlett and Senator Brownback \n     to suspend and review the abortion drug RU-486, the Tell-A-\n     Parent (TAP) bill, which requires parental notification laws \n     in California and a campaign to encourage prevention and open \n     dialogue about unplanned pregnancy and abortion in the home. \n     Please contact us with any questions or requests for support \n     of these very important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Monty and Helen Patterson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15475-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15475-S15476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 271--URGING THE PRESIDENT AND THE UNITED STATES \n DIPLOMATIC CORPS TO DISSUADE MEMBER STATES OF THE UNITED NATIONS FROM \n SUPPORTING RESOLUTIONS THAT UNFAIRLY CASTIGATE ISRAEL AND TO PROMOTE \n     WITHIN THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY MORE BALANCED AND \n    CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACHES TO RESOLVING CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. \nLautenberg) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 271\n\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly and United \n     Nations Security Council have over a period of many years \n     engaged in a pattern of introducing and enacting measures and \n     resolutions unfairly castigating and condemning the state of \n     Israel;\n       Whereas despite the myriad of challenges facing the world \n     community, the United Nations General Assembly has devoted a \n     disproportionate amount of time and resources to castigating \n     Israel;\n       Whereas during the fifty-seventh session of the United \n     Nations General Assembly, the General Assembly adopted a \n     total of 69 resolutions by roll call vote, 22 of which \n     related to Israel;\n       Whereas many member states of the United Nations General \n     Assembly continue to engage in a discriminatory campaign \n     against Israel, including enacting on October 21, 2003 a \n     resolution that condemns Israeli security measures without \n     proportional condemnation of terrorist attacks launched \n     against Israel;\n       Whereas the discriminatory voting patterns in the United \n     Nations have historically been driven by voting blocs and \n     ideological divides originating from Cold War rivalries that \n     are obsolete in the post-Cold War period; and\n       Whereas in the post-Cold War geopolitical environment, the \n     United States has a special responsibility to promote fair \n     and equitable treatment of all nations in the context of \n     international institutions, including the United Nations: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges the President and all \n     members of the United States diplomatic corps--\n       (1) to dissuade member states of the United Nations from \n     voting in support of General Assembly resolutions that \n     unfairly castigate Israel; and\n       (2) to promote within the United Nations General Assembly \n     more balanced and constructive approaches to resolving \n     conflict in the Middle East.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to submit, along with my \ngood friend and colleague Senator Corzine, a bipartisan resolution \ndealing with the unfair treatment of Israel at the United Nations.\n  For too long, Israel has been singled out for castigation by the \nUnited Nations General Assembly. Israeli defensive actions are \ncondemned, while terrorism against Israeli civilians goes largely \nunnoticed. There are whole bodies designed to do nothing but produce \nanti-Israel materials. There is a Division of Palestinian Rights which \nsits at the same level in the U.N. organization as a single division \nfor the Americas and Europe, a single division for Asia and the \nPacific, and two Africa divisions. Of all the resolutions adopted by \nrollcall vote at the last session of the UN General Assembly, one-third \nsingled out Israel.\n  Let me be clear on this point: I do think it is appropriate to help \nthe Palestinian people, and I do share President Bush's vision of two \nstates living side by side in peace.\n  But for the United Nations to spend so much of its time on this one \ncrisis, with an unbalanced approach, ultimately undermines its ability \nto contribute constructively to the peace process. To accord the \nPalestinian people--however serious their problems are the same level \nof attention as entire continents is inappropriate in a world where \nthere are so many other oppressed groups and nations. Why is there no \nDivision of Tibetan Rights? Why no Division of Chechen Rights?\n  If you look at the General Assembly voting records, there are too \nmany one-sided resolutions dealing with Israel that pass with only a \nhandful of negative votes--cast by the U.S., Israel, Micronesia, the \nMarshall Islands, Nauru and Palau. Last Friday, I was pleased to note \nAustralia joined us as well.\n  The good news is that we are starting to see some progress. A joint \nU.S.-European-Israeli effort to consolidate seven resolutions on UNRWA \ninto one resolution recently was a good start. The resolution was \npassed out of the committee by a vote of 109 to 0, albeit with 54 \nabstentions. True, several superfluous resolutions on UNRWA were also \napproved by the committee. But this year, it was five resolutions \ninstead of seven.\n  When the U.S., Europe, and Israel can work together on a resolution \ndealing with Palestinian refugees--and one that is passed without any \nnegative votes--we get a glimpse of the U.N.'s potential for bringing \nparties together.\n  I would be remiss if I did not commend the work of U.S. diplomats, \nand applaud their increased attention to this issue. This resolution \ngives them a tool to use with their diplomatic counterparts--a strong \nstatement from the U.S. Senate that we are paying attention to these \nvotes, and that we support a more balanced approach toward the Middle \nEast at the United Nations.\n  It should be a goal we can all agree upon. By reducing the number of \nanti-Israel resolutions passed by the General Assembly, the United \nNations can live up to the promise of its charter: ``to practice \ntolerance and live together in peace with one another as good \nneighbors.''\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Coleman, \nLautenberg and Voinovich, I am submitting a resolution to address a \nserious and persistent problem: the unfair and inequitable treatment of \nIsrael in the United\n\n[[Page S15476]]\n\nNations. The resolution urges the President and all members of the \nUnited States diplomatic corps to dissuade member states of the United \nNations from voting in support of General Assembly resolutions that \nunfairly castigate Israel, and to promote within the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly more balanced and constructive approaches to resolving \nconflict in the Middle East.\n  On October 21, 2003, the United Nations General Assembly ratified a \nresolution condemning Israeli security measures. The resolution did not \ncall on the Palestinian Authority to dismantle terrorist organizations, \nnor did it name those organizations. Yet it passed by a vote of 144-4, \nwith 12 abstentions. Other than the United States, only Micronesia, the \nMarshall Islands, and Israel itself voted against the resolution.\n  This resolution was only the latest in a long line of General \nAssembly resolutions castigating Israel with little regard to the \nsecurity threats that Israel faces. For decades, the Assembly has \ndevoted a disproportionate amount of time and resources to resolutions \nrelated to Israel--conducting, for example, 22 rollcall votes on UN \nGeneral Assembly resolutions that related to Israel out of the 69 for \nall of the 57th Session of the Assembly. Besides distracting the United \nNations from the countless other critical issues the world faces, these \nresolutions undermine efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East by \ncasting blame almost entirely on one party. They are also unfair in \nthat they subject Israel to discriminatory treatment not accorded to \nany other member state of the UN.\n  It is long past time for the General Assembly to stop ratifying these \nbiased, unproductive resolutions. Voting patterns that discriminate \nagainst Israel appeared during the Cold War, when conflict in the \nMiddle East was fueled by the rivalry between the West and the Soviet \nbloc. The Cold War has ended. So, too, should the polarization it \nengendered. We have also seen new alliances and relationships emerge in \nthe global war on terrorism, and have witnessed the world come together \nin condemning terrorist violence. I refer to UN Security Council \nResolution 1373, passed on September 28, 2001, which reaffirmed that \nany act of international terrorism constitutes a threat to \ninternational peace and security and called on states to work together \nto prevent and suppress terrorist acts.\n  Resolution 1373 reminded us of what the United Nations was meant to \nbe--a forum for the world to come together to identify common threats \nand find common ways to address them. It offered the hope of a world \nunited in its resolve to fight terrorism, with the United States \nleading that fight--in Afghanistan and in other parts of the world \nwhere international terrorists operate.\n  It is therefore with great disappointment that we witness business as \nusual at the General Assembly. The spirit of unity that prevailed for a \ntime after September 11 has not led to a common approach to the \nconflict in the Middle East, and the United States has thus far been \nunable to enlist its friends and allies in its effort to ensure that \nIsrael is treated fairly.\n  Since the inception of the United Nations, the United States has \nplayed a unique and critical role in ensuring that the U.N. lives up to \nthe promise of its Charter--to maintain peace and security. As the sole \nremaining superpower, we have an opportunity to shape a global \nconsensus on terrorism and security, one that requires new, more \nproductive approaches to the conflict in the Middle East. This requires \nthat we recognize the harm that comes from repeated, biased \ncondemnations of a valuable ally in the United Nations General \nAssembly. It also requires sustained efforts, in the United Nations and \nwithin our bilateral and multilateral relationships, to change the \nvoting patterns of friends, allies, and other member states.\n  We must bring our own values and our own vision of peace and security \nto the United Nations. Voting against resolutions that unfairly \ncastigate Israel is not enough, particularly when we find ourselves in \na tiny minority. We must seek to ally the world with us on this \ncritical matter. The resolution we are introducing today thus urges the \nPresident and all members of the United States diplomatic corps to \ndissuade member states of the United Nations from voting in support of \nGeneral Assembly resolutions that unfairly castigate Israel, and to \npromote within the Nations General assembly more balanced and \nconstructive approaches to resolving conflict in the Middle East.\n  The United Nations can be--must be--a forum for defending our values. \nThrough committed leadership, we can begin to change how other \ncountries approach the General Assembly and how they vote on issues \nrelated to the Middle East. By doing so, we will be taking an important \nstep toward peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15476-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 272--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING NOVEMBER 16, \n                    2003, AS AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Warner, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Johnson, \nand Mr. Grassley) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 84\n\n       Whereas, on September 11, 2001, the National Guard and \n     Reserve responded to the horrific terrorist attacks on the \n     United States with professionalism and courage, rescued the \n     injured, saved lives in New York City, provided protection to \n     the Pentagon, and flew combat air patrols over Washington, \n     D.C., and other major cities;\n       Whereas, on September 14, 2001, in Executive Order 13223, \n     President Bush proclaimed a national emergency, and exercised \n     his authority under section 12302 of title 10, United States \n     Code, to allow him to call up as many as 1,000,000 National \n     Guard and Reserve members to active duty for up to two years;\n       Whereas more than 300,000 National Guard and Reserve \n     members have been called to active duty under this Executive \n     Order, serving on the front lines by fighting terrorists in \n     Africa and Asia and keeping the peace in Afghanistan, the \n     Balkans, and Iraq;\n       Whereas the National Guard and Reserve are taking on \n     unprecedented challenges;\n       Whereas 64 percent of National Guard and Reserve members \n     have been called up for active duty during at least one of \n     the seven major mobilizations since 1990;\n       Whereas 7,800 National Guard and Reserve members have been \n     mobilized more than once to serve in the Global War on \n     Terrorism, and members serve between 60 and 120 days per \n     year;\n       Whereas 42,000 of the approximately 160,000 United States \n     troops currently in Iraq are members of the National Guard \n     and Reserve;\n       Whereas the National Guard and Reserve are being deployed \n     to Iraq without critical protective equipment, such as body \n     armor,\n\n[[Page S15477]]\n\n     carbines, laser sights, night vision goggles, desert boots, \n     Camel Back water carriers, aviation holsters, aviation \n     protective masks, radios, and desert camouflage uniforms;\n       Whereas many National Guard and Reserve units are using \n     older and outdated equipment;\n       Whereas, due to equipment shortages throughout the National \n     Guard and Reserve, units are being stripped of equipment in \n     favor of units being deployed, leaving other units without \n     equipment with which to train;\n       Whereas at least one National Guard and Reserve unit asked \n     hospitals in the United States to donate medical supplies to \n     cover its shortages; and\n       Whereas a poll taken in Iraq by Stars & Stripes reveals \n     that 48 percent of National Guard and Reserve troops consider \n     their morale ``low'' or ``very low'', compared with only 15 \n     percent reporting ``high'' or ``very high'' morale: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the sacrifices made by the members in the \n     regular and reserve components of the Armed Forces;\n       (2) expresses concern about their safety and security; and\n       (3) urges the Secretary of Defense to take immediate steps \n     to ensure that the National Guard and Reserves are provided \n     with the same equipment as the regular components.\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the relationship between the active \nand reserve components in the United States military is known as the \n``total-force'' concept. Active duty units cannot fight wars without \nthe support and participation of units from the National Guard and \nReserve. It is this aspect of the all volunteer military that \ndistinguishes the American armed forces from the praetorian armies of \nold and links the broader public, intimately, to the costs and \nsacrifices of war.\n  The men and women of the American military continue to preform \nmagnificently. They are executing difficult missions in distant lands \naround the globe. There are more than 130,000 troops in Iraq, 30,000 in \nKuwait, 37,000 in Korea, and 10,000 in Afghanistan. At this moment, \nmore than 164,000 national guardsmen and reservists are on active duty, \nand the Pentagon has recently announced two more rounds of activation, \nincreasing that number by another 58,000 troops. With more than 60 \npercent of the Army's active combat strength deployed or preparing to \ndeploy, the men and women of the National Guard and Reserves are \nessential to our efforts in the war on terrorism and the stabilization \nof Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  These deployed ``weekend warriors'' are much more than part-time \nsoldiers; they are full-time war-fighters serving alongside active duty \nunits, performing the same missions, facing the same dangers, paying \nthe same bloody price.\n  Despite this fact, the equipment of the National Guard and Reserves \nhas been substandard when compared to the equipment available to \nmembers of the active units for far too long. This peace-time nuisance \nis a mortal danger in war. It is inexcusable that any U.S. units, \nwhether active or reserve, would deploy to a combat zone without the \nlatest equipment and technology.\n  But we have heard concerns about National Guard and Reserve units \nlacking the latest gear or technology: helicopters lacking basic \ndefense systems; Humvees without the additional armor needed to protect \ntheir occupants; and inadequate supplies of personal body armor. It is \na dereliction of duty to send anyone into harm's way without basic \nprotective gear.\n  The Concurrent Resolution submit today, expresses our concern for the \nwelfare and security of all the men and women of the United states \nmilitary, whether they serve in the active duty military, the National \nGuard, or the reserves. If this is to truly be a ``total-force,'' then \nwe must also commit ourselves to equipping it as such. The courageous, \nyoung men and women of our armed forces deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15477-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15477-S15478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 85--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nTHE CONTINUED PARTICIPATION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN THE GROUP OF 8 \n  NATIONS SHOULD BE CONDITIONED ON THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT VOLUNTARILY \n     ACCEPTING AND ADHERING TO THE NORMS AND STANDARDS OF DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 85\n\n       Whereas the countries that comprise the Group of 7 nations \n     are pluralistic societies with democratic political \n     institutions and practices, committed to the observance of \n     universally recognized standards of human rights, respect for \n     individual liberties, and democratic principles;\n       Whereas in 1991 and subsequent years, the leaders of the \n     Group of 7 nations, heads of the governments of the major \n     free market economies of the world who meet annually in a \n     summit meeting, invited then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin \n     to a post-summit dialogue;\n         Whereas in 1998, the leaders of the Group of 7 nations \n     formally invited President Boris Yeltsin of Russia to \n     participate in an annual gathering that subsequently was \n     known as the Group of 8 nations, although the Group of 7 \n     nations have continued to hold informal summit meetings and \n     ministerial meetings that do not include the Russian \n     Federation;\n         Whereas the invitation to President Yeltsin to \n     participate in the annual summits was in recognition of his \n     commitment to democratization and economic liberalization, \n     despite the fact that the Russian economy remained weak and \n     the commitment of the Russian Government to democratic \n     principles was uncertain;\n         Whereas under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, \n     the Russian Government has attempted to control the \n     activities of independent media enterprises, nongovernmental \n     organizations, religious organizations, and other pluralistic \n     elements of Russian society in an attempt to mute criticism \n     of the government;\n         Whereas the suppression by the Russian Government of \n     independent media enterprises has resulted in widespread \n     government control and influence over the media in Russia, \n     stifling freedom of expression and individual liberties that \n     are essential to any functioning democracy;\n         Whereas the arrest and prosecution of prominent Russian \n     business leaders who had supported the political opposition \n     to President Putin are examples of selective application of \n     the rule of law for political purposes;\n         Whereas the courts of Great Britain, Spain, and Greece \n     have consistently ruled against extradition warrants issued \n     by the Russian Government after finding that the cases \n     presented by the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation \n     have been inherently political in nature;\n         Whereas Russian military forces continue to commit brutal \n     atrocities against the civilian population in Chechnya;\n         Whereas the rise to influence within the Russian \n     Government of unelected security officials from the KGB of \n     the former Soviet Union is increasingly undermining the \n     commitment of the Russian Government to democratic \n     principles, accountability, and transparency;\n         Whereas a wide range of observers at think tanks and \n     nongovernmental organizations have expressed deep concern \n     that the Russian Federation is moving away from the political \n     and legal underpinnings of a market economy; and\n         Whereas the continued participation of the Russian \n     Federation in the Group of 8 nations, including the \n     opportunity for the Russian Government to host the Group of 8 \n     nations in 2006 as planned, is a privilege that is premised \n     on the Russian Government voluntarily accepting and adhering \n     to the norms and standards of democracy: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the selective prosecution of political opponents and \n     the suppression of free media by the Russian Federation, and \n     the continued commission of widespread atrocities in the \n     conduct of the brutal war in Chechnya, do not reflect the \n     minimum standards of democratic governance and rule of law \n     that characterize every other member state in the Group of 8 \n     nations;\n       (2) the continued participation of the Russian Federation \n     in the Group of 8 nations, including the opportunity for the \n     Russian Government to host the Group of 8 nations summit in \n     2006 as planned, should be conditioned on the Russian \n     Government accepting and adhering to the norms and standards \n     of free, democratic societies as generally practiced by every \n     other member nation of the Group of 8 nations, including--\n       (A) the rule of law, including protection from selective \n     prosecution and protection from arbitrary state-directed \n     violence;\n       (B) a court system free of political influence and \n     manipulation;\n       (C) a free and independent media;\n       (D) a political system open to participation by all \n     citizens and which protects freedom of expression and \n     association;

Mr. President, as ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I ask my colleagues to join me today in \npassing S. 1136, the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act. This important \nbill would restate and update the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief \nAct of 1940, a law that protects servicemembers from worrying about \ncivil lawsuits and pre-existing debts while they are in uniform \ndefending the United States. The bill reasserts our commitment to \nprotect and care for those servicemen and women who often make \ntremendous sacrifices to serve our nation.\n  Civil protections have been afforded to servicemembers in the United \nStates since the War of 1812. The first modern version of the SSCRA was \nenacted after the U.S. entered World War I. In 1940, Congress reenacted \nmany of the WWI provisions, but raised the protection on rent evictions \nby $30 to reflect the rise in the cost of living. Congress continued to \nupdate and supplement provisions over the years to adapt the \nprotections to the changing needs and circumstances of servicemembers. \nIn 2002, responding to the lengthy mobilization of National Guard \nmembers to safeguard the nation's airports after the attacks of \nSeptember 11, Congress extended SSCRA protections to Guard members \ncalled up by the President to respond to national emergencies who \nremain under the authority of the State Governors.\n  This legislation would restate, clarify, and revise the Soldiers' and \nSailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, SSCRA, and its subsequent \namendments. The SSCRA's main purpose has been to suspend some of the \nlegal obligations incurred by military personnel prior to entry into \nthe service or mobilization for active service in the Reserves or the \nNational Guard. The core protections provided by the SSCRA are: stays \nof civil legal proceedings during a person's period of military \nservice; an interest rate cap of 6 percent on debts incurred before \nactive duty; protection from eviction and termination of pre-service \nresidential leases; and legal residency protection. Also, \nservicemembers are able to terminate a lease on a home if given orders \nto move. Because of the SSCRA, servicemembers have not had to worry \nabout being sued or being evicted from their homes while deployed. \nInstead, the legislation has allowed them to properly keep their focus \non military duties.\n  The legislation before us, S. 1136, would update the SSCRA to better \naddress the obligations servicemembers incur today. For example, due to \nthe escalating costs of rental housing over\n\n[[Page S15499]]\n\nthe past few decades, this act will provide greater protection for \nservicemembers and their families from being evicted during times of \nmilitary service. Currently, servicemembers are protected from eviction \nif they have a monthly rent of $1200 or less. This legislation will \nraise the bar to $2,400, to be adjusted annually based on the annual \nincrease in the Consumer Price Index, thus avoiding the future need for \nfrequent amendments to the law.\n  Continuing the effort to make the SSCRA applicable to today's \nservicemembers' lifestyles, this legislation would allow servicemembers \nto be released from a lease for an automobile if they are deployed for \nan extended period of time or moved overseas. It was necessary to add \nthis protection because auto leasing has become such a popular \nalternative to purchasing in recent times, yet many leases prohibit the \nremoval of cars from the United States.\n  This bill would also look after the needs of small business owners \nwho serve, particularly those in the Reserves and National Guard. If \npassed, the bill would preserve the assets of small business owners \nduring military service if the servicemember is personally liable for \ntrade or business debts.\n  I thank the leadership of my colleagues who serve on the House \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, Senator Specter, and Senators Ben Nelson and Zell \nMiller, who have all worked together to provide a comprehensive and \nnecessary set of benefits which will relieve many of the personal \nburdens some of our servicemembers face when they are called into duty. \nThe benefits will allow them to continue focusing their efforts on \ntheir heroic duties for our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critical measure and restore the \nfundamental justice due our veterans.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the committee substitute amendment \nbe agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee then be discharged from further \nconsideration of H.R. 100, and the Senate proceed to its consideration. \nI further ask all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. \n1136, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill as amended be \nread a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable en bloc, S. 1136 then be returned to the calendar, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Banking \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1531 and that \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1531) to require the Secretary of the Treasury \n     to mint coins in commemoration of Chief Justice John \n     Marshall.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1531, \nthe Chief Justice John Marshall Commemorative Coin Act. I am the \nsponsor of this significant legislation and I believe its passage is \nindeed a tribute to the most important Chief Justice to serve on the \nSupreme Court of the United States since our nation's founding.\n  John Marshall served as the fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court \nfor over 34 years. He is the longest serving Chief Justice in our \nNation's history. Throughout his years on the Supreme Court, he \nauthored over 500 opinions, many of which significantly impacted the \noperations and interpretations of the Constitution. He was a \ndistinguished leader who made a lasting impression on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  For example, probably Marshall's most famous opinion, Marbury v. \nMadison, instilled in the Supreme Court the authority to review the \nconstitutionality of congressional acts and instituted the doctrine of \njudicial review. Without judicial review, the Supreme Court and the \nlower courts of our great nation would not have the ability to uphold \nand sustain the Constitution and stop any unauthorized intrusion into \nthe sacred freedoms that great document protects.\n  The Marshall Court decided numerous landmark and historically \nsignificant cases that have forever fashioned the Nation's \nconstitutional law and history--including McCullough v. Maryland, \nCohens v. Virginia, Stuart v. Laird, Dartmouth College v. Woodward, and \nGibbons v. Ogden, just to name a few. These cases are still cited today \nby our Federal courts and State courts as impressive precedents \nimportant to recognize that establish significant legal doctrines and \nrelevant constitutional interpretations.\n  Chief Justice Marshall is not only the longest serving Chief Justice \nin the history of the United States, but he has authored more opinions \nfor the Court than any other Chief Justice in the Supreme Court's \nhistory. That impressive record remains in place today.\n  It is noteworthy to recognize that Chief Justice Marshall also \nintroduced and implemented the practice of allowing one justice to \nspeak for the Court while having the remaining justices either sign on \nto that opinion or issue their own concurring or dissenting opinion. \nPrior to Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, Justices usually wrote their \nown opinions and a party in a case had to thoroughly study the \nparticular nuances in each individual Justice's opinion in order to \ndiscover which side prevailed.\n  Chief Justice Marshall was also a Revolutionary War veteran, Envoy \nExtraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to France, Member of the \nUnited States House of Representatives, and Secretary of State under \nPresident John Adams.\n  I believe minting a coin is a fitting honor for the Great Chief \nJustice. This coin will commemorate the 250th anniversary of the birth \nof Chief Justice Marshall, which will take place in the year 2005.\n  This legislation will allow the Supreme Court Historical Society to \nreceive the necessary revenue it needs for worthwhile endeavors. The \nSupreme Court Historical Society is an established national \norganization whose programs and endeavors benefit Americans in every \nState in the Union. The Supreme Court Historical Society operates a \nSummer Institute for Teachers, with brings teachers from across the \nnation to Washington to study the Supreme Court and the Constitution \nfirst hand. This particular program helps to improve public school \neducation about the role and importance of the Court in our Government.\n  The Supreme Court Historical Society collects antiques and historical \nartifacts for the use of the Court Curator's educational displays at \nthe Supreme Court Building. There are still many artifacts and antiques \nthat would preserve the precious history of the Court that the Society \nlacks the funds to acquire.\n  The Supreme Court Historical Society also holds public lectures at \nthe Supreme Court Building and around the country which usually feature \ncurrent Justices on the Supreme Court and other important leaders in \nconstitutional and legal scholarship.\n  The Chief Justice John Marshall Commemorative Coin Act will allow for \n400,000 coins bearing the likeness of the Great Chief Justice, John \nMarshall, in 2005, with a surcharge of $10 per coin. The sale of these \ncoins has the capability to produce nearly $4,000,000 in direct support \nof the Supreme Court Historical Society's programs and functions.\n  Furthermore, I put a provision in this bill to ensure that there is \nno net\n\n[[Page S15501]]\n\ncost to the Federal Government in minting this coin. This provision is \nimportant, especially in a time when many are concerned about \ncontrolling deficit spending and making sure Congress does not unduly \nburden the American people with unnecessary debt.\n  Never in the history of this country has a coin been minted focusing \non the history of the Supreme Court or on its profound influence on our \nconstitutional form of government. Unless citizens have some form of \nlegal training or a scholarly interest, the Supreme Court and our \nFederal courts are usually the least understood of the three branches \nof the government. Yet what it does has an impact, both direct and \nindirect, on the rights of every citizen.\n  The Chief Justice John Marshall Commemorative Coin Act has the \nsupport of every sitting Justice on the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. It is likewise supported by the Citizens Commemorative Coin \nAdvisory Committee and the former Solicitors General across party \nlines.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, as many have. I am \nconfident this bill will benefit the entire country and as it will help \npreserve and protect the history of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the \nJohn Marshall Commemorative Coin Act, S. 1531.\n  As an original cosponsor of the John Marshall Commemorative Coin Act, \nI have worked closely with Senator Hatch to do all that we possibly can \nto speedily pass it into law.\n  This bill authorizes the Treasury Department to mint and issue coins \nin honor of Chief Justice John Marshall in the year 2005. Funds raised \nby sale of the coin will support the Supreme Court Historical Society. \nSales of the coin also cover all of the costs of minting and issuing \nthese coins, so that the American taxpayer is not bearing any cost \nwhatsoever of this commemoration.\n  That sales of a coin that bears the likeness of Chief Justice \nMarshall will be used to the support of the Supreme Court Historical \nSociety is fitting. The society is a nonprofit organization whose \npurpose is to preserve and disseminate the history of the Supreme Court \nof the United States. Founded by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the \nsociety's mission is to provide information and historical research on \nour Nation's highest court. The society accomplishes this mission by \nconducting programs, publishing books, supporting historical research \nand collecting antiques and artifacts related to the Court's history. \nJohn Marshall is known as ``the great Chief Justice'' of the Supreme \nCourt. Marshall served on the bench for 34 years and established many \nof the constitutional doctrines we revere today. He is best known and \nrespected for the fundamental principles of checks and balance of our \ndemocratic government.\n  In our successful efforts to gender support for the bill, we gained \nover 75 cosponsors in the U.S. Senate. Given the noble cause, it was \nnot a hard sell. Yet, the sheer numbers of bipartisan supporters are a \nfitting tribute to the Great Chief Justice John Marshall. We are happy \nto assist a worthwhile organization like the Supreme Court Historical \nSociety.\n  I thank all the Senators who supported this bill--too numerous to \nname. I also thank the Supreme Court Historical Society for its \ndedication to this important cause.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1531) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 112, S. 579.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 579) to reauthorize the National Transportation \n     Safety Board, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is now \nconsidering S. 579, the National Transportation Safety Board \nReauthorization Act of 2003. This bill was introduced by Senators \nHollings, Lott, Hutchison, Rockefeller and myself, and it was \nunanimously approved by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation on March 22, 2003.\n  Each year, the National Transportation Safety Board, NTSB, \ninvestigates more than 2,000 transportation accidents and events, \nincluding all fatal aviation accidents, and hundreds of railroad, \nhighway, maritime, and pipeline transportation accidents. The NTSB also \nconducts safety studies, and evaluates the effectiveness of other \ngovernment agencies' programs for preventing transportation accidents. \nMost importantly, the NTSB makes safety recommendations, based on its \ninvestigations, to federal, state and local government agencies and to \nthe transportation industry regarding actions that should be taken to \nprevent accidents.\n  This legislation would authorize appropriations for the NTSB for \nfiscal years 2003 through 2006. It also would allow the NTSB to \nrelinquish responsibility for providing assistance to families of \nvictims of accidents to the FBI if it takes over the investigation, and \ngive the NTSB expedited procurement procedures to aid in accident \ninvestigations.\n  The bill is being proposed along with an amendment that incorporates \nprovisions from the House-passed version of its NTSB reauthorization \nbill, H.R. 1527. The amendment was developed in cooperation with the \nHouse Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Among other things, \nit includes a provision that would require the Secretary of \nTransportation to submit annual status reports on the Department's \nprogress in meeting the safety recommendations stemming from the NTSB's \n``most wanted list.''\n  The NTSB's safety investigations and the resulting recommendations \nplay a vital role in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of our \nnation's transportation system. It is my understanding that the NTSB \nsupports this legislation.\n  I urge the Senate to pass this important legislation so the House of \nRepresentatives can consider it before they adjourn for the year.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the McCain-Hollings amendment \nat the desk be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed; the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, \nand any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2211) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To add provisions relating to accident and safety data \n classification and publication from H.R. 1527, as passed by the House \n              of Representatives, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 2, line 15, strike ``$3,000,000.'' and insert \n     ``$4,000,000.''.\n       On page 3, line 6, strike ``paragraph'' and insert \n     ``subsection''.\n       On page 3, line 16, strike the closing quotation marks and \n     the second period.\n       On page 3, line 17, strike ``(c)'' and insert `` `(d)''.\n       On page 3, line 21, insert closing quotation marks and a \n     period after the period.\n       On page 5, strike lines 7 through 21, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 371, H.R. 3349.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3349) to authorize salary adjustments for \n     Justices and judges of the United States for fiscal year \n     2004.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up \nand passing legislation to authorize salary adjustments for Justices \nand judges of the United States for fiscal year 2004.\n  As a member of both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the \nJudiciary, I have worked hard to help preserve a fair and independent \njudiciary. I have repeatedly introduced and cosponsored legislation to \ngive our Federal judges meaningful and significant pay raises. I have \nbeen disappointed that the Continuing Resolutions approved by Congress \nfail to give the Federal judiciary even a cost-of-living adjustment, \nCOLA.\n  In 1975, Congress enacted the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living \nAdjustment Act, intended to give judges, Members of Congress, and other \nhigh ranking executive branch officials automatic COLAs as accorded \nother Federal employees unless rejected by Congress. In 1981, Congress \nenacted section 140 of Public Law 97-92, mandating specific \ncongressional action to give COLAs to judges. During the 21 years of \nsection 140's existence, Congress has always accorded to the Federal \njudiciary coequal respect by suspending section 140 whenever Congress \nhas granted to itself and other Federal employees a COLA. With the end \nof the last Congress, however, the continuing resolutions providing \nfunding failed to suspend section 140, thus ensuring that no COLA would \nbe provided for Federal judges during the current fiscal year, unless \nother action is taken.\n  In April of this year, I introduced legislation to respond to the \nshortfall in real judicial compensation, to repeal the link of judicial \npay to congressional pay, to improve survivorship benefits, and to \ninstill greater public confidence in our courts. This legislation would \nhave obviated the annual need to pass judicial cost of living \nadjustments. Unfortunately, the Fair and Independent Judiciary Act of \n2003 was never put on the agenda in committee for consideration.\n  I hope we can all agree that the Judiciary deserves a cost of living \nadjustment. I look forward to Senate passage of this bill to give our \nfederal judges a cost of living adjustment. I hope the President will \npromptly sign our legislation into law.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In addition, I inform my colleagues that \nthere will be no rollcall votes during tomorrow's session. It is my \nhope that we will be able to schedule a vote on the conference report \nfor Monday. I will continue to work with the Democratic leadership to \nreach an agreement for a final vote.\n  In addition, we will in all likelihood be in session on Sunday as \nwell to continue the debate on Medicare. I will tomorrow make further \nannouncements about Sunday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/21/senate-section/article/S15510-5", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
