Mr. President, I want to talk today about several \nagricultural issues.\n  First, last week, I met with John Stewart and Bill Fielding. They run \na company called Creekstone Farms that sells premium Black Angus beef \ncattle.\n  Creekstone had a good marketing idea: In the wake of the mad cow \nscare, Creekstone thought that one way to re-open the Japanese markets, \nwhich had accounted for 28 percent of our Nation's beef exports, would \nbe to privately test all of their cattle for BSE, or mad cow disease, \nat no cost to the taxpayers.\n  The Japanese markets have been closed for several months, but they \nhave said that they would re-open their markets for Creekstone's beef.\n  Creekstone has built a top-notch laboratory at their headquarters in \nKansas, and they have hired several full-time animal health experts. \nBut they wanted to do this the right way, so they asked USDA to support \nthem in their efforts.\n  The Department actually said ``no.'' They said Creekstone could not \ntest.\n  You see, USDA doesn't want to set a precedent that all beef needs to \nbe tested. They suggest that large meat packers might essentially be \nforced into testing all animals. That, USDA contends, would be \nexpensive and, well, inconvenient.\n  But nobody is suggesting that the Government mandate 100 percent \ntesting. If a meat packer wanted to test, however, it might be a good \nmarketing tool for them.\n  But the packers say testing would be too cumbersome, that consumers \ndon't want and don't need testing information.\n  All of those arguments ring very familiar and very hollow. Remember, \nthe packers and the Bush administration opposed another marketing \ntool--country-of-origin labeling for those very same reasons.\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\n  USDA says that mad cow disease, or BSE, isn't even a public health \nissue. They say it is only an animal health issue, but tell that to the \nmore than 120 people who died from the human form of BSE in Britain. It \nwas a food safety issue for them. It is a public health issue.\n  Creekstone even acknowledges, and I agree, that the science does not \nnow suggest that all cattle need to be tested for BSE. They acknowledge \nthat. Most experts do.\n  But consumers don't always base their purchasing preferences on \nscience. The Japanese, who, by the way, test all of their beef for BSE, \nwant their imported beef tested, and Creekstone was willing to do so, \nbut USDA said ``no.''\n  Isn't this the administration that wants the free market to prosper?\n  Yet, here we have a willing buyer, the Japanese, a willing seller, \nCreekstone, and the Government says ``no.''\n  Government is telling a U.S. business what they can and can't do to \nadd value to their product and create a market.\n  It is kind of like the Government telling automakers they can't have \nleather seats. Leather seats aren't needed, but they add value to the \ncars and make the product more marketable.\n  So I am hopeful that USDA will revisit this issue. Creekstone and \nother companies want the ability to meet consumer demand, and the \nGovernment should not get in the way.\n  If USDA wants to establish a testing protocol or some other structure \nfor the testing to ensure that it is done in an appropriate manner and \nthat we don't get false positives, I think we can all agree that such \nan approach would make some sense. But to deny producers the ability to \nuse another marketing tool baffles me. I think USDA could and should \nhave done better, and I urge them to re-examine the issue immediately.\n  It is also clear that some of the other things that USDA has been \ndoing need to be reassessed. For example, on Monday, U.S. District \nCourt Judge Richard Cebull granted a temporary restraining order \nprohibiting USDA from importing ground beef and bone-in beef from \nCanada.\n  The judge said, and I agree, that the risk of BSE is simply too great \nfor us to fail to ensure that we have taken a thoughtful and deliberate \napproach to resuming beef imports from Canada.\n  Both animal health and food safety demand that we take a science-\nbased approach to the reopening of our border with Canada. Producers \nare extremely concerned that USDA has not done so.\n  The judge has scheduled a May 11 hearing, at which time I hope there \nwill be a full examination of the process USDA did or did not use in \nmaking their decision to reopen the border.\n\n  Ensuring that we get this right is not only important for our \nNation's ranchers. It is important for our export markets and consumers \nof U.S. beef.\n  Another issue I want to discuss today is what I see as an emerging \ndrought in many parts of the country. The Drought Monitor--a government \nmap that documents the ongoing extent of drought--already shows some \nproblem areas.\n  The yellow here--and you can see this on the map--denotes conditions \nacross the Southeast, conditions which have continued to deteriorate \nfor most of that region. Southern California, the area in Oklahoma, \nArkansas, through southern Missouri and into southern Illinois, and up \nall the way through Indiana and Ohio and Michigan. You can see that \nthere is abnormal dryness occurring in that area, even getting into the \nlower parts of the northern regions of Texas.\n  While there were some rains in parts of the upper-Midwest recently, \nthey missed the western part of Minnesota. And you can see here this is \nwhere the extraordinary conditions are now becoming even more adverse, \ncreating what the Drought Monitor categorizes as ``severe drought'' \nconditions, represented of course in the areas here in the orange and \ndarker areas. The darker the color, the more severe the drought.\n  In my State of South Dakota, we have been able to avoid some of the \nmost severe parts, but you talk to ranchers and farmers today and it is \nclear that this drought that we now see through almost the entire \nwestern part of the United States is moving east.\n  South Dakota has now experienced a drought in each of the last 5 \nyears. The experience has been daunting. But there is one thing we have \nlearned in dealing with drought and other weather-related natural \ndisasters: Our national polices are wholly inadequate. By any \nlegitimate standard, our policies have failed.\n  In 2002 the Senate approved, on a bipartisan basis, an amendment that \nI offered to provide $6 billion in disaster assistance. Unfortunately, \nthe administration blocked its enactment.\n  But that was then, and today is, hopefully, a different story. Today, \nI think we need to take a serious look at what more we can do this \nyear.\n  That is why today I am asking the President again to re-examine this \nissue, while we still have time. I am urging him to take a fresh look \nat what we can do, through an interagency approach, to address what \nappears to be another extreme drought this year--already extreme in \nsome parts of the country, and certainly moving, as we have said, to \nthe Great Plains States as well.\n  Although USDA should take the lead in this effort, the SBA, the \nEconomic Development Administration, and other agencies, including, but \nnot limited to, FEMA, can all play a role in finding a solution to this \nongoing problem.\n  That is why I have requested that the President immediately ask the \nFederal agencies involved to develop a comprehensive legislative \nproposal to address weather-related natural disasters that impact our \nNation's farmers, ranchers, and rural communities.\n  If he does this now, and receives a report back within 45 to 60 days, \nthe Congress will still have time this summer to enact meaningful \ndisaster assistance.\n  In my letter to the President sent earlier today, I pledged that, \nonce he has provided Congress with such a proposal, I will work with \nhim and all of my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion to approve \nwhatever disaster-related assistance is necessary to adequately \ncompensate producers and keep our nation's rural communities vibrant.\n  We can prepare now for what looks like another very bad year for \nagriculture.\n  Drought victims are no less deserving of Federal assistance than \nthose who are impacted by a flood, tornado, or hurricane. As Federal \nofficials, we have an obligation to respond more effectively than we \nhave in the past.\n  Working together, with the leadership of this administration, I hope \nwe can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4446-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, when I came to the United States Senate \nlast year, it was with great optimism--with a mission to get real \nresults accomplished for my North Carolina constituents and for our \ngreat Nation. During my tenure in the Department of Transportation, the \nDepartment of Labor, and the American Red Cross, I was blessed with the \nopportunity to tackle some very important and challenging issues--like \nthe sale of Conrail, modernizing the American Red Cross, settling a \nbitter coal strike, transferring Dulles and National airports from \nFederal control to ensure that Dulles' capacity would be doubled and \nthe gateway to the Nation's capital would be our beautiful new airport. \nThese issues required me to work with colleagues from both sides of the \naisle at\n\n[[Page S4447]]\n\nevery turn. If I had just tried to work with Republicans when tackling \nthese matters, you can bet that nothing would have ever been \naccomplished. These success stories were achieved in a bipartisan and \nconstructive manner. I looked forward to the same experience when \nentering this great body last year; however, the pattern of \nobstructionism occurring over the past few months is at a crossroads.\n  The opportunity to vote--to even vote--on the following legislation \nhas been blocked:\n  Medical liability reform: After a comprehensive bipartisan bill was \nblocked last July, two additional targeted attempts to protect access \nto ERs and OB-GYNs were blocked February 24 and April 7.\n  A comprehensive Energy bill has been thwarted for 3 years--3 years. \nPassage would not only create an estimated 1 million American jobs but \nalso reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Energy tax relief that would \nhave created an estimated 650,000 jobs was also blocked on April 7.\n  Workforce Investment Act: This legislation, projected to help more \nthan 940,000 dislocated workers obtain the training they need to get \ngood jobs was passed by both the House and Senate but now my friends \nacross the aisle refuse to even appoint conferees.\n\n  There are other examples of blocked legislation: Class action reform, \nFaith based/charities--the Care Act--welfare reform, and the Fair Act--\nAsbestos--but I want to highlight the legislation that could directly \nbenefit the economy. And I use the word ``could'' because unfortunately \nnone of this legislation can even get the courtesy of an up or down \nvote.\n  You cannot have it both ways. You cannot come down to the Senate \nfloor and deride the administration's economic policies--then, in the \nsame day, vote to block job-creating legislation.\n  A piece of legislation that underscores this point is S. 1637, the \nJOBS bill. Why in the world would we not be passing this legislation? I \nreally want to know the answer so I can tell my constituents, in a \nState that has been hit especially hard by manufacturing job losses. \nWhy is there objection to removing tariffs from our companies? Why is \nthere objection to cutting taxes on manufacturing companies when they \nneed it most? I must be missing something. When a bill is passed out of \nthe Finance Committee 19-2--yes 19-2--and it is blocked from coming to \na vote on two separate, that is simply outrageous.\n  Those of us on both sides of the aisle recognize the need to deal \nwith the increasing concerns associated with the current \nExtraterriorial Tax Regime ETI. The World Trade Organizations has \ndetermined that if not repealed, the current rules for exportation \nwould necessitate $4 billion in tariffs. If passed, the JOBS bill will \nnot only eliminate the WTO's exorbitant tariff imposition; it will also \nreplace ETI's tax relief with a tax deduction for domestic \nmanufacturers.\n  At a time when America's manufacturing industries need immediate \nrelief, the benefits of this legislation are clear--and the necessity \nof its passage is obvious. However, Senate Democrats are continuing to \nplay petty political games and in so doing, are preventing direct aid \nto our hurting manufacturers. These partisan antics harm our American \nbusinesses directly--businesses run by men and women who deserve better \nfrom their elected officials.\n  I am particularly focused on this issue because North Carolina has \nareas that are severely affected by the loss of manufacturing jobs, \nmainly in textiles and furniture. This past summer, North Carolina \nexperienced the largest layoff in State history when textile giant \nPillowtex closed its doors forever. The result of Pillowtex's closing \nwas 4,400 people losing their jobs in a single day--and eventually \nnearly 5,000 being laid off.\n  In eastern North Caroline, layoffs and plant closures have resulted \nin more than 2,200 layoffs since last summer. In just the past few \nmonths, the western region of North Carolina has lost more than 1,500 \njobs. And in February, 22 of North Carolina's 100 counties had double-\ndigit unemployment rates. Now there are signs that the situation is \nimproving--initial data for March unemployment in North Carolina shows \nthat just four counties have double-digit rates--but we must take \naction to help our manufacturers and to ensure upward trends will \ncontinue.\n  Action can begin with final passage of the JOBS bill. This is not the \ntime for political games. This is a time for doing what is right for \nthe American people--and providing our manufacturers with legislation \nthat will directly benefit their businesses. I urge my colleagues to \nallow the final vote on the passage of S. 1637 to protect our companies \nfrom undo tariffs and excessive taxes.\n\n  Democrats say they want to find a way to rejuvenate our economy and \nprevent more factories from shutting down. If they are truly searching \nfor such answers, then why don't they step forward and allow for the \nsolution to reach final passage? I am hoping my friends on the other \nside of the aisle will remember the American people who depend on \nCongress and put aside partisan antics and pass good legislation. We \nneed to put an end to this obstruction and work together to get things \ndone in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4447-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4447-S4448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        9/11 COMMISSION AND IRAQ\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to talk about a couple of events \nthat are in the news: the proceedings of the 9/11 Commission and the \ndebate about the President's policy in Iraq.\n  As I said last week, I am troubled by the partisanship and public \nposturing of some members of the 9/11 Commission, both in the hearing \nroom and in TV studios.\n  I am not the only one who is troubled. The former National Security \nAdvisor under President Clinton, Tony Lake, has said the hearings are \n``a sad spectacle that has become so partisan.''\n  And Max Holland, a former fellow at the University of Virginia who is \nwriting a history of the Warren Commission, notes that ``in some \nrespects'' the proceedings of the commission are ``definitely a new \nlow.'' He added that ``this is a commission charged with establishing \nfacts and the truth rather than posturing for political gain. But some \nof the hearings amounted to lecturing and posturing.''\n  Still others, like Professor Juliette Kayyem, of the Kennedy School \nof Government at Harvard, who served on a congressional terrorism panel \nto investigate the 1998 African embassy bombings, have questioned why \n9/11 commission members have granted so many interviews. She notes that \n``they have become too public,'' and that ``tempts commissioners into \nmaking assessments and conclusions prematurely.''\n  My understanding of the 9/11 Commission was that it was to \nimpartially determine the facts and make non-partisan recommendations \non how to go forward.\n  So far, the 9/11 Commission's descent into ``gotcha'' questioning has \nonly highlighted a tendency to fight each other rather than the \nterrorists. Unfortunately, while American politicians are busy blaming \neach other, the terrorists are busy plotting our doom.\n  This partisanship, unfortunately, is not confined to the 9/11 \nCommission. Clearly, the central front in the war against terrorism has \nshifted to Iraq. Al Qaeda operatives and foreign terrorists have \nflocked to Iraq to make a desperate final stand against American \ntroops, and we must see to it that they lose.\n\n  On the issue of Iraq, the most important thing this body could do is \nto have an open and honest debate about how to build a moderate \ndemocracy in that country. If Senator Kerry, in particular, believes he \nhas a solution to the difficult challenges facing our troops and \ndiplomats in Iraq, let him offer a plan, rather than simply guessing \nand criticizing.\n  Let me be clear: placing the UN in charge in Iraq is not a plan. It \nis a pure fantasy.\n  America did the right thing by liberating the Iraqi people from \nSaddam's tyrannical regime, and by so doing, we are making the American \npeople safer. Succeeding in our efforts to help the Iraqis replace one \nof the most repressive regimes on the planet with the single most \nrepresentative government in the Arab World will dramatically alter the \npolitical landscape of the Middle East.\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\n  Only if the citizens of the Middle East experience the freedoms and \nopportunity of democratic reform can we hope to win the war against \nterrorism. We can kill terrorists one by one in Afghanistan and Iraq, \nbut until we change the individual and personal calculations of \nthousands of young men who are taught to value death over life, there \nwill always be more terrorists around every street corner. A free Iraq \nwill be an oasis of liberty in the heart of the Middle East and a \nsource of democratic influence on its undemocratic neighbors.\n  Bringing democratic reform to the Middle East is not a lofty hope but \na necessary reality and a long-term strategy. Citizens who can voice \ntheir frustrations at the ballot box are less likely to do so by \nstrapping bombs to their bodies.\n  It is no coincidence that democratic Muslim states such as Turkey and \nreforming states such as Jordan, Egypt, and Morocco are not state \nsupporters of terrorism, while oppressive states such as Syria and Iran \nprovide aid and succor to international terrorists.\n  President Bush's multi-tiered approach to combating terrorism is the \nright one. And it is improving.\n  Likewise, our Nation's efforts can be improved upon if we conduct our \ndebates with the gravity and objectivity required by the high stakes of \nthe war against terrorism, but forgive me for not being optimistic.\n\n  Until now, the critics have proposed two alternatives to President \nBush's plan to stay the course in Iraq. One alternative is to cut and \nrun or to cede control to the U.N., whose member states by and large \nwant America to cut and run.\n  Unless failure is our goal, these are not serious proposals. And they \ndiscount the very simple fact that unless America delivers on its \ncommitment to eliminate havens for terrorists and support democracy in \nIraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, we will embolden the terrorists who \ndelight and attack when America wavers.\n  How do I know this? Because Osama bin Laden has told us. In his 1998 \n``Declaration of War Against the Americans'' bin Laden noted, and I \nquote: ``When tens of your soldiers were killed in minor battles and \none American Pilot was dragged in the street of Mogadishu, you left the \narea in disappointment, humiliation and defeat, carrying your dead with \nyou.''\n  Former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger recently noted that Bin \nLaden also observed: ``when people see a strong horse and a weak horse, \nthey naturally gravitate toward the strong horse.''\n  The terrorists are watching us closely, and we must show strength, \nnot weakness. We must not allow Iraq to become another Somalia because \ngoing home early is the surest way to embolden the terrorists and \nensure the failure of our efforts to bring peace and security to the \nMiddle East.\n  It is clear to this Senator that al-Qaida wants us to fail in Iraq, \njust as it wants us to fail in Afghanistan. Al-Qaida terrorists and \nother foreign Jihadis are aligning themselves with violent Iraqi \ninsurgents whose radical ideology has no place in a democratic Iraq. \nThese zealots want the United States to appear in the Arab world as a \nweak horse.\n  The terrorists are watching us closely, and we must show our \nstrength, not our weaknesses, as we confront the security challenges in \nIraq that lie between despotism and democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

Mr. President, this week our colleague, Senator John \nKerry, is traveling to the Midwest to discuss ways to help boost job \ncreation. While I applaud his intention on this issue, I also want to \nmake certain Senator Kerry is aware we have scheduled a third floor \ndebate on the JOBS bill--that is the very important bill on \nmanufacturing in this country, S. 1637--to start next week. That \nimportant bill seeks to protect more than a million high-quality \nmanufacturing jobs in the United States.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Kerry's Democrat colleagues in the Senate are \nwaging a filibuster against this jumpstart our business strength bill, \nthe JOBS bill, having twice voted to prevent us from completing action \non this essential manufacturing legislation.\n\n  I do ask Senator Kerry to use his new position as his party's \npresumptive nominee, but in all likelihood the nominee, to help \nconvince his colleagues to abandon this filibuster and move this \nlegislation quickly toward passage.\n  According to the National Foreign Trade Council, there are currently \n147,200 jobs in Ohio that hinge on passage of this JOBS bill; in \nMichigan, some 150,000 jobs will be impacted by this ill-advised \nfilibuster; and in Pennsylvania, nearly 142,000 jobs are tied to this \nlegislation.\n  We must repeal these European tariffs on at least 100 U.S.-made \nproducts. People say: What sort of products? They include safety glass. \nThey include portable handheld tools. They include marine engines. They \ninclude aluminum wire, steel wire. They include printing paper. This \nEuro tax started at $200 million in March. It increased to $240 million \nin April. It will increase again to $280 million this Saturday and will \ncontinue to climb upward to $680 million next year if we fail to act.\n  Senator Kerry was a cosponsor of this bill and supported it in the \nFinance Committee. I urge him to join us in a bipartisan effort to end \nhis fellow Democrats' filibuster and agree to a time to pass and send \nto President Bush a jobs bill, a jobs bill that will benefit \nmanufacturing workers throughout the United States.\n  We must pass this JOBS bill to protect America's manufacturing base \nand the manufacturing jobs of thousands of our workers across the \nUnited States. America's workers are depending on us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from me to \nSenator Kerry dated April 28, 2004, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 2004.\n     Hon.

After all, according to the National Foreign Trade \n     Council, there are currently 147,200 jobs in Ohio that hinge \n     on passage of the JOBS bill. In Michigan, some 150,100 jobs \n     will be impacted by this ill-advised filibuster. In \n     Pennsylvania, nearly 142,000 jobs are tied to this \n     legislation. It is my hope that you will join with us in a \n     bipartisan effort to end the Democrat filibuster and press \n     for timely action on the JOBS measure.\n       Since you were once a co-sponsor of this bill and supported \n     it in the Finance Committee, I know you appreciate how \n     important it is that we approve this measure and repeal the \n     European tariffs on at least 100 US-made products.

Mr. President, I want to respond to the distinguished \nmajority leader.\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\n  Like him, I have come to the Senate floor on several occasions \nadvocating for passage of the FSC bill. Many of us believe it may be \nthe only opportunity we have to address, meaningfully, jobs policy and \nthe creation of new jobs in this country.\n  His characterization of our position is unfortunate and inaccurate. \nWe have no desire to filibuster the bill. We simply believe Senators \nought to have a right to offer amendments. That was really the \ndiscussion and the debate earlier as the legislation was offered. We \nhad an amendment that simply provided for protection for 8 million \nworkers who were not accorded overtime, who the administration now \nacknowledges were prepared to take overtime as a part of their \ncompensation packages. We fought it. The administration has changed it, \nnot to our satisfaction. But had it not been for our fight, I doubt \nvery much that overtime could have been protected for the millions of \nworkers who otherwise would see it as lost.\n  We also want to ensure that we have an opportunity to deal with the \noutsourcing problem. Outsourcing is a very serious issue today. The \nPresident has created a new program called Higher Hour Workers. The \nacronym is HOW. Well, that is our question. How? How are you going to \ndo it? What we have seen so far from this administration falls far \nshort of what we need to do if we are serious about meaningfully \naddressing the problem of jobs in this country.\n  This administration has lost 3 million jobs. We have not seen an \nadministration like this in seven administrations. We want to address \nthe terrible and unfortunate record we have seen with regard to the \neconomy over the last 36 months.\n  So our hope is we can create a real opportunity to debate jobs, to \ndebate the way with which we can compete in the international markets. \nThat is our desire.\n  I went to Senator Frist and offered him an agreement, after this \ncloture vote, and indicated that we would limit our ourselves to 18 \namendments. I presented that to him. I was hoping we could get a \nunanimous consent agreement. That was not done and, as a result, time \nwas lost. Now, as we understand it, they have over 50 amendments \npending to this bill. We have something like 30. So there is no \nfilibuster going on. They have some difficulty on their side in trying \nto address this issue, and in an expeditious way.\n  We will get through the amendments. It is unfortunate we could not \nhave agreed to the 18. We would be done with it by now. But there has \nbeen a practice on the Senate floor, over the last several months--we \nget on a bill, an amendment is offered, the bill is pulled; we move to \nanother bill, we get on that, an amendment is offered, the bill is \npulled. We have to stay on a bill to finish the bill. I am hopeful we \ncan stay on the Internet tax bill until it is finished, that we can \nstay then on the FSC bill until it is finished, and welfare reform \nuntil it is finished.\n  We can accomplish a lot, but we have to have greater attention to the \nwork at hand and a willingness to stay with it until it is done. That \nis the nature of the Senate. That is the way we function. That is our \ninstitutional history. We are prepared to work with our Republican \ncolleagues on these and other bills in the months ahead to make that \nhappen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk a few minutes about the \nwork of the 9/11 Commission. I know it has become popular--perhaps it \nhas always been that way--for those who sit on commissions, those who \nengage in political debate about the great causes of the day in \nWashington, DC, to try to find blame for various things that happen. \nThat is no less true of the work of the 9/11 Commission in looking into \nboth the causes of the terrible events of that day and also when it \ncomes to coming up with recommendations about what we might be able to \ndo to make sure that sort of tragedy never occurs on our own soil \nagain.\n  But I think we ought to be clear about who is to blame for the \nterrible events of 9/11. It was not President Clinton or his \nadministration. It was not President Bush or his administration. The \nindividual and the organization at fault for the events of 9/11 were \nOsama bin Laden and al-Qaida. Regardless of our differences, especially \nin this election year where we are going to select a President, I think \nwe ought to make sure our enemies do not draw any comfort from the \ndebates we have on the floor of the U.S. Senate or elsewhere that we \nsomehow are redirecting the blame to others for political gain and to \nscore political points. I think all Members of the U.S. Senate--indeed, \nall Members of the U.S. Congress--should be absolutely clear where the \nblame lies. As I said, that lies with al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden.\n  Indeed, after that terrible day there was an upswelling of bipartisan \nsupport in this country to try to make sure we did whatever we needed \nto do in order to make sure that the events of that day would never \noccur again. Indeed, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution \nauthorizing the use of all necessary and appropriate force against the \npersons and organizations responsible for September 11.\n  Indeed, in an unprecedented fashion, also, we saw that our allies in \nNATO, under article V of that treaty, declared that an attack against \nthe United States was, in effect, an attack against all NATO nations.\n  Of course, this issue is as current as today's news because we know \nthere are two cases that are going to be argued before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, the Hamdi and Padilla cases, which are going to look at the \nlimits of Presidential power under a declaration of war, such as was \nauthorized by the Congress, by the Senate unanimously. Of course, they \nare going to decide, and it seems obvious to me, but perhaps it is not \nas obvious to others, that the approval of all necessary and \nappropriate force must necessarily include the capture and detention of \nenemy combatants. But that is perhaps an issue for another time.\n  Also, in the spirit of bipartisan support for using all necessary and \nappropriate means to defend our country, the Senate passed the USA \nPATRIOT Act 98 to 1. Of course, this important legislation provides law \nenforcement with sorely needed tools to combat terrorism. \nUnfortunately, we also recall that spirit of bipartisan unanimity did \nnot last very long.\n  Once the Democratic Party began to choose its Democratic nominee, we \nheard a lot of disparaging remarks made about the USA PATRIOT Act. \nIndeed, in a misguided and perhaps ill-informed way, there are 287 \ndifferent municipalities around the country that have passed \nresolutions disparaging the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  It is amazing, in Washington, how events can turn on a dime. After we \nheard testimony before the 9/11 Commission from Janet Reno, former FBI \nDirector Louis Freeh, Attorney General John Ashcroft, FBI Director \nRobert Mueller, and others, a bipartisan chorus said it was the USA \nPATRIOT Act which tore down the wall which\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\npreviously precluded information sharing between law enforcement and \nintelligence-gathering officials. We haven't heard very much more about \nthe previous calls to either repeal or change the PATRIOT Act because, \nindeed, it was the PATRIOT Act that tore down that wall and which has \nmade America safer. Perhaps the best evidence of that is not just my \nstatement or anyone else's. It is the fact we have, thank God, avoided \nanother 9/11 in the days since that terrible day.\n  The spirit of bipartisanship that resulted in a resolution \nauthorizing the use of necessary force against our enemies who brought \nthe war to us on 9/11 and the spirit of bipartisanship that saw a 98-\nto-1 vote in favor of the USA PATRIOT Act and tearing down that wall \nneeds to continue to prevail on the National Commission on Terrorist \nAttacks on the United States that was created by Congress and appointed \nby both the Congress and the President. Of course, it is the job of \nthat Commission to find facts, to create a historical record of the \nevents that led up to that date, and then come up with recommendations. \nIt is absolutely critical that the work of the National Commission on \nTerrorist Attacks, the 9/11 Commission, not be undermined and that the \npublic confidence be preserved in that Commission.\n  That brings me to the testimony which I believe must be provided in \nan open forum by Commissioner Jamie Gorelick. As Attorney General \nAshcroft revealed during his testimony, when he declassified a key 1995 \nmemorandum, dated actually March 4, 1995, authored by Ms. Gorelick when \nshe was Deputy Attorney General, it was the policy of the Justice \nDepartment, under Ms. Reno and under Ms. Gorelick, during the Clinton \nadministration, that went further than the law required in establishing \nthis wall which prohibited information sharing between law enforcement \nofficials and counterintelligence officials. Indeed, in the days since \nAttorney General Ashcroft revealed the existence of this memo, we have \nseen Ms. Gorelick respond in a Washington Post op-ed piece explaining \nher role.\n\n  My point is, Ms. Gorelick, serving in a high-level position in the \nJustice Department as Deputy Attorney General, in effect the chief \noperating officer in the Department of Justice under Attorney General \nJanet Reno, has special knowledge of the facts and circumstances \nleading up to that memo and the erection and buttressing of that wall \nbarring the sharing of communications.\n  I believe her testimony under ordinary circumstances would be sort of \na no-brainer. The 9/11 Commission would say: This is a person with \nknowledge of relevant facts. Let's bring her before the Commission and \nask her to tell us what she knows.\n  That has been requested now, public testimony by Ms. Gorelick, in \nletters signed by a number of Senators, and now been refused by the \ncochairs, Chairman Kean and Chairman Hamilton.\n  Simply put, this is a self-inflicted wound on the credibility of the \n9/11 Commission. We have learned that she has provided testimony in \ncamera or, in English, in secret. In other words, she has been \ninterviewed by the 9/11 Commission and told apparently what she knows \nout of the public eye. Obviously, she has written an op-ed piece \nexplaining, without the benefit of further questions or followup, what \nit is she intended to do and the circumstances leading up to that 1995 \nmemo.\n  If public testimony by persons with knowledge of relevant facts \nranging from Janet Reno to Louis Freeh to John Ashcroft to Bob Mueller \nand others, if that testimony was important--and indeed, I believe it \nwas--then public testimony by Ms. Gorelick is important to preserving \nthe public credibility of the work product of the 9/11 Commission.\n  Secret testimony will not cut it. In fact, we need to know what it \nwas that led up to this policy and the reasons for it in order to \nunderstand why it is important never to go there again. As I said, this \npolicy is stated in that very same memo, which went well beyond legal \nrequirements. In other words, the PATRIOT Act, once it was passed \nvirtually unanimously in this body, dismantled that wall in a way that \nmade America safer.\n  May I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes and also \nto extend the Democratic time by the same amount.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. First, Ms. Gorelick claims in this Washington Post op-ed \npiece that she had no choice when she penned the 1995 memo. It would be \nworth knowing why it is she thought she had no choice.\n  Second, she claims this memo did nothing more than continue \npreexisting Justice Department policy first established in the 1980s. \nBy the very terms of the memo, she states it is prudent to establish a \nset of instructions that will clearly separate counterintelligence \ninvestigations from criminal investigations. It is appropriate to ask \nher if she thought she was establishing a policy or continuing a \npolicy, as she stated in another place.\n  Finally, Ms. Gorelick appears to be shifting the blame for the \npolicy--and we are not talking about blame for the policy--to then-\nDeputy Attorney General Larry Thompson. At a minimum, it is not \nappropriate for one Justice Department official to attack her successor \nfor failing to adequately correct their own mistakes, as we now know \nthat wall was a mistake.\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say because I know time is \nrunning out, I believe it is absolutely imperative that Ms. Gorelick \noffer to come forward and give public testimony about what she knows \nabout the erection of the ``wall'' barring the critical sharing of \ninformation that has subsequently now made America much safer.\n  I believe the credibility of the Commission's report depends on that \npublic testimony, and I urge the chairman of the 9/11 Commission to \nreconsider, and indeed Ms. Gorelick to consider her refusal to testify \nin public and avoid what has, by all appearances, the status of a self-\ninflicted wound on the credibility of the Commission.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think that in addition to having Ms. \nGorelick reassess her position, it would be good for the President and \nadministration to reassess their positions and testify publicly, or at \nleast separately, instead of this appearance that they have in secret.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4450-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4450-S4451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, tomorrow, in the White House, it is my \nunderstanding from press accounts--and I have talked to various \nSenators and one House Member who will attend the meeting--there is \ngoing to be a meeting with the President to talk about the highway \nbill. I think it is important, therefore, that I, who have worked on \nthis most important bill--and I have worked on several others in years \npast--make some observations about what I think should take place at \nthat meeting.\n  Of course, it is a typical meeting that takes place in this \nadministration. It is done in secret, with no Democrats present, which \nis unusual; but that is in keeping with what this administration has \ndone now for 3\\1/2\\ years. Let me say, though, that I believe Senator \nJim Inhofe, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nhas been an exemplary legislator on the highway bill. He has been \nsomeone that has been very fixed in his ideas. He is someone, however, \nwho is willing to work and, as legislators have to do, compromise. I \nhave had to do the same thing. Senator Jeffords had to do the same \nthing. Senator Bond has had to do the same thing. The four of us have \nput this bill together. I think it is a good bill.\n  I appreciate the tireless efforts of Jim Inhofe on this most \nimportant legislation. He has always understood the importance of a \nhighway bill. No one in this country can question the conservative \ncredentials of Jim Inhofe. No one could ever accuse him of trying to \ngive things away. That is why it is a mystery to most of us what the \nadministration is doing on this bill.\n  Mr. President, first of all, understand that the chairman of the \nTransportation Committee in the House, Congressman Young from Alaska, \nbelieved\n\n[[Page S4451]]\n\na bill of $300 billion just for highways alone--he was unable to do \nthis because he could not get a proper rule in the House. The \nadministration was opposed to him, and my understanding is that several \nother leaders in the House were opposed to him.\n\n  Finally, they came with a bill of $275 billion, which included \ntransit. The legislation that we have passed in the Senate takes into \nconsideration the needs of this country. We have $318 billion over six \nyears. This is a bill that includes transit. We have worked very hard \non this. Keep in mind, there are no new taxes. The bill is paid for in \na number of different ways, not the least of which is highway trust \nfund moneys, which are supposed to be used for highways. We have been \ntold by all outside organizations, by our own experts within the \nFederal Government--and the outside organizations can be exemplified \nand illustrated by the American Association of State Highway \nTransportation Officials, AASHTO. They say, as we all say, simply to \nmaintain our roads and bridges--not to have some Cadillac version, but \nsimply to maintain our roads and bridges--the Federal Government must \ninvest at least $40 billion a year.\n  Unfortunately, a 6-year bill at $275 billion that includes all the \nneeds of this country simply doesn't do the trick when we talk about \nhighways and transit. This means, then, more congestion, less safety, \nand increased maintenance and replacement costs.\n  The Senate bill is a good bill. It passed by 76 Members voting for \nit. It would create a $42.7 billion average annual highway investment. \nThis is a good bill. It would generate real improvements in condition \nand performance. Let's not forget, it would create more than a million \nhigh-paying jobs. The spinoff from those direct jobs would be many \nthousands more.\n  I cannot understand the President. He is the first President since \nHerbert Hoover who has not had a net increase of private sector jobs. \nIt doesn't matter how many jobs are created in the next 6 months, he \nwill be the first President since Hoover to have a net loss of private \nsector jobs. Yet he is threatening to veto this. It is wrong.\n  Not only is the bill good for the reasons I have mentioned. That will \nallow us to at least keep even with the programs that we need in this \ncountry--highways, bridges--but it also consolidates all safety \nprograms. It creates a very new program, with safe routes to school, \nwhich will allow children to walk and ride bicycles to school. It \ncreates a good program at our ports, called a gateway program, which \nwill not only be one that will create a more safe network of ports in \nour country, but will be more efficient, and it will save lots of time. \nThere will be a new equity bonus program.\n  We have tried in this legislation to have a fair bill, not just to \nadd up the number of Senators who are for the bill and run over those \nwho don't get treated as well. By the end of our bill, every State will \nget at least 95 cents for every dollar they pay in. This is a \ntremendous improvement.\n  Mr. President, I hope at this meeting tomorrow the Republicans who \nare meeting in secret to discuss this matter will follow the lead of \nthe Senate, and especially Senator Inhofe. This is a bill that we need \nto pass for the good of every State in the Union.\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield the remaining time I have to the \nSenator from New Jersey, with this preface. I say to my friend from New \nJersey, who is going to discuss chicken hawk, I want the Senator to \nunderstand that when the President held his last press conference and \nsaid he could not think of a mistake he made--when I was at home during \nthe last break, I reminded the people of Nevada that I could think of \nat least 2 mistakes he made. One is when he climbed on the USS Lincoln, \nthe big aircraft carrier, and had the big sign in celebration of the \n``mission accomplished.'' I think the second mistake was when he was \nasked the question whether there are some people in Iraq who, maybe, \nare going to cause some trouble, as you will remember, the President \nsaid, ``bring them on.'' I think those are two mistakes--``mission \naccomplished'' and ``bring them on.''\n  Since his statement, ``bring them on,'' we have lost more than 600 \nAmerican soldiers. That is only the number of those who were killed; \nthat doesn't take into consideration the thousands who are missing \nlimbs, eyes, who are paralyzed, and in bad shape physically. So I think \nthose are two mistakes, I remind the President. No. 1, the mission was \nnot accomplished when he flew on the aircraft carrier in his borrowed \njumpsuit; or, No. 2, when he said ``bring them on,'' I think that was \nan intemperate remark, and I think he made a mistake.\n\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4451-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4451-S4453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WAR RECORDS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. Nothing \ncould be more poignant, as we view what has taken place in Iraq, than \nthe bravado that led us into the battle and the boastful statements \nthat were made, such as ``mission accomplished.'' What the mission \naccomplished was, was to get a picture that could be used in an \nelection campaign. That was the mission that was accomplished.\n  People thought the President was talking about something else, and he \ndid say the worst is behind us. It is a terrible memory for us to \nconjure up while people are dying in quantities hardly ever dreamed \nabout, far more casualties in this war where we have 130,000 people in \nIraq than when we had 540,000 people in the first gulf war because \nthere were enough of them to protect one another; there were enough of \nthem to get the job done quickly and effectively.\n  We have some memories, and I couldn't agree more with the Democratic \nwhip, my friend from Nevada, about mistakes made and remembering \n``bring them on,'' which I found so offensive.\n  This week is the anniversary of the photo on the bridge of the \naircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln. Photo on the bridge--that is the \nmemory that is going to be conveyed out there. This is the photo on the \nbridge. Here is the aircraft carrier looking very splendid in a display \nof power, but the timing was so far off and the statements were so \nempty: ``Mission accomplished.''\n  Ask the 600 families who have lost children; ask those 22 families of \nsons and daughters in the State of New Jersey whether they think the \nmission was accomplished May 1 a year ago. I don't think they would \nagree.\n  Yesterday, I had an opportunity to visit the World War II memorial \nthat is going to be open to the public very shortly. I am a veteran of \nWorld War II, as are several other Members of the Senate. I came from a \nworking-class family. My 42-year-old father was on his deathbed from \ncancer when I enlisted. My mother became a 36-year-old widow. I was 18 \nalready. I did not enlist to be a hero. I simply wanted to do whatever \nI could to help my country. So when I looked at the memorial yesterday, \nit brought back some very significant memories.\n  I remember being in uniform. I remember climbing telephone poles and \nputting up wire. Once again, I did what I was supposed to do because I \nwas in the Signal Corps and responsible in part for getting \ncommunications between those who are commanders and those who are in \nthe field.\n  I had a fairly narrow perspective, but one thing I did respect was \nthose who received medals, those who had a Purple Heart. They were my \nheroes, and we used to defer to them. Anyone who got a Bronze Star or a \nSilver Star was thought to be someone special. That was to those of us \nin uniform who were trying to bring America victory. That is what \nhappened.\n  When you visit the Vietnam Memorial here in Washington, it pulls at \nyour heartstrings to see 58,235 names on the wall and you are reminded \nof the gravity and the impact that conflict had on our Nation. But now \nwe are in a different place. I do not believe, I must say, we should \njudge our politicians based on who served and who did not serve. But \nwhen those who did not serve attack the heroism of those who did, I \nfind it particularly offensive, and I hope people across America will \nput aside that criticism of Senator John Kerry who received three \nPurple Hearts and a Silver Star, which is a very high commendation for \nbravery. I find it offensive, and I hope every American and I hope \nevery veteran will say: No, no, you can't talk like that,\n\n[[Page S4452]]\n\npretending this man is soft on defense. He put his neck on the line, \nalmost lost it, and saved someone else's neck in a very heroic deed.\n  That is what we are talking about: heroism. Max Cleland lost three \nlimbs in Vietnam, and they shamed him so that he was pushed out of \noffice because he was portrayed as weak on defense. Where do they come \noff with that kind of stuff? I will never know, but I hope the American \npublic understands what is being done.\n\n  We now have discovered a return of the chicken hawk. We thought they \nflew the coop, but in the last week or two, they have returned aplenty. \nIf anyone is curious about what a chicken hawk is, I have a definition \nright here on this placard. We see the chicken in a uniform with \nmedals. The definition obtained from the Internet goes as follows:\n\n       Chickenhawk, n.: A person enthusiastic about war, provided \n     someone else does the fighting, particularly when that \n     enthusiasm is undimmed by personal experience with war; most \n     emphatically when that lack of experience came in spite of \n     ample opportunity in that person's youth--\n\n  I am extending it--to serve their country, unless you had a good \nexcuse, unless you had other priorities.\n  Chicken hawks shriek like a hawk, but they have the backbone of a \nchicken. We know who the chicken hawks are. They talk tough on national \ndefense and military issues and cast aspersion on others. When it was \ntheir turn to serve, where were they? A-W-O-L, that's where they were.\n  Now the chicken hawks are cackling about Senator John Kerry. The lead \nchicken hawk against Senator Kerry is the Vice President of the United \nStates, Vice President Cheney. He was in Missouri this week claiming \nSenator Kerry is not up to the job of protecting this Nation. What \nnerve. Where was Dick Cheney when that war was going on where 58,235 \nyoung men died and many more wounded and many with wounds that were \nnever visible, but you could see it in their emotional structure and in \ntheir psychology? It was a war everyone thinks in retrospect was \nmisguided. But John Kerry volunteered for hazardous duty on a swift \nboat going up a river with people shooting at him all over the place. \nCowardly? What an insult. I plead with veterans across this country. \nLook at what they are saying about your service. Exemplified: Max \nCleland lost three limbs. What a sacrifice he made, and they beat him \nin the election, beat him in the polls because they characterized him \nas soft on defense. Now they want to take John Kerry who served nobly \nand establish that he, too, is soft on defense. I don't know where they \nget it.\n  He fought for our country. He still has shrapnel from the \nbattlefield. Vice President Cheney said: At the time he had other \npriorities in the sixties than military service. He ought to tell that \nto the parents of those who lost their lives in Vietnam, and ask them \nwhat they think.\n  I heard someone--I think it was Karen Hughes--on the television the \nother night. Why are they talking about a 35-year-old war? A 35-year-\nold war? Ask those who served in Vietnam whether they ever think it is \na 35-year-old war.\n  Come on, America, face up to what we are doing here. This is the \nultimate disgrace: Risk your life and then be abused by those in the \nhighest office in the country? The chicken hawk has no idea what it \nmeans to have the courage to put your life at risk to defend this \nNation. They are quick to disparage those who did sacrifice. I do not \nunderstand how their conscience permits them to challenge Senator \nKerry's commitment to our Nation's defense.\n\n  The reality is the chicken hawks in this administration are doing a \nlousy job of bolstering our Nation's defense and supporting the troops. \nCase in point: Mission accomplished.\n  I want to discuss this 1-year anniversary because I think it \nsummarizes this flawed thinking and policy planning of the \nadministration regarding its activities in Iraq after the initial \ninvasion. We are all familiar with the imagery of May 1, 2003. My \ncolleagues can see it on this placard. President Bush is dressed up in \na flight suit--well, here he is wearing civilian clothes--playing \nsoldier that day. The theatrics that followed were a production \ncarefully choreographed by the White House political unit. It was \nnothing more than a staged circus act.\n  When the President switched to substance, it was almost more \ndisturbing. He declared that ``major combat operations are over.''\n  He was, unfortunately, wrong. He was certainly wrong over 600 times \nbecause people died in that relatively peaceful postwar period of time.\n  Since the President declared mission accomplished on May 1, 2003, we \nhave lost 585 American troops in Iraq. Before that day we had lost 139. \nThat is a total of 724. In the first gulf war, with over 500,000 troops \nabroad, we lost a total of 293 troops.\n  When the President made his speech on the May 1 mission, it was not \naccomplished. Major combat operations were not over. It was a naive \nmiscalculation. The troops on the ground in Iraq knew trouble was \nbrewing, even though they heard that declaration that the mission was \naccomplished. They knew trouble was brewing as insurgents were \nlaunching more and more attacks.\n  When these attacks on our troops became more frequent, what did the \nPresident say last July? I could not believe what I was hearing. He \nsaid, ``Bring 'em on,'' in this gesture of bravado, in this gesture of \ntoughness, bring them on. But he was not brought on. He was brought on \nto the deck of the aircraft carrier but he was not brought on to the \nbattlefield in Vietnam when there was a chance to do something.\n  I do not think our soldiers are so happy about the President's \ndangerous comment.\n  I served in Europe in World War II. The last thing I wanted to hear \nfrom my Commander in Chief, or my local commander, is to dare the enemy \nto launch attacks on us.\n  The President and his allies are charging Senator Kerry with being a \nflip-flopper, but is it not a more dangerous flip-flop to tell our \nenemies to bring it on and invite attacks? Is it not a flip-flop when \none says they support the troops and then--I heard it directly on our \nrecent trip to Iraq when a captain in one of the reserve units--no, he \nwas full service--when I asked if there were any complaints, he said, \nSenator, those flak jackets, the new ones, I have seen them on Spanish \ncoalition members and I have seen them on other coalition members. We \ndo not have them, Senator.\n  He then pointed to his rifle. He said, You know, there are smaller, \nmore efficient, and better sidings and better sights on smaller, \nlighter weapons. We do not have those. We need more armored Humvee \nvehicles.\n\n  When I was in Iraq in March, soldiers complained to me they are not \nreceiving the best equipment they could have.\n  What about the President's flip-flop to military families? He is \narbitrarily extending tours of duties despite promises to families that \nloved ones would be returning home.\n  No, when it comes to supporting the troops the President is a flip-\nflopper. He says one thing, does another. Supporting the troops means \ncareful planning of military operations, both pre-and postinvasion.\n  We know the administration did not want to hear any dissent about the \nunrealistic assessment of what the Iraqi operation would require. When \nGeneral Shinseki, a distinguished military leader, said we need more \ntroops, that over 300,000 troops would be required, he got fired. \nInstead, we have 130,000 troops in Iraq. That is what is favored by \nSecretary Rumsfeld.\n  Our excellent troops are fighting a treacherous insurgency launched \nby both Sunni and Shi'a elements. Combat operations are not over. They \nare raging. It is obvious the administration miscalculated and \nmisunderstood what would happen after we deposed Saddam. In fact, the \nadministration's beliefs bordered on the delusional. Experts warned \nthem at the time, but they refused to listen.\n  According to Bob Woodward's account, Secretary Powell was all but \nexcluded from the war planning among the key Cabinet officers. Colin \nPowell is the only one who ever saw combat in that group and they \nexcluded him.\n  George McGovern, a friend, a decorated veteran, said this war was \nclearly planned by people who have never seen a battlefield. Look at \nwhat Vice President Cheney said on March 16, 2003:\n\n       We will, in fact, be greeted as liberators. . . . I think \n     it will go relatively quickly . . . (in) weeks rather than \n     months.\n\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\n\n  February 23, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld said the war ``could last 6 \ndays, 6 weeks. I doubt 6 months.'' Now it is over a year later and the \nwar is still going on. A total of 724 American troops have been killed, \n585 of them after President Bush declared major combat operations had \nended.\n  We are in a quagmire that is the result of miscalculations and poor \nplanning by the administration, but for the sake of our troops it is \ntime for the chicken hawks in this administration to end the arrogance \nand the bravado that has put us in the mess we are in right now.\n  If we want someone effectively to defend our Nation and support our \ntroops, I say let us look to someone who understands what it really \nmeans to answer the call and defend your country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the information of Members, there are \nstill 4 minutes 30 seconds remaining. Does the Senator wish to yield \nback the time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield back all the time, yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4453-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 150, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 150) to make permanent the moratorium on taxes \n     on Internet access and multiple and discriminatory taxes on \n     electronic commerce imposed by the Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McCain amendment No. 3048, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Daschle amendment No. 3050 (to the language of the bill \n     proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 3048), to eliminate \n     methyl tertiary butyl ether from the United States fuel \n     supply, to increase production and use of renewable fuel, to \n     increase the Nation's energy independence.\n       Domenici amendment No. 3051 (to amendment No. 3050), to \n     enhance energy conservation and research and development and \n     to provide for security and diversity in the energy supply \n     for the American people.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to urge consideration \nof the Internet Tax Moratorium Act, the proposal, debate, and voting on \ngermane amendments. As I came to the floor, I heard this attack on the \nPresident of the United States and the administration. It was pretty \nrough stuff, calling people chicken hawks and talking about service to \nthe country or lack thereof.\n  I am sure the statements just made by the Senator from New Jersey \nreflect the intense partisanship and recent discussions and charges and \ncountercharges on talk shows and cable television and radio all over \nAmerica. I think it might be an interesting and maybe sometimes \nentertaining exercise--the little drawing of the chicken hawk was kind \nof clever. I have to hand it to whoever the artist is.\n  But isn't it a fact that we are now engaged in a war? Isn't it a fact \nright now that, as we speak, our marines are attacking Falluja and I am \nsure incurring casualties, these brave young Americans?\n  I don't know if they get C-SPAN over in Iraq, but here they are with \ntheir lives literally on the line, trying to bring freedom or ensure \nthe freedom of the Iraqi people. They get television--if not C-SPAN, I \nknow they get Armed Forces Television in many of the bases in Iraq--\nwhat do they see? They see us attacking each other about service or \nnonservice in a conflict that ended more than 30 years ago.\n  All of us who stand here--I haven't known of an elected or nonelected \npolitician who hasn't said: We are all behind the troops; we are behind \nthe men and women in the military; we support them 100 percent no \nmatter what. What are they supposed to think? Are we really supporting \nthem and are we interested in bringing about a successful conclusion to \nthe Iraqi conflict?\n  Senator Kerry, the Democrat nominee, says we have to stay the course. \nHe may have different views as to exactly how to do that than the \nPresident and the administration, but we are in agreement. Meanwhile, \nwhat are we doing on the floor of the Senate? We are attacking the \nPresident's credentials because of his service or lack of service in a \nwar that ended 30 years ago, more than 30 years ago.\n  I think that is wrong. I wish we would stop it. I wish we would just \nstop, at least until the fighting in Iraq is over.\n  Second, maybe we could devote some of our time and effort and energy \nin coming up with a bipartisan approach to this conflict. Yes, there \nare enormous difficulties. No, things haven't worked out as well as \nthey should have. Yes, I, myself, would have had different approaches \nto the challenge in Iraq. But we are there. We are in a very crucial \nmoment. Why don't we all join together and sit down and work out, with \nthe administration, both sides of the aisle, a common approach so we \nsend a single message? Not that we are refighting the Vietnam war, but \nthat we are committed to seeing this thing through in Iraq because we \ncannot afford to fail. We cannot afford to fail.\n  There will be plenty of time after this conflict is over. We may even \nhave a commission. We have commissions for everything else; why not \nhave a commission after we have democracy in Iraq to find out where we \nfailed in Iraq? That would be fine with me. I wouldn't particularly \nwant to serve on it, but let's have a commission.\n  But in the meantime, don't you think our focus and attention is \nmisplaced? We are talking about chicken hawks. When the President of \nthe United States is the one whose most solemn responsibility is to be \nCommander in Chief of our Armed Forces, and to prosecute a conflict \nthat was authorized by an overwhelming vote in this body, and we are \ncalling him a chicken hawk--please. Is that the appropriate time and \nplace for this kind of activity?\n  I do know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't \nlike this. I know my friend Senator Lieberman proposed that we all join \ntogether to try to come up with a common approach. I don't know if that \nis possible in this day and age, but it is certainly something worth \nconsideration. But at least, could we declare that the Vietnam war is \nover and have a cease-fire and agree that both candidates, the \nPresident of the United States and Senator Kerry, served honorably--end \nof story. Now let's focus our attention on the conflict that is taking \nplace in Iraq, that is taking American lives as I speak on this floor.\n  I don't want to belabor the subject, but I do want to expand on it a \nlittle bit. It is a symptom of the extreme partisanship that exists in \nthis body today on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator to yield for a brief \ncomment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I had to step off the floor for a phone call, and I \napologize. But what I wanted to say to the Senator from Arizona, the \nSenator from Arizona, in my opinion, is exemplary in his statements on \nthe floor and off the floor about what has been going on between the \ntwo people who are going to be running for President in November.\n  I believe the Senator from Arizona has defended the Democratic \nnominee, his war record.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the President of the United States.\n  Mr. REID. That is right. I was going to say, and the President of the \nUnited States. We would be better off if everyone in this very delicate \nPresidential election would follow the lead of the Senator from \nArizona. We do not need, in my opinion, to get into what went on in \nVietnam.\n  We are proud of what Senator Kerry has done, and whatever President \nBush has done, he is Commander in Chief now. It would be better off for \neverybody, I repeat, for the second time, if we followed the lead of \nthe Senator from Arizona and not question what went on during those war \nyears.\n  I would say, though, to my friend from Arizona, I feel as if I am in \nhigh school now--``They started it,'' that kind of thing. I think we \nneed to get back to the real issues; that is, how we are going to \nfinish the situation in\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\nIraq, what we are going to do about the economy, health care, the \nenvironment, and all those other issues.\n  The third time: We would all be better off if we followed the example \nof the Senator from Arizona. That is basically what I want to say. I \napologize.\n  This is a he-said, she-said, they-said. My friend from New Jersey is \na war veteran himself. He has a right to speak, as we all know. But I \nam sure he would not have spoken had this not started some other place. \nBut I appreciate very much the Senator from Arizona yielding.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada who is a good and dear \nfriend of many years, who I also know decries this.\n  Let me repeat one more time that I believe that honorable service was \nperformed by the President of the United States in the National Guard. \nAlmost 40 percent of the forces that are in Iraq today are guardsmen \nand reservists. They are superb young men and women.\n  Obviously, I know the Senator from Nevada shares my view that service \nin the National Guard is honorable service, as is service on Active \nDuty, as that performed by Senator Kerry, in my view. But it is time to \ndeclare a truce.\n  I would also say to my friend from Nevada, there is nothing we can do \nabout what talk show hosts do, or outside commentators. That is freedom \nof speech.\n  I am sorry so much focus is on that, and I don't pretend to say I \ncould do anything about that. But I hope Members of this body could \ndeclare a truce on this issue, if I may use that word, and then we \ncould move forward in addressing the compelling issues of the day.\n  I will be glad to hear the response of the Senator or, if he doesn't \nmind--I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that would be easy to do. I think we can get \npeople on this side to stop the discussion. If the administration \nwouldn't be doing what they are doing with ads and things of that \nnature, we would all be better off.\n  I repeat that I am not questioning someone's military record. As the \nSenator knows, this is an ongoing issue. I can't do anything about talk \nshow people, but we can do something about the two Presidential \ncandidates--one sitting President and one sitting Senator--and have \nthem and their organizations not discuss this. I think it doesn't \naccomplish anything. Someone might say: They started it; we are going \nto try to finish it. We should wash our hands of that and try to start \nanew and not be talking about the service of either one.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to leave that particular \nsubject, but say that segues in a very rational way into what we are \nfacing on the floor of the Senate in consideration of this bill.\n  Yesterday, I was under the impression that we were moving forward \nwith a vigorous and spirited and passionate debate on the issue of an \nInternet tax moratorium.\n  Why is this issue of importance? Because the worst thing we can do to \nsmall and large businesses in America, around America, is to have an \natmosphere of uncertainty.\n  I think most of my colleagues would agree--this is probably the most \npartisan environment I have seen in the 18 years I have served in the \nSenate and the 4 years that I served in the House.\n  What is happening--and I was a bit sarcastic yesterday, I must \nadmit--is we come to the floor with legislation which is important. The \nInternet tax moratorium doesn't lend itself to partisanship. In fact, \nthe two greatest opponents of this legislation--Senator Dorgan opposes \nit with two Members on this side of the aisle. It is not one of those \nthat somehow is a Democrat philosophy versus a Republican philosophy. \nOne of the greatest supporters of the Internet tax moratorium is the \nSenator from Oregon. Here we are with this issue which is really \nimportant to American businesses. Most businesses, obviously, support a \ntax moratorium. But what they fear most of all is uncertainty. They \nhave to make plans for their businesses and their futures.\n  What we are in danger of right now as we speak is getting hung up on \nextraneous issues, as we have on almost every piece of legislation that \nhas come before this body, on extraneous amendments. I understand the \nfrustration of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I served \nin the minority for the first number of years that I was here. Yet the \nmajority sets the agenda. I have said to the Senator from North Dakota, \nI want my issue raised, I want a vote on it, and I am ready to go. I \nhave never tried to tie up the Senate on an issue. I have come down \nhere for years and forced votes on line-item vetoes. But I said that I \nam willing to have a time agreement and a debate on the issue of \nclimate change. Senator Lieberman and I said: Look, we are not going to \ntie up the Senate. We are not going to impede everything from going \nforward. We had a vote. We got 43, I am happy to say.\n\n  My point is, we shouldn't block the passage of legislation. I think \nthere is a careful balance between proposing an amendment, getting a \nvote on it, and then allowing the legislation to move on rather than \njust overloading the legislation to the point where it has to be \nwithdrawn.\n  I hope we can get a vote on the Democratic leader's amendment on \nethanol. I hope we can get a vote on many of these other issues, \nincluding minimum wage if necessary. But at some point you cross a line \nbetween trying to have your views and your issues and your agenda \naddressed to the point where we just end up in gridlock.\n  I think most observers, both inside and outside of this institution, \nwill agree we are basically gridlocked on almost every issue that comes \nbefore us. That is not what we are sent here to do. We are sent here to \nact as legislators and to address the issues that are important to the \nAmerican people instead of partisan gridlock.\n  I hope we can sit down on both sides of the aisle and at least make \npeople aware of what the agenda is. I have a very long relationship \nwith both the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from South Dakota who \nare friends of mine. I would like to know what the agenda is. I don't \nthink it is a lot to ask what I can expect in managing this bill. At \nleast in that way I can try to accommodate the concerns of the agenda \nof the other side of the aisle.\n  But to come out here and just spring an amendment I don't think is \nquite fair, and I don't think I would do that if I were in that \nposition.\n  I hope we can return to some kind of comity and that way perhaps \ndecide how we are going to dispose of this bill.\n  I said only half sarcastically yesterday that if we are going to \nspend all of our time in gridlock around here, some of us would like to \ngo home. It is much nicer in Arizona than in the Nation's Capital. \nMaybe we could leave a couple of Senators on either side to propose \namendments, have quorum calls, and be in gridlock. Some people would be \nfooled that we are still working. But instead, it is now Wednesday. We \nare supposed to be out Thursday night, and we have addressed one \namendment to this legislation. I don't think this is a fair way to \nlegislate.\n  I know my friend from North Dakota is here and wants to say a few \nwords, and my friend from Oregon and my friend from Virginia. But I \nalso urge those who have amendments which are germane to please come to \nthe floor so we can debate them and vote on them since I think it is \nimportant to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Oregon has been \nwaiting to speak. The Senator from Virginia is in the Chamber as well. \nBut if it might be appropriate, I wish to make a couple of comments \nrelative to my friend's comments. If it is appropriate, I would like to \nask consent that the Senator from Oregon be recognized following my \npresentation. My understanding is he is going to speak for a few \nmoments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me clear up a couple of issues.\n  First, my colleague from Arizona is straight with all the facts. We \nhave no disagreements about the facts. He indicated I am opposed to the \nmoratorium. I am not opposed to the moratorium. I have voted for an \nInternet tax moratorium. I hope before the end of this week I can vote \nfor another Internet tax moratorium.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I appreciate \nthe\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\nSenator correcting the Record. I do not mean his opposition to a \nmoratorium but his opposition to the definition of Internet access.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct. I don't support the specific definition \nof access. We need to work through that. But that doesn't mean I don't \nsupport the moratorium on taxing the Internet. I have supported that \npreviously. I supported the previous moratorium that was in existence, \nand I support it now. In fact, I will offer an amendment that will \ndemonstrate that support. I appreciate clearing that up.\n  Second, the Senator twice yesterday--I was going to correct him and I \ndid not--talked about the fact that the Democrats have a retreat this \nweekend on Friday. We Democrats don't use the word ``retreat.'' We call \nit an ``issues conference.'' We think ``retreat'' is a more negative \nword. So we have an issues conference, as do the Republican members of \nthe Republican caucus, I think, have a couple times a year. We have an \nissues conference. We will be doing that beginning on Friday.\n  Let me also comment about the Senator from South Dakota, the minority \nleader, Mr. Daschle. He offered his amendment. I know the comments by \nSenator McCain this morning reflect the right of Senator Daschle to \noffer that amendment. I understand that when one is managing a bill, \nthe last thing you want is an amendment that is off the particular \nsubject. But Senator McCain has correctly stated that the amendment \noffered by Senator Daschle was well within the rules of the Senate. He \nhas the right to offer that amendment.\n  My guess is, as Senator McCain described his approach earlier in the \nSenate of offering an amendment, that might be extraneous for the \npurpose of getting a vote on the amendment at some point. I think \nSenator Daschle would be very happy to--I can't speak for him--come out \nhere and say: I will withdraw that amendment in exchange of Senator \nFrist allowing me a vote on that amendment immediately following the \nInternet tax moratorium. I am guessing Senator Daschle would be very \nhappy to do that.\n  In any event, because he felt a need to offer that amendment on this \nbill, it doesn't mean he is trying to block this bill. The only block \nis a mental block among those who might not want to proceed now.\n  The fact is, I think Senator Daschle would be willing to come out \nhere and say: Let us have a 15-minute time agreement or 30-minute time \nagreement, have a vote, and we will dispose of this amendment--however \nit is disposed of. Let us do that. I am sure he would say: I don't \nintend to block this bill but I just intend to exercise my right to get \na vote on my amendment, which I think is the same approach the Senator \nfrom Arizona has used very effectively, I might add, over many years.\n  If anybody on the floor of this Senate is relentless--and some might \nuse other adjectives--in the pursuit of his passions and demands that \nhe be heard, it is the Senator from Arizona.\n  I expect others who have managed bills who have sat in that very \nchair have from time to time had to grit their teeth in sufficient \nvolume to have people hear in the Russell Building when Senator McCain \ncomes to the Senate floor, wondering what amendment he will offer and \nwhat is its purpose.\n  The approach with which we legislate in the Senate is not always the \nmost efficient approach. The most efficient approach, I suppose, is the \none used by the other body in the House of Representatives where they \npackage up, through the Rules Committee, the exact circumstance under \nwhich legislation will be considered. They bring a bill to the floor, \nthey will allow these six amendments, and they will have 10 minutes \neach. They package it up and zip it real tight. The Senate does not \nwork that way. George Washington was happy it does not. So was Thomas \nJefferson. I am as well. However, it is frustrating from time to time. \nYesterday was a frustrating day.\n  However, I would speak on behalf of the minority leader in saying \nthat the issue offered with respect to renewable fuels is a very \nimportant issue. Let's just move on that. Let's get a vote on that. I \nexpect I could ask him to come to the Senate floor, and I expect he \nwould be willing to have a short time agreement if he gets a vote on \nhis amendment. Since he offered the amendment, Senator Domenici came \nand offered a 900-page amendment dealing with the entire Energy bill, \nrewritten so that is a different issue.\n  My goal would be to try to move through this legislation. I hope we \ncan find a way to vote on amendments that are offered, have short time \nagreements.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware on this side we would be happy to \nagree to set aside, temporarily, the pending amendment? For example, \nSenator Kennedy wants to offer something on minimum wage. He would take \na very short time agreement on that: 15 minutes divided on each side. \nWe would be happy to allow the majority to offer an amendment either as \nit relates to this bill, as the Senator from Arizona wants to do, or \nwhatever else they might feel is appropriate. We would look at that and \nsee if we could agree to a short time agreement.\n  Even though we are in this parliamentary quagmire with three votes \nscheduled for tomorrow, three separate cloture votes, today we would be \nhappy to work our way through this, doing one amendment per one \namendment. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am. I was trying to make the point that those who have \na right to offer amendments do not intend to block the legislation. My \nhope is we can try to determine how we get through this, have votes.\n  I heard a presentation earlier this morning in the Senate saying the \nproblem with the Senate is we are being obstructed every time we turn \naround. The obstruction is the minute somebody on our side offers an \namendment, the place shuts down. I don't understand that.\n  There is a guy in my hometown who had a Model T. He got drunk one \nnight, and when he was driving home he turned the front wheels too \nsharp. The Model T's were the only cars like the red wagon: If you turn \nthe wheel too tight, it tips over. He turned the Model T too tight and \nit tipped over. He thought he saw chickens in the road, so he turned \nthe wheels too tight and tipped the Model T.\n\n  I was thinking of this in terms of getting this moving. When somebody \noffers an amendment, somebody sees some chickens in the road, so we \njust stop or tip over. We just do not move. Then somebody says, Well, \nwe do not want to move anymore because the other side has obstructed \nus.\n  I say--whether it is overtime, whether it is ethanol, or whether it \nis on minimum wage--they need not obstruct anything. I believe all of \nthose who have offered those amendments have agreed to a very short \ntimeframe. Have a vote and dispose of it, and then move forward. \nBecause the majority does not want to have that vote, they essentially \ndecide we are going to do nothing. We will keep the lights on, we will \nmake it look like we are working, but we are not going to move.\n  That is unfortunate because there is not obstruction from this side. \nThe obstruction would be from those who have decided once my colleague \noffered an overtime amendment we will no longer proceed with the \ncorporate finance bill; we will no longer proceed because somebody \noffered an amendment we do not like.\n  With respect to this bill in the Senate, the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct, my preference would be whatever somebody offers today, ask them, \nWill you accept a time agreement that is reasonable--15 minutes, 30 \nminutes? If they say yes, we ought to have a discussion about it for \nthat 15 minutes, call the roll, have a vote, and then move on. We will \nexhaust that pretty quickly. We will get to the amendments that are at \nthe center of this bill, find out what the sentiment of the Senate is \non that, and then, I hope, pass this legislation.\n  I hope at the end of the day I will vote in favor of this, as I have \ndone on previous pieces of legislation dealing with the Internet tax \nfreedom or the moratorium on taxing the Internet. My hope is we can \nfind a solution to this definition. I think we are working on one so \nthat we can vote for it. I want this to pass.\n  I have taken longer than I intended to say something I should have \nsaid with greater brevity, but my hope is we\n\n[[Page S4456]]\n\ncan just proceed. We are now at parade rest again, as is the case with \nevery bill, with people saying, Your side is obstructing. We are not \nobstructing. We can have a 15-minute debate on the Daschle amendment \nand then vote for it. I am for that. I think Senator Reid would be for \nthat. Let's do that. Then we do not have a worry about the Democratic \nleader offering an amendment. He offers it and the Senate has an \nopportunity to vote on it.\n  The place where we should be roundly criticized is if we offered an \namendment and said, By the way, we do not want to vote on this; we want \nto talk about it for 2 or 3 days. No one I am aware of is in the \nposition of doing that. That is not our intention. We simply want to \nvote on the Daschle amendment.\n  I know my colleague from Oregon is waiting to talk about the very \nthing that represents the difference on this moratorium issue, and that \nis the definition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. First, Mr. President, I say to the Senator from North \nDakota I very much support what the Senator is trying to do in terms of \nprocedure. It is time to vote. As the Senator has said, whether 15 \nminutes or half an hour, people ought to get on to the task of voting.\n  After 8 years of discussing this eye-glazing subject of Internet \ntaxes, we always cringe at the prospect of wading once more into this \nincredibly arcane area, so I will take a few minutes to talk about the \ndefinitions question with respect to Internet access. This is clearly \nthe big hangup.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is here. He has been exceptionally \ncooperative, even though we have had different views on the subject \nover the last 8 years. I will take a couple of minutes to describe what \nthe central concerns are with respect to working out the definition of \nthe Internet access.\n  The concern on my part is, as the Alexander language is written \ntoday, in effect it will hide taxes on Internet access, No. 1; and, No. \n2, it opens the door to multiple State and city taxes on the individual \ncomponent parts the American people think of as Internet access. No \nSenator wants to do this. There is no Member of the Senate who gets up \nin the morning and says, I want to have thousands of new Internet \ntaxes. However, the way the definition of the Alexander language is \nwritten today, it will, in fact, open up the opportunity to tax \nwireless Blackberry services, spam-filtering systems, Web hosting, and \nthe like.\n  I will take a minute to touch on both of these concepts, the question \nof hiding the Internet taxes and the question of opening the entire Net \nto taxing the individual components. We will have to work through those \ntwo in order to do as the Senator from North Dakota has suggested--get \nthis done as we have done on several occasions.\n  With respect to the hiding of taxes, it comes in the overall bill the \nconsumer receives. We already see this in jurisdictions, for example, \nthat tax DSL. Right now, I believe we are discriminating against the \nfuture. Right now cabling, in effect, gets a free ride. DSL gets taxed \nin a number of jurisdictions. This has special impact for my friend \nfrom North Dakota and me because DSL, of course, is the way we will get \nbroadband into rural areas. The way that tax shows up, of course, is in \nthe overall bill. It is just in the overall bill.\n\n  So unless we get equity for DSL relative to cable, what is going to \nhappen in America is the Internet tax will be hidden in the overall \nkind of bill, and the consumer will just see, in Oregon and North \nDakota and everywhere else, a higher bill for broadband than they would \nsee right now for cable, and that would be continued.\n  So we absolutely, in the area of definitions, have to have \ntechnological neutrality. That is what we began with 8 years ago when \nwe said everything that happens online is the same thing that is going \nto happen offline. To get the technological neutrality this time, we \nhave to say that DSL does not get hammered and cable gets a free ride.\n  Here is an example. I want to offer this to my colleagues because I \nthink it also highlights again our concern with respect to the \ndefinitions in the Alexander language and how it opens the opportunity \nfor additional taxes. The Alexander language stipulates there be no tax \non services used to ``connect the purchaser of Internet access to the \nInternet access provider.'' But nowhere in that language is the term \n``connect'' defined.\n  Does it mean that Internet access ends where a computer hooks into \nthe phoneline? Does it mean where the phoneline reaches the central \noffice or where the line makes its first point of presence on the Net? \nSo the term ``connect'' without any definition is simply uncharted \nterritory, and it would again, in my view, allow States and cities to \ntax Internet access, again, through a kind of hidden approach that is \ngoing to keep the consumer from doing what I and the Senator from North \nDakota have always tried to do in the consumer protection area: give \nconsumers access to information and make sure there is truth in billing \nso they can actually choose between various technologies that best \nassist them.\n  With respect to the question of the Alexander legislation opening up \nthe door to multiple State and city taxes on the individual components \npeople think of as Internet access, we now have 391 separate taxes on \ntelecommunications administered in 10,000 jurisdictions. The fact is, \nStates tax different technology platforms for Internet access in \ndifferent ways. So we have a cable modem platform, we have a \ntraditional landline, we have a wireless dial-up in DSL, and, of \ncourse, satellites.\n  The Alexander proposal says that DSL is not Internet access but a \ntelecommunications service, and, in effect, we would then see DSL \nfurther taxed. I think that would eliminate the competitive playing \nfield that has always been the point of this exercise for now 8 years. \nTo me, to just force people, particularly in rural areas--in the rural \nareas I care about and the Senator from North Dakota cares about--to \nface this discrimination against broadband is particularly troubling.\n  So I know this is exceptionally complicated material, and Senators \nhave been barraged by all sides on this over the last few days. I have \ntried to outline how the revenue projections we have discussed over the \nlast 8 years, with the States and localities saying they were going to \nlose vast amounts of revenue, have not come true. I have talked about \nhow this is an effort, in this iteration of the Internet tax freedom \nbill, to essentially update our original law with respect to \ntechnology. But it is, as the Senator from North Dakota has correctly \nsaid, a question of definitions. So this concept, as I have outlined \nwith respect to the Alexander language, in terms of how you would \nconnect the purchaser of Internet access--without that being defined \nmeans you can expose jurisdictions to multiple forms of taxation. Then \nthere is the question of hiding the Internet tax, which is what the \nAlexander proposal will do, because companies do not eat these costs; \nthe companies end up passing them to the consumer.\n\n  So what will happen, all over this country--in North Dakota and \nOregon and across the country--is that people who order broadband, who \nessentially look to DSL for their broadband services, will just get a \nhigher bill. They will get a higher bill than people who order \nbroadband through cable. That is regrettable. It certainly violates the \nprinciple of technological neutrality.\n  I repeat, I think the Senator from North Dakota has been very \nconstructive on this issue. We have gone through this water torture \nexercise now since late 1996, and I am very much prepared to do this \nonce again. But clearly, with respect to these definitions, we have \nsome major issues that have to be worked through.\n  I also point out, as the chairman of the Commerce Committee did \nyesterday and Senator Allen has as well, in 10 separate areas, as we \nworked even for the managers' amendment, we have made efforts to \ncompromise on the definitions question. We have exempted a whole host \nof areas all of the sponsors felt should not be subjected to taxation. \nWith respect particularly to voice over, the exciting area where phone \ncalls are going to be made over the Internet, we have made it clear in \nthis legislation, in the substitute the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\nis offering, that we would not change the status quo.\n  I have heard from California and others that somehow this is going to \ndramatically change the question of taxation for phone calls over the \nInternet. The McCain language clearly stipulates--clearly stipulates--\nthat in that area California and others have been so concerned about, \nthere are no changes.\n  So I look forward to working with the Senator from North Dakota. I \ncommend him for taking yet another crack, as he has done for 8 years \nwith me, on this subject that I have been comparing to sort of \nprolonged root canal work. But we are going to get this done, and \nhopefully it will be this week.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oregon yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Of course.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Oregon has outlined, I think, the center \nof the discussion and the controversy. To demonstrate the complexity of \nthis issue, when we talk about someone connecting to broadband from \ntheir home computer, they are connecting, perhaps, through their \ntelephone system. So it goes from the computer to the telephone wire, \nback to, I guess--through, perhaps--a D-SLAM, up to an ISP, Internet \nservice provider. So you have a series of things that are happening \nwith respect to the connection.\n  Some would say the connection is between the computer and the \ntelephone service that is going to be provided at a cost of, let's say, \n$40 a month, and that shall be tax exempt. I agree with that. That \nconnection shall not bear the burden of a tax. I think that is what the \nSenator is talking about with respect to part of the definition.\n  So then the question goes beyond that. Well, what about the \narchitecture that goes back up through the local phone system to the D-\nSLAM, to the Internet service provider? What if they are buying a part \nfor the facility that allows them to move DSL out to the neighborhood? \nThat is part of the DSL stream, but it is upstream in the architecture \nof getting the DSL to the home. So is that part of what the \narchitecture is?\n  One of the difficulties for me is to try to understand what the \nSenator from Oregon describes as the connection. Is it all the way up \nto the Internet service provider in every purchase--every part, every \npiece, or every bit of construction that exists between the computer \nand the Internet service provider downstream through the architecture? \nIf that is the case, we are talking about a substantial amount of \neconomic activity, almost all of which is now taxed, incidentally, not \njust for telephone service but similarly for the cable system, which \nwould not then be taxed in the future and would affect the revenue base \nof State and local governments. But if the definition of the \n``connection'' is some $40 a month that one might pay for the DSL \nservice, that, I think, represents a definition that most of us agree \nwith.\n  I am just trying to understand a bit, and perhaps the Senator from \nOregon can describe an answer to those questions so I understand it \nbetter.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, with respect to the architecture the \nSenator from North Dakota has described, people have already paid once. \nSo this question of what is going to be done with respect to various \naspects of the architecture is an interesting discussion for us to be \npursuing in the Senate, and all of these various components and pieces \nof equipment, but people have already paid once. And with respect to \nInternet access, about which we have been concerned, it is almost like \na carton of milk: You paid for the carton of milk once; you should not \npay again if you are going to pour it on your cereal or something else.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has raised a question about funding for \nwhat is called the backbone of the communications system. But at the \nend of the day, the bottom line is, people have already paid once. What \nwe want to do with this legislation is to say, on the question of \nInternet access, nothing about sales taxes and the like. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota knows once we get over this, we will have the next \nissue, which is the question of the streamlining of sales taxes. But \nwith respect to the architecture the Senator from North Dakota has \nraised, the consumer has already paid once with respect to Internet \naccess.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't know if the Senator from Oregon had a chance to \nsee the article by Senator Allen this morning in the Wall Street \nJournal. I commend it to all. It is funny because Senator Allen's piece \nin the Wall Street Journal dovetails with the information we received \nin the Commerce Committee in the last 2 years about revisiting the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act and what we need to do in the future.\n  The issue that came up with all the witnesses this morning and came \nup yesterday morning was the United States is falling dangerously \nbehind all other nations on DSL. We are now ranked 11th in the view of \nsome, 20th in the view of others. If you would have told me 10 years \nago we would rank behind South Korea on almost any technology, as \nintelligent and hard working and industrious as they are, I would have \nsaid: We have a problem.\n  As the Senator from Virginia points out in his piece, they are trying \nto tax DSL. Some States are taxing DSL. I am not saying it is taxation \nof DSL that has caused the serious problem we have fallen behind at \nleast 10--in the view of some, 19--other nations in broadband access. \nBut I am saying, why in the world would we want to lay taxes on them at \na time when we need to expand it dramatically rather than lay a tax on \nit.\n  May I mention one other point here that is important. To all of these \nState Governors, the National Governors Association, who keep saying, \n``We are losing all this revenue; why don't you stop spending so \nmuch,'' revenues have increased in literally every State in America in \nthe last couple of years. Instead they are spending more. For them to \ntax DSL at a time when it, in the view of almost everyone, is critical \nto the United States maintaining its technological lead and the growth \nof business, communications, and politics, is outrageous. It is \ninsulting. It is disgraceful these greedy Governors are so greedy they \ndon't understand the impact of taxation of DSL, which is still only in \n28 percent of our urban and suburban residences and 10 percent of rural \nAmerica. Talk about tunnel vision.\n\n  They and their acolytes come over here and start talking about how \nimportant it is that they be able to keep taxing and that many of \nthem--as Senator Allen points out in his column, they say: We are not \ngoing to tax hamburgers, so they tax the meat and not the bun--have \nstarted to tax DSL. It is spreading. Even in our bill, we are going to \nallow them to continue to do so. We are going to allow them, even \nthough they are not in violation of the letter of the law, but \ncertainly the intent of the law by taxing DSL. Now they want to tax it \nmore. Every witness before our committee--we had the Cato Institute and \nthe Brookings Institute; we had representatives across the spectrum of \nthought in America--said: You have to increase DSL. You have to \nincrease broadband access. You are falling behind every other nation in \nthe world.\n  So what do the Governors want to do? They want to tax them. We are \ngoing to have them come over here and talk about unfunded mandates and \nunfairness and fairness. The fact is, if we allow every State in \nAmerica and every municipality in America to start taxing DSL, it is \nabsolutely inevitable that we will see a slowing of the growth of \nbroadband access. It is obvious if you lay another burden on it.\n  There are a number of areas, including overregulation and other \nthings. Mr. Notebaert of Qwest pointed out yesterday that in order for \nhis corporation to provide DSL to a home, to have permission to do so \nrequired $130,000 in expenditure and X number of days. I think he said \nsomething like 24 days. But if a cable company wants to provide exactly \nthat same service, they can provide it in less than 24 hours. Obviously \nthere is something fundamentally and terribly wrong in the regulatory \nregime, and it needs to be fixed.\n  I am not blaming our falling behind other nations on DSL and \nbroadband access simply on taxation. But I am saying that increases in \ntaxation--and it would be widespread if we opened the door--will have a \nsubstantial chilling effect in the reduction of what should be one of \nour Nation's highest priorities, as the President of the United\n\n[[Page S4458]]\n\nStates said in his speech the day before yesterday, to provide \nbroadband access to all Americans no matter where they are.\n  I again congratulate my colleague from Virginia for an excellent \npiece in the Wall Street Journal. I recommend it to my colleagues.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I still have the floor. I know the Senator \nfrom North Dakota wants to talk more about the architecture. The point \nthat is being made with respect to broadband and that Senator McCain \nhas touched on is if we now say the Alexander definitions go forward, \nbroadband through DSL is going to be taxed. That is discrimination \nagainst the future. It is particularly burdensome for rural areas, the \nkind of areas I and the Senators from North Dakota and South Carolina \nrepresent. The fact is, you are not going to get broadband into small \nareas through cable. It is not economically efficient to do it. You are \ngoing to get broadband to rural areas through DSL.\n  I am prepared--once we make sure DSL is not singled out for \ndiscriminatory treatment, as it has been in a number of jurisdictions \nin the past--to work with the Senator from North Dakota and others to \nget this matter resolved.\n  Broadband through DSL is going to create a tremendous number of jobs. \nBrookings has said there are going to be hundreds of millions of \ndollars worth of investment that come about through broadband DSL. The \nSenator from Arizona is correct in saying we don't have the problem now \nwith respect to broadband exclusively because of taxes. But I can \nassure my colleagues we will in the future see this problem compounded \nif broadband secured through DSL is singled out for special treatment. \nUnder the Alexander definition, that would be the case. That is \nunfortunate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have just a couple of thoughts. First, \nmy colleague from Arizona was also at the hearing this morning when the \nquestion to one of the witnesses elicited the answer that taxes really \nare inconsequential or have almost no impact on the movement and \ndeployment of broadband. I happen to agree with that assessment.\n  What has happened with respect to Japan and South Korea, as an \nexample, where they have had this robust, aggressive development of \nbroadband, it is a result of a couple things. They had a national will, \na program, and a determination to make that happen, including loan \nguarantees, among other things--also, including regulation. What was \nthe regulation? It was that their Government said incumbent providers \nmust make their facilities available to other competitors; their dark \nfiber must be made available to other competitors. They created robust, \naggressive competition and, therefore, a massive buildout of broadband. \nGood for them. But that was regulation. That was the Government saying \nyou have to make your dark fiber available to the incumbent providers. \nThey have approached this in different ways.\n  Also, we in this Government, right now, have, I understand, over $2 \nbillion of loan guarantees and loan authority in the U.S. for the \nbuildout of broadband. I know that because I offered the amendment \nwhich allowed that to happen.\n  Senator Burns and I and others worked on this for a long while. Yet \nthat money has sat down at the USDA and they are not doing much with \nit. We met with the Secretary of Agriculture to say: Let's move, let's \nincentivize and develop the buildout of broadband.\n  You have resources, substantial resources. I believe the resources \nused in Japan were $1 billion in loan guarantees. We have more than \nthat available; it has been available, appropriated, and ready, and it \nis not being used. While I appreciate the President's speech, I say to \nthe President that we have appropriated money for this. Let's get USDA \nto move on it.\n  I wish to make the point that there are a couple of things that \nreflect what has happened in Japan, South Korea, and other countries, I \nmight add, that has dramatically accelerated their buildout of \nbroadband. We ought to be concerned about that. In my judgment, we \nought to have regulatory authority, and we ought to have the ability to \nuse what is already appropriated for loan guarantees. We ought to have \na national will and a national determination to have a broadband \nbuildout that is aggressive. That is going to happen when our \nGovernment says this is a significant priority for us.\n  Attendant to that, I would say, is passage of a moratorium bill. I \nwill support that at the end of the week, provided we can reach this \nsolution on definition. I don't want to describe that as some nirvana \nthat is going to be the event that unleashes some massive, new program \nof the buildout of broadband.\n  I agree with the fellow from Brookings who said this isn't \nparticularly consequential. It is not the tax issue that is impeding \nthe buildout of broadband.\n  Having said that, we have previously decided, as a matter of public \npolicy, that we did not want to tax Internet service, connection to the \nInternet. I supported that. That moratorium existed in Federal law, and \nthen it expired last fall. I prefer at the end of this process, this \nweek, I hope, that we will have passed another piece of legislation \nthat represents a moratorium. Why? Well, I think incrementally it is \nthe right policy. I don't know. We have some people on the floor who \nhave law degrees. I guess most of us have advance degrees of some type. \nI will bet there is not one person on the floor of the Senate at the \nmoment who can understand their telephone bill--not one. We ought to \nbring them to the floor of the Senate and go over it in some detail. It \nwould take a few days. That would be the ultimate obstruction, trying \nto read your personal telephone bill. It is so god-awful complicated, \nnobody can understand it. There is a myriad of charges, fees, and \ntaxes.\n\n  For that reason, I am sympathetic to the notion of a moratorium, not \nbecause I think it unleashes the forces of the buildout of broadband; I \nthink it is a reasonable thing to do.\n  I have not read the submission of the Wall Street Journal printed by \nthe Senator from Virginia today, but I will do that when I have the \nopportunity. I am interested now that it has been raised. I think what \nwe should do is the right thing, and we ought to do it the right way. \nSo you don't find opposition from me with respect to the objective \nhere. I hope we can reach this definition as we move upstream beyond \nthe immediate connection of DSL, for example, and that we can define \nwhat moving upstream means, and exactly what it is we are preventing \nfrom ever being taxed by State and local governments, which they may \nnow tax.\n  Once we describe and understand that, I think we can easily find a \nbill that should get 95 votes in the Senate, to say we subscribe to the \nbasic principle that we should not tax access to the Internet. That is \na principle I support, and I hope at the end of the week I will be able \nto manifest my support by voting for the legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Virginia has been \npatient. Briefly, I point out that in the hearing this morning, yes, \none witness from Brookings said it would have very little, or not much, \neffect. The other five witnesses said it would have great effect. All \nsix witnesses said they strongly supported an Internet tax moratorium, \nincluding DSL, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, including the one \nwho said there was very little effect. The other witnesses strongly \nfavored it and thought that a tax, particularly on DSL, would have a \nsignificant impact.\n  I think we ought to reflect in the Record the view of all of the \nwitnesses.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield on that point, this is like \nbeing witness to an accident. We all see different things, apparently. \nBut it is absolutely true that all of the witnesses at the hearing we \njust attended supported a moratorium on the issue of taxing the \nInternet. No question. I didn't hear from all these witnesses that it \nwould have ``great'' effect. I didn't hear that term. Nonetheless, I \nbelieve they feel, as I do, and as Senator McCain does, that we ought \nto have a moratorium.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend.\n  I point out again, there are a lot of reasons why we are falling \nbehind, probably for the first time I know of in a major high-\ntechnology capability. Maybe during the 1970s there was a time we fell \nbehind the Japanese in\n\n[[Page S4459]]\n\ncertain areas. But this should be of concern to all of us. We should \nremove any impediment or burden. I think the Senator from North Dakota \nand the Senators from Oregon and Virginia agree that we have to change \nthe regulatory scheme which has clearly not conformed with these \nadvances in technology.\n  I point out again, when Dick Notebaert said it costs him $124,000 and \nX number of days to install a DSL line, and a cable company can do it \nin 24 hours, something is wrong. Either one is wrong or the other.\n  But I argue that if I were a small businessperson and I saw looming \nahead of me significant taxes on the way I was conducting my business, \nI would obviously give pause. Small businesspeople have small margins. \nWe all know that. That is always a factor in the decisions that are \nmade. I think we ought to remove that impediment or certainly that \ncloud of concern that small business in America is considering today.\n  I thank my friend from Virginia for his patience. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, it is an interesting discussion we are \nhaving. Actually, I think it is very important for folks to understand \nthe context of this and how important it is in our efforts--Senator \nMcCain's Senator Wyden's, mine, and others.\n  This debate is about protecting consumers from taxes, taxes that \nwould be burdensome and harmful. It is keeping, not taking necessarily, \nrevenues away from any State or local government, but making sure we \ndon't have them putting on additional taxes and costs, thereby making \naccess to the Internet, and more particularly broadband, in rural areas \nand small towns less affordable. Everyone understands that if you tax \nsomething or something has a higher cost, fewer people can afford it.\n  We are talking about bridging economic digital divides. We are \ntalking about what Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Denmark, Sweden are \ndoing, and how the U.S. is falling behind.\n  One of the reasons the Internet has grown in this country is because \nthe national policy for the last 6 years has been, don't tax it. It is \nsimple. A fourth grader will understand the basic economics that more \npeople will be able to afford something if it doesn't cost as much.\n  So the first rule of a national policy in making broadband available \nto all people everywhere in this country is don't tax it. That is \nsimple and that is the basic effort of the leadership on this issue.\n  You can talk about incentives, and the Senator from North Dakota \ntalked about incentives. I have been in favor of many of these \nincentives, and I think the Senator from Oregon has, the chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee as well. But the point is, it seems so \ncounterproductive. We are going to give incentives to companies to \ninvest hundreds of millions of dollars to get broadband high-speed \nInternet access to southwest Virginia or eastern Oregon or northern \nArizona, but we are going to have to give even greater incentives \nbecause we are going to have to offset the taxes that are going to be \nimposed on those ultimate consumers. It is illogical and \ncounterproductive to have taxes imposed on Internet access.\n  For folks who are watching at home, you may think you send e-mails \nacross this country and those messages are traveling over the Internet. \nGuess what. You are right; they are. Here is the problem with our \nopponents' proposal. By the way, I wish the folks who are on the side \nof taxing the Internet were in the Chamber. Let's vote on the \namendments. The Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, had an amendment \nyesterday. We debated it, and we voted on it.\n  We had a cloture vote, and 11 people did not want to go to this bill. \nI wish they were in this Chamber debating and advocating their ideas \nand let the Senators vote on them rather than delaying, dawdling, and \nfreezing up this bill.\n  Our opponents say e-mails are not Internet services, they are \ntelephone services because what they want to do is apply telephone \ntaxes to your Internet communications.\n  The protax view is, if you happen to choose DSL for your Internet \nservice, and you are unlucky enough to fall into one of these taxing \ngrandfathered States, then the entire network from your computer to \nyour friend's e-mail inbox on the other side of the country is taxable.\n  Telephone tax rates can run very high. Here are some examples. This \nis not a proud moment for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Richmond, VA, \n29, almost 30-percent taxes on a telephone bill in Virginia. Texas has \nhigh taxes, too, 28.5 percent. This is the top 10. Georgia is 19 \npercent. I am sure the Presiding Officer is glad to see South Carolina \nis not in the top 10. South Carolina actually ought to be applauded. \nSouth Carolina was one of the grandfathered States, allowing them to \ntax Internet access, but they said, no, it is harmful to South \nCarolina's ability to attract business, and they removed that tax, as \ndid Iowa, the District of Columbia, and Connecticut. Regardless, this \nis the amount of taxes that are put on telephone services.\n  The opponents will say they are worried about telecommunications \nmigrating. They worry about telecommunications, telephone calls, \nmigrating to the Internet with voice over IP. Senator McCain's \namendment makes sure that issue is not disposed of in this bill. The \nreality is, what they are advocating is having telephone taxes migrate \nonto your Internet access bill.\n  The Senator from North Dakota mentioned bills and how we try to \nfigure out these bills. What Senator Wyden and Senator McCain and I \nwould like to see done if we had a moratorium is have your Internet \naccess bill be the way it is now. Whatever that amount is, it is \nsimple. This chart shows your monthly bill of $23.90. If it is \nbroadband, the amount is probably going to be in the thirties or \nforties. Of course, we like to make sure there is competition whether \nit is wireless, DSL, satellite, and a variety of other areas. The \nCarper-Alexander approach would want that to be taxed.\n\n  Guess what it would look like. The Senator from North Dakota talked \nabout how can we figure out these telephone bills, as there are \nmultiple local taxes, State taxes, Federal taxes. This chart shows a \nVerizon bill. Here we have gross receipts surcharge, relay center \nsurcharge, such and such--all sorts of different taxes, Federal and \nState.\n  From the simplicity of your bill with no added taxes, taxes on \naverage 17 percent, they want to get into this situation. I say to my \nfriends and anybody watching, there was a similar debate, I suppose, \n105 years ago, in this Senate. They needed this money because we were \nin the midst of the Spanish-American War. They said: We need to put a \nluxury tax on this newfangled idea called the telephone. So a luxury \ntax was put on telephone service.\n  Guess what. Whether you are in Virginia, North Dakota, Oregon, \nHawaii, or anywhere in between in this country, Americans, well over \n100 years after that Spanish-American War, are still paying that \nSpanish-American War luxury tax on telephone service. The reason I say \nthat is it gives us an idea of how many different taxes there are, but \nalso a history lesson of how hard it is and nearly impossible to ever \nremove a tax once a tax is imposed.\n  That is why it is so important that we act on this moratorium and \nprevent new States, additional States, localities, counties, and tax \ndistricts from coming up with new taxes because if you ever try to take \nthem off, you will hear all sorts of bleating and whining: Oh, gosh, \nyou can't take it off. Again, the prime example is this Spanish-\nAmerican War tax that still is on our telephone bills. This is what \nSenator McCain, Senator Wyden, and those of us who are on the side of \nthe consumers and against taxing the Internet are advocating.\n  If you happen to choose a dial-up service, whether it is cable modem, \nor however you get your Internet access, our opponents will say you \nshould be protected from taxation from, they say, ``the last mile'' \nleading up to your house. But then say the Internet backbone still \nshould be taxable.\n  Let's examine what this means. Let's assume you live on Capitol Hill \nin Washington, DC. I know for some watching on TV that would not be an \nappealing thought. Nonetheless, let's assume you do. Let's assume you \nwanted to send an e-mail to a friend in Los Angeles, CA. Because of the \nway the Internet operates, that e-mail message\n\n[[Page S4460]]\n\nwill be broken into various packets of data sent via various routes all \nacross this country.\n  Let's say one piece of your e-mail goes from Washington, DC. It will \nprobably go into Loudoun County, VA, because there is a good server \nthere. It is going to go to Chicago, because in Chicago they have a big \nInternet hub, then to Austin, TX, then to northern California because \nthey also have a huge hub there, and then on down to southern \nCalifornia.\n  You begin to get a sense of all the jurisdictions this e-mail passes \nthrough and the chaos that will result if they, the tax proponents, \nclaim to have authority over your e-mail. Obviously, DC and Virginia \nwould have an opportunity to tax it, or maybe Loudoun County would tax \nit, going through parts of Ohio and Indiana, through Missouri, \nArkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and probably, if you are assuming all these \nare direct lines, it may, for all you know, go on up to Idaho and \nOregon. Regardless, all of those would claim jurisdiction and authority \nover that e-mail.\n  This is a classic example of interstate commerce. Our Founders had a \nconcern about multiple burdens imposed by multiple governments and that \nis why our Founders put the Commerce clause in the Constitution giving \nCongress, not unelected bureaucrats, the authority and responsibility \nto make sure interstate commerce and the interests of all of the people \nare defended against potentially harmful burdens imposed by State and \nlocal governments to taxation.\n  Now, according to our opponents, the folks who are advocating taxing \nthe backbone, which of the jurisdictions would be free from taxation on \nthis Internet backbone? None. None would be prohibited. All would be \nfree to tax interstate communications. Every single State, every single \ncity, county, town, and municipality on this red line would have \nauthority to tax; not just DC, not just Illinois, not just Texas, not \njust California, but all of them.\n  Remember, our opponents have promised everyone tax freedom for the \nso-called last mile, which is the last mile right here, which means \npeople may enjoy no taxation on the last mile so they will have tax \nfreedom there, but they have 3,000 miles of taxes if the Alexander-\nCarper proposal is successful. I do not know if that sounds like an \nInternet tax moratorium to my colleagues. It certainly does not to me, \nbecause State and local governments, while they cannot tax the very \nbeginning or the very end of an electronic connection, can tax \neverywhere in between. They can tax from the end of the beginning to \nthe middle to the end of the end before you get to the final end. The \npoint is, they can tax every other part of this 3,000-mile electronic \njourney.\n  The Alexander-Carper alternative would allow for taxes on the \nInternet backbone services in all 50 States and in every local taxing \njurisdiction, plus taxes directly will be on the consumer in more than \n20 States. The Alexander-Carper amendment would create a nightmare \nscenario our Founders sought to avoid when they wrote the Commerce \nclause of our Constitution where every town and State would tax \ncommercial traffic moving through its borders.\n  We have 7,600 taxing jurisdictions in the United States. Not a single \none of those 7,600 taxing jurisdictions would be prohibited from taxing \nthe Internet backbone under the Alexander-Carper proposal. In fact, the \nbill makes clear America's 7,600 taxing authorities can tax e-mail in \nevery jurisdiction in America as long as they present the bill to the \nInternet service provider instead of directly to the customer. In the \n20 to 30 States, depending on interpretations of the new grandfather \nclauses, they can tax the consumer directly.\n  Figure what is going to happen. If there is a 17-percent tax on this, \nwho knows, Ohio might have the 17-percent tax, Illinois would have a \n12-percent tax, Texas would have 25 percent, New Mexico 12, Arizona, \nunder the great influence of the senior Senator from Arizona, would \nhave 1 percent, Nevada being a very free State in many respects, and \nlibertarian, would have zero. Then we get to California and San \nFrancisco which would have a high tax, say 28 percent, and then as it \ngets to Los Angeles, it is back to 17-percent tax.\n  The point is, every single one of these would be able to tax it. So \nthe opponents will say we ought to be able to tax this, but if one \ntakes an airplane from Dulles Airport to Long Beach, say they flew Jet \nBlue from Dulles Airport to Long Beach, the Federal Government says a \nperson is not going to be taxed as they fly over the country, but that \nelectronic message will be taxed if the Alexander-Carper amendment \npasses.\n\n  Indeed, if we want to use that analogy going from Dulles Airport in \nnorthern Virginia to Long Beach, CA, the Federal Government recognized \nthat is interstate commerce. Decades ago, the Federal Government said \nyou cannot tax not only when you fly over a State but you cannot tax as \nyou are leaving and you cannot tax those passengers at their \ndestination when they arrive, either.\n  I ask my colleagues to say no to 3,000 miles of taxes, and say yes to \na true and accurate Internet tax moratorium.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask my colleagues to act. I ask those who have \namendments to go forward with their amendments, let us debate them, let \nus decide today so we are not delayed, frozen up as it happens from \ntime to time in the Senate with not enough time tomorrow night because \nfolks are scattering to go to various events and political functions.\n  Yes, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I agree with the last statement. I think \nwe ought to proceed and vote on issues that are before us. I would like \nto get to the conclusion of the bill, so I support that.\n  Looking at the Senator's chart and listening to his discussion, we \nare not so far apart on all of this. I do not disagree with that which \nhe has said with respect to much of his desire to prevent institutions \nof Government from coming in and taking pieces of this and taxing it, \nbut I used an example last year I want to use again to describe my need \nto understand exactly what will be covered by the moratorium.\n  For example, if we decided to exempt from taxation a loaf of bread \nbecause we decided bread is important to life and we do not believe \nbread ever ought to be taxed, so we want to exempt a loaf of bread, we \ncould have a moratorium on the taxation of a loaf of bread forever. The \nquestion will be, does that extend then to the grocery store that buys \nthe shelf to display the bread, because they are probably going to have \nto pay a use tax to the company they buy the shelf from, and that use \ntax goes to the State and local government. They are going to make the \ncase there is a moratorium on the taxation of bread. We actually pay a \ntax on the shelves we are purchasing and that has to be passed along in \nthe price of bread so we believe the purchase of the shelves ought to \nbe tax exempt as part of this moratorium.\n  I am asking that question only to try to understand what the \nmoratorium refers to with respect to the electronic transmission. The \nelectronic transmission the Senator describes I understand should be \nexempt. The question is, if that facility in Los Angeles the Senator \ndescribes, or southern California, which is a facility that is an \nInternet hub and reroutes the e-mail that is moving along the system, \nif they are purchasing desks and things in that facility for the \npurpose of furthering this Internet transmission, should they be \nexempt? Will they be exempt? Is that what the Senator intends with this \ndefinition?\n  I think as soon as we fully understand all of this definition issue \nthat is being raised, the sooner we can move forward and construct an \nappropriate moratorium, which I will support. So I ask those questions \nof the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his question. We \nare not talking about a loaf of bread, and if we were talking about a \nloaf of bread we would have a lot of people saying, gee, we rely on all \nthe taxes. If one looks at the cost of a loaf of bread--and I know the \nwheat farmers in North Dakota say, Here is the price I get for wheat \nand think of what\n\n[[Page S4461]]\n\nthe cost of it is, it is 3 cents out of the loaf of bread, and by the \ntime everyone else does different things in packaging and transport, \nthere are all sorts of taxes on it, and it ends up being who knows \nwhat, $1.50 for a loaf of bread, or maybe 79 cents if one is lucky and \nit is a few weeks old. Regardless, all of those component parts \nincrease the cost of the loaf of bread to someone who wants to put \npeanut butter and jam on a sandwich for their young son or daughter \ngoing to school.\n  So that economic argument applies to why we do not want to have a lot \nof taxes in between. The simple answer is we do not want the bandwidth \nbeing taxed. Internet service providers have desks. Internet service \nproviders have a physical facility that is subject to property taxes \nand they have personal property taxes on some of the accessories in \nthat building. They have to pay the corporate taxes as that \ncorporation. If they are an Internet service provider, if they have an \nincome, they have to pay a tax in that particular State. The point is, \nthough, that for the bandwidth, the actual transport, that should not \nbe taxed.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I also recognize that while we \ndo not necessarily agree on this issue at this moment, I do appreciate \nthat at least when we wanted to proceed to this measure you voted to \nproceed, unlike the 11 who wanted to continue to freeze it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further for a question, I think \nI understand a bit more. I think I would want to see a greater \nrefinement of it. If the Senator is now saying the definition that he \nbelieves is appropriate for this moratorium deals with the bandwidth or \nthe spectrum that is used--essentially the bandwidth that moves that \npacket of ones and zeros across the country in the form of an e-mail, \nbut he is not talking about things other than that--is that correct?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Right. There were a great deal of concerns, I think the \nSenator from North Dakota might recollect, in the Commerce Committee \nabout what was exempt or what was prohibited from taxation or what did \nthe moratorium prohibit taxation upon. There were many concerns. They \nwere generally handled, in my view, adequately by the managers' \namendment that Senator McCain had, that came out of the Finance \nCommittee. That made sure what was to be taxable and what was not \ntaxable because there were concerns that somehow personal property \ntaxes, real estate taxes, corporate taxes, income taxes, and so forth, \nwould be prohibited on companies that are involved in providing \nInternet service.\n  Our concern is making sure that whomever your Internet service \nprovider is in Washington, DC, when you get to, say, Los Angeles and \nthere is a slew of other Internet service providers there with a lot of \ncompetition, in between they don't own all of this. Somebody has to get \nthis routed electronically. So that routing of that electronic e-mail, \nso to speak, or those bits, should not be taxed.\n  It is looking at this message as being a car, an automobile. You \ncould drive across this whole country on an interstate that is a \nfreeway. The Alexander-Carper amendment would turn that into a toll \nroad. So you wouldn't go this way unless you were lost or taking some \nscenic route. But if you were driving from Virginia to Tennessee, you \nwould take Interstate 40 probably, across 81, but you can probably \ndrive that whole route, as I have and others have, and not pay a toll.\n  But if you have the Alexander-Carper amendment, that turns this whole \nthing into something akin to the New Jersey Turnpike, a toll road. \nObviously, once you get there it is going to cost you a whole lot more \nto get that packet, that automobile, from Washington, DC, to Los \nAngeles.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his interest, his probing \nquestions that allowed me to clarify what we are trying to do.\n  I conclude by saying to the opponents, come forward; let's get \nmoving; let's get acting. I think it is vitally important to protect \nconsumers from these taxes. I think it is vitally important to those \nwho are looking to invest in rural areas that they know what the \npolicies of this country are, to recognize in what kind of market they \nmight be in small towns and rural areas, and let's get about expanding \neconomic opportunity, jobs, and prosperity for all Americans everywhere \nin this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak up to 12 \nminutes as in morning time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Miller pertaining to the introduction of S.J. \nRes. 35 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am prompted to comment on the \ninteresting, provocative, and controversial comments by my colleague \nfrom Georgia. He knows I have long respected him and was pleased when \nhe arrived here in the Senate. I have enjoyed working with him. But I \nmust say I don't have quite so hopeless a notion about our country or \nits future. I don't despair about what is happening in this country. I \nthink we have incredible challenges to meet, and we must. We have a big \nglobe with 6 billion people on it. One-half of them have never made a \ntelephone call. One-half of them live on less than $2 a day. One \nhundred fifty million kids are not in school. One and one-half billion \npeople don't have access to clean, potable water. Somehow, in this big \nchallenging Earth of ours, we ended up right here right now. What a \nremarkable thing for us. It is our time and our responsibility to \nnurture and protect this democracy of ours. There is no other democracy \nlike it on the face of this Earth. At a time when our country faces \nchallenges, this country somehow provides leadership.\n  The McCullough book about John Adams is interesting to me. John Adams \ntraveled a lot, because he represented this new country they were \ntrying to put together, both in England and in France. He represented \nour interests, and he would write back to Abigail. As he would write to \nAbigail, he would lament in his letters to her: Who will provide \nleadership to put this country of ours together? Where will leaders \ncome from? Who will be leaders?\n  Then he would plaintively say in his letter: There is only us. There \nis just only us. There is me. There is Jefferson. There is George \nWashington. There is Ben Franklin. There is Mason. There is Madison. \nThere is only us.\n  In the rearview mirror of history, the ``only us'' represents some of \nthe greatest talent ever gathered on the face of this Earth.\n  Thomas Jefferson: Have we seen another? I don't think so. George \nWashington was a remarkable person.\n  So the questions John Adams asked--where will leadership come from, \nwho will be the leaders--have been asked of every generation. Somehow, \nthrough time, this country has been blessed by leaders who stepped \nforward and said, Let it be me. Let it be us. This country has been \nblessed with remarkable leadership.\n  You can take over 200 years a period of 5 years or 10 years in which \nyou can suggest perhaps the leadership was less than it should have \nbeen at that time. But somehow the calling of this great democracy to \nordinary Americans who have the capability to do extraordinary things \nhas produced that leadership. It will, in my judgment, again also \nstrengthen and nurture our country.\n  I like the original thinking of those who wrote our Constitution. I \nlove the Constitution. I think it is one of the greatest documents ever \nwritten which establishes the basis of our freedom--we the people. We \nhave people here who think it is a rough draft. I think we are going to \nvote on three amendments to the Constitution in next couple of months \nin the Senate. It has only been amended 17 times in 2 centuries. Do you \nknow why? Because there are not many people who can improve upon the \nwork of George Washington, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson's \ncontribution to the Bill of Rights, for example. Outside of the 10 \namendments called the Bill of Rights, we have amended the Constitution \nonly 17 times in 200 years. Yet we will, I guess, vote on three of them \nhere in just a matter of time because people think it is a rough draft \nand something that is easily changed and easily improved.\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\n  It is the case I think which perhaps causes some of the despair in \nsome quarters in this country, that there is a kind of a crescendo of \nnoise from corners of America that aren't very appealing.\n  I can tell a story which describes a country in great trouble. I can \ntell that story easily. We have roughly 10 million Americans who do not \nhave a job today. They desperately want a job and their country's \neconomy hasn't provided them a job. There are 10 million people who are \nout of work, and 30 million to 40 million people are on food stamps. We \nare the murder capital of the world. We consume one-half the world's \ncocaine. What an ugly place. Or I can take up some person's \ndysfunctional behavior and hold it up to a light, and say, Isn't this \nugly, and run it through about 10 talk show programs and have it on \nevery morning show, and say, Isn't this ugly? Yes, it is ugly, but it \nis not America. It is not America. It is somebody's ability and desire \nto try to entertain people with someone else's dysfunctional behavior. \nI can give that speech and I hear it from time to time.\n\n  However, there is another side to this country that gives me cause \nfor great hope and does not lead me to the conclusion that we ought to \ntake away the right of the American people to vote for public \nofficials. Let me describe that, if I might.\n  There was a man named Stanley Newberg who died in New York City. \nStanley Newberg is someone I did not know. I saw a paragraph, maybe two \nparagraphs about him in the New York Times. It simply said this man had \ndied and then described something he had done. I asked my staff if we \ncould find out a little more about him. Let me tell you about Stanley \nNewberg.\n  He came to America with nothing, to escape the persecution of the \nJews by Nazis. His dad had nothing. He began to peddle fish on the \nLower East Side of New York. Stanley, beside his dad, walked along the \nLower East Side peddling fish in New York City. They made some money \nand did fairly well.\n  Stanley went to school, went to college. He got his college degree \nand went to work for an aluminum company. He did so well he rose up to \nmanage the company. He did so well managing, he decided to buy the \ncompany. He did very well, and then later he died. When Stanley died \nthey opened his will. In his will, this man left $5.7 million, his \nestate, to the United States of America. He said: With gratitude for \nthe privilege of living in this great country, with gratitude for the \nprivilege of living in this great country of ours. I thought, what a \nwonderful thing, to understand what others see.\n  If we did not have immigration laws, this place would be full, just \nplain full. We have folks from all around the world who want to come \nand live in this country. Why? It is a beacon of hope and opportunity.\n  We survived the Civil War. We beat back a depression. We beat back \nthe oppression of nazism and defeated Adolph Hitler. We have done so \nmuch. We built the atom. We spliced genes. We invented the silicon \nchip, plastics, radar, the telephone computer, the television set. We \nbuild airplanes; we fly them; we build rockets; we go to the moon; and \nwe are hardly out of breath. We cure smallpox. We cure polio. What a \nremarkable place this is. We have two little vehicles crawling around \nthe surface of Mars analyzing rocks. Isn't that something? I must say, \nthe pictures they got look very much like a place 5 miles south of my \nhometown, but apparently this is high science and pretty remarkable. \nThis is really a very special place.\n  Is it the case that we face some pretty big, daunting challenges? You \nbet your life we do. We have a fiscal policy that is way out of whack. \nA few years ago everyone thought we would have surpluses forever. Now \nit looks like we will have deficits forever. We have to fix that. We \ncannot leave that to somebody else. That is our job. That is on our \nshoulders. This President and this Congress need to fix that.\n  Iraq, Afghanistan--this country represents the beacon of opportunity \nand freedom around the world. We are involved. We got involved in \nAfghanistan because we are tracking al-Qaida and dealing with people \nwho killed innocent Americans, and we need to deal with that. We \nhave American troops there, fighting and dying. We do not have a lot of \noptions. We have to prevail and persevere and support those troops. We \nwill. This is not the darkest of hours for our country. This is a \ngreat, strong, resilient country--within my judgment, a foundation of \ngoodness people around the world understand. For a long, long time, if \nanything happens around the world, who is there first? Which country \ncan be looked to to provide help, to say, you are not alone? This \ncountry. This country tackles issues other countries do not even want \nto acknowledge.\n\n  We had women chaining themselves to the White House gate because they \nwere not allowed the right to vote. They said: We demand the right to \nvote. We dealt with that issue. The list is endless. We grapple with \nthem. It is not easy. But we are the example of representative self-\ngovernment in this world that works. It is messy. The noise of \ndemocracy is annoying sometimes, but it works.\n  Going back to John Adams' lament to Abigail: where is the leadership, \nin my judgment, every generation of Americans has seen leadership \nemerge and develop to lead this great country in times of trouble. That \nwill always be the case because this is a special country, and we do \nhave people who are willing and able. Right now, there is someone \nrunning for the Senate someplace in this country whose name I perhaps \ndo not know who likely will be a President some day. Why? Because they \nhave a passion in their heart and their gut to serve this country and \nwant to do right by this country.\n  Let me come back to where I started. The only reason I was provoked \nto say these things is my colleague gave a speech this morning about \nsomething which, as I sat and listened to it--look, I have great \nrespect for my colleague from Georgia. His public service is \nextraordinary. I first knew about him when he was Governor of Georgia \nand he was talking about scholarships for kids. I thought, what a great \nidea. Our future is not people who wear dark suits and suspenders who \nsome people consider windbags in the Senate; our future is kids. That \nis who will run this country. I have great respect for the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  I wanted to say this: At a time when there is so much lament about \nAmerica, I have a great reservoir of hope for the future of this \ncountry. This country will prevail. I know, as I have traveled around \nparts of the world, one example comes to mind. I was on an Army \nhelicopter once that ran out of gas. I learned one of the immutable \nlaws of flying: When you are out of gas in a flying machine, you will \nland soon. We landed in an area between Nicaragua and Honduras. I was \nwith two other Members of Congress. When we landed, we were out of \ncontact with anybody else. We landed in a clearing in kind of a jungle \narea between Nicaragua and Honduras, and campesinos from all around \ncame to the helicopter. We were waiting to get rescued. We got rescued \nin 4 or 5 hours. The campesinos had come up and I got to talking to \nsome people who had never seen anyone from our country. I was asking \nquestions. We had an interpreter with us.\n  Do you know what all of them said they would like to do? They would \nlike to come to the United States of America--all of them. We asked, \nWhat would you like? I would like to come to the United States of \nAmerica. I would like that for me, for my kids. We find that all over \nthe world. Why? Because they see this country as something unusual on \nthe face of this Earth, something very unusual. That did not happen \njust by accident.\n\n  I come to this Senate floor not because I have a political pedigree \nor because I come from a big reservoir of wealth; I come here because a \nNorwegian immigrant came to this country with her husband, and her \nhusband had a heart attack shortly thereafter. She was left alone with \nsix kids. She took her six kids to a small rural area in southwestern \nNorth Dakota and started a farm. She pitched a tent, she built a house, \nraised a family, and ran a family farm in Hettinger County, ND. She had \na son who had a daughter who had me. That is how I got here. And \nvirtually everyone here has a similar story about perseverance, \nstrength, faith, and hope--almost always about hope.\n  Let me conclude by saying while we face many challenges, I have great \nhope that, yes, the talents of the Senator from Georgia--unique \ntalents, extraordinary talents--and the talents of\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\nso many others with whom I have had the ability to serve in this \nChamber and in the House of Representatives, and also other venues of \npublic service in this country, give this country a better opportunity \nfor a better future.\n  I have had several other opportunities to work in different \nenvironments. I don't know that I have ever worked with a more talented \ngroup of people than the men and women, Republicans and Democrats, with \nwhom I have served in the Senate. They are extraordinary people who \ncome to the call for public service. I salute them and say I have great \nreservoir of hope for the future of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I was watching the debate earlier that \ndealt with the Internet tax, and I felt it important to explain clearly \nwhere Senators Alexander, Voinovich, Enzi, Senator Dorgan, and I are on \nthis issue.\n  Before I do that, I am compelled to comment on a bit of what Senator \nDorgan has said. I missed most of my colleague Zell Miller's comments, \nbut I heard all of what Senator Dorgan said. I am one of those guys who \nare probably like him, who see this glass as almost full; but even if \nit were almost empty, I tend to see it as half full.\n  We were here about a week or so ago debating what to do with respect \nto the situation we face in this country with asbestos. We all heard \nthe stories that there are people who are sick and dying from asbestos \nexposure and not getting the help they need. There are folks who may \nhave been exposed to asbestos, and they are taking away money from the \nfolks who ought to be getting it, who are sick and dying.\n  In the meantime, in the settlements that are taking place, in \nrelation to the transaction costs, the legal fees, maybe half the \nsettlements go for legal fees. That is a situation we face. It is not a \ngood situation. We all know we ought to do something about it. The \ntough thing is trying to figure out what.\n  We have the insurance industry in one corner, the manufacturers and \nthe defendants in another corner, the trial bar in another corner, and \norganized labor, which is a proxy for victims, in yet another corner.\n  Last week, we voted not to proceed to the bill that Senator Frist had \nintroduced. Some of us thought it was premature, given the negotiations \nthat have been underway for the last couple months, trying to narrow \nour differences on asbestos litigation reform. As a result, I think 47 \nof us voted not to proceed to the bill. We did not proceed to the bill.\n  But a very good thing has happened subsequent to that. The very good \nthing is, the negotiations, the mediation led by a retired Federal \njudge from Pennsylvania, a fellow named Becker, who had been the chief \njudge of the Third Circuit for a number of years, now retired, in his \nseventies, a fellow whose health is apparently not good. I probably \nshould not say this. He takes chemotherapy, so I think his health is \nnot good. But he is in his seventies and an age where he is retired and \nhe does not have to work. But he has been drawn, by Senator Specter, \ninto trying to mediate the differences between organized labor and the \ntrial bar and the insurance companies and the defendant companies to \nsee if we cannot come up with a better way to make sure people who are \nsick and dying from asbestos exposure get the help they need, and to \nmake sure people who are not sick but have been exposed--but they get \nsick--that we help them, too; and for folks who are not sick, who have \nexposure, to make sure they get their medical costs paid and try to \nreduce outlays from the settlements that occur so the money goes to the \npeople who need the help, not necessarily to their attorneys.\n  Judge Becker is here today in Washington. He lives in Pennsylvania, \nbut he is here today. He was here yesterday. He was here the day \nbefore. He is leading a mediation that has been anointed, embraced by \nour leaders--Bill Frist on the Republican side, the majority leader, \nand Tom Daschle on our side, the Democratic leader.\n  As I speak right now, Judge Becker is holding forth, meeting, \nlistening, asking questions, probing, trying to move the disparate \nforces to a consensus. I joined him for a little while over in the Hart \nBuilding earlier today and said to Judge Becker: My job, I get paid to \ntry to build a consensus on difficult issues. That is part of what we \ndo in the Senate.\n  That is not Judge Becker's job. He is retired. He ought to be \nsomewhere taking life easier, and yet he is here. He paid his way down \non the train today. He did the same thing yesterday. He pays for his \nown meals, his own lodging. He does it out of the goodness of his heart \nbecause he thinks it needs to be done.\n\n  I raise that just to say that every day, in some corner of this \nCapitol, somebody is trying to make this place work. In this case, it \nis Judge Becker. There are other people of good will who are in that \nroom with him trying to get through a tough patch and to help us find a \nway to a more rational, logical, fair way to help people who have been \nexposed to asbestos.\n  We voted last week not to go to the bill. I know some people were not \nhappy with that vote, but we simply believed it was not time to go to \nthe bill, given this mediation process. We urged our leaders to embrace \nthat process, and they have done that. I am encouraged--out of that \nembracing of that mediation process, and the infusion of leadership \nauthority to it--that something good will come of these negotiations.\n  Mr. President, we will have an opportunity to vote tomorrow on \nproceeding to the McCain amendment. Senator McCain has sought to find a \ncompromise on the Internet tax legislation.\n  Let me back up for a moment and talk about it, if I can. When Senator \nVoinovich and I were Governors of our respective States, we worked with \nthe Congress--House and Senate Democrats and Republicans--and \nencouraged then-President Clinton to sign legislation that said the \nFederal Government ought not tell the States to spend money on \nsomething and not provide that money. The Federal Government should not \nundercut the revenue base of State and local governments without making \nup the difference.\n  In 1998, the Congress passed a little bitty unfunded mandate that \nsaid States could not tax access to the Internet. If you were already \ndoing it, you could continue to derive your tax, if you are a State or \nlocal government, and tax access to the Internet. But the States could \nnot have multiple taxes; they could not have discriminatory taxes on \nthe Internet. That was the legislation passed in 1998 and extended in \n2001, and that moratorium lapsed last fall, as we know.\n  Since that time, States have not jumped in to pass new taxes on \naccess to the Internet. They have not passed discriminatory taxes or \nmultiple taxes with respect to the Internet. They have been sort of \nsitting back biding their time, waiting to see what we would do.\n  I think there are four areas of contention that exist with respect to \nthe proposal that Senator McCain has offered. One is the definition of \nwhat is tax exempt under any moratorium we negotiate. On our side, \nSenators Alexander, Voinovich, Enzi, myself, and others believe the \nexisting moratorium actually nails it pretty well, and the idea that \nfolks should not have to pay a tax on accessing the Internet on their \nAOL bills, if you will. Whether they access their e-mail, their \nInternet by cable, by DSL, or by wireless, we think folks should not \nhave to pay that kind of tax.\n\n  We do not believe folks should have to pay multiple taxes by \ndifferent levels of government on the Internet. We believe there should \nnot be discriminatory taxes on purchases, for example, that are made \nover the Internet.\n  But we have a clear difference of opinion with respect to defining \nwhat is to be tax exempt--free from taxation--by State and local \ngovernments. Our friends on the other side are interested in doing a \nwhole lot more than stopping access fees that we pay as consumers. We \ndon't want anybody to pay those either.\n  They want to go well beyond the moratorium against multiple fees on \nuse of the Internet. They want to go beyond discriminatory taxes. What \nthey want to do, really, is take away from States and local governments \nthe ability, if States want to, to impose business-to-business \ntransaction taxes that might involve the Internet. I am not interested \nin taxing those as a Federal legislator, but I don't know that it\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\nis our part, as Federal legislators, to say to State and local \ngovernments that they can't do that unless we are willing to make up \nthe revenue shortfall that may come as a result.\n  So the four areas of difference: One is the definition of what is tax \nexempt under the moratorium we adopt. A second area of difference that \nwe have is with respect to the duration of the moratorium that we might \nextend. I said earlier, the first moratorium we passed was 3 years in \nduration from 1998 to 2001. At that time, Congress passed, almost \nunanimously, a further 2-year extension of that moratorium that lasted \nuntil last fall. Now that moratorium has lapsed.\n  I think we have seen suggestions in S. 150, introduced by Senator \nAllen and Senator Wyden, that they wanted to make the moratorium \npermanent, an extension of the moratorium not 2 years, not 3 years, but \nto make it permanent. They define very broadly what is to be exempt \nfrom taxation under that permanent moratorium, even if it cuts into the \nrevenue bases of State and local governments, and even if we do not \nmake up the shortfall they may then face. So the second area of \ncontention is the duration of the moratorium.\n  The third area of contention deals with whether we should grandfather \nin the rights of State and local governments, so if they have already \nput in place some kind of tax on the Internet, our previous moratoriums \ngrandfathered them in, protected them, for a period of time, from \nlosing those revenues. It held them harmless, if you will. And the \nquestion is, if we go forward and we have a grandfather clause to \nprotect the States that already have imposed some kind of tax measure, \nhow long do we extend that grandfather clause for those State and local \ngovernments that are going to be deprived of revenues they currently \ncollect, and that we are not prepared to make up?\n  The suggestion has come forward, in Senator McCain's proposal earlier \nthis week--maybe yesterday--that there should be a grandfather clause \nto hold the States harmless for a while but not for as long as the \nduration of the moratorium. And that is problematic.\n  The fourth area of contention deals with the application of the \nmoratorium to what I would describe as traditional taxable voice \ncommunications, taxable by State and local governments, but the \napplication of the moratorium to those traditional taxable voice \ncommunications when those communications are routed over the Internet. \nIt is called VOIP.\n  Is it possible to bridge our differences on those four areas? It may \nor may not be. But having clearly defined them, our side is certainly \nwilling to discuss them with those who have a different view of these \nissues than we do. One thing we all agree on is, whatever we do, we \nshould try to hold the States harmless.\n  Somewhere in my talking points today, I have a discussion of why it \nis important that we hold the States harmless. If I can just take a \nminute or 2, I want to share part of this.\n  Our States are clearly facing extremely difficult times. We all know \nthat. States have cut services and raised taxes over the last 3 years \nas they have scrambled to fill a budget shortfall that approaches $250 \nbillion. Many States still face significant revenue shortfalls. \nCalifornia alone must fill an estimated $16 billion shortfall. New York \nfaces a $4 billion shortfall. Both Michigan and Florida still have \nprojected deficits of $1 billion. Some States are being forced to make \ncuts that are not only painful and unpopular but which ultimately \nundermine our efforts as part of welfare reform to make work pay. Some \n34 States have adopted cuts that are causing anywhere from 1.2 million \nto 1.6 million low-income people to lose their health insurance. \nAlabama, Colorado, Maryland, Montana, and Utah have all stopped \nenrolling children in their children's health insurance programs. \nFlorida has done the same and has built up a waiting list of more than \n10,000 children.\n  Meanwhile, Connecticut is cutting coverage for more than 20,000 \nparents, and Georgia is cutting coverage for 20,000 pregnant women and \nchildren. In Texas, the State is actually ending coverage entirely for \nnearly 160,000 children and working families.\n  Besides health care, childcare is also on the chopping block. Some 23 \nStates have cut back on childcare for working families. Florida, for \nexample, has more than 48,000 children on a waiting list for childcare. \nUnder the State's formula they are actually eligible, but they are not \nable to get it given the State's fiscal challenges. Reducing the \nwaiting list is not even an option. I am told the budget in Florida is \nmoving through the statehouse and they have cut childcare even more, by \nanother $40 million.\n  Tennessee faces similar cuts. Tennessee has begun declining \napplications for childcare from all families who are not actually \nreceiving welfare payments.\n  Altogether, in about half of all States, low-income families who are \neligible for or in need of childcare assistance are either not allowed \nto apply or are placed on waiting lists. In California alone, over a \nquarter of a million kids, 280,000 children, are on waiting lists in \nthat one State.\n  I won't go on. The point I am trying to make is just a reminder. \nStates face terribly difficult choices these days, whether it is health \ncare, childcare, size of the classrooms, or the ability to hire \nteachers and to pay them what they need to attract good math and \nscience teachers. States are in a bind. I was Governor in the good \nyears, from 1993 to 2001, when we were rolling in money. The States are \nnot rolling in money anymore.\n\n  The father of the Presiding Officer is Governor. He will tell us they \nare not rolling in money up in Alaska any more than they are in \nCalifornia.\n  If States were rolling in money, Senator Alexander and myself, \nSenators Voinovich, Enzi, Hutchison, and others would not be making \nthis big fuss over what we believe is an unfunded mandate for State and \nlocal governments that is represented by S. 150 and, we believe, by the \nalternative offered by Senator McCain. If the States were rolling in \nmoney, we wouldn't be doing this. If we were providing some kind of \noffset to the revenues that State and local governments would lose, we \nwouldn't be making a big fight about it either. If States could be held \nharmless, we could probably work our way through this. Maybe we ought \nto. I believe we should.\n  One thing I know for sure, there is agreement to extend the \nmoratorium. I think if we were to vote on a simple 2-year extension of \nthe moratorium that expired last November, there would probably be \nvotes to pass that.\n  I am concerned about the vote on cloture tomorrow on the McCain \nproposal. I urge my colleagues not to vote for it. Last week I urged my \ncolleagues not to vote to proceed to the bill on asbestos that Senator \nFrist had introduced, not because I was not interested in getting a \nconclusion or consensus. I believed that by not bringing the bill to \nthe floor, it actually increased the likelihood that we are going to \nget consensus on asbestos litigation reform. We are moving in that \ndirection, and I am encouraged that we are on the right track.\n  I believe if we go to the McCain bill tomorrow, we would be acting \nprematurely. There are still negotiations that can take place and \nshould take place around the four elements I discussed. If we are \nforced to take up the bill at that point in time, we foreclose what \ncould come out of those discussions, some of which have borne fruit \nalready, some which still could.\n  There are a number of Senators on my side who want to offer \namendments of their own. It is ironic. We have on the one hand people \non the other side of this issue--from Senators Alexander, Voinovich, \nEnzi, and myself--who contend that they want to support the telecom \nindustry. I believe in their hearts they want to promote the industry. \nIt is a good industry with good people. But there are also folks on our \nside and on the Republican side who have a whole bunch of ideas they \nwould like to present and to offer as amendments. I will mention a few \nthat might be appropriate.\n  If we want to help the industry build a market broadband network, \nthere are any number of viable options. Senator Hollings has introduced \nlegislation, with a number of cosponsors, that would provide block \ngrants to support State and local broadband initiatives.\n  Senator Dorgan, the floor manager on our side, has legislation to \nmake\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\nlow-interest loans available to countries who would deploy broadband \ntechnology in rural areas. Senator Rockefeller has introduced \nlegislation, with 65 cosponsors, to provide tax credits for companies \ninvesting in broadband equipment. Senator Burns of Montana has \nlegislation that would allow the expensing of broadband equipment. \nSenator Boxer has legislation that allocates the additional spectrum \nfor unlicensed use by wireless broadband devices. Senator Clinton and \nothers have legislation.\n\n  To the extent that we vote for cloture tomorrow on the McCain \nproposal, many, if not all, of these proposals will not be made in \norder, even though they are germane and they relate to the issue. These \namendments and, frankly, a lot of others like them could not be \noffered.\n  I am not suggesting that all of them should be offered, but some of \nthem should. Members who have a strong interest and have worked on the \nissues for a long time deserve that right. They believe strongly.\n  As my collegues think about tomorrow's cloture votes, I realize this \nbill has gotten off track. What somehow started off as an Internet tax \nbill and figuring out how we can extend the moratorium and then paying \na user fee for access to the Internet got off on another side rail on \nenergy policy, ethanol, and a number of other things. I think Senator \nDomenici has introduced as an amendment the entire Energy bill. \nEventually, I hope we will work our way through that. In the meantime, \nI hope we will use the hours ahead and maybe the next couple of days to \njoin in a negotiation with our colleagues on the other side of this \nissue and try, maybe one last time, to see if there is someplace in \nbetween where we are and where they are.\n  In the end, if there is a push for the approach Senator Alexander and \nI introduced, which is the straight-ahead, 2-year extension of the \nmoratorium, to make sure it is not biased against DSL, we can just have \nthat vote. We are not there yet. We have about 24 hours to consider it, \nand maybe cooler heads will prevail. If it comes to it, I will vote \nagainst cloture, not because I am not interested in finding a \nsolution--I think we can. The time just may not be right. It could be \nclose.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask the Chair to make an inquiry to the \nleadership as to whether it would be appropriate for us to recess at \nabout 2:55 until about 4:05. The Secretary of Defense will be here. \nWith the parliamentary situation we find ourselves in on the Senate \nfloor, it would be appreciated if the Chair would check that out \nthrough the leadership.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I would like to take a little time \nthis afternoon to talk about one of the pending amendments. This would \nbe the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico regarding energy. It \nhas been said on this floor and in the committees in which I have been \nparticipating, and no doubt it is going to be said again: At a time \nwhen the American economy is suffering under the weight of high energy \nprices such as the steadily increasing natural gas prices, record high \ngasoline prices as we go into the summer months, and tight \ninternational oil markets resulting in rising crude oil prices, it is \ntime that the Congress act on issues as they relate to energy with a \ncomprehensive national energy policy.\n  I am pleased the Senate is reconsidering this vital national policy. \nI commend Chairman Domenici for his leadership on this issue. The \nSenator from New Mexico has shown a great deal of willingness to find \nthe middle ground on many of these issues addressed in the amendment. I \nbelieve we should work with him to enact this comprehensive energy \nlegislation.\n  There are several different components to the amendment. Certainly \nthe one I happen to focus on most, coming from Alaska, is that area \nwhich will help facilitate the construction of an Alaska natural gas \npipeline. Construction of this pipeline means a great deal to the \npeople in my State. It means not only jobs for Alaskans, but it means \nenergy, natural gas, to my State.\n  But we have to look beyond just what it can provide to Alaska. The \nconstruction of a natural gas pipeline will create thousands of jobs \nthroughout the United States and bring a much needed new supply of \ndomestically produced natural gas to our starved lower 48 markets.\n  We have seen in the news recently the suggestion, coming from Mr. \nGreenspan, that the future, if you will, is in imported LNG. Once \nagain, it is the emphasis that we should place in the national energy \npolicy on domestic sources of energy. We have those domestic reserves \nin Alaska, as it relates to natural gas. Let's take advantage of that.\n  Residential natural gas customers are paying nearly historic high \ncosts to heat their homes, to cool their homes, to keep the lights on. \nAmericans are increasingly forced to spend a substantial portion of \ntheir household income on energy costs. A reasonably priced supply of \nnatural gas will allow homeowners to devote a greater portion of their \ndisposable income to other pursuits.\n  When you think about the state of the economy and what we spend on \nenergy, the more disposable income that we have, the less we have to \nspend on energy, the stronger an economy we have.\n  But it is not just the residential customers in America who are \nsuffering from these sustained high natural gas prices. It is our \nindustrial consumers who rely on natural gas to produce the \npetrochemicals, the fertilizers, and other goods. They are losing their \nmarkets to foreign competitors who have access to less expensive \nreserves of gas. Whether I am sitting in the Energy Committee or the \nEPW, talking about what is happening across the country now, whether it \nis on our farms or whether it is AMAZON.Com not being able to produce \nthe packaging bubbles domestically because of the high price of natural \ngas, it affects all of us in all the industries.\n\n  In many instances we are hearing about the companies that are laying \noff workers, closing their factories, because they simply cannot pay \nthe current natural gas prices and remain competitive within the global \nmarketplace. The layoffs affect thousands of workers in many regions of \nthe country.\n  Look at what Alaska's natural gas can do. We are a long way from the \nrest of the 48, but with a pipeline getting our reserves of natural gas \ninto the lower 48, we can meet that supply need; we can help to reopen \nthese factories.\n  Natural gas is not only a vital feedstock for industry and home \nheating, it also serves as a major fuel for electricity production. By \nthe year 2020, the Energy Information Agency has predicted that natural \ngas will account for 32 percent of all electricity generation. When we \nthink back to the situation just last August in the Northeast, \nCalifornia's power problems 3 years ago, increasing the investment \nrequirements for our Nation's electrical grid and production capability \nwill only further the demand for natural gas as plant operators look to \nnatural gas as having lower capital costs, higher fuel efficiency, \nshorter construction lead times, and lower emissions as compared to \ntraditional coal-fired electrical plants.\n  Yet with all of these facts in front of us, recognizing that the \nresidential consumer is paying more, that the industrial consumer is \npaying more, and businesses are being closed, recognizing the future as \nit relates to electricity production, and considering the President's \nrequest, if you will, that we move to a hydrogen-based society, the \nrequest he made in his State of the Union Address last year when he \nindicated he wanted children who were born today to be driving vehicles \npowered by hydrogen--it is wonderful, but we have to have the natural \ngas to assist with all of this.\n  Despite all of Alaska's proven reserves, 35 trillion cubic feet of \nproven reserves on the North Slope with the possibility of upwards of \n100 trillion cubic feet still in the ground, we need to do all we can \nto bring that from\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\nAlaska's North Slope to the rest of the country.\n  Senator Domenici's amendment is not all about natural gas. For \nelectricity, about which many of my colleagues have spent a great deal \nof time talking on the floor, the amendment ensures reliable and \naffordable electricity for America.\n  We all recognize that we in Congress must address the issue of \nreliability. The amendment would prohibit onerous Federal manipulation \nof energy trading markets that cost consumers money, and it would \nincrease the penalties for market manipulation and enhance consumer \nprotections.\n  To those of my colleagues who have called on the Senate to address \nthe electricity issue, the reliability issue, I say support Senator \nDomenici's proposal.\n  For coal, which is used to produce 50 percent of our Nation's \nelectricity, the amendment authorizes $2 billion to fund the Clean Coal \nPower Initiative. The development of clean coal technology will help \nour Nation use its abundant coal resources in an environmentally \nresponsible manner.\n  In Alaska, we are working to find new ways to use our very abundant \nreserves while mitigating the impact on our environment. We have a \nlittle place called Healy, AK, where we have a small experimental clean \ncoal plant. This clean coal plant is currently sitting dormant. It just \nbarely missed its emissions requirement. We were attempting to utilize \nnew technology to again provide very necessary energy to an area that \nwas very limited in what it could receive and what it could generate. \nOnce the Healy clean coal plant and other clean coal technologies \ndemonstrate better ways for us to generate electricity from coal, we \ncan utilize our Nation's vast coal resources in an environmentally \nresponsible manner for many years to come, as well as provide high-\npaying jobs and much needed electricity.\n  There is also renewable energy. For renewable energy, the amendment \nreauthorizes the Renewable Energy Production Incentive Program to \npromote the use of clean renewable energy. The amendment would also \nencourage exploration and development of geothermal energy, including a \ncall for rulemaking on a new royalty structure that encourages new \nproduction.\n  I could go further in detailing all those very important matters \ncontained in the energy amendment, but I think these four examples--\nauthorizing the Alaska natural gas pipeline, improving our Nation's \nelectricity grid, providing research on clean coal technology, and \npromoting the use of clean renewable energy--illustrate the immense \nbenefits of a comprehensive energy policy. They are great, but they are \nmeaningless to us unless we enact them.\n  A comprehensive national energy policy, as envisioned in Senator \nDomenici's amendment, will generate thousands of jobs throughout the \ncountry. As I said on many occasions, the Energy bill is a jobs bill. \nSo is this amendment.\n  I commend the Senator from New Mexico for offering this amendment. I \nknow my constituents in Alaska don't care whether this bill is enacted \nas an amendment or as a stand-alone bill. My constituents want to see \nthe jobs. My constituents want to see the energy, they want to see the \nnatural gas, and they want to see movement on an energy policy. I think \nmost Americans want the same thing. They want high-paying jobs. They \nwant decreased volatility in the energy market. They want increased use \nof renewable energy and improved electricity grids. I think we have \nthat within this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues as we move forward to support the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Mexico.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, the Senator is very kind, and I thank \nthe Senator from Tennessee.\n  Madam President, I come to the floor today to inform the Senate of \nthe outstanding commitment, courage, and professionalism of our \nmilitary medical community. This morning, the Senator from Hawaii and I \ncochaired a hearing with the Surgeons General and the chiefs of the \nNursing Corps from each branch of the Armed Forces. We were joined by \nArmy Surgeon General James Peake, Navy Surgeon General Michael Cowan, \nand Air Force Surgeon General George Taylor. From the Service Nursing \nCorps, we heard from Army COL Deborah Gustke, Navy ADM Nancy Lescavage, \nand Air Force GEN Barbara Brannon.\n  I want the Senate to note and personally thank each of our witnesses \ntoday for the outstanding leadership they provided to our military \nmedical community. Their individual accomplishments are numerous.\n  I offer a special recognition to Surgeons General Peake and Cowan, \nwho will be retiring from Active Duty this year. We greatly appreciate \ntheir service in military medicine, to our Nation, and especially their \nassistance to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. The insight \nthey provided to the subcommittee is invaluable. I congratulate each \none of them on a successful and distinguished career.\n  During today's hearing, the members of the committee and I were told \nof outstanding accomplishments by our military medical leaders. I have \ncome to the Senate to share some of what we learned today with my \ncolleagues.\n  Over the last year, our thoughts have never been far from the \nbattlefields, or from the soldiers and families who have sacrificed so \nmuch for our Nation. I salute our brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines for their efforts in the war on terrorism. I join the families \nof our lost sons and daughters in mourning and remembering those who \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of freedom.\n  I have seen many headlines about the casualties of the war, but the \naccomplishments of our military doctors, nurses, and corpsmen are \nseldom mentioned. These health care professionals were among the first \nto rush to the battlefield, and they are still on the front lines \nproviding care in some of the most dangerous and difficult conditions.\n  Today our combat medics regularly perform miracles. They use \ntransformational technology to successfully expand the ``golden hour'' \nof trauma care, the critical hour of opportunity from when a trauma is \nsustained and the lives can be most often saved.\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\n  One telling statistic is the lowest ``died of wounds rate'' in \nrecorded history of warfare.\n  A number of factors have contributed to this accomplishment, but the \nmobile surgical teams have been crucial. They bring resuscitative \nsurgical care onto the battlefield. Without the care they get within \nthe ``golden hour'' after being wounded, the 15 to 20 percent of \nwounded soldiers they target would probably die while being evacuated \nto the combat support hospital.\n  These surgical teams are specially equipped to deal with excessive \nhemorrhaging, which has been the major cause of death in previous \nconflicts. One of the transformational technologies employed by these \nsurgical units is a hand-held ultrasound machine used to identify \ninternal bleeding, a truly lifesaving piece of equipment.\n  Other technologies the medics have employed include haemostatic \ndressings and the chitosen bandage. These are two new lifesaving wound \ndressings that are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Approximately 1,200 haemostatic dressings have been deployed under an \ninvestigational new drug battlefield protocol. In one account we \nlearned of today, the dressing was successfully applied to a thigh \nwound to completely control arterial bleeding when a pressure dressing \nand tourniquet proved unsuccessful. There are two similar reports of \nspecial forces medics using chitosen bandages to treat severe bleeding \ncaused by gunshot wounds to the extremities. Approximately 5,800 of \nthese chitosen bandages have been deployed to the theater of \noperations.\n  These are just a few of the examples of military medics using \nrevolutionary medical technologies to lead the way in trauma treatment, \nlead the way in saving lives. Military researchers continue to \ninvestigate numerous other cutting-edge technologies, and those efforts \nare the foundation for the future of medical health care while in the \nservice. Many of these same technologies will likely be used someday in \ncivilian trauma centers across our country.\n  Aeromedical and ground evacuation crews, operating from Blackhawk \nhelicopters, a variety of fixed-wing aircraft, and ground evacuation \nvehicles, such as the Stryker, have also performed exceptionally during \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The crews have demonstrated an \nability to swoop into a hostile environment and pull wounded service \nmembers from the battlefield. They provide critical in-flight trauma \ncare until more substantial care can be provided at fleet and field \nhospitals.\n  Military health professionals also ensure the health and safety of \nour soldiers in a number of other ways. When forces deploy around the \nglobe, environmental health professionals are on the ground surveying \nthe environment for biological and environmental threats. Among these \nmilitary health professionals are nationally recognized experts in \nchemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. Their \nexpertise ranges from medical surveillance and epidemiology to casualty \nmanagement. Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear training \nhas been incorporated into the soldiers' common skills training, \nadvanced individual training, and leadership courses.\n  Our health professionals also consider the mental health of our \ntroops to be a top priority. In July 2003, a team of mental health \nexperts from treatment facilities around the Nation left for Iraq. \nTheir mission was to assess mental health issues and address concerns \nabout a spike in the number of suicides occurring in the theater of \noperation. These professionals evaluated the mental health patient flow \nfrom theaters and assessed the stress-related issues soldiers \nexperienced in combat operations.\n\n  The survey team remained in the theater for 6 weeks and traveled to \nseveral base camps. I am told this is the first time a mental health \nassessment team has ever conducted a mental health survey with soldiers \nin an active combat environment.\n  While many of the medical providers are deployed in the support of \ncontingency operations, the military health system continues to provide \noutstanding care to service members, their families, and our retirees \nhere at home.\n  These professionals never waiver in their commitment to the highest \nquality of health care for our beneficiaries.\n  The caregivers here at home also provide rehabilitative care to our \ntroops after returning from combat. Perhaps the best example is the \namputee center at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital, which provides \nstate-of-the-art care to service members who have lost limbs in battle. \nThe center aims to return each amputee to the highest level of \nperformance and quality of life. I have personally visited with wounded \nsoldiers at the center, and I can tell you they are achieving their \ngoal.\n  I have come to the Chamber to commend our military health care \nprofessionals who have served with distinction throughout the global \nwar on terrorism. Their dedication and commitment to their fellow \nservice members is unmistakable, and their service is responsible for \nsaving countless lives, both of our American service members and \ninjured Iraqis. We are truly grateful for their service.\n  I ask the whole Senate to join me in commending the military service \nof these medical professionals who have done so much for us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Washington Post of \nApril 27, entitled ``The Lasting Wounds of War,'' by Karl Vick, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       The Lasting Wounds of War\n\n                             (By Karl Vick)\n\n       Baghdad.--The soldiers were lifted into the helicopters \n     under a moonless sky, their bandaged heads grossly swollen by \n     trauma, their forms silhouetted by the glow from the row of \n     medical monitors laid out across their bodies, from ankle to \n     neck.\n       An orange screen atop the feet registered blood pressure \n     and heart rate. The blue screen at the knees announced the \n     level of postoperative pressure on the brain. On the stomach, \n     a small gray readout recorded the level of medicine pumping \n     into the body. And the slender plastic box atop the chest \n     signaled that a respirator still breathed for the lungs under \n     it.\n       At the door to the busiest hospital in Iraq, a wiry doctor \n     bent over the worst-looking case, an Army gunner with coarse \n     stitches holding his scalp together and a bolt protruding \n     from the top of his head. Lt. Col. Jeff Poffenbarger checked \n     a number on the blue screen, announced it dangerously high \n     and quickly pushed a clear liquid through a syringe into the \n     gunner's bloodstream. The number fell like a rock.\n       ``We're just preparing for something a brain-injured person \n     should not do two days out, which is travel to Germany,'' the \n     neurologist said. He smiled grimly and started toward the UH-\n     60 Black Hawk thwump-thwumping out on the helipad, waiting to \n     spirit out of Iraq one more of the hundreds of Americans \n     wounded here this month.\n       While attention remains riveted on the rising count of \n     Americans killed in action--more than 100 so far in April--\n     doctors at the main combat support hospital in Iraq are \n     reeling from a stream of young soldiers with wounds so \n     devastating that they probably would have been fatal in any \n     previous war.\n       More and more in Iraq, combat surgeons say, the wounds \n     involve severe damage to the head and eyes--injuries that \n     leave soldiers brain damaged or blind, or both, and the \n     doctors who see them first struggling against despair.\n       For months the gravest wounds have been caused by roadside \n     bombs--improvised explosives that negate the protection of \n     Kevlar helmets by blowing shrapnel and dirt upward into the \n     face. In addition, firefights with guerrillas have surged \n     recently, causing a sharp rise in gunshot wounds to the only \n     vital area not protected by body armor.\n       The neurosurgeons at the 31st Combat Support Hospital \n     measure the damage in the number of skulls they remove to get \n     to the injured brain inside, a procedure known as a \n     craniotomy. ``We've done more in 8 weeks than the previous \n     neurosurgery team did in 8 months,'' Poffenbarger said. ``So \n     there's been a change in the intensity level of the war.''\n       Numbers tell part of the story. So far in April, more than \n     900 soldiers and Marines have been wounded in Iraq, more than \n     twice the number wounded in October, the previous high. With \n     the tally still climbing, this month's injuries account for \n     about a quarter of the 3,864 U.S. servicemen and women listed \n     as wounded in action since the March 2003 invasion.\n       About half the wounded troops have suffered injuries light \n     enough that they were able to return to duty after treatment, \n     according to the Pentagon.\n       The others arrive on stretchers at the hospitals operated \n     by the 31st CSH. ``These injuries,'' said Lt. Col. Stephen M. \n     Smith, executive officer of the Baghdad facility, ``are \n     horrific.''\n       By design, the Baghdad hospital sees the worst. Unlike its \n     sister hospital on a sprawling air base located in Balad, \n     north of the capital, the staff of 300 in Baghdad includes\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\n     the only ophthalmology and neurology surgical teams in Iraq, \n     so if a victim has damage to the head, the medevac sets out \n     for the facility here, located in the heavily fortified \n     coalition headquarters known as the Green Zone.\n       Once there, doctors scramble. A patient might remain in the \n     combat hospital for only six hours. The goal is lightning-\n     swift, expert treatment, followed as quickly as possible by \n     transfer to the military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany.\n       While waiting for what one senior officer wearily calls \n     ``the flippin' helicopters,'' the Baghdad medical staff \n     studies photos of wounds they used to see once or twice in a \n     military campaign but now treat every day. And they struggle \n     with the implications of a system that can move a wounded \n     soldier from a booby-trapped roadside to an operating room in \n     less than an hour.\n       ``We're saving more people than should be saved, \n     probably,'' Lt. Col. Robert Carroll said. ``We're saving \n     severely injured people. Legs. Eyes. Part of the brain.''\n       Carroll, an eye surgeon from Waynesville, Mo., sat at his \n     desk during a rare slow night last Wednesday and called up a \n     digital photo on his laptop computer. The image was of a \n     brain opened for surgery earlier that day, the skull neatly \n     lifted away, most of the organ healthy and pink. But a thumb-\n     sized section behind the ear was gray.\n       ``See all that dark stuff? That's dead brain,'' he said. \n     ``That ain't gonna regenerate. And that's not uncommon. \n     That's really not uncommon. We do craniotomies on average, \n     lately, of one a day.''\n       ``We can save you,'' the surgeon said. ``You might not be \n     what you were.''\n       Accurate statistics are not yet available on recovery from \n     this new round of battlefield brain injuries, an obstacle \n     that frustrates combat surgeons. But judging by medical \n     literature and surgeons' experience with their own patients, \n     ``three of four months from now 50 to 60 percent will be \n     functional and doing things,'' said Maj. Richard Gullick.\n       ``Functional,'' he said, means ``up and around, but with \n     pretty significant disabilities,'' including paralysis.\n       The remaining 40 percent to 50 percent of patients include \n     those whom the surgeons send to Europe, and on to the United \n     States, with no prospect of regaining consciousness. The \n     practice, subject to review after gathering feedback from \n     families, assumes that loves ones will find value in holding \n     the soldier's hand before confronting the decision to remove \n     life support.\n       ``I'm actually glad I'm here and not at home, tending to \n     all the social issues with all these broken soldiers,'' \n     Carroll said.\n       But the toll on the combat medical staff is itself acute, \n     and unrelenting.\n       In a comprehensive Army survey of troop morale across Iraq, \n     taken in September, the unit with the lowest spirits was the \n     one that ran the combat hospitals until the 31st arrived in \n     late January. The 3 months since then have been substantially \n     more intense.\n       ``We've all reached our saturation for drama trauma,'' said \n     Maj. Greg Kidwell, head nurse in the emergency room.\n       On April 4, the hospital received 36 wounded in 4 hours. A \n     U.S. patrol in Baghdad's Sadr City slum was ambushed at dusk, \n     and the battle for the Shiite Muslim neighborhood lasted most \n     of the night. The event qualified as a ``mass casualty,'' \n     defined as more casualties than can be accommodated by the 10 \n     trauma beds in the emergency room.\n       ``I'd never really seen a `mass cal' before April 4,'' said \n     Lt. Col. John Xenos, an orthopedic surgeon from Fairfax. \n     ``And it just kept coming and coming. I think that week we \n     had three or four mass cals.''\n       The ambush heralded a wave of attacks by a Shiite militia \n     across southern Iraq. The next morning, another front erupted \n     when Marines cordoned off Fallujah, a restive, largely Sunni \n     city west of Baghdad. The engagements there led to record \n     casualties.\n       ``Intellectually, you tell yourself you're prepared,'' said \n     Gullick, from San Antonio. ``You do the reading. You study \n     the slides. But being here. . . .'' His voice trailed off.\n       ``It's just the sheer volume.''\n       In part, the surge in casualties reflects more frequent \n     firefights after a year in which roadside bombings made up \n     the bulk of attacks on U.S. forces. At the same time, \n     insurgents began planting improvised explosive devices (IEDs) \n     in what one officer called ``ridiculous numbers.''\n       The improvised bombs are extraordinarily destructive. \n     Typically fashioned from artillery shells they may be packed \n     with such debris as broken glass, nails, sometimes even \n     gravel. They're detonated by remote control as a Humvee or \n     truck passes by, and they explode upward.\n       To protect against the blasts, the U.S. military has \n     wrapped many of its vehicles in armor. When Xenos, the \n     orthopedist, treats limbs shredded by an IED blast, it is \n     usually ``an elbow stuck out of a window, or an arm.''\n       Troops wear armor as well, providing protection that \n     Gullick called ``orders of magnitude from what we've had \n     before. But it just shifts the injury pattern from a lot of \n     abdominal injuries to extremity and head and face wounds.''\n       The Army gunner whom Poffenbarger was preparing for the \n     flight to Germany had his skull pierced by four 155mm shells, \n     rigged to detonate one after another in what soldiers call a \n     ``daisy chain.'' The shrapnel took a fortunate route through \n     his brain, however, and ``when all is said and done, he \n     should be independent. . . . He'll have speech, cognition, \n     vision.''\n       On a nearby stretcher, Staff Sgt. Rene Fernandez struggled \n     to see from eyes bruised nearly shut.\n       ``We were clearing the area and an IED went off,'' he said, \n     describing an incident outside the western city of Ramadi \n     where his unit was patrolling on foot.\n       The Houston native counted himself lucky, escaping with a \n     concussion and the temporary damage to his open, friendly \n     face. Waiting for his own hop to the hospital plane headed \n     north, he said what most soldiers tell surgeons: What he most \n     wanted was to return to his unit.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I was just at a luncheon with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, and he wondered where \nI had been in terms of the debate on the Internet tax question. So here \nI am. I am glad to have this opportunity. I know we have been diverted \nto discuss the Energy bill. But I appreciate the leadership creating an \nopportunity to debate these issues.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire knows, who is a member of the \nCommerce Committee, and has a large interest in the fastest-growing \ntechnology in America, the growth of high-speed Internet access--the \nquestion of how we approach, in a comprehensive way, the regulation and \ntaxation of this new technology--is very important. It is important for \nour economic growth. It is important because, as we do this, we will be \nmaking, inevitably, major adjustments in terms of the responsibilities \nof State and local governments, and we need to do it right.\n  That is why I am encouraged by the fact Senator McCain; Senator \nStevens; the Commerce Committee; Michael Powell, the Chairman of the \nFederal Communications Commission, all have announced that we need to \ntake a new look at the Telecommunications Act of 1996 in light of the \nrecent growth of high-speed Internet access.\n  I am not happy about the fact we are trying to solve problems that \nought to be solved comprehensively, for the long term, on a piecemeal \nbasis, which is exactly what some are trying to do, by turning a fairly \ninnocuous idea--a temporary timeout on State and local taxation of \nInternet access; we are just talking about the connection between my \ncomputer and AOL or whoever is providing my Internet access; that is \njust a little bitty thing--they have turned that into a debate about \nwhether we should give a broad exemption to the entire high-speed \nInternet access industry, and make decisions now about whether State \nand local governments will be able to continue to collect taxes on \ntelephone services.\n  One of the problems with this debate is that everyone who stands up \non opposite sides offers different facts and figures and \ninterpretations, so a Member of the Senate who is not really studying \nor following this issue closely is easily misled.\n  Let me deal with four or five of the misconceptions. First, let me \ntalk about what we are talking about. We are talking about high-speed \nInternet access, which was barely known to most Members of Congress \nwhen the 1996 Telecommunications Act was enacted, not very well known \nin 1998, when we all said--almost all of us said; I said this--let's \ntake a temporary timeout. Let's not allow even State and local taxation \nof Internet access until we figure out what it is.\n  So we did that for 2 years. We did it then for 3 more years. Now the \neffort is to not just do that permanently but to just say: OK, this is \na great new invention. Let's just exempt the whole industry from \ntaxation.\n  High-speed Internet access is now offered in lots of different ways. \nThe reason it is so important is because it means that lots of \ndifferent services may come to my home. If I am watching television \nthrough direct satellite in my home here in the District of Columbia, \nthere is a nice young woman who comes on and she advertises that\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\nthe same DirecTV satellite television I have can also supply me with \nhigh-speed Internet access.\n  Anywhere I am that I can get DIRECTV, which is most places in the \nworld, I can get high-speed Internet access. It seems I get something \nin the mail every day from my telephone company saying they can deliver \nit over the telephone line. That is DSL. I would get something from the \ncable TV, when I had that, that said: We can deliver high-speed \nInternet access to you as well. There are Internet service providers, \ncompanies who deliver it, such as America Online. Now we are finding \nthat high-speed Internet access can be delivered by power companies.\n  In other words, there is no problem with making high-speed Internet \naccess available to anybody in America who has a telephone wire running \nto their house or business, has an electric wire running to their house \nor business, who can put up a satellite dish or hook into a cable \ntelevision. That covers about everybody. But not everybody has it. More \nAmericans have it than in any other country, which I will get to in a \nminute. But this is a new technology. A lot of people have it. In \nManassas, VA, you can buy it from your electric power company. The same \npeople who provide electricity will sell it to you for $25 a month. \nMost cable systems or telephone companies will sell it to you for $30 \nor $40 a month. I get things in the mail that offer it on an \nintroductory basis for $10 or $15 a month.\n  What we are debating is whether State and local governments can apply \nthe sales taxes they usually apply to such transactions and whether \nthey can apply the business taxes they usually apply to such business \nactivities. The tax we are talking about that Tennessee, New Hampshire, \nor Texas might charge might be $1 a month or $2 a month. That is what \nall the fuss is about. If that were all we were talking about, it \nreally would not be worth very much of the Senate's time except the \nlegislation that we are being offered would do much more than is \nadvertised.\n  Let me begin by suggesting what it will do or what it could do. I \ndon't know why every Governor in America and every mayor in America is \nnot sitting in the lobby right now saying to Members of the Senate: Be \ncareful about what you are doing because the way we read the latest \nproposal by the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nSenator McCain, and certainly the way we read the legislation that came \nover from the House that is expected to be put into conference with \nwhatever we produce, you put at risk the money State and local \ngovernments collect today from taxing telephone services.\n  If you are sitting at home listening, you might say: Hooray, I don't \nwant to pay those taxes. Well, fine. So we take those taxes off. In \nTexas, if we take off the taxes Texas collects on telephone services, \nit is $1.7 billion a year. So if the bill passes in the form it passed \nthe House or in the form it is now written in the Senate, we might as \nwell call this the Texas new income tax law of 2004 or the Nashville \nhigher local property tax law of 2004. Because you cannot put at risk \nbillions of dollars of State and local revenues and expect those \ngovernments to continue to fully fund universities, schools, parks, \nroads, and the other things they are expected to do.\n  One might say, well, let them just cut the size of government. I \ncould be facetious about this, although I don't want to be because it \nis so serious. Here is a serious analogy. I just had lunch with the \npresident of one of the largest car companies in the world. We were \ntalking about hybrid cars, the cars that have an electric engine in \nthem and an internal combustion engine in them. They are reported, \naccording to Toyota Corporation, to get 50 miles a gallon. That is \npretty good. Gasoline is at record prices. The Middle East is in \nturmoil. We are getting 65 percent of our oil from around the world, \nand our air is dirty. So as a Senator, I think it would be a great idea \nto encourage people to use hybrid cars.\n  Why don't I propose a Federal law that stops Tennessee, New \nHampshire, Texas, and California from charging a State tax on the sale \nof hybrid cars? That would clean the air. That is a good thing. Let's \ndo it. You might say: That sounds good, but it sounds odd, too, because \nyou are a Federal legislator. Why would you pass a hybrid car act about \nState laws? If you have an expensive idea, why don't you do it \nyourself?\n\n  The Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Arizona have said it \nis not the intention of their legislation to keep States from \ncontinuing to tax telephone calls, telephone services, even if the \ncalls are made over the Internet. That is what was said. But that is \nnot what the language of the bill does. I don't think the Senate should \ntake any chance that in the State of California we would pass a law on \nsuch a simple item as exempting Internet access from taxation and have \nthe unintended effect of costing State and local governments up to $10 \nbillion a year in revenues they now collect on telephone calls--not all \ntelephone services, just telephone calls.\n  In Florida, it is $1 billion a year. So you might call this act, as \nit is now written, the Florida income tax act of 2004, the Tennessee \nincome tax act of 2004, the Texas income tax act of 2004, because I \ndon't know what other revenue base is left if that much of a sales tax \nis taken away.\n  You might ask: Why are you saying it would be taken away? Let's \nassume I am right about the way the law is written. Here is what \nhappens. I will use the hybrid car analogy. We might set up a two-tier \ntax system for cars. Buy a hybrid car in Nashville and you will pay \nzero of the Tennessee sales tax. Buy a regular car in Nashville and you \nwill pay 6, 7 percent on the cost of the car, I believe up to a \nceiling. So we will have two tiers. That is what is going to happen \nwith telephone calls.\n  One of the exciting advantages of this new technology is we will soon \nbe making regular telephone calls over the Internet, not over the \ntelephone wires. They will be using telephone wires but not in the same \nway. It is a different technology. It is still a telephone call but a \ndifferent way of doing it, just as with a hybrid car. Calls, as they \nmove to the Internet, will be free of State and local taxation. That is \nwhat adds up to about $10 billion a year in State and local revenues.\n  That won't happen overnight. The Congressional Budget Office has \ninformed us that within the next 5 years, State and local governments \nwill lose $3 billion of revenue. I think it will come faster than that. \nMost people who look at VOIP, voice over Internet protocol, believe it \nwill and hope it does. I hope it does. I think it is a great advance. \nBut I disagree that on this bill, we should decide the question of \nwhether State and local governments must stop taxing telephone services \nand start raising property taxes, or sales taxes on food, or institute \na new income tax to make up for all or part of the revenue you lose.\n  I would much rather see the Senate Commerce Committee, over the next \nyear or two, consider legislation such as that by the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, which straight out says--if I am stating it \ncorrectly--that with this new protocol, it should be free of taxation. \nWe ought to talk about that. It ought not be snuck into a bill.\n  I urge the chairman of the committee and Senator Allen to accept \nplain English language--just take it and change their bill. They asked \nwhat suggestions we have. I have given this to them several times. Just \nsay that nothing in this legislation precludes States from collecting \ntaxes they are collecting on telephone services, including telephone \ncalls made over the Internet. Save that question for another day. I \nhave heard that is their intention. That is not what it says.\n  In Alabama, that is worth up to $213 million a year; in Alaska, it is \n$18 million a year; in Arizona, it is $308 million a year; California \ncollects $1.5 billion a year. So that is a huge cost to State and local \ngovernments. It is 5 percent of the Tennessee State budget, to give you \nan example. Senator Feinstein says there are more than 100 cities and \ncounties in California that estimate they could lose from 5 to 15 \npercent of their revenue. So that is one of the four issues that could \nbe easily corrected.\n  Another question that has come up quite a bit lately is the idea that \nsuddenly we need more Government subsidy for high-speed Internet access \nbecause the United States is falling behind.\n  Well, my view on that is I don't think it is true that we do. But if \nit is\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\ntrue, Congress ought to pay the bill and not send it to State and local \ngovernments. Just as we think hybrid cars are great and we want to give \nthem a subsidy--that is called picking and choosing winners in the \neconomic marketplace, which I thought conservatives were not supposed \nto do. If we want to do that for hybrid cars, we should take it out of \nour budget and not tell Governors and mayors to take it out of property \ntaxes or take it out of the classrooms to do it. If we want to give an \nadvantage to high-speed Internet access, we should pay for it. But we \nought not to pass this bill because we think we are behind in high-\nspeed Internet access. There is no real evidence of that.\n  For example, in 2002, the United States had the highest number of \nInternet subscribers in the world, nearly 20 million. Eighty-eight \npercent of all ZIP codes have at least one high-speed subscriber; 29 \npercent of all ZIP codes have access to five or more providers. The Pew \nanalysis recently showed that a quarter of Americans have high-speed \nInternet access in their home and half have it at their workplace.\n  Consumers are adopting broadband, high-speed Internet access, at a \nrecord pace, not a slow pace. There is no emergency in terms of people \nnot using this. They are adopting broadband technology at a faster pace \nthan CD players. High-speed Internet access is coming in at a faster \npace than cell phones, color TVs, and VCRs during their development. \nThat is according to a report from the Department of Commerce in 2002. \nCellular phones took 6 years from their introduction to reach 7\\1/2\\ \nmillion subscribers. High-speed Internet reached that in 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  High-speed Internet service providers are increasing their investment \nin broadband services. For example, between 1996 and 2001, the four \nlargest phone companies increased their investment in broadband \ntechnologies by 64 percent and cable companies by 68 percent.\n  In short, the Congressional Budget Office told us, the Senate, in \nDecember 2003 that the broadband market is booming. In its report to us \nin December of 2003, ``Does the Residential Broadband Market Need \nFixing?'' the CBO analysis also concluded that ``Nothing in the \nperformance of the residential broadband market suggests that Federal \nsubsidies for it will produce large economic gains.''\n\n  This is CBO. ``Nothing in the performance of the residential \nbroadband market suggests that Federal subsidies for it will produce \nlarge economic gains.''\n  So, then, why are we coming with a bill that would give more big \nsubsidies? I have reviewed the fact that, because of the language in \nthe latest proposal by the chairman of the Commerce Committee, up to \n$10 billion of State and local tax collections on telephone companies \nare at risk. If you take that away, that is a subsidy to a company.\n  You can subsidize a company in one of two ways. You can give it some \nmoney or you can say you don't have to pay taxes like everybody else \ndoes. That is a flatout subsidy. That is not the only subsidy. I \nmentioned to the distinguished chairman, the Senator from Arizona, that \nit seems to me that insofar as my research indicates, high-speed \nInternet access is a lot like ethanol. It is hard to find anything that \nhas more subsidy. According to the Congressional Research Service, the \nCongressional Budget Office identified three programs totaling $4.8 \nbillion in subsidy, a Federal subsidy for promoting the adoption of \nhigh-speed Internet access. They are already in place--$4.8 billion of \nFederal subsidy for high-speed Internet access.\n  Established in 1996, the Telecommunications Act provided subsidies \nfor schools and libraries, subsidies for rural health care providers. \nThe Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 authorizes $20 \nmillion per year for loans and grants.\n  Then I have the Alliance for Public Technologies' report on all of \nthe State and local broadband policy experiments in the State. In \nvirtually every State in America, there is a spending of taxpayer \ndollars to encourage the spread of high-speed Internet access.\n  Yesterday, I used the example of Texas. Texas set up a fund in 1995 \nto spend $1.5 billion over 10 years to provide telecommunications \naccess to public schools, hospitals, libraries, and institutions of \nhigher education. Almost every State is doing it. So let's take how \nthis works as an example.\n  If this bill passes--and if I am reading the McCain proposal right \nand it affects telephones the way I believe it does--this is what \nhappens in Texas to broadband. They are spending $1.5 billion already \nto encourage the spread of broadband in public institutions. Texas also \nhas a law put in by President Bush when he was Governor in 1999; I \nthink it is a good law. By the way, I think we ought to adopt that. I \nthink it is exactly the way to encourage permanently the growth of \nhigh-speed Internet access, if that is what we want to do.\n  Texas, in 1999, said it is the law of Texas that the first $25 is \nexempt of everything to pay for Internet access. So that would save you \nmaybe $1 or $2 a month. That is what the tax would be in Texas on high-\nspeed Internet access. You can get it anywhere from $20, to $40, or \n$50, depending on who sells it to you. The prices are coming down \nbecause of the competition.\n  So you have $1.5 billion in Texas at least to encourage it. You have \nan exemption for every single person in Texas who wants to sign up. The \nfirst $25 is already exempt.\n  Now here we come with our bill. What does it do? It does a lot more \nthan exempt Texans from tax on Internet access. First, I believe it \nputs at risk up to $1 billion of revenues in sales taxes the State \ncollects today on telephone services. That is one.\n  Second, it stops Texas from collecting business taxes on telephone \ncompanies it normally would collect on any company that does business \nin the State. The definition of the latest proposal by the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona says we are not just talking about \nthe hookup, Internet access between the end user and the provider, we \nare talking about the whole industry. We are talking about that, that, \nthat, and that--in other words, all the way through.\n  Let's go back to the example of the hybrid cars. It would be like \npassing a Federal law saying you cannot collect the State tax in \nArizona or Tennessee on the sale of a hybrid car because it is a great \nnew invention. Not only that, you cannot collect a sales tax--if you \nare an auto parts supplier in Tennessee--you can't collect a tax there. \nAnd if they brought steel to the auto parts supplier, you cannot \ncollect a tax there.\n  None of us like to pay taxes, but when we lower State and local taxes \nhere, we are inevitably raising State and local taxes there. Lowering \ntaxes in this amount of money by direction from Washington, DC, \ninevitably makes this the Higher Sales Tax Act of 2004, the Higher \nLocal Property Tax Act of 2004 because every mayor and every Governor \nis going to be scrambling to figure out: We lost all this revenue \nbecause the Congress in its wisdom had the idea to give a big subsidy \nto the high-speed Internet access business, and we are going to have to \nfind a way to pay for the schools, to keep from raising tuition so \nmuch, to pay for health care, and to open the parks. So we are going to \nhave to close them, cut them back, or raise the sales tax on food and \nraise the property tax. That is why we usually leave those matters to \nmayors and Governors and do not do it from here.\n  We are all for home ownership, but we do not pass a Federal law to \nlower property taxes. We all want our corporations to stay in the \nUnited States, and we do not want them to have high local taxes any \nmore than high Federal taxes, but we do not pass a Federal law lowering \nthe local corporate income tax.\n  That is why I am perplexed by this bill. The idea that by adding a \nsubsidy we would encourage the use of high-speed Internet access when \nit is already, according to the New York Times last week, the fastest \ngrowing technology in America, when already it is being accepted more \nrapidly than VCR and all these other innovations I do not agree with. \nThe idea that it needs more taxpayer support I do not agree with.\n  Let's throw that item completely out the window and say if we do \nbelieve it needs a subsidy, then why do we send the bill to State and \nlocal governments? We promised not to do that.\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\nMr. President, 300 Republicans stood over on the steps of the Capitol \nin late September 1994 and said: No money, no mandates. If we break our \npromise, throw us out.\n  I thought we were the party on this side of the aisle of no Federal \nunfunded mandates. That was a big movement back then. Everybody got \nfired up about it. I heard it. I was running around the country trying \nto offer myself for higher office, which the people rejected. I know \nthe great Contract with America was no more unfunded mandates. I \nremember Senator Dole saying when he was majority leader the first act \non the part of the Senate was no more unfunded mandates. In fact, this \nunfunded mandate might be so large that according to CBO's letter to \nus, they cannot calculate how much it will be, although they know it is \nenough to make it an unfunded Federal mandate.\n  Why would we do that? Why don't we do what Texas did? Texas did a \nvery direct thing. They said the first $25 you pay every month is \nexempt from State and local taxes. It could be $30, it could be $35, it \ncould be $40. Then we won't have any argument about definition. We \nwould not have to worry about whether we were subsidizing companies \ninstead of consumers, and we would actually be giving a benefit to the \nindividual American--maybe there will be 100 million of them 1 day--who \nsubscribe to high-speed Internet access, and we say no State and local \ntaxes at all, none on you.\n\n  The States have asked us to do that, and we have not done it. I don't \nknow why. That also is an unfunded mandate, but it is not much money. \nThe way we are doing it is a lot of money. It is at least hundreds of \nmillions of State dollars a year, and the way this latest bill is \nwritten, it could be billions a year of State and local revenues.\n  I thought the National Governors Association letter was thoughtful \nand respectful and acknowledged the hard work all sides have done on \nthis issue. That is why it is such a hard issue, maybe, because it \nought to be easy. It ought to be a small amount of money and a fairly \nsimple issue. But it has been written into a complex issue with the \npossibility that it might run a Mack truck through State and local \nbudgets.\n  The National Governors Association yesterday suggested the proposal \nby the Senator from Arizona falls short of their hope of balancing the \ninterests of State sovereignty and State responsibility with the desire \nfor keeping high-speed Internet access free of excessive taxation. They \ntalked about the specific issues I suggested in my letter to the \nchairman earlier this week and that formed the basis for amendments I \nhave filed.\n  One, the definition. Instead of using the definition of the original \nmoratorium in 1998, the one we all agreed to in 1998 and 2000, instead \nof saying let's do that permanently or do that again, they have cooked \nup a new definition. This definition is the one that runs the risk of \ncosting State and local governments so much. That is one.\n  Second, the language--and this may be inadvertent and if it is, maybe \nI can ask the Senator from Arizona if there is a way we can agree on \nhow to fix it. If we agree we do not intend to keep States from \ncontinuing to collect State and local taxes on telephone services, even \ntelephone calls made over the Internet, then we ought to get that issue \noff the table, and surely we can find somebody who can write that in a \nsentence to which we can all agree.\n  Then there is the term. I applaud the leadership of those Senators on \nthe Commerce Committee who want to address this issue. I think if we go \n4 years, which is better than permanent, but if we go 3 or 4 years, we \nrun the risk of freezing into the law provisions that will be much \nharder for the Commerce Committee and the full Senate to change. Then \nthere is the question of the so-called grandfather act which allows \nStates already collecting taxes to keep doing that.\n  Those are all the issues we have here. One is the definition, one is \ntelephone, one is term, and one is grandfather. That is tantalizingly \nclose, it would seem to me, but the one that makes the most difference \nis the definition, which means for the first time, States will not be \nallowed to apply business taxes to the high-speed Internet industry in \nthe same way they normally would other businesses for the first time. \nThey are not collecting these taxes.\n  The other issue is the language, we believe, in the latest draft and \ncertainly the language in the House bill runs the substantial risk of \nover time costing the States up to $10 billion a year in sales taxes, \nand the House bill another $7 billion in business taxes now collected \non telephone services.\n  I do not want to overstate that point. That is not going to happen \ntomorrow. It is going to gradually happen as telephone calls are made \nover the Internet.\n  So that would be my hope since we have narrowed it down to that, and \none of them may not be an issue at all, but that is pretty close. I do \nnot know much more that I can say about it except--well, I can say a \nwhole lot more about it. I have stacks of stuff and I will be glad to \nstick around and talk about it if anybody wants to. I do have the \nhearing I am expected to chair at 3, but I would say to the \ndistinguished chairman from Arizona that I hope he understands I am not \npersisting in this just for the purpose of being obstinate. I feel very \ndeeply, from my background as Governor, that it is important for us to \nrespect the ability of State and local governments to fund their \nprograms.\n  Since I left the Governor's office in Tennessee in 1987, Federal \nfunding for education has gone from 50 cents out of every dollar to 40 \ncents. Most of that has gone to higher education. Our chances for job \ngrowth and a high standard of living depend to a great extent on the \nability of State and local governments to properly fund colleges and \nuniversities and create schools our children can attend.\n  Any time we take away resources from State and local governments, \nthat does not sound like the Republican Party. President Reagan was \ngiving resources to State and local governments. President Eisenhower \nwas giving resources to State and local governments. Last year, we sent \na welfare check to State and local governments of $20 billion, and this \nyear we are talking about taking back up to at least $10 billion a \nyear. That is my objection.\n  We could have a separate debate about whether the subsidy is \nwarranted and, if it is, well, we could pay for it from here. But \nsurely we would not send the bill to State and local governments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I look forward to discussions with the \nSenator from Tennessee and the Senator from Delaware. As they know, we \nhave a meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld in 407 in about 20 minutes, and \nwe are going to go back on the bill at 4. I would be glad to have \ndiscussions. Meanwhile, I hope there would be some amendments proposed \nby the opponents of the legislation, and we could dispose of them as we \ndid yesterday with the Senator from Texas, who came forward with an \namendment and we debated it. Unfortunately, neither the Senator from \nTennessee, nor the Senator from Delaware, nor the Senator from Ohio \nhave chosen to do so.\n  Usually, I like to do business by amendments, debates, and votes. \nThat is the way we usually like to move forward legislatively.\n  I look forward to that opportunity and also engaging in any \ndiscussions which the Senator would like. I want to assure him I am \nvery confident in the sincerity of his views on this issue and his \ncommitment to the issue. I understand his background as a very \nsuccessful Governor of the great State of Tennessee which gives him a \nperspective for which I am greatly appreciative.\n  We are still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to finish my \nstatement, which I hope will be done by 2:55. If not, I ask unanimous \nconsent to finish my complete statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4471-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4471-S4474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION CHAIRMAN MUST GO\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was in Arizona recently, and by chance I \nwatched C-SPAN airing the Federal Election Commission hearing on the \nissue of 527s. Let me assure my colleagues, it was both eye opening and \nappalling.\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\n  Once in a while, we have a public debate in Washington that serves as \na perfect metaphor for the cynical way in which business is sometimes \ndone here. The argument over whether and when the Federal Election \nCommission should regulate new soft money fundraising groups provides \nus with one of those moments. In it, we can see how badly our election \nwatchdog has served the public and the urgent need to fix it.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Election Commission, Bradley Smith, \nclaims apparently some moral superiority on the issue of 527s because \nas a Republican he stands in opposition to the Republican Party's \neffort to ensure 527 groups comply with the law. While some may look \nupon his views as principles, I can only conclude that they again \nillustrate the same unfitness to serve on the Federal Election \nCommission he has shown since he was appointed 5 years ago.\n  Despite claims that his contempt for the Federal elections laws was \nmerely that of an academic commentator and that he would uphold the \nlaws as passed by Congress if confirmed, Mr. Smith has made no secret \nsince arriving at the FEC of his disdain for the Federal Election \nCampaign Act of 1974, as well as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of \n2002. He has done so once again in the pending rulemaking.\n  Even after the Supreme Court decision in McConnell v. FEC, Mr. Smith \nhas gone out of his way to criticize the Court's decision and the law \nhe is supposed to enforce. In one public speech he said:\n\n       Now and then the Supreme Court issues a decision that cries \n     out to the public, ``We do not know what we are doing.'' \n     McConnell is such a decision.\n\n  Further evidence of Mr. Smith's predilection can be found in an \narticle in the May 3 edition of National Review in which he writes:\n\n       Campaign reform passed Congress and was upheld by the \n     Supreme Court because groups hostile to freedom spent \n     hundreds of millions of dollars to create an intellectual \n     climate in which free political participation was viewed as a \n     threat to democracy.\n\n  This is perhaps the most inflammatory and inappropriate comment I \nhave ever seen by an individual who is supposed to be enforcing \nexisting law, affirmed in its constitutionality by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States of America. To assert that proreform groups had \nsomehow brainwashed Congress and the Supreme Court is simply pathetic \nand solidifies my belief that Mr. Smith cannot administer our campaign \nfinance laws in good faith because he is incapable of putting his sworn \nduties above his personal opinion.\n  By the way, his treatment of Mr. Nobel, a witness before the FEC, was \nas bullying and as cowardly as I have ever seen anyone conduct \nthemselves in our Nation's Capital and clearly was an abuse of his \nauthority as Chairman of the Commission.\n  Mr. Smith's views on the constitutionality of the Nation's campaign \nfinance laws have been repeatedly rejected by the Supreme Court. Mr. \nSmith was dead wrong in his views that the Federal Election Campaign \nAct and its restrictions on contributions were unconstitutional, and \nMr. Smith was dead wrong in his views that BCRA was unconstitutional. \nMr. Smith seems to be incapable of accepting the fact that the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, not Mr. Smith, is the last word on the \nconstitutionality of campaign laws and that it is his job as an FEC \nCommissioner to carry out, not thwart, the Supreme Court's mandate.\n\n  I do not deny that Mr. Smith is entitled to his personal views on the \nissue of regulating 527s. I am saying, however, that he is failing to \nfulfill his duties as the chairman of a Federal agency and one who is \nsworn to uphold and enforce the law. Just as we would not tolerate the \nappointment of a pacifist to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nor the Director of the FBI who believes the whole Penal Code should be \nnull and void, so we should not accept a Chairman of the FEC who \nopposes campaign laws upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Knowing of his opposition to the laws he was sworn to uphold, I \ncannot fathom why Mr. Smith would have even accepted his current \nposition in the first place, certainly now that the Supreme Court has \nproven him wrong and upheld the constitutionality of a law that he \nstated was ``clearly unconstitutional.'' It makes no sense. It makes no \nsense for him to be charged with enforcing a law he so publicly opposes \non policy and legal grounds.\n  I know if I were in Mr. Smith's shoes, I would do the honorable thing \nand resign if I was so determined to carry on a crusade against Federal \nregulation of campaign finance. I would leave the FEC position to be \nfilled by someone who believed in the job.\n  If any of my colleagues think I am exaggerating about these FEC \nhearings, by the way, they should get a tape from C-SPAN and look at it \nthemselves. It was shocking.\n  One very troubling aspect of the hearings was the way in which some \nCommissioners and antireform witnesses joined in a chorus of complaint \nthat ``no one knew what Congress intended to do'' when it passed FECA \nin 1974 and BCRA in 2002.\n  One witness testified that it took Congress 7 years to figure out \nwhat to do about soft money. I am somewhat amazed by such a statement \nbecause anyone who was in Washington during those 7 years knows that \nthe main component of our bill--from the very beginning--was a ban on \nsoft money. You can't get much more definitive than a ban. What did \ntake 7 years was convincing our opponents to allow a vote on the \nmeasure, and when we finally got our vote, we had clear majorities in \nboth Houses.\n  Some of the lawyers who testified that no one knows what Congress \nintended to do in these bills were the very same lawyers who spent \nyears urging Members to vote against BCRA, and argued its \nunconstitutionality before the Supreme Court. Give me a break. As \nwitnesses to Congressional intent, they have zero credibility. Let me \nbe clear on this: Senator Feingold and I repeatedly told the FEC \nexactly what we intended to accomplish with our legislation, and the \nlegislative history of FECA from 1974 is equally as clear. The only \nconfusion in this area has been with the FEC itself and those \nCommissioners who just simply didn't like the actions taken by \nCongress.\n  The Commission's hearings centered on the issue of regulation of so-\ncalled ``527 groups'' that are raising and spending millions of dollars \nin soft money in the current presidential election. These groups \nreadily admit that their intended purpose is to influence the outcome \nof Federal elections. FECA has long required these groups to register \nas Federal political committees and comply with Federal campaign \nfinance limits. Unfortunately, because the FEC has misinterpreted and \nundermined the law, we find ourselves in this unenforced regulatory \nlimbo today. The 1974 law requires that any group with a ``major \npurpose'' of influencing a Federal election, and which spends more than \n$1,000 doing so, must use the same limited hard money contributions as \nthe political parties and the candidates themselves. In recent years \nthough, the FEC slouched into the feckless and unjustified position of \nnot enforcing the law in the case of groups which avoided the ``magic \nwords'' of ``express advocacy'' but were set up and operated to \ninfluence Federal elections. Then, in McConnell, the Supreme Court \nitself made clear what many of us already knew--that the Constitution \ndid not require an ``express advocacy'' standard, and that such a \nstandard is ``functionally meaningless.'' That's the words of The \nUnited States Supreme Court.\n  But here we are, with these groups openly flouting the law and openly \nspending soft money for the express purpose of influencing the \npresidential election while the FEC sits on its hands once again. Like \nthe emperor with no clothes, those Commissioners just do not know what \nto do now that the Supreme Court has removed their ``express advocacy \nis required by the Constitution'' rationale for failing to regulate \npolitical activity by the 527 political organizations. As a result, \nthese organizations remain busy soliciting and spending millions for \nthe avowed purpose of influencing Federal elections.\n  That the FEC's lack of action undermines the law isn't just my \nopinion. The Supreme Court confirmed this in its recent decision \nupholding the soft money ban. In McConnell v. FEC, the Supreme Court \nstated, in no uncertain terms, how we ended up in the soft money crisis \nto begin with. The Justices placed the blame squarely at the\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\ndoors of the FEC, concluding that the agency had eroded the \nprohibitions on union and corporate spending, and the limits on \nindividual contributions through years of bad rulings and rulemakings, \nincluding its formulas for allocation of party expenses between Federal \nand non-Federal accounts. Regarding the allocation regulations for \nparties, the Supreme Court stated in McConnell that the FEC had \n``subverted'' the law, issued regulations that ``permitted more than \nCongress . . . had ever intended'', and ``invited widespread \ncircumvention of FECA's limits on contributions.'' That is a damning \nindictment of the behavior and performance of the Federal Elections \nCommission.\n  Based on the recent hearings, it seems entirely possible that the FEC \nwill once again abdicate its statutory responsibilities and refuse to \nend this new soft money scheme--or at least put off any action until \nthe Presidential election is over. In fact, FFC Vice-chair Ellen \nWeintraub recently opposed a rulemaking on 527 activity saying that:\n\n       At this stage in the election cycle, it is unprecedented \n     for the FEC to contemplate changes to the very definitions of \n     terms as fundamental as ``expenditure'' and ``political \n     committee'' . . . sowing uncertainty during an election year.\n\n  Ms. Weintraub further stated:\n\n       I will not be rushed to make hasty decisions, with far-\n     reaching implications, at the behest of those who see in our \n     hurried action their short-term political gain.\n\n  Ms. Weintraub has no business looking at the election calendar. That \nis none of her business. What is her business is to enforce existing \nlaw according to the law in the U.S. Supreme Court upholding its \nconstitutionality. It should not matter to Ms. Weintraub whether we are \nin an even numbered year, an odd numbered year, fall, spring, winter, \nor summer. This is an incredible statement as to how politics affects a \nFederal commission that is supposed to rule on laws, not on political \ncampaigns.\n  Of course, it is not that complicated. All the FEC needs to do now is \nsimply enforce existing Federal law as written by Congress in 1974 and \ninterpreted by the Supreme Court in a number of cases, including the \nMcConnell case. It defies the whole purpose of the FEC, to say it \nshould not properly enforce the law in the middle of an election year \nbecause such enforcement might affect that election. We want the law \nenforced. I have never heard of a regulatory agency that has any \nreference whatsoever to political campaigns.\n  The fact the FEC has neglected to properly enforce the law correctly \nin the past is not a reason or justification for the Commission to \ncontinue failing to properly enforce the law, now that the Supreme \nCourt has made clear the FEC was wrong. If the FEC fails to act now, \nthe FEC will simply be treading the same destructive path it has \nfollowed for a generation.\n  We know systemic campaign finance abuses have usually begun when one \npolitical party decides to push the envelope and the FEC declines to \nact, leading the other party to adopt the same illegal tactics. In \n1988, one party invented the use of soft money to promote their \nPresidential campaign, evading campaign finance rules. The Commission \nlet them get away with this. This is well documented. The other party \nfollowed.\n  In 1996, the soft money scheme was raised to an art form and the \nCommission did nothing. You have to ask whether the Commission has \nlearned anything about the consequences of its failure to properly \nenforce the law. History proves it is imperative that the Commission \nact now. If it does not, we can rest assured both parties will soon be \ntrying to out-raise each other in this venue, and a whole new soft \nmoney scheme will have blossomed.\n  By the way, the reality is if these soft money 527s are allowed to \nstand--they are now, we know, largely funded by Democrats. Who in the \nworld doesn't understand if you allow this to stand, then the \nRepublicans will do the same thing, and understandably so? Just as in \n1988 one party was allowed to do it, so the other party was able to as \nwell.\n  Much of the controversy at the Commission has been ginned up by an \nartfully crafted misinformation campaign designed to persuade the \nnonprofit community--the 501(c)s--that any FEC action to rein in 527s \nwould have the unintended consequence of limiting their own advocacy \nefforts. It is true certain campaign finance rules for spending by \nnonprofits are different than they are for political groups like 527s. \nThere is no immediate campaign finance regulatory problem with the \n501(c) groups. I repeat, there is no immediate campaign finance \nregulatory problem with the 501(c) groups as there is with the 527 \ngroups, and no need--no need to address 501(c) groups in this \nrulemaking.\n  Some have suggested the agency do what Congress did when it passed \nBCRA: Issue a ruling but make the change effective after the election.\n  What these critics fail to recognize, however, is that Congress was \ncreating an entirely new set of election rules in BCRA. All that is \nrequired here is for the FEC to properly enforce law that has been on \nthe books for 30 years, and to abandon its wrong interpretations of the \nlaw as made clear in the McConnell decision. To issue new regulations \nnow and make them effective after the 2004 election would be for the \nFEC to say that ``we know the law has been wrongly interpreted for \nyears but we are going to allow that to continue for the rest of this \nyear, and then next year, we will start interpreting that law \ncorrectly.'' This is simply not rational and it is an abdication of \ntheir responsibilities.\n  Finally, it is essential that the FEC act quickly to fix its absurd \nallocation rules, which govern the mix of soft and hard money a \npolitical committee can spend when it is supporting both State and \nFederal candidates. It is clear that a number of the current crop of \n527s exist only to defeat President Bush. But through the absurd FEC \nallocation formulas, if these same entities also claim to be working in \nstate elections, they could use soft money for 98 percent of their \nexpenditures--a complete end-run around the soft money ban in Federal \nraces.\n  Despite all the evidence, I am still hopeful the Commissioners will \nsummon the political will to do the right thing now. There are some \ncommissioners who want to do the right thing. I want them to step \nforward and do it. But even if they do, the agency's structural \nproblems will be the same as they ever were. By unfortunate custom, \nthree Republicans and three Democrats are chosen by their party \nleadership, usually with the express purpose of protecting their \nparty's interests, rather than enforcing the law. It takes four votes \nfor the Commission to take action--a requirement that has been a recipe \nfor deadlock and bipartisan collusion and gave birth to the soft money \nproblem we're trying to put behind us.\n  Last month I testified before the Senate Rules Committee on the issue \nof 527s. During my testimony I stated that one of the problems the FEC \nfaces today is that some Commissioners, and in particular Chairman \nSmith, refuse to accept the Supreme Court's conclusions in the area of \ncampaign financing. A decision by the FEC to abdicate its \nresponsibility at this politically inconvenient moment will only \nprovide further evidence that it is time to start over. If the \nCommission has become too hopelessly politicized to do its job, then we \nmust replace it with an agency that will.\n  The FEC's current difficulty in dealing with an issue as \nstraightforward as these 527 organizations spending soft money to \ninfluence the 2004 Federal elections, and the 3-3 ties at the \nCommission when it recently considered an advisory opinion on this \nissue, are only the most recent examples of the need for fundamental \nFEC reform. With my fellow BCRA sponsors, I have introduced legislation \nthat would scrap the FEC and start over, using a new organizational \nstructure and administrative law judges to avoid deadlocks and take \nsome of the politics out of the process. Whether we adopt this or some \nother basic reform, it is time for a watchdog with some bite.\n  I thank the President for his patience as I ran over the previously \nagreed-to time.\n  This is a very serious issue. We are not going to give up on it. We \ndidn't work for 7 years to get campaign finance reform done and upheld \nby the U.S. Supreme Court to have a group of six people down there who \nare so politicized that they refuse to enforce a law which was passed \nby this Congress in overwhelming numbers, finally, and upheld by the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\n  I want to tell them and all of those other people I watched on C-SPAN \nwho are trying to undermine this law that we will not let you get away \nwith it.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Another Week, Another Cloture Vote\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, our country is facing record budget and \ntrade deficits. We are in a war of our President's choosing that is \nnot, to put it mildly, going as well as had been expected. Millions of \nAmericans are without health care and millions more worry about the \nsecurity of their jobs.\n  These are troubled times and many issues clamor for the attention of \nthe Senate. Yet what is the response of the Senate, the world's \ngreatest deliberative body? Are we debating strategies to quell the \nviolence in Iraq and bring our soldiers home? No. Are we considering \nplans to shore up Social Security and Medicare? No. Is the Senate \ndeliberating on how to make America's workforce more competitive? No. \nIs the Senate grappling with reauthorizing welfare reform or the \nhighway bill? No.\n  This great deliberative body which was forged by the Founding Fathers \nin the Great Compromise of July 16, 1787, has become a factory that \nmanufactures sound-bite votes that make great fodder for 30-second \npolitical ads but which do very little to address the many challenges \nfacing this country. If this continues, I fear that the Senate will be \nlittle more than an insignificant arm of the political parties, and we \nmay as well lower the flag that flies over this Capitol and wave the \nwhite flag of surrender in its place.\n\n  Have we lost the will to legislate? Is the current leadership afraid \nto allow the Senate to work its will? The Republican leadership seems \nto feel that their slim majority gives them a blank check to impose \ntheir exclusive agenda. Let me be clear. It does not. The Senate, by \nits very existence, embodies a core tenet in American democracy; \nnamely, the principle that the minority--the minority, the Democrats as \nof now, the minority--has rights. The Republican leadership is fast \nmaking the committee process a thing of the past. Furthermore, the \nleadership has done everything in its power to prevent Democratic \nSenators from getting votes on their amendments.\n  The United States is faced with a trade deficit that has mushroomed \nto an all-time high for the third year in a row. Adding to that \nunfortunate situation, in August 2002, the World Trade Organization \nauthorized the European Union to impose up to $4 billion in trade \nsanctions against the United States if provisions of the Tax Code were \nnot repealed. How about that?\n  The distinguish Republican leader brought up the Foreign Sales \nCorporation legislation to address this situation only after the \nsanctions were in place. After votes on only two amendments, the \nmajority wanted to shut down the amendment process--shut it down. Many \nreasons were given, but the truth is that they did not want to vote on \nan amendment dealing with overtime rules for American workers. Yes, the \nAmerican workers. While American companies are losing their competitive \nedge, the ``my way or the highway'' approach of the leadership has \ndelayed a final resolution on this bill.\n  In the past, cloture was a rarely used procedural tool. When I came \nto this Senate, it was rarely used--only once in a while. Not so today. \nCloture is routinely filed in an attempt to limit nongermane \namendments. Instead of the phrase, ``another day, another dollar,'' the \nSenate operates in an atmosphere of ``another week, another cloture \nvote.''\n  Last November, we had three cloture votes in one day. What great \nhopes the leadership must have had for the first two votes to schedule \nthree in a row. How can such a move be seen as anything more than \npolitical scorekeeping?\n  This Senate has spent an extraordinary amount of time and energy and \neffort on President Bush's judicial nominees. In fact, last November \nthe Senate set aside the VA-HUD appropriations bill to hold an \novernight marathon stunt--something to watch indeed, something to \nwatch. What a sham. The majority actually set aside substantive \nlegislation to conduct a circus--a circus--on the floor of the Senate.\n  The VA-HUD appropriations bill was never completed. Instead, it was \nrolled into the Omnibus appropriations bill, as has become the \nunfortunate custom in recent years. We have had 17 cloture votes on 6 \ncontroversial and problematic nominees. The response of the Republican \nleadership and the administration has not been to address the \nfundamental underlying concerns raised by various Senators. Oh, no, no \nnegotiation. Instead, they choose the course of holding cloture vote \nafter cloture vote and then bash Democratic Senators as obstructionist. \nAnd just for good measure, the President, who has had 96 percent of his \njudges confirmed, moved two of these divisive nominees on to the bench \nin recess appointments.\n\n  Now, I do not pretend that the conflict over judicial nominees began \nin this Senate or with the President, but I will state that this Senate \nleadership and this President have worked in concert to further \npoliticize the process by which we select members of the judiciary.\n  And it is not just with judicial nominees that the Republican \nleadership is doing the White House's bidding. The Republican \nleadership is controlled by this White House--controlled by this White \nHouse. Rather than have a legislative branch which crafts a bill and \nthen sends it to the President to sign or veto, this Republican \nleadership in the Senate and in the House has allowed this President to \ncontrol both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  During the conference on the Omnibus appropriations bill, the \nRepublican majority allowed this White House to assert itself and put \nin provisions that had been rejected by one or both Houses. \nSpecifically, the provision to allow increased concentration of media \nownership had been rejected by both the House and the Senate. However, \nit was included in the bill at the behest of the White House. Shameful. \nYes, shameful.\n  The House and the Senate were both on record as opposing overtime \nregulations proposed by the Bush administration. Nevertheless, at the \nurging of the Bush White House, language to block implementation of \nthese regulations was dropped from the conference report--dropped from \nthe conference report.\n  Another example of allowing the Bush White House to dictate the \nlegislation produced by the Congress is the highway bill. Here is a \nbill that is important to every State and every person in the Union. \nEvery Senator's State will benefit from this bill. The transportation \nbills passed the House and the Senate by wide bipartisan majorities, \nmajorities that could easily override a veto. Yet we are stalled \nbecause the Bush White House is demanding that the cost of the highway \nbill be significantly lower than what was passed by both Houses of \nCongress.\n  This White House, under the Bush administration, has threatened a \nveto if the cost of the bill is over its chosen number. What is meant \nby ``its''? Under the White House's chosen number. Big daddy down at \nthe White House, big daddy.\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\n  And what is the reaction of the Senate leadership to such an \noutrageous, outrageous, outrageous demand? Did the Senate stand its \nground? No. The White House offers a disapproving nod and the Senate \nleaders scurry like mice, taking the offensive proposal off the table.\n  It was not always like this. There was a time when the Senate was an \nindependent body, not the errand boy of the White House. It was not \nalways like that. It was not always that the executive branch \neffectively dictated what provisions the Congress included in \nconference reports. No, this is not how the Senate is supposed to work.\n  The Senate is like a broken bone today. Left untreated, we risk that \nthis body will be permanently weakened, never again able to do the work \nand bear the load for which it was designed.\n  I say that we must set the Senate back on course and allow it to knit \nback together. The current path is reckless, unsustainable, and unwise.\n  The record of this Senate is abysmal. Time after time, on issues such \nas medical malpractice, asbestos reform, and many others, the \nRepublican leadership has abandoned the committee process of the Senate \nto bring partisan, divisive bills to the floor to make a political \nstatement and to score political points with supporters.\n  One might dismiss the polarization of this body as a product of the \nSenate being so closely divided. But this leadership has allowed \nexternal forces--most notably pressure from the White House--to seep \ninto the dealings of the Senate.\n  Is the leadership unaware that the Constitution has separate articles \nfor the legislative and the executive branches? This is the \nConstitution. I hold it in my hand. It has separate titles for the \nexecutive and the legislative branches, does it not, Mr. McCain, my \nfriend from Arizona? Separate titles. What branch does it mention \nfirst? Not the executive branch. No, not the executive branch. No, it \nmentions first the people's branch and then the executive branch and \nthen the judicial branch.\n  What has become of civility in this branch? That is a great question. \nOne could spend a day talking about that. What has become of civility, \nold-fashioned civility? What has become of comity? What has become of \ncomity in this branch? It used to be unheard of for Senate leaders to \nseek an active role against each other in campaigns. That time has \napparently gone. Has honor gone, too? Who cares about honor when a \nSenate seat might be gained? When did party labels become more \nimportant than honor and the power of ideas?\n  Gone are the days in which there was genuine debate. Gone are the \ndays when Senators listened to the give and take of the discussion to \nlearn about an issue. And sadly, many of the votes that we take have a \npredetermined outcome. Yet they are brought to the floor--and this goes \nfor both sides of the aisle--to try to get Senators on record as voting \nfor and against such-and-such.\n  Bills are brought to the floor. Amendments are offered to create a \npublic record that can be touted or attacked come campaign season. In \nall this sound bite and fury, the losers are the people, the people out \nthere who are watching through those electronic lenses. They are the \nlosers. The losers are the people whom we represent, the people who \nsend us to this body to act in their best interests, not to squabble \nand point fingers like petulant children.\n\n  That is where all of these shenanigans play out, in front of the \nAmerican people--people who need affordable health care or help putting \ntheir children through college, people who are afraid that their jobs \nwill be sent overseas or that they will lose the pay and the benefits \nthey have worked hard to secure, people on Medicare, people on Social \nSecurity, people who worry about whether Medicare and Social Security \nwill be there when it is time for them to retire, people who have sent \ntheir sons and daughters to fight in the hot sands of the Middle East \nhalfway around the world and who are afraid that their sons and \ndaughters may not come home.\n  I have served in this Chamber for more than four decades. Times have \nchanged. The world has changed. But our responsibilities and our \nduties, may I say to the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith--\nwho always is so nice to his colleagues, always has a smile. I like \nhim. He is always a gentleman. What better can be said about one? Our \nresponsibilities and our duties as Senators have not changed, may I say \nto my friend, Mr. Smith.\n  Long after the campaign of this November or the campaigns of many \nNovembers to come, each Senator in this body will look back at the \ncontent of his or her career and judge whether they made our country a \nbetter place. The people send us here to do a job. They do not send us \nhere to play with their lives or their children's lives or to score \npolitical points.\n  It is difficult in this world of instant gratification to think \nbeyond the moment, to think beyond the immediate, but we should all \npause for a moment and reflect on the Senate.\n  The Senate is an institution that relies on precedent. What kind of \nprecedent is being set here?\n  In my many years in this body, I have spent approximately two-thirds \nof my time in the majority and one-third in the minority. The majority \nis better, by the way. I would say to the Republican leadership that it \nis unlikely that they will always be in the majority. There will come a \ntime when they may appreciate once again the rights afforded to the \nminority. We all need to spend a little time thinking about how it may \nfeel once again to be in the other guy's shoes, and about what our \nsilly, silly, little selfish games are doing to the soul of this \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am going to yield to the Senator from \nArkansas, and I hope to speak after him.\n  Briefly, I wonder if the Senator from West Virginia would permit me \nto thank him for his kind words. I have heard Senator Byrd many times \nspeak about his mother. In hearing his speech today, from a statesman \nsuch as he, he is uniquely qualified to remind us Senators as to our \ninstitutional responsibility and the importance of remembering \ncivility.\n  I remember when my mother used to say: ``Gordy, the best way to ruin \na good story is to hear the other side.'' I have remembered so much \nelse that she taught me while she was alive about treating others as I \nwould like to be treated. I appreciate Senator Byrd's civility on every \noccasion on which I have ever dealt with him. We don't vote much the \nsame, but I will tell you, we both care about coal miners, we both care \nabout timbermen, or lumbermen, we care about people who love the land. \nIn all of my dealings with him, he has always been civil and set that \nexample.\n  For that, I publicly express my appreciation and thank you, sir, for \nyour kind words.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon, as I have already \nindicated, is a gentleman. I think--in fact I know--that if all \nSenators accorded to their fellow Senators and fellow men and women the \ngraciousness that he accords us, not only the Senate but the Nation \nwould be a better place in which to live. I like him. I like him for \nwhat he is, for what he appears to be. As I said earlier, he is a \ngentleman.\n  There seems to be, as I have found, something bigger and better than \na political party. His political party does not seem to be the end-all, \nnot the beginning of everything. He seems to be something even bigger \nand better than his political party. I appreciate that, I commend him \nfor that, and I wish in many ways that I could be the man that he is. I \nremember those lines, ``You are a better man than I am, Gunga Din.'' \nThe Senator from Oregon sets a fine example. I thank him for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I notice that today we have a number of \nschoolchildren watching the proceedings. It is always great to have \npeople here watching in on us and watching what we do and hopefully \nkeeping us accountable. I hope they realize and appreciate the \ngreatness of the Senator from West Virginia and his wisdom and counsel. \nI hope they also will recall the teaching in the Bible about respecting \nyour elders. I can say that there is no Senator in this body that we, \nthe body,\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\nhave more respect for than the Senator from West Virginia. So we thank \nhim for those comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4476-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4476-S4484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I rise to talk about the ongoing war \nin Iraq, but more importantly to recognize a few of those soldiers who \nsometimes get lost in the mounting rolls of casualty listings and to \nspeak to the reality of war as seen through the eyes of a State that \nhas a long tradition of sending young men and women onto the \nbattlefield.\n  I have been in every county in my State many times, and I cannot \nthink of one county in Arkansas that does not have some sort of war \nmemorial. In fact, most of those are at the county courthouse. In fact, \nWar Memorial Stadium is in Little Rock; it is where the Razorbacks play \ntheir games. You can go all over the State and see memorials to men and \nwomen who have served and died in World War I, World War II, the Korean \nWar, Vietnam, and now we are adding memorials for those who have died \nin Iraq. In fact, in some parts of Arkansas, you can visit the graves \nof Revolutionary War soldiers who actually--even though Arkansas wasn't \neven a State or a territory during that time, we have taken those \ngraves, honored them, and we are proud that they migrated to the area \nknown as Arkansas. We feel connected to the Revolutionary War through \nthem.\n  Sometimes it is easy to feel disconnected from the war effort. Even \nthough there is 24-hour news coverage dominated by visions of our men \nand women in uniform fighting for freedom in Iraq, the pictures, words, \nand stories can have a numbing effect. We start paying attention to \nother matters, and we try to live our daily lives and try to put the \nechoes of war in the background. But sometimes all it takes is one \nevent to snap us back, to grab our attention and make us more attuned \nto the conflict we face.\n  The tragic events in Iraq in April have brought with it 115 American \nmilitary fatalities; major combat in Fallujah; and a rush of \nkidnapping, bombings, and other insurgent attacks that have terrorized \nnot just American soldiers but innocent Iraqis.\n  April has also brought our full attention as a Nation back to the war \nin Iraq. Almost a year later, we fully realize there is still work to \nbe done militarily and diplomatically, and that our mission is not yet \naccomplished.\n  As for the citizens of Arkansas, we have in the past few weeks \nexperienced both the joy and pain that is associated with being a \nstandard bearer for freedom and democracy. We are a country that has \nand will continue to risk life and limb, not only to protect our \nfreedom and liberty but to extend those same opportunities to all \npeople in all places. It is something of which we can and should be \nproud. But as we know, it often comes with the most precious sacrifice.\n  On April 22, we were fortunate enough to welcome home 106 Army \nNational Guard soldiers, members of the 1123rd Transportation Company \nbased in Marked Tree, AR, and Blytheville, AR. Also, more than 60 Army \nReserve soldiers from Company C of the 489th Engineer Battalion \nreturned to their home bases in Arkansas last week after spending more \nthan a year in Iraq. These units spent more than a year in Iraq helping \nrebuild Iraqi cities, providing protection and logistical support, and \ndestroying enemy weapons.\n  I commend these men and women for their brave service. Some of them \nwere away from their families for far longer than they expected, but \nthey are now home, and I, along with all Arkansans and all Americans, \nwelcome them back.\n  Mr. President, while Arkansans rejoiced in the news of having a \ncollection of our men and women return safely, we at the same time \nfaced the harsh reality that some of our men and women would pay the \nultimate sacrifice for freedom.\n  On Saturday, April 24, four soldiers, all members of the Arkansas \nArmy National Guard's 39th Infantry Brigade, were killed in Taji, Iraq, \nas a result of hostile fire when rockets hit their camp. An additional \nsoldier was killed a day later when a roadside bomb detonated near Sadr \nCity.\n  To let my colleagues know, there are approximately 4,200 troops in \nthe 39th Infantry Brigade, including about 2,800 Arkansans from 47 \nhometown units. The balance of the troops are from 10 other States.\n  The 39th was officially called to active duty last September, and I \nwatched their progress as they trained and prepared to fulfill their \nmission.\n  In January, I traveled to Fort Hood, TX, to visit troops from the 1st \nCavalry Division and the 39th Infantry Brigade. During my trip, I \nwitnessed demonstrations of topnotch training and cutting-edge \nequipment that will enable these soldiers to successfully carry out \ntheir mission in Iraq.\n  I again visited them at Fort Polk, LA, with other members of \nArkansas's congressional delegation. I was truly proud of what I \nwitnessed. I saw Arkansans who had undergone long days of training and \npreparation and were aware of the dangerous conditions and challenges \nthat lay ahead for them in Iraq. However, they remained in high spirits \nand were determined to carry out their mission.\n  I am inspired by these men and women, patriots all, who have taken \ndetermination and commitment to a new level. I know the sacrifice and \nthe dedication of the 39th will help bring stability and democracy to \nthe streets of Iraq.\n  We wished these soldiers well, knowing it was a matter of days before \nthey would be sent to Iraq. In March, they were sent over. Since their \ndeparture, we have all gone to bed with prayers in our minds and hope \nin our hearts that all the members of the 39th would return home \nsafely. The events of the past few weeks have prevented this from \nhappening, although we remain hopeful.\n  I stand here today to extend my deepest sympathies to their families \nand honor them for their commitment and sacrifice. The brave men and \nwomen who have surrendered their lives this weekend so others might \nenjoy freedom include:\n  U.S. Army CPT Arthur ``Bo'' Felder, 36, of Lewisville, AR. He had \nserved in the National Guard since 1986, a year after he graduated from \nLewisville High School. Felder served as a youth director at St. Luke \nMissionary Baptist Church in North Little Rock.\n  U.S. Army CWO 3 Patrick Kordsmeier, 49, of North Little Rock, AR, who \ndied tending the soldiers injured in the first blast when he was killed \nby a second attack. He was up for retirement before the war in Iraq \nbegan, but he asked for an extension so he might serve. He was born in \nLittle Rock. He reminds me of that phrase in the Bible where it talks \nabout there is no greater love than one who lays down his life for a \nfriend. That is exactly what he did;\n  U.S. Army SSG Stacey Brandon, 35, of Hazen. He was a prison guard for \nthe Arkansas Department of Correction and later worked at the Federal \nprison in Forrest City;\n  U.S. Army SSG Billy Orton, 41, of Humnoke, AR. His wife and children \nreside in Carlisle, AR, and his mother in Hazen;\n\n  U.S. Army SP Kenneth Melton, 30, of Batesville, AR. Melton was \ntraveling as part of a protection team with battalion leaders when a \nroadside bomb exploded, taking his life.\n  The events of this past weekend almost double the number of troops my \nState has previously lost during the war in Iraq. Arkansas has lost \neight soldiers prior to this weekend.\n  To put this in perspective, no single day during Vietnam saw as many \nArkansans killed by hostile fire as this past Saturday. In fact, \nSaturday's events are the bloodiest for Arkansas's soldiers since \nDecember 2, 1950, when five Arkansans were killed during combat in \nKorea.\n  I also honor the other eight soldiers who gave their lives during \ncombat in Iraq. They include:\n  U.S. Army SFC William Labadie, 45, of Bauxite, AR, who died 2 weeks \nafter being deployed. Labadie was also assigned to the 1st Cavalry, \n39th Brigade, Troop E-151 Cavalry, Camp Taji in Kuwait;\n  U.S. Army SP Ahmed ``Mel'' Cason, 24, died on April 4 in Baghdad. He \nwas assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry \nDivision in Fort Hood. Cason grew up in McGehee and many of his \nrelatives now live in Maumelle, AR;\n  U.S. Army 1LT Adam Mooney, 28, of Cambridge, MD. His helicopter went \ndown in the Tigris River in Mosul,\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\nIraq, during a search for a missing soldier. His wife now lives in \nConway, AR;\n  U.S. Army MSG Kevin Morehead, 33, a special forces soldier from \nLittle Rock who had previously received a Bronze Star with valor in \nAfghanistan, died on September 12, 2003, from hostile fire in Ramadi, \nIraq;\n  U.S. Army SP Dustin McGaugh, 20, of Derby, KS, died on September 30 \nin Balad, Iraq. His mother resides in Tulsa, OK, and his father in \nSpringdale, AR. McGaugh grew up in Springdale and joined the Army ROTC \nafter he graduated from high school in 2001;\n  U.S. Army PFC Jonathan M. Cheatham, 19, of Camden, AR, my father's \nhometown. He was assigned to the 489th Engineer Battalion, U.S. Army \nReserve, North Little Rock, AR. He was killed while riding in a convoy \nthat came under a rocket-propelled grenade attack on July 26 in \nBaghdad;\n  U.S. Marine Corps PFC Brandon Smith, 20, of Washington, AR, died \nMarch 18, 2004, in Qaim, Iraq, on the eve of the anniversary of the \nwar. He was trying to help comrades under attack when he was killed by \nmortar fire;\n  U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman Third Class Michael Vann Johnson, Jr., of \nLittle Rock, AR. He was the first Arkansan to die during Operation \nIraqi Freedom. In fact, one of my staff in Little Rock was visiting a \ndoctor several days ago and it so happened he started talking to the \nwoman who was assisting in the doctor's office, and it was Michael Vann \nJohnson's mother. It happened to be the 1-year anniversary of his death \nin Iraq.\n  We have not lost nearly as many as other States, but our loss is just \nas real. The grieving is just as sorrowful, and the fear that there may \nbe more coming is just as frightening, but our resolve is just as \nstrong.\n  This is a very real war for the people of my State. It impacts every \ncommunity. It seems as if everybody in my State knows of someone who \nhas served, is serving, or who will serve in Iraq.\n  We might not all agree on how we got where we are. We might not all \nagree with all the decisions that have been made by this \nadministration. But we stand behind our troops and are truly inspired \nby their dedication. We are proud of our professional soldiers, Guard \nmembers and reservists who left behind their families and way of life \nto fight in a land that is not theirs for people they do not know.\n  The soldiers we have lost will never be forgotten. They, along with \nall our soldiers, will be remembered for their strength and dedication \nin bringing independence to the Iraqi nation, and they will be defined \nas heroes of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Petty Officer \nNathan B. Bruckenthal for his service to the United States Coast Guard \nand his commitment to his country. Petty Officer Bruckenthal was killed \nin action in Iraq on April 25, 2004, as he sought to intercept a marine \nvessel attempting to launch a terrorist attack.\n  Petty Officer Bruckenthal's death reminds us of the dangerous mission \nthat the Coast Guard performs every day, at home and overseas, in \nsupport of the Nation's defense.\n  It is with a deep respect for the Coast Guard and the many valiant \nAmericans who serve in the Coast Guard that I come to the floor today \nto pay tribute to the first Coast Guardsmen killed in Iraq. U.S. Coast \nGuard Damage Controlman Third Class Nathan B. Bruckenthal was killed \nalong with two U.S. Navy sailors, Petty Officer First Class Michael J. \nPernaselli and Petty Officer Second Class Christopher E. Watts, trying \nto protect oil terminals off the coast of Iraq. A coordinated suicide \nbombing attack struck members of the coalition Maritime Interception \nOperations team as they attempted to board a small boat that threatened \nthe Khawr Al Amay Oil Terminal.\n  This tragic loss of the first Coast Guard member killed in battle \nsince Vietnam highlights the critical and often overlooked role of \nCoast Guard operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom. At the height of \ncombat operations, the Coast Guard had approximately 1,250 personnel \ndeployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom for port and coastal security, \nmaritime law enforcement, humanitarian aid, maintenance of navigational \nwaterways, contingency preparedness for environmental terrorism, and \ntraining the newly established Iraqi coast guard. Coast Guard support \nto Operation Iraqi Freedom continues today with approximately 300 \npeople supporting these vital operations.\n  Petty Officer Bruckenthal enlisted in the Coast Guard 6 years ago. I \nam proud to say his service included 2 years in western Washington at \nthe Coast Guard Station Neah Bay. In addition to protecting the safety \nof lives at sea, he was a dedicated citizen of the Clallum County \ncommunity. Petty Officer Bruckenthal made time to volunteer as a Neah \nBay fire fighter, an emergency medical technician, a reserve police \nofficer, and a coach for the Neah Bay High School. He was known for his \nterrific work with children and his passion for law enforcement.\n  As many brave members of our armed forces, Petty Officer Bruckenthal \nwas serving on his second tour in Iraq. He served from February 2003 to \nMay 2003 in Operation Iraqi Freedom where he received the Armed Forces \nExpeditionary Medal and the Combat Action Ribbon. He returned for a \nsecond tour in Iraq beginning February 2004. This was an extremely \ndifficult and complex mission; particularly trying to distinguish \nbetween the enemy and the average citizens. Coast Guard is carrying a \nvery heavy load in protecting the northern Arabian Gulf and the oil \nfueling stations which are essential to the recovery of the Iraqi \neconomy.\n  I have long ties to the Coast Guard. In my leadership roles on the \nTransportation and Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittees, I \nhave often noted the tremendous task the Coast Guard faces in terms of \nsecuring our Nation's ports and cargo terminals. I have applauded their \nefforts in addressing the security issues facing our country's ports. \nThe 13th Coast Guard District is known as guardians of the Pacific \nNorthwest. They have a presence in 14 locations throughout my State and \nare responsible for monitoring 200 facilities in Washington, including \n60 designated water front facilities that handle oil and hazardous \nmaterials.\n  We know that many fine young American soldiers, sailors and airmen \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice in the fight against terrorism and \nterrorists and in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have personally written to 25 \nfamilies of service men and women with ties to the State of Washington \nwho have died while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \nEnduring Freedom. Now, sadly, a proud member of the Coast Guard has \njoined the list of Americans killed in action in defense of our \ncountry. We extend our deepest sympathies and respect to Petty Officer \nBruckenthal's family and friends. We join the Coast Guard family in \nhonoring Petty Officer Nathan Bruckenthal. We will remember his brave \nservice to the Coast Guard, to our Nation's defense, and to us all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business, and after my remarks that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Environmental Policies\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be addressing a Texan, the \nPresiding Officer, at this moment. I wish to speak about a Texan. I was \nserving in the Senate for 4 years when I got a call from the Governor \nof Texas, George W. Bush, to ask if I would give him some time and \nconsider his candidacy for the Presidency of the United States.\n  I was privileged to travel to Austin, and an hour's meeting turned \ninto a half a day's meeting, as I found in this good man a man of the \nWest, a man who understood from whence he came in rural parts of Texas.\n  I represent the State of Oregon. I come from the dry side of Oregon, \na side not unlike many parts of Texas. People do not think of Oregon in \nthose terms, but many parts of Oregon are arid. My neighbors are people \nwho farm the earth, fish the rivers, the ocean, and they harvest timber \nfrom our mountains.\n  I had served for 4 years as a Senator, working with President Clinton \nand his administration, trying to make sense of his Northwest Forest \nPlan, and other proposals of his administration that had an enormous \neffect upon the State of Oregon.\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\n  It was interesting to watch the election results 4 years ago and to \nsee the diversity of voting between urban and rural places. \nOverwhelmingly, rural people voted for George W. Bush, as did I because \nI am from a rural place.\n  In my first meeting with George W. Bush, I began to discuss the \nissues of the people I serve and who elected me. I could tell in an \ninstant that he got it, that he understood. He understood water. He \nunderstood ranching. He understood farmers.\n  Should he be elected, I asked him as he formulated his environmental \npolicies to please not forget the people who I thought would vote \noverwhelmingly for him. I asked him to please try to better balance the \nenvironmental policies of the Federal Government so we did not forget \nour human stewardship as we try to implement our environmental \nstewardship.\n  We have just observed the 34th annual Earth Day. I know many in the \nenvironmental community are assembling an arsenal of millions of \ndollars to run against George W. Bush and suggest that the air has \ngotten dirtier, the water is fouler, and that the earth is more \nimbalanced because of his tenure.\n  He has not forgotten those who have elected him. He has not forgotten \nrural people. He has reconsidered and rebalanced some proposals, and \nthe air is cleaner, the water is cleaner, and the land is doing fine. \nWe have made enormous environmental progress in our country and \nsometimes we do not stop to celebrate all the progress we have made.\n  I remember as a boy growing up in Bethesda, MD, one could not safely \ngo in the Potomac River because it was so polluted. We can do that \ntoday because of the EPA, an Agency established by Richard Nixon and \nthe Congress. We can do that because of all of the efforts that have \ngone on before.\n  I used to be somewhat concerned and frustrated as President Clinton \nwould go to Virginia and West Virginia and decry rural poverty, when I \nrecognized that much of the poverty occurring in my State was as a \ndirect result of Federal policies. It used to be that in the State of \nOregon, for a long time, we harvested tremendous amounts of timber. We \nhad a very vibrant timber industry in our country.\n  Indeed, from the Pacific Northwest region alone we would average \nabout 4 billion board feet a year. I think President Clinton recognized \nthat maybe that was more than was sustainable. He promised the timber \nindustry and the people of the forest in Oregon that he would give them \n25 percent of their average harvest--that is 1 billion board feet. We \nhave probably harvested 10 percent of that since that promise was made, \nand I have witnessed tens of thousands of family wage jobs evaporate.\n  When that happens, it is not just jobs that go away. There are \nproblems with alcoholism, spousal abuse, crime, hopelessness, suicide, \nand a loss of dignity. So when one wants to know where a lot of our \njobs went, they went away because of conscious Federal policy.\n  Right now, as we barely utilize our resources in Oregon and in \nAmerica, we are overcutting in Canada. The spotted owl does not know \nthe difference. In fact, as we overcut in Canada, we watch our forests \nburn at record rates. George W. Bush, fortunately, true to his word, \nhelped with this Senate and the House of Representatives to pass a \nforest health initiative. It is a modest step but it is designed to \nmake communities safer, improve environmental health, and to harvest \ntimber. All of those things will begin to be enjoyed by the people of \nOregon again: a better environment and a better economy. Some of those \njobs can come back.\n\n  I lamented when Michael Kelly, the late columnist, lost his life in \nIraq. He put the natural resources conflict quite eloquently in a \ncolumn he wrote in 2001. He said that the battle of values over land \nuse and environmental policies, while often framed as between man and \nbeast, is better understood as between increasingly poor and powerless \nrural voters and increasingly rich and powerful urban and suburban \nvoters.\n  Kelly went on to note that the Endangered Species Act ``has been \nexploited by environmental groups whose agenda is to force humans out \nof lands they wish to see returned to a pre-human state.''\n  For my counterparts in the East, some of whom think all resource \nextraction on public lands should be off limits, I would like to give \nyou a sense of how vast the Federal presence is in my State. This \npicture is of an area known as the Biscuit Fire. The Biscuit Fire \nconsumed lands larger than the State of Rhode Island, or four times the \nsize of the District of Columbia. It destroyed countless acres of \nroadless areas, wilderness, spotted owl habitat, and salmon spawning \ngrounds. I ask how that moonscape leaves the environment better. I know \nit left the people worse.\n  The Federal Government owns over 50 percent of the State of Oregon, \nwhich amounts to almost 33 million acres; greater than the total \nacreage of 22 other individual States. So it is safe to say Federal \nland management policies have a significant impact on the people, the \neconomy, the environment, and the environmental health of my State.\n  I am proud we have a President who understands the implications of \nFederal policies on rural America. This President understands that \nhumans are part of the environmental equation, and he is working to \nmaintain domestic resource industries and to return strength to rural \neconomies.\n  So as he gets attacked in this campaign, I hope the people of Oregon \nwill understand there is a human side to this equation, and they will \nremember the compassionate conservatism he campaigned on is being \nrestored in rural places: a little compassion, a little balance.\n  In 2002, President Bush came to Oregon. He saw firsthand the \ndestruction and dislocation caused by these catastrophic wildfires. On \noccasion, I was able to share with him the importance of rebalancing \npolicies, even as it related to producing electricity. For a long time \nthere were serious people in powerful places advocating the demolition \nof hydroelectric power on the Colombia and Snake Rivers. It is the \nproduct of our prosperity in this country that we have come to a place \nwhere too many think electricity comes from a light switch, gasoline \ncomes from a service station, and timber comes from the local hardware \nstore. But all of these things come from rural places, from industries \nthat provide us the power and the means to enjoy the American way of \nlife. President Bush has had the good sense to resist some of these \nproposals that went too far and, when appropriate, to rebalance them so \npeople can have a place again in the environmental equation.\n\n  This President also is strongly committed to species conservation. \nSometimes that is missed. In fact, it will never be included in the ads \nof environmental organizations, but this President's budget for fiscal \nyear 2005 includes $100 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery \nFund, which is a $10 million increase from the year before. The \ncombined Federal funding request for Pacific salmon mitigation and \nrecovery is over $719 million, and this commitment is paying off. Ten \nyears ago a little over 200,000 chinook and 160,000 steelhead returned \nto the Bonneville Dam. But in 2003, nearly a million chinook and \n365,000 steelhead returned to that dam.\n  This President has also understood the need for a comprehensive \nnational energy policy, and that energy security is vital to our \nnational security, to say nothing of our economic security. He has \nchampioned the research and development of new fuel cell technology \nthat would lessen our dependence on imported oil. He has supported \nenergy conservation and tax credits for the production of electricity \nfrom renewable sources.\n  As energy prices remain high, and as our economy rebounds, the need \nfor a national energy policy will only continue to become more and more \nurgent.\n  President Bush is not going to get credit for these things in the ads \nof certain advocacy groups, but I hope the American people will \nremember to credit him for his care for rural people and places, for \nhis tangible efforts to restore lost family-wage jobs as it relates to \nfishing, farming, forestry, and energy production. I hope people will \nalso remember our air is cleaner, our water is cleaner--we are making \ntremendous progress. While some will say this has been rolled back, or \nthat has been changed, it is usually because something has gone too far \nand a little common sense, a little compassionate\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\nconservatism was needed to be restored to the equation.\n  On Earth Day I had wanted to come and say these things to defend the \nPresident, as he is being attacked so liberally, but time on the floor \nwas not allowed that day. So I am here this day to put in this reminder \nand ask the American people to remember: President Bush is a good \nsteward. More than that, he is a good man.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of the \nSenator from New Mexico, I be recognized for such remarks that I may \nmake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3051\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for \nhis courtesy in reserving my opportunity to speak.\n  The pending business before the Senate is the Domenici amendment \nwhich has been offered to the Internet tax bill. I thought it would be \nuseful to try to talk about that legislation and the substance of that \nlegislation, at least to some extent this afternoon, before we get to a \ncloture vote tomorrow. This amendment, of course, is the Energy bill. \nFor those who have not focused on it, this is the amendment I hold in \nmy hand. It is 913 pages. It is called the Energy Policy Act of 2003.\n  Unfortunately, not a lot has changed since the beginning of the floor \ndebate that we had in the Congress last May, or when we debated the \nenergy conference report last November. We have before us proposed \nlegislation that I believe does not command the broad public support \nthat we need in order to have a national energy policy.\n  I would cite three categories of problems with the bill. First, I \nwill talk about some of the objectionable provisions in the bill and \ngive examples of concerns in that area. Second, I will talk about some \nmeritorious provisions which the Senate has previously passed as part \nof the Energy bill that we acted upon in this Congress and in the \nprevious Congress but which have been deleted from this bill, which I \nthink is a mistake. Finally, I will talk about the legislative thicket \nthat we would be wading into if in fact we invoked cloture on this \namendment.\n  First, let me talk about this category of objectionable provisions \nthat are contained in the Domenici amendment. There are fairly good \nprovisions in the bill as well. Let me say that at the outset. Many of \nthose are ones we have included in legislation previously passed in the \nSenate. I do not mean to imply that there are not good provisions in \nthe bill. But let me start the list of examples of objectionable \nprovisions by talking a little about electricity and the efforts that \nwe made in the Senate regarding the regulation of electricity markets.\n\n  The new amendment substantially fails to protect electricity \nconsumers from market manipulation, including most of the schemes that \nwere used in California by Enron and other companies that were acting \nin the same way that Enron was. It makes illegal only one specific \npractice that was used by Enron, that is round-trip trading. It \npotentially leaves an inference that Congress does not view the other \nschemes as equally problematic.\n  The Senate voted last year, 57 to 40, for a broad ban on market \nmanipulation. I strongly believe that was the right way for us to vote \non this issue. I do not understand the rationale for ignoring a past \nstrong Senate vote on this subject in an effort to prohibit market \nmanipulation.\n  The amendment also contains a proposal to shift the cost of \nconstructing new transmission from one set of parties in the electric \nutility industry to another. Trying to legislate rate design is \nprobably never a good idea. In the form of so-called participant \nfunding that is contained in this amendment, it is particularly \negregious. Its effect would be to create a huge disincentive for the \nconstruction of new transmission by corporations that are not already \nin a substantial monopoly position in a given region.\n  Why should we want to cut down on the number of companies interested \nin building generation and transmission? I fear that is what this \namendment, as it currently stands, would do. The new amendment repeals \nthe Public Utility Holding Company Act. It does so, however, without \nany other provisions being added to ensure that electric or gas mergers \nor acquisitions had to be in the public interest, without any real \nprotection for the ability of State public utility commissions to \nprotect consumers against cross-subsidization or other abuses.\n  If there were such protections, it would be my inclination to support \nthe repeal of PUHCA, and I have supported the repeal of PUHCA in the \npast. But I think a world of untrammeled mergers of electric utility \ncompanies is going to turn out to be bad for electricity consumers.\n  The amendment also overreaches, in my view, in the response to the \nstandard market design rulemaking. It basically throws into question \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's authority to issue rules of \ngeneral applicability that are other than the standard market design \nrule. If we have another price crisis in this country as we have in \nCalifornia, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will be unable to \nintervene as it ultimately did in California and in the West. Since \nstandard market design is, for all practical purposes, a dead issue at \nthis point, I do not see why we are still trying to address it in the \nclumsy way it is addressed in the amendment.\n  Let me move on from electricity and the whole issue of oil and gas.\n  With respect to the dependence on foreign oil, the bill has some \nproblematic provisions, both on the efficiency side and on the supply \nside. One provision in the amendment would increase U.S. gasoline \ndemand over the current law by 11 billion gallons by 2020. Given \ntoday's prices at the pump, that would seem to me to be a step in the \nwrong direction.\n  With respect to oil and gas production, the bill mixes up the worthy \ngoal of getting more energy development on Indian lands with provisions \nthat weaken the National Environmental Policy Act process--the NEPA \nprocess--with the change in the trust relationship between Indian \ntribes and the Department of the Interior. The trust relationship has \nnothing to do with energy, and the change contemplated by this bill is \nvigorously opposed by several Indian tribes. I do not know why it needs \nto be included in this amendment either.\n  The new amendment adds some other new provisions related to the oil \nand gas industry that, in my view, are likely to backfire when they \nactually get implemented. The first of these provides the cost of NEPA \nanalyses can be pushed off on oil and gas producers to be recovered by \nthem at some future date from their royalty stream to the government, \nif one ever develops from the lease for which the NEPA work was done. \nThis is essentially a mandate that producers give the Federal \nGovernment the equivalent of an interest-free loan with the producers \npaying for something they thought they had already paid for through \ntheir taxes.\n  If this amendment were to become law, there would be much greater \npressure to let producers bear the entire cost of preparing the \nGovernment's NEPA documents with a theoretical cost recovery by them at \nsome point in the future. I do not think this is good public policy.\n  A second provision that could backfire is the very detailed \nmicromanagement of the permit approval process in the Government with \nextremely tight deadlines like a 10-day deadline for agency action. \nThis is likely to result in a great deal of paperwork to explain why \nthe 10-day limit was exceeded for such permits, and the effort spent on \ngenerating all of the defensive paperwork will probably come at the \nexpense of actually getting permits done.\n  What we need and what I have strongly supported is getting more \nresources into the field offices of the Department of the Interior to \neliminate the backlogs that are there at the present time. That is what \nwe should be focused on--not on micromanaging the bureaucratic process.\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\n  With respect to coal, the new amendment waters down the Clean Coal \nTechnology Program in some very important ways. It lowers the fraction \nof funds in the program that needs to be spent on the cleanest \ntechnologies from what we have previously agreed to here in the Senate. \nIt also sets up a brand new competing program to the Clean Coal \nTechnology Program. Under that program, the Federal Government will \ncontribute up to $1.8 billion to the utility industry to help foot the \nbill for off-the-shelf coal and pollution control technology for \nexisting coal plants. I don't see how this subsidy makes sense from the \npoint of view of energy, or the environment, or our budget situation.\n  With respect to renewables, the new amendment authorizes grants to \nburn biomass for energy, but then it fails to protect old-growth \nforests. Under the amendment, old-growth forests could be cut down with \nFederal grants for use as an energy source. I think that is \nobjectionable. An imperative for Federal energy policy legislation has \nto be to recognize the ways in which energy use and energy policy is \nintertwined with the environment.\n  In this area, the amendment we have before us has some major \nfailures. If enacted, it would be the first statute in years to \nsubstantially roll back environmental protections for our citizens and \nthose rollbacks have nothing to do with improving our energy security.\n  For example, the amendment loosens ozone attainment standards \nnationwide. To its credit, EPA in the last few weeks has taken \ndefinitive steps in the opposite direction; that is, for tough \nstandards for ozone control. I don't know why we should vote in the \nSenate to undercut the progress the EPA is making. Further changing \nozone standards is a topic that has never received Senate consideration \nin the past on any energy bill.\n  The particular provision I am describing here materialized for the \nfirst time in one of last year's closed-door conference discussions.\n  The conference report also exempts oil and gas construction sites \nfrom the Clean Water Act, even large sites that have been under \nregulation for years. It contains numerous provisions that are \ninconsistent with a thoughtful environmental review process under NEPA.\n  I could go on at some length here pointing out problems in the bill.\n  I have a letter I received today from Trout Unlimited and various \nIndian tribes in the Northwest and other outdoor sportsmen's groups--41 \ngroups in total--that talks about problems they see with the \nhydroelectric provisions in this amendment. It is a letter sent to all \nSenators and I am sure all Senators have received it.\n  They say:\n\n       We urge you to oppose cloture on the amendment and support \n     amendments to fix or eliminate the hydro provisions from the \n     energy bill.\n\n  They also go on to say:\n\n       At this point, the adoption of the hydropower title would \n     significantly complicate the implementation of these new \n     rules and would lengthen the licensing process.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, these are some of the many problems \ncontained in the pending amendment. I am sure colleagues will come to \nthe floor and mention others they particularly are focused on.\n  Let me talk about the second class of problems which consists of the \ngood and needed energy policy provisions the amendment leaves out, even \nthough those in most cases I am going to discuss are ones we in the \nSenate have passed as part of the Energy bill we sent to conference.\n  First of all, the amendment steps backward from the old conference \nreport that was brought to the Senate last fall in one important area; \nthat is, in renewing the Federal Government's ability to enter into \nemergency savings performance contracts. This is one of the Federal \nGovernment's primary tools for improving energy efficiency in Federal \nfacilities. I don't know why we would not want to include that in any \nenergy bill we passed here in the Senate. We have included it in the \nbills we have passed previously.\n  Second, the new amendment lacks something that enjoys majority \nsupport in the Senate; that is, a renewable portfolio standard for \nelectricity.\n  Along with the tax incentives in the FSC/ETI bill, this measure is \nessential, in my view, in order to give new certainty to the fledgling \nmarket to allow economies of scale to drive down costs and improve \nmanufacturing capacity for renewable energy equipment in the United \nStates.\n  The Energy Information Agency agrees with this analysis. They have \ncome up with their own analysis that shows this renewable portfolio \nstandard is effective in getting more renewables into the market beyond \nwhat tax incentives would do. That would relieve some of the pressure \non national gas prices over the long term.\n\n  Another problem that is unaddressed in the bill deals with \ndistributed generation such as combined heat and power at industrial \nfacilities. The amendment does not address the barriers that have been \nerected to uniform interconnection of distributed generation to the \ngrid. It is not enough to have the technology; we need to rid ourselves \nof the redtape that is keeping the technology from being used. The \namendment, unfortunately, does not do that.\n  With respect to reducing our dependence on foreign oil, the new \namendment leaves out another important proposal that has overwhelming \nsupport in the Senate. That would be the innovative amendment offered \nlast year by Senator Landrieu to promote oil savings economy-wide. That \namendment passed this body 99-1 as part of our debate of an energy \nbill. Again, I see no reason why that should not be included if we are \ngoing to, in fact, pass an energy bill.\n  The new amendment also entirely ducks the important issue of climate \nchange. Climate change is closely related to energy policy because the \ntwo most prominent greenhouse gases--that is, carbon dioxide and \nmethane--are largely released due to energy production in use. Every \nstudy of how to mitigate the possibility of global climate change comes \nup with a list of policy measures which relies heavily on increased \nenergy efficiency and new energy production technologies with lower \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Because of this connection, much of the \nenergy policy and much of the climate change policy has to be discussed \ntogether. To do one is, by implication, to do the other; to ignore one \nwhile doing the other is to risk unfortunate and unintended \nconsequences.\n  The Senate has previously passed energy bills with numerous \nprovisions to ensure that we integrate climate change strategy with \nenergy policy, develop better climate change science, and that we focus \non breakthrough technologies with better environmental performance, and \nthe United States takes the lead in exporting the clean energy \ntechnologies we develop. These provisions do not receive even the \nslightest consideration or mention in the amendment that has been put \nforward. Leaving climate change out of the energy legislation is a very \nshortsighted approach, both in terms of energy policy and in terms of \nour overall relations with the rest of the world.\n  Finally, let me talk about this third major problem, and that is the \nway we are being asked to go about legislating on energy with this \ncloture vote on this amendment added to the Internet tax bill. This has \nto do with the fact that all of the above problems are encompassed in \nthe 913-page amendment. Because it is a second-degree amendment, all \n913 pages are, at the moment, unamendable. It is a take-it-or-leave-it \nproposition for the Senate at this point.\n  Let us suppose a cloture is invoked on this second-degree amendment \nand it was then adopted to the first-degree Daschle amendment. At that \npoint, Senators who wish to change language currently contained within \nthe Domenici amendment could only do so by offering a complete \nsubstitute amendment for the whole 913-page amendment. Senators who \nwish to add new subject matter, not seeking to change what is currently \nin the Domenici amendment, would do so by offering amendments that \nwould be added onto the end of the amendment. But whenever the first \nsubstitute amendment fixing a problem within the Domenici amendment was \nadopted, no further amendments to the amended Daschle amendment would \nbe in order.\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\n  To have further amendment opportunities, Senators would then have to \nagree to adopt the Daschle amendment to the underlying text of S. 150. \nAt that point, Senators with new ideas could still add new amendments \naddressing those new ideas but--and this is significant--Senators who \nstill want to address problems remaining in the text would have to \nwrite so-called ``bigger bite'' amendments.\n  As an example of what I am talking about, a Senator wishing to change \nsomething on page 600 of this 913-page amendment would have to write an \namendment containing part of S. 150 and the first 599 pages of the \nDomenici amendment, and then the Senator would have to make sure the \namendment made substantive changes both to the text of S. 150 and to \nthe Domenici amendment. Successful amendments of this sort could take \nbigger bites that would unwittingly screen out other such amendments \nother Senators might want to offer.\n  If this sounds convoluted as a way to do business in the Senate, that \nis because it is. If anyone wants to stand up and say this amendment \nwould be fully amendable even if we invoke cloture tomorrow, I guess \nthere is some technical argument to the effect that is true, but the \nreality is, all Senators with interests in changing specific problems \nin this 913 pages would find themselves at a considerable and perhaps \noverwhelming disadvantage compared to the normal way we go about \namending bills in the Senate.\n  So for both substantive and procedural reasons, I think proceeding to \ninvoke cloture on the Domenici amendment is not the best course of \naction for the Senate. I believe we have better options for enacting \nenergy issues in this Congress than this convoluted amendment \nsituation. Those options would be to take the most pressing energy \nneeds and promising energy opportunities and act directly on those \nwithout getting mired in the many controversies that are contained in \nthis amendment.\n  The Senate has already made a start in that direction. Over the past \nfew months, the Senate has incorporated both large chunks and smaller \npieces of the energy conference report into other legislation it has \neither passed or hopefully is going to pass. The prime example, of \ncourse, is the unanimous agreement to incorporate the Senate's \nbipartisan energy tax package into the FSC/ETI bill. We have also acted \nseparately on LIHEAP reauthorization, the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program reauthorization, putting that in a separate bill, S. \n1786, which passed the Senate on February 12. Other sections of the \nEnergy bill were put into the highway bill, which has also passed the \nSenate.\n  I have pointed out for some time now that there are a number of \nadditional provisions from the conference report that have broad \nbipartisan support that we could act on. Instead of mixing them with \nthe Internet tax bill, we ought to separate them and pass them \nindividually.\n  One such provision, of course, is the legislation related to \nelectricity reliability. Congress has been working on this over three \nCongresses now. Senator Cantwell has proposed freestanding legislation \nand has come to the Senate floor twice now and asked unanimous consent \nto pass this bill. Her requests have been denied. I urge my colleagues \nto let this bipartisan bill pass. There is no reason why this much \nneeded provision should be held hostage to more controversial energy \nprovisions.\n  Another noncontroversial energy provision is related to the Alaska \ngas pipeline. The needed fiscal incentives to build the pipeline are \nnow in the FSC/ETI bill. That is a great development. Why can't we go \nahead and pass the provisions to streamline the regulatory approvals \nfor the pipeline by unanimous consent? I am not aware of anyone in the \nSenate who objects to doing that.\n  A third example where the Senate could act very easily, in my view, \nwould be to renew the authority for energy savings performance \ncontracts. This is an important energy matter that has broad bipartisan \nsupport. I pointed that out. As I have also pointed out, it has been \ntotally deleted from this amendment.\n  I could go on and point to other provisions related to the oil and \ngas industry, to energy efficiency, to research and development, and to \nother topics that are probably also easy enough to pass on a bipartisan \nbasis. It does not make sense to take the position that we cannot do \nany single thing related to energy unless we tie it to the resolution \nof every other controversial issue in energy policy. In my view, that \nis counterproductive.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree with me that the current amendment \nbefore the Senate is not the path we should take to move forward.\n  I think there has been too much partisanship on energy in this \nCongress. In my view, that is unfortunate. Taking an especially \npartisan approach to formulating the policy has not been a recipe for \nsuccess. I hope the Senate will not proceed forward with this amendment \nand will proceed forward with the underlying Internet tax bill. I do \nnot believe this amendment provides the right balance between energy \nsupply, energy efficiency, and the protection of the environment. We \ncan do better for this Nation by passing the sensible energy provisions \nthat are broadly supported in this body, and passing them soon.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nTribal Nations and River Conservationists Call on the Senate To Oppose \nCloture on Senator Domenici's Second Degree Amendment To Add the Energy \n Bill (S. 2095) to the Internet Tax Bill--Provisions Harmful to Rivers \n        and Fish Must Be Fixed or Eliminated in the Energy Bill\n\n                                                   April 28, 2004.\n       Dear Senator: Last year, the conference committee agreed to \n     profound changes to the Federal Power Act contained in the \n     proposed hydropower title of the Energy Bill. These changes \n     turn 80 years of law on its head by significantly changing \n     Sections 33(b), 4(e), and 18 of the Federal Power Act. Under \n     the new statute, States, Tribes and interested citizens \n     would, for the first time, be afforded inferior status in the \n     process for establishing fish passage and other public land \n     protections on hydropower licenses. Today, Senator Domenici \n     is trying to add the Energy bill, S. 2095, containing these \n     provisions to the Internet Tax Bill. We urge you to oppose \n     cloture on his amendment, and support amendments to fix or \n     eliminate the hydro provisions from the Energy bill.\n       Under these provisions, a given license applicant would \n     offer alternative conditions contrary to what the Secretaries \n     of the Interior, Commerce, or Agriculture may have \n     recommended, and provide them with an unfair and exclusive \n     opportunity to specify the level of protection for public \n     lands (including Indian lands) or implementation of fish \n     passage. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this language \n     is the establishment of a new administrative appeals process \n     in the form of a ``trial-type'' hearing. Both this new \n     ``hearing'' and the right to require the agencies to accept \n     alternative conditions are available only to dam owners. \n     Other interests already full parties to FERC proceedings, \n     including states, tribes, irrigators, landholders, and \n     environmental are prohibited from gaining party status in \n     this process. To suggest that State and Tribal governments or \n     local citizens should not be able to exercise their role as \n     full parties to hydro licensing when hydropower dam operators \n     proposed alternatives that could damage fisheries and public \n     lands is nothing less than an attack on basic democratic \n     principles.\n       Today, there is even less reason to adopt the language from \n     last year's conference. On July 23, 2003, FERC finalized new \n     rules that establish a new licensing process--Integrated \n     Licensing--designed collaboratively by industry, FERC, State \n     and Tribal governments and the public interest community. See \n     ``Hydroelectric Licensing Under the Federal Power Act; Final \n     Rule,'' 68 Fed. Reg. 51069-51143 (August 25, 2003). This new \n     process specifically addresses the longstanding concerns that \n     inadequate interagency coordination has resulted in delays \n     and unnecessary costs in licensing decisions. Under this \n     process, licensees along with the other parties are provided \n     with opportunities to work collaboratively with the \n     conditioning agencies on the development of public land \n     protections and fishways in FERC licensing. The process will \n     run on a strict clock to assure a relicensing decision before \n     expiration of an original license, as the hydropower industry \n     requested. The rules also require FERC to conduct \n     consultation with tribes affected by the licensing. At this \n     point, the adoption of hydropower title would significantly \n     complicate the implementation of these new rules (for \n     example, by requiring Commerce, Agriculture and Interior to \n     undertake their own further rulemakings), and would lengthen \n     the licensing process. Without question, they will add a new \n     layer of red tape to a process that has not even been given a \n     chance to work.\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\n       Yesterday, amendment was offered to the Internet tax \n     legislation on the Senate floor that includes the Hydropower \n     Title. We ask you to vote ``no'' on cloture for Senator \n     Domenici's amendment. We also ask you to oppose any efforts \n     to attach or otherwise pass the hydropower title and its \n     provisions that are so contrary to the interests of State and \n     Tribal governments and local citizens. Let's give these new \n     FERC regulations an opportunity to work.\n       We thank you for your continued leadership on this issue to \n     ensure that our nation's rivers remain a public resource for \n     all to use and enjoy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                          The 9/11 Commission\n\n  Madam President, earlier, I spoke on the importance of the 9/11 \nCommission maintaining its credibility given the important mission that \norganization has undertaken to determine, first, a factual record of \nthe events leading up to 9/11, and then to make recommendations to \nCongress and various Government agencies on how we can continue to \nprotect our homeland against any further terrorist attacks on our own \nsoil.\n  I spoke about the need of one of the Commissioners, Commissioner \nJamie Gorelick, to provide information about her knowledge of relevant \nfacts. She, of course, was Deputy Attorney General during the Clinton \nadministration under Attorney General Janet Reno.\n  I also made one other point that I think bears repeating here now; \nthat is, this is not about blame. The only person and the only entity \nto blame for the events of 9/11 are al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. This \nis not about blaming the Clinton administration or the Bush \nadministration. This is about getting to the facts. This is about \ngetting good recommendations based on all the information and then \nmaking the American people safer as a result.\n  On Monday, Senator Lindsey Graham and I asked the Justice Department \nto produce any documents they may have in their possession relating to \nJamie Gorelick's involvement in establishing policies preventing the \nsharing of critical terrorism-related information between intelligence \nand law enforcement officials. It is the fact that those have now been \nmade public and, indeed, posted on the Department of Justice's Web site \nat www.usdot.gov which brings me back to the Senate floor to briefly \nmention why I think Ms. Gorelick's testimony is even more important to \nexplaining what she did as a member of the Justice Department under \nJanet Reno to erect and buttress this wall that has been the subject of \nso much conversation and why it is so much more important that she do \nso because the 9/11 Commission's credibility is at stake.\n  Documents posted today on the Justice Department's Web site \nsubstantially discredit Ms. Gorelick's recent claims that, No. 1, she \nwas not substantially involved in the development of the new \ninformation-sharing policy, and, No. 2, the Department's policies under \nthe Clinton-Reno administration enhanced rather than restricted \ninformation sharing.\n  Madam President, these documents--and they are not particularly \nlengthy, but they do raise significant questions about the decision of \nthe Commission not to have Ms. Gorelick testify in public. Indeed, the \nonly testimony we know she has given has been in secret or in camera, \nto use the technical term. These documents make it even more important \nthat we get her explanation for these apparent inconsistencies and \ncontradictions.\n  Indeed, the document that Attorney General Ashcroft declassified and \nreleased during the course of his testimony --giving his very powerful \ntestimony about the erection and the buttressing of this wall that \nblinded American law enforcement and intelligence agencies from the \nthreat of al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden--these new documents reveal, \nindeed, Ms. Gorelick did have a key role in establishing that policy, \nwhich was ultimately signed off on and approved by Attorney General \nJanet Reno; indeed, that she received and rejected in part and accepted \nin part recommendations made by the U.S. attorney for the Southern \nDistrict of New York with regard to this wall.\n\n  Specifically, Madam President, as you will recall, the first attack \non American soil that al-Qaida administered was, in all likelihood, the \nWorld Trade Center bombing in 1993. Indeed, the document that Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft released pointed out that Mary Jo White, the U.S. \nattorney for the Southern District of New York, was concerned about an \nongoing criminal investigation ``of certain terrorist acts, including \nthe bombing of the World Trade Center,'' and that ``[d]uring the course \nof those investigations significant counterintelligence information \n[had] been developed related to the activities and plans of agents of \nforeign powers operating in [the United States] and overseas, including \npreviously unknown connections between separate terrorist groups.''\n  Well, in response to some draft proposals for establishing criteria \nfor both law enforcement and intelligence, counterterrorism officials, \nMs. Gorelick noted that the procedures that were adopted at her \nrecommendation by the Justice Department under Attorney General Janet \nReno went beyond what is legally required. Indeed, I spoke earlier \nabout the fact that the USA PATRIOT Act brought down that law that had \nbeen established both by this policy and, indeed, by policies that had \npreceded it.\n  But it is important, in these new documents that have just been \nrevealed today, in response to my request and Senator Graham's request, \nthat there is, indeed, a memorandum by Mary Jo White dated June 13, \n1995, in which she was given an opportunity to respond to the proposed \nprocedures that have maintained and buttressed this wall that blinded \nAmerica to this terrible threat.\n  Mary Jo White, in part, said--and the documents are on the website so \nanyone who wishes can see the whole document, but she said, in part:\n\n       It is hard to be totally comfortable with instructions to \n     the FBI prohibiting contact with United States Attorney's \n     Offices when such prohibitions are not legally required. . . \n     .\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       Our experience has been that the FBI labels of an \n     investigation as intelligence or law enforcement can be quite \n     arbitrary depending upon the personnel involved and that the \n     most effective way to combat terrorism is with as few labels \n     and walls as possible so that wherever permissible, the right \n     and left hands are communicating.\n\n  Indeed, it was this lack of communication, which I think is \nuniversally acknowledged, that contributed to the blinding of America \nto the threat of terrorism leading up to the events of 9/11. So Ms. \nWhite made what she called a very modest compromise and some \nrecommendations for change to this proposed policy.\n  In the interest of fairness and completeness, let me just say the \ndocuments reveal there were two memoranda by U.S. Attorney Mary Jo \nWhite, and they contain recommendations for revisions of the \npolicy, and that Ms. Gorelick, through and in cooperation with Michael \nVatis, Deputy Director of the Executive Office for National Security, \naccepted some of those proposed changes and rejected others.\n\n  But then in these documents, again, which were finally disclosed \ntoday in response to Senator Graham's and my request, there is a \nhandwritten note from Ms. Gorelick that says:\n\n       To the AG--I have reviewed and concur with the Vatis/\n     Garland recommendations for the reasons set forth in the \n     Vatis memo. Jamie.\n\n  So it is clear Ms. Gorelick was intimately involved with \nconsideration of the arguments, both pro and con, on establishing this \npolicy which, according to her own memo, went well beyond what the law \nrequired. Thus, it becomes even more clear she is a person with \nknowledge of facts that are relevant and indeed essential to the \ndecisionmaking process of the 9/11 Commission.\n  I wish it stopped there, but it does not. Indeed, it appears these \nnew documents contradict or at least require clarification by Ms. \nGorelick of subsequent statements that she has made on the 9/11 \nCommission. For example, in a broadcast on CNN's Wolf Blitzer Reports, \nWolf Blitzer asked her:\n\n       Did you write this memorandum in 1995 . . .\n\n  By reference, this was the one that was declassified by Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft that established these procedures building the wall \nand blinding America to this terrible threat.\n  He asked:\n\n\n[[Page S4483]]\n\n\n       Did you write this memorandum in 1995 that helped establish \n     the so-called walls between the FBI and CIA?\n\n  Ms. Gorelick said:\n\n       No. And again, I would refer you back to what others on the \n     commission have said. The wall was a creature of statute. It \n     existed since the mid-1980s. And while it is too lengthy to \n     go into, basically the policy that was put out in the mid \n     1990s, which I didn't sign, wasn't my policy in any way. It \n     was the Attorney General's policy, was ratified by Attorney \n     General Ashcroft's deputy as well on August of 2001.\n\n  In other words, Ms. Gorelick, notwithstanding the fact that her \ninitials as Deputy Attorney General appear on the very memos \nconsidering recommendations, both pro and con, with regard to \nestablishing these procedures, in spite of the fact she appears by \nthese documents to have been intimately involved in the adoption and \nestablishment of these procedures, said: I didn't sign this memorandum \nand it wasn't my policy.\n  Well, at the very least it is clear that it was the policy of the \nAttorney General, based on her explicit recommendation, and that she \nconsciously adopted in some cases and rejected in others the \nrecommendation of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New \nYork with regard to sharing of information between law enforcement and \ncounterintelligence authorities.\n  Finally, another example of an apparent contradiction, and maybe one \nthat Ms. Gorelick could explain if she would testify in public, as I \nand others have requested, before the Commission, she said in an op-ed \nthat appeared in the Washington Post, April 18, 2004, entitled ``The \nTruth About the Wall,'' in giving the various reasons for her side of \nthe story in response to the testimony of Attorney General Ashcroft and \nthe revelation of this previously classified document:\n\n       Nothing in the 1995 guidelines prevented the sharing of \n     information between criminal and intelligence investigators.\n\n  That appears to directly contradict what is contained in these \ndocuments. I would imagine if asked to provide her own testimony, Mary \nJo White, the now retired former U.S. attorney for the Southern \nDistrict of New York, would beg to differ.\n  The primary purpose of this is not to cast blame. We know where the \nblame lies. But it is important the 9/11 Commission get an accurate \nrecord, a historical record of the events leading up to September 11. \nIf, in fact, there is a way for Ms. Gorelick to shed some light on this \nsubject, indeed, if there is a way for her to clarify or reconcile the \napparent contradictions between what these newly released records \ndemonstrate and her public statements and writings, then she ought to \nbe given a chance to do so.\n  If she does not avail herself of that opportunity, if the Commission \nrefuses to hear from this person in public and to give the American \npeople the benefit of this testimony in public in a way that they have \ndone with Attorney General Janet Reno and former FBI Director Louis \nFreeh, current FBI Director Robert Mueller, George Tenet, Director of \nCentral Intelligence, and Attorney General John Ashcroft, if they \nrefuse, if they continue to refuse to avail themselves of this public \ntestimony and the opportunity for questions to be asked about these \napparent contradictions, they will have administered a self-inflicted \nwound. The public will be left, at the conclusion of the 9/11 \nCommission, with grave doubts about the impartiality and the judgment \nof the Commissioners who have refused to allow the American people the \nbenefit of this relevant and important testimony.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                             Internet Taxes\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as we move to conclusion of the debate on \nthe question of Internet taxes and votes tomorrow, as has happened so \noften over the last 8 years that we have dealt with this issue, a lot \nof Senators have asked for some examples of how all this would work \nbecause it is obviously an extraordinarily complicated issue, and the \nterminology is pretty dense. What I wanted to do was give Senators a \nsense of what we are talking about.\n  Of course, under the McCain proposal, Senator Allen and I would \nsimply say, with respect to Internet access, it is tax free. You have \nalready paid for it. It is like buying a carton of milk. You have \nalready paid for it once. You should not have to pay for it again when \nyou pour it on your cereal. That is essentially what the McCain \ncompromise would do.\n  The proposal offered by the Senator from Tennessee takes a very \ndifferent kind of tack. I wanted to give a very specific example of how \nit would work and why I am opposed to what he has been advocating. The \nSenator from Tennessee, in his proposal, stipulates that there would be \nno taxes on services used ``to connect a purchaser of Internet access \nto the Internet access provider.''\n  That certainly sounds like a laudable goal and something everyone \nshould support. But because the Senator from Tennessee nowhere defines \nwhat the word ``connect'' means, I am of the view that proposal alone \nmeans that scores of jurisdictions in our country would be able to \nsubject a simple message, sent by a Blackberry via DSL, to scores of \ntaxes.\n  I want to walk through exactly why I believe that. Let us say, for \npurposes of discussing an example, you send a Blackberry message via \nDSL from Providence, RI, to Portland, OR. You type your message in and \nyou hit send.\n  The first connection--again, I am citing that because it is the \nlanguage of the Alexander proposal--is with a cell tower in Providence. \nThis would then be connected to a Verizon local phone line somewhere in \nthe Northeast. Then it would be connected to a switch, again somewhere \non the east coast. The message at that point is connected to AT at a \nnetwork in one of their many facilities on the east coast. AT would \nthen shoot the message across scores of States and connect it at a \nQwest switch in Portland, in my home State. That Qwest switch then \nconnects the message to a cell tower in Portland. And then, finally, it \nconnects it to the friend in Portland.\n  The way that message is sent could involve as many as 100 different \nconnections--the concept that is not defined in the Alexander proposal. \nBut depending on how the word ``connect'' is defined--and it is not \nlaid out anywhere in the proposal of the Senator from Tennessee--you \ncould have hundreds of jurisdictions imposing taxes on the one message \nI have just described as being sent on a Blackberry from Providence, \nRI, to Portland, OR.\n  The reason why that is the case is the Alexander proposal states no \ntaxes would be applied on services used to connect a purchaser of \nInternet to the Internet access provider. But in the example I just \ngave, what you would have is scores of jurisdictions across the country \nsaying they are not the exempted connection. They would say they are \nnot the exempted connection, and then they would be off to the races, \nin terms of imposing these special taxes.\n  So we are going to have a chance, I think tomorrow, to extend this \ndebate a bit longer. I think people are going to be pretty close to \necstasy to have this debate wrap up, given how long it has gone. But I \nwant to take a minute and try to recap what I think are the central \nkinds of questions.\n  From the very beginning, those who have been involved in this effort \nhave tried to promote technological neutrality. We have come back again \nand again to say all we would like is to make sure that what happens in \nthe offline world is applicable to the online world. We have said it \ndoes not make sense today to discriminate against the future, which is \nbroadband delivered through DSL. Certainly, that would be the case if \ncable gets a free ride and DSL gets hammered.\n  I am of the view the message you get today under the Alexander \nproposal--instead of that message, ``you've got mail,'' the message \nwill be ``you've got special taxes,'' and you will have those special \ntaxes because terms like the one I have described this afternoon are \nnot defined.\n  As I have talked about in the last couple of days, we have pointed \nout the revenue estimates, which are always so dire in terms of lost \nrevenue on the part of the States and localities, and time after time--\nand we have debated this in the last 8 years--those revenue projections \nhave not come to pass. I know Senators and their staffs right now are \nbeing bombarded by some officials from State and local governments, \nsaying they are going to lose\n\n[[Page S4484]]\n\nenormous amounts of money, and this is going to drain their revenue \nbase, and it will have calamitous financial ramifications.\n  But as you listen to those projections--and I know they are pouring \ninto Senators' offices--we have heard those arguments again and again, \nand they have not come to pass. I point out, for example--and I will \nquote--in 1997, the National Governors Association said the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act ``would cause the virtual collapse of the \nState and local revenue base.''\n\n  The chairman of the Commerce Committee worked with myself and Senator \nStevens and others, and we passed the legislation. The Governors said \nthat revenue base was going to collapse. But in the next year, local \nand State tax revenues were up $7.2 billion. That is one example from \nover the last 8 years and the journey we have had in the debate over \nthis legislation.\n  The same thing happened in 2001. Those who opposed our legislation \nsaid: The growth of e-commerce represents a significant threat to State \nand local tax revenues and they might lose tax revenue in the \nneighborhood of $20 billion in 2003.\n  According to the National Association of State Budget Officers, State \nsales tax collections rose from $134.5 billion in 2001 to $160 billion \nin 2003, an increase of more than $25 billion in 2 years.\n  We heard again and again this would be devastating to mom-and-pop \nstores on Main Streets, and pretty much the Main Streets of Maine and \nOregon would shrivel up because of the special fix that was provided \nfor sales online. Over the entire period this law has been on the \nbooks, the number of sales online has gone up something like 1.5 \npercent. It has been a tiny fraction of our economy.\n  The fact is, the major development over the 8 years we have had this \nlegislation on the books is we have essentially seen most of our \nbusinesses go to ``bricks and clicks.'' If you walk on the streets of \nMaine, or the streets of Oregon, our smallest businesses so often are \nable to expand their sales because they have a significant online \ncomponent, and people from all over the world can shop at a small store \nin Maine or Oregon. I think as the Chair will note, these small stores \ndon't have big advertising budgets. They cannot send people all over \nthe world to market their products. Because of the Internet, they are \nin a position to have a global marketplace. So major development in \nthis field, rather than wiping out Main Street stores, has helped them.\n  Senator Leahy brought in a small merchant from Vermont who talked to \nus specifically about the extraordinary gains they have been able to \nmake as a result of the convenience provided by Internet shopping, \nwhich will certainly be harmed if the Alexander legislation were to \npass.\n  I imagine we will continue to pummel this subject a bit more \ntomorrow. Having been involved in this issue for 8 years, I think it is \nfair to say the decision the Senate makes on this subject will say a \nwhole lot about the future of the Internet. We learned this morning, as \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee pointed out, we are already \nlagging behind in terms of broadband investment. That is the wave of \nthe future. I think small towns in Maine and in Oregon--when we talk \nabout access, for example, to the Net and new technology, it is not \ngoing to come about through cable, because cable is going to be very \nreluctant to make those major investments in small towns, such as those \nthat the distinguished Presiding Officer represents, and my small \ntowns. It is going to come about essentially through broadband, \ndelivered via DSL, and the fact is, today, DSL in many jurisdictions is \nsingled out for special and discriminatory treatment. If we were to not \nupdate the law, that would be a trend that would be sure to accelerate.\n  So I think this is going to be an extremely important vote tomorrow. \nThis is a law that has worked. I will wrap up with this one comment I \nhave mentioned to colleagues, as we have talked about this over the \nyears. I have not found a single jurisdiction anywhere that can point \nto an example of how they have been hurt by their inability to \ndiscriminate against the Internet. That is all we have sought to do \nover the last 7 years. We said treat the Internet as you treat the \noffline world. When we started, that was not the case. If you bought a \npaper the traditional way in a number of jurisdictions, you would pay \nno taxes. If you bought the online edition of that very same paper, you \nwould pay a tax. That was not technologically neutral. So we passed the \nfirst Internet tax freedom bill to deal with that kind of example.\n\n  For over more than 5 years, this is a law that has worked. Under the \nMcCain compromise that we will vote on tomorrow, we would simply be \nupdating that law to incorporate the kinds of technologies that evolved \nover the last few years.\n  I wanted to make sure tonight that people understood with a specific \nexample of a message that would go from Providence, RI, to Portland, \nOR, how the vagueness in terms of the definitions in the Alexander \nlegislation would, in my view, subject a simple message sent by \nBlackBerry via DSL to scores of new taxes. I cannot believe any Senator \nwould want that to happen, and that is why I am hopeful we will get \nsupport for the McCain compromise and be able to move forward to final \npassage of the legislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has come to my attention that the \nfamily of former Congressman John Rhodes of Arizona has established a \nspecial Web site: www.johnrhodesmemories.org for the purpose of \ncollecting memories from friends and former colleagues of this \noutstanding statesman.\n  When I was elected to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives in \n1972 one of the first House leaders I came to know was John Rhodes, who \nwas serving as chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee. \nTogether with Congressman Gerald Ford, who was the Republican leader, \nhe helped shape our legislative priorities and worked closely with \nPresident Nixon to formulate Republican Party policies.\n  The memories I have of John Rhodes include his impeccable manners, \nhis courtesy, his warm, big smile, his good judgement and his honesty. \nHe was well liked by all Members of the House, Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  It was foregone conclusion when Gerald Ford was selected by President \nNixon to be his Vice President that John Rhodes would be elected by \nHouse Republicans to be the Republican leader. He was unopposed and \nelected unanimously.\n  He served as leader with distinction during a very challenging time. \nThe Watergate experience decimated House Republicans, but he helped put \nus on the road to political recovery and eventual majority status. Even \nthough he and I left the House about the same time--he to retirement \nand I to election to the Senate--we would get together occasionally at \nmeetings of SOS, a group that meets every week to discuss mutual \ninterests and ideas for the improvement of the country and beyond.\n  In summary, all my memories of the Honorable John Rhodes were good \nones. His death on August 24, 2003, saddened all who knew him. He was a \ntrue friend and a great Congressman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4484-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4484-S4485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UKRAINIAN DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the demise of the Soviet Union, in 1991, \nprovided an opportunity for millions of people to chart their own \ndestiny as people free from the yoke of repressive communism. At that \ntime, there was great hope that a free and prosperous Ukraine could \nbecome a member of the\n\n[[Page S4485]]\n\nEuro-Atlantic community that is united by democracy, free markets and \nthe rule of law.\n  In the past 12 years, Ukraine's transition to democracy and \ncapitalism has been a difficult process marked by success and failure. \nThe successes are many: Ukraine has given up nuclear weapons, \npeacefully changed power from Leonid Kravchuk to Leonid Kuchma, \npartnered with NATO's Partnership for Peace program, and has stationed \nroughly 1,600 troops in Iraq--one of whom, Private Ruslan Androshchuk \npaid the ultimate price for his service.\n  Yet, in spite of these achievements, Ukraine faces a stark choice of \nleadership as it seeks to shape its second decade of freedom from \ncommunism. Those who would seek to forge a new and open Ukrainian \nidentity aligned with the community of democratic nations stand in \ncontrast to those who seek to return the nation to its repressive past \nby establishing a more authoritarian regime that avoids the needed \nreforms it must undertake.\n  The choices facing the Ukrainian people are clear, and the upcoming \nOctober 2004 presidential election will play a critical role in \ndetermining the course that this proud and important nation will take. \nIt is my hope that the presidential election will draw Ukraine closer \nto the West by cementing a strong and stable democracy. Unfortunately, \na number of recent events and actions by the Ukrainian government have \nprovided supporters of a democratic Ukraine with reason for concern.\n  In the lead up to the fall's election, Ukrainian president Leonid \nKuchma has pursued constitutional changes that would shift substantial \npowers from the presidency to the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna \nRada, on the eve of the presidential election in which a strong \nopponent of the President is currently leading in the polls. In \nresponse to concerns expressed by many nations, President Kuchma \ndropped the most egregious provision, which would have replaced the \ndirect election of the president with an election by the Ukrainian \nparliament. Deliberations on constitutional reforms, especially reforms \nthat would alter the political landscape and structure of the nation, \nshould be discussed in a full and open parliamentary debate with the \nbroad participation of the Ukrainian population. Yet, the proponents of \nthis measure primarily relied on backroom maneuvering to push through \ntheir changes. Although President Kuchma argued that he was not \nadvocating these changes to strengthen his position, since he has said \nhe will not run for reelection, many concerns existed that he was doing \nso to fortify the position of his allies in the legislature.\n  In a sign that true democratic aspirations in Ukraine are still \nalive, those changes to the Ukrainian constitution failed by six votes \nearlier this month. I am hopeful that President Kuchma will permit the \nelection to go forward without further attempts to undermine Ukraine's \nconstitution.\n  The constitutional changes advocated by President Kuchma are just one \nfacet of an increasingly authoritarian trend in Ukraine. Media \nrepression that threatens the safety of Ukrainian journalists also \nlimits the ability of citizens to obtain fair and accurate reporting \nprior to the October elections. A free press and open media are \nessential foundations for any open, democratic society. Yet the ability \nof the media to operate freely has been threatened in the past several \nyears.\n  The commercial FM Dovira network removed Radio Free Europe/Radio \nLiberty, RFE/RL, Ukrainian-language programs from its schedule in \nFebruary of this year. This move came after the takeover of the network \nby a political supporter of President Kuchma. The network had \npreviously served as the RFE/RL major affiliate, reaching roughly 60 \npercent of Ukraine's population. Apparently RFE/RL programming did not \n``fit the envisioned new format of the radio network,'' despite the \nfact that these programs were the most popular shows on the station.\n  When Radio Kontynent, an FM commercial station in Kyiv, started \nairing RFE/RL programming a couple of weeks later, the station was \nraided and closed by Ukrainian authorities. The station's transmission \nequipment and three employees were briefly detained. The former owner \nof the station fled to Poland fearing for his life and is awaiting \npolitical asylum.\n  This action was not an isolated event, unfortunately. According to \nthe Broadcasting Board of Governors, Ukrainian authorities continue an \nongoing campaign against the independent media, including the \nharassment of journalists and the suppression of fact-based news and \ninformation and investigative reporting. Several journalists have been \nmurdered and others have been killed in suspicious ``accidents.'' We \nmust do more to support efforts in Ukraine by journalists and media \norganizations that fight for fundamental rights.\n  Political repression and harassment apparently influenced the \nelection for the mayor of Mukachevo, a town in southwestern Ukraine. \nExit polls for this election indicated that Our Ukraine's candidate \nreceived 62.4% of the vote, yet a subsequent recount indicated that his \nopponent won by 5,000 votes. Reports trickling out after the election \nindicated that some of the election stations were raided and damaged by \n``criminal elements'' and other ballots were summarily destroyed or \nignored. Four members of the parliament were beaten and an election \nobserver was hospitalized after being assaulted. In addition to this, \nprior to the election the Our Ukraine candidate temporarily was taken \noff the ballot and a theater director that allowed Our Ukraine to use \nhis venue for a meeting was severely beaten.\n  The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, \nexpressed its concerns about this election, as well as recent \nlegislation that bars domestic non-partisan observers from monitoring \nelections. Without the assurances of a free, open, and transparent \nelection, there is little to hope that the fall election will, in fact, \nuphold true democratic values. The events in Mukachevo and the barring \nof domestic observers are reasons for great concern. Recent actions, \nsuch I described, raise the fear that this election will be stolen from \nthe Ukrainian people.\n  Ukraine has taken some positive steps toward the creation of \ndemocratic institutions and a free-market economy, though much more \nremains to be done. This is why a free and fair presidential election \nin October 2004 remains so important to determining the future path of \nUkraine. Who emerges victorious from this election is a matter to be \ndecided by the Ukrainian people. What is of concern to the United \nStates is how these elections will be conducted. Both the election day \nand the pre-election period must meet international standards for a \nfree and fair electoral process, including ensuring that candidates \nhave unimpeded access to media outlets, citizens are guaranteed the \nopportunity to exercise their civil and political rights, free from \nintimidation and interference, and domestic and international monitors \nare allowed to observe the electoral process and report their findings. \nThe numerous problems in Ukraine noted in elections in 1999 and 2002 by \nelection observers only intensify everyone's concerns.\n  Ukraine, if it is to realize its considerable potential, must take \naction now to protect the fundamental human rights of its citizens. \nThere have been some achievements in the past twelve years, but much \nmore remains to be done. I know that my Senate colleagues share my \nconcerns about the upcoming presidential elections and stand ready to \nsupport the Ukrainian people as they continue with efforts to make \ntheir nation more free and democratic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4485-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4485-S4486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Three employees of the Office of Diversity and Dialogue in \nScottsdale, AZ, were injured on February 26, 2004, when a bomb \ndelivered through the mail exploded in their office. The Office of \nDiversity and Dialogue offers community training and outreach programs \nand handles various complaints from city employees and citizens, \nincluding racial and sex discrimination grievances.\n\n[[Page S4486]]\n\nThe explosion occurred when Don Logan, the director of Scottsdale's \nOffice of Diversity and Dialogue, opened a notebook sized package \naddressed to him that was carrying a bomb.

Logan, 48, suffered serious burns on his hands and \narms.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4486-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4486-S4488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A CREDIBILITY GAP ON NEW NUCLEAR WEAPONS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address what I \nconsider a large and serious issue--U.S. nuclear weapons policy--and \nupdate the Senate on what has been happening.\n  In particular, I am concerned about the apparent reopening of the \nnuclear door by the United States and the further research and \ndevelopment of a new generation of nuclear weapons.\n  I serve as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, on both \nthe Energy and Water and Defense Subcommittees, and have had an \nopportunity to participate in the committee and conference debates on \nthis issue.\n  Despite earlier claims to the contrary, by all appearances the Bush \nAdministration is seeking to develop a new generation of nuclear \nweapons.\n  This includes both the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, which is a \n100-kiloton ``bunker buster'', and so-called Advanced Concepts, which \ntranslate into low-yield battlefield nuclear weapons, below 5 kilotons.\n  The first hints of this policy came in the administration's 2001 \nNuclear Posture Review--which was leaked to the press in early 2002.\n  The review cited the need to develop a new generation of tactical \nnuclear weapons, blurring the lines between conventional and nuclear \nforces.\n  According to press reports, it named seven countries against which it \nwould consider launching a nuclear first strike: North Korea, Iraq, \nIran, Syria, Lybia, China, and Russia.\n  And it proposed a ``new triad,'' in which nuclear and conventional \nweapons co-exist along the same continuum.\n  This blurs the distinction between nuclear and conventional weapons \nand suggests that they could be used as offensive weapons.\n  Subsequently, in the Defense Authorization Bill last year the \nAdministration sought, and ultimately obtained permission, to repeal \nthe 10-year old Spratt-Furse Amendment, which prohibited research to \ndevelop a low-yield, less than 5 kiloton, nuclear weapon.\n  Spratt-Furse has served as a ``brake'' on nuclear weapons development \nfor the past decade. Now, it is gone.\n  I argued against the repeal of Spratt-Furse on the floor, and working \nwith Senator Kennedy, I offered an amendment to maintain it. \nUnfortunately, we did not prevail.\n  What really concerns me is that, throughout all of this, the \nAdministration continues to deny their intention to develop new nuclear \nweapons.\n  For example, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham, in a Washington \nPost op-ed on July 21, 2003, stated: ``. . . we are not planning to \ndevelop any new nuclear weapons at all.''\n  And Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, in response to a question I \nasked him at a Defense Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on May 14, \n2003, stated that the work the Administration was undertaking was \n``just a study'', and that there were no plans to build new weapons.\n  This defies credibility.\n  Well, if one really wants to know what is happening, the best thing \nto do is to track where the Administration is asking for and spending \nmoney.\n  And when you do, you find that the administration is putting major \nresources into researching new nuclear weapons.\n  For instance, last year's budget request included: $15 million for \nthe study of the development of the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator; $6 \nmillion in funding for Advanced Nuclear Weapons Concepts, including the \nstudy for development of low-yield, battlefield weapons; $24 million to \nincrease the Nevada Test Site's time-to-test readiness posture from the \ncurrent 36 months to 18 months; and, $22 million for site selection for \nthe Modern Pit Facility, which is a facility to build nuclear triggers \nfor our Nation's stockpile of nuclear weapons.\n  This would be a $4 billion plant to make up to 450 new ``pits'' per \nyear, some of which could be designed for new weapons.\n  Four-hundred-and-fifty pits is larger than China's entire nuclear \narsenal, so this production capacity raises questions about the number \nof weapons the Administration wants in the U.S. arsenal.\n  Currently, the United States has approximately 15,000 warheads. Under \nthe Moscow Treaty, the U.S. is to decrease its strategic nuclear force \nto 1,700 to 2,200 warheads by 2012.\n  To maintain a 2,200 warhead nuclear force at replacement level, we \nwould only need to build 50 pits a year, not 450. Fifty pits a year can \nbe handled at Los Alamos. So why build a new facility, with a \nproduction capacity of 450 pits a year?\n\n  This country doesn't need that much production unless plans are \nunderway to increase the size of our nuclear arsenal, including a new \ngeneration of nuclear weapons.\n  Last year, those of us opposed to developing tactical nuclear weapons \ndid have some success in limiting these programs.\n  Working with others in the House and Senate, we managed to: cut the \nfunding for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator in half, to $7.5 \nmillion; condition $4 million of the $6 million for Advanced Concepts \non further reporting and planning on Stockpile Stewardship; and contain \nspending on the Modern Pit Facility to $10 million, a $12 million \nreduction.\n  Critically, we also managed to win passage of a requirement that any \nmove to develop a Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator further than the 6.2A \nphase require a specific congressional authorization.\n  As many of my colleagues know, there is a formal set of phases by \nwhich new and modified nuclear weapons move through research, \ndevelopment, production, deployment, and retirement.\n  As a recent CRS report states, ``The Key phases for Robust Nuclear \nEarth Penetrator are: phase 6.2, feasibility study and down select; \nphase 6.2A, design definition and cost study; phase 6.3, development \nengineering in which the nuclear weapons labs produce a completed \nwarhead design; and phase 6.4, production engineering, in which the \ndesign is a adopted for production and a system to manufacture the \nweapon is created.''\n  So when the administration wants to move beyond 6.2A to 6.3 and into \nthe development engineering phase, they need specific Congressional \nauthorization.\n  Continuing its efforts, the administration came back this year and \nasked for significantly more funding for research into new nuclear \nweapons.\n  Indeed, the administration's budget requests before Congress this \nyear total some $96.5 million, and makes it clear that there are those \nin this administration who are deadly serious about the development and \ndeployment of a new generation of nuclear weapons.\n  The administration's FY 2005 budget request calls for: $27.5 million \nfor the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator; $9 million for Advanced \nConcepts Initiative, which includes so-called ``low yield'' weapons \n(under 5 kilotons); and $30 million for the Modern Pit Facility.\n  This is just the tip of the iceberg. The Congressional Research \nService now reports that the administration's own long-term budget \nplans, including $485 million for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator \nbetween 2005 and 2009, ``cast doubt'' on the contention that the study \nof new nuclear weapons are, in fact, only a study.\n  This ramp-up in funding can mean one thing: the administration is \ndetermined to develop and deploy a new generation of nuclear weapons.\n  Yes, the administration is seeking to re-open the nuclear door and is \nseeking more ``usable'' nuclear weapons:\n  The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, for use in launching first \nstrikes to reach deeply embedded command bunkers; and\n  Tactical nuclear weapons, for possible use on the battlefield.\n\n[[Page S4487]]\n\n  The logic of the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, for instance, is \nthat there are certain scenarios in which the United States could need \na nuclear weapon to destroy deeply buried targets--such as command \nbunkers--which could not be effectively targeted by conventional \nweapons.\n  The goal would be to develop a weapon that could burrow into the \nearth deep enough so that it would be ``antiseptic'', with fallout \ncontained deep beneath the surface, 500-1000 feet below the surface.\n  There are three problems with this:\n  First, a casing that can drill down 800-1000 feet before the warhead \nexplodes does not exist. While the U.S. has technologically \nsophisticated missiles, there is no such casing at this time.\n  Second, advanced conventional munitions can shut down air vents, cut-\noff electricity, and render these targets harmless.\n  Third, and most critically, it is not possible to contain the \nradioactive fallout from these weapons--and the radioactive fallout is \nenormous.\n  According to Stanford University physicist Sidney Drell, even a one-\nkiloton weapon detonated 20-50 feet underground would dig a crater the \nsize of ground zero and eject a million cubic feet of radioactive \ndebris into the air. The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator is a 100 \nmegaton weapon, so magnify that by 100-fold.\n\n  You would need to burrow more than 800 feet into the earth before the \nweapon exploded in order to contain the fallout from the Robust Nuclear \nEarth Penetrator. The maximum feasible depth we can bury a warhead into \nthe earth today is about 35 feet.\n  Use of the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator would be a cataclysm of \nthe highest order. Using one might well take out a buried North Korean \nbunker, but would also kill tens of thousands, if not hundreds of \nthousands in both North and South Korea and, depending on wind \npatterns, either China and Japan as well.\n  So the idea that the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator would provide \nthe United States with a usable nuclear weapon--perhaps even a weapon \nthat would be an effective first strike weapon--is absurd.\n  Furthermore, it represents a major departure from U.S. policy and \nmakes our nation less safe--not more.\n  This is in fact part of the administration's broader policy in the \ninternational arena that can best be summed up in two words: Arrogant \nunilateralism.\n  This administration has: engaged in unnecessarily belligerent \nunilateralist rhetoric and action; dismissed arms control and \nnonproliferation efforts as ineffective; emphasized the role of pre-\nemptive military action; and pursued new nuclear weapon capabilities.\n  The administration is sending the destabilizing message that nuclear \nweapons have utility, thereby encouraging the proliferation the United \nStates seeks to prevent.\n  Instead, I believe that the United States' top priority for nuclear \nsecurity should be preventing the spread of nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological weapons and the means to deliver them.\n  Leading non-proliferation efforts and actions, and convincing the \nworld to follow, that's how the world will be safer today and safer \ntomorrow.\n  U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy: I am not a supporter of unilateral \ndisarmament. I am a supporter of treaties, agreements, and programs \nwith strong enforcement and interdiction programs to accomplish multi-\nlateral disarmament.\n  I believe that this Nation should always be in a position to protect \nitself, with a strong military, and the most advanced technology \navailable to that military.\n  But I believe that moving ahead with these programs is folly.\n  First, who would want to send their son or daughter to a battlefield \nwith tactical nuclear weapons?\n  Second, under what circumstances would a President push the ``Red \nButton'' for a nuclear first strike that would launch a nuclear missile \nof 100 kilotons, 4 or 5 times more devastating than Hiroshima, which \nkilled 140,000 in just the first four months after the Bomb was \ndropped.\n  The United States has the most advanced conventional strike forces in \nthe world. We have conventional bombs that can burrow into the earth \nand deliver thousands of pounds of explosives.\n  If the United States develops new nuclear weapons, what do we think \nIndia will do?\n  If the United States develops new nuclear weapons, what do we think \nPakistan will do?\n  And what about Iran and North Korea?\n  Does this encourage them to develop battlefield nuclear weapons? I \nbelieve it does.\n  This administration is placing too great an emphasis on efforts to \ndevelop and deploy a new generation of nuclear weapons.\n  This is the wrong policy and, in my view, will only cause America to \nbe placed in greater jeopardy in the future.\n  What should be done?\n  First, Congress should cut the funding for the Robust Nuclear Earth \nPenetrator and Advanced Concepts entirely.\n  Second, Congress should close an inadvertent loophole that appears to \nallow the Administration to go forward with design engineering of low-\nyield or other Advanced Concepts weapons, but requires specific \nCongressional action for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator.\n  Congress should put the same restrictions on Advance Systems that are \nrequired for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator--and require specific \nCongressional authorization for design engineering and development of \nbattlefield nuclear weapons.\n  I will propose such an amendment most likely in mark-up or Conference \nCommittee.\n  Third, Congress should postpone funding for the Modern Pit Facility \nuntil we receive a joint laboratory report that will include the finds \nof ``accelerated aging'' experiment, due in 2006,\n  Although it is true that the pits in current U.S. warheads are \nexpected to slowly deteriorate as they age--and at some point will need \nto be replaced if the warheads are to remain in the stockpile--until \nthat study is completed we simply have insufficient data to measure \neither the urgency by which pits need to be replaced or how many pits a \nyear the United States needs to be able to manufacture to meet \nreplacement needs.\n  Finally, Congress should deny any funding for new nuclear weapons \nuntil the reports we are awaiting justify these programs, including:\n  The report on stockpile stewardship required by last year's Energy \nand Water bill and which is intended to help inform decision making; \nand,\n  A formal report that spells out the specific military necessity of \nany of these new weapons. Usually, the military requirements for a \nspecific weapons system--nuclear or nonnuclear are provided before well \nbefore funds are provided for design engineering.\n  These steps are necessary to bring this administration's unrestrained \nenthusiasm for developing new nuclear weapons under control, and assure \nthat the United States proceeds in this area with all the seriousness \nand restraint that is fitting for a great power.\n  Now, I want to take a moment to say what I believe the United States \nshould be doing with regard to nuclear policy.\n  First and foremost, the United States must work with others in the \ninternational community to address the larger nuclear non-proliferation \nproblem.\n  Proliferation poses a clear and present danger not only to our nation \nbut to the world.\n  President Bush offered a glimmer of hope two months ago, when he \ncalled for international cooperation on controlling the spread of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  In his speech, President Bush called for: expanding efforts to obtain \nmultilateral cooperation in interdicting land, sea and air shipments of \nWMD-related equipment, materials and technology.\n  Early adoption of a U.N. Security Council resolution that would \nrequire all Nations to criminalize certain proliferation-related \nactivities, enact strict export control regulations, and ensure \nadequate security for nuclear and other sensitive materials within \ntheir borders.\n  Expansion of threat-reduction assistance programs that are designed \nto secure sensitive materials and prevent former weapons scientists \nfrom selling their expertise on the black market.\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\n  Closing a loophole in the Nonproliferation Treaty--NPT--that has \nenabled countries like Iran to acquire dual-use facilities capable of \nproducing bomb-grade plutonium under the guise of a civil nuclear \nenergy program.\n\n  Strengthening verification of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, by \ncalling on countries to adhere to the International Atomic Energy \nAgency's--IAEA--Additional Protocol.\n  The creation of a special committee of the IAEA Board to deal with \nverification and compliance.\n  Ensuring that no country under investigation for violating nuclear \nproliferation obligations should be allowed to serve on the IAEA Board \nof Governors.\n  These are important steps, but they do not amount to a comprehensive \nnon-proliferation strategy.\n  Building on what the President suggested, I believe the following \nactions are needed to implement a comprehensive approach to non-\nproliferation:\n  First, the U.S. should support strengthened international monitoring \nand inspection capabilities, such as the International Atomic Energy \nAgency's Additional Protocol.\n  The Additional Protocol is an addendum to the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, which would expand the amount of information that Nations will \nhave to provide the IAEA--including, the location, operational status, \nand production of any uranium and thorium mines.\n  It also would expand IAEA's ability to check for clandestine nuclear \nfacilities by providing the agency with authority to visit, on short or \nno notice, any facility to investigate questions or inconsistencies in \na state's nuclear declarations.\n  The Additional Protocol has now passed the Senate, and I believe that \nthe United States must work with the IAEA to give it reality and force.\n  Second, the U.S. and other global powers can no longer ignore the \npossession of nuclear weapons by allies and friends.\n  India and Pakistan are not a direct threat to the United States, but \nthey do threaten one another, and, as we recently learned, Pakistan has \nbeen at the hub of a global black market in nuclear technology.\n  According to a press report last Friday, it is possible that India is \nnow seeking to develop a low-yield nuclear weapon of less than one \nkiloton, following in the footsteps of the Bush administration's \nnuclear weapons policy.\n  Such a move by India would likely be extremely destabilizing for \nAsia. We must realize that the way in which the United States and our \nfriends and allies approach nuclear weapons has a profound impact on \nglobal security, and we must be willing to make sure that our friends, \nno less than states of concern, adopt a responsible approach to nuclear \nweapons.\n  Third, the international community must consider new ways to restrict \naccess to dangerous nuclear technologies.\n  The Non-Proliferation Treaty guarantee of access to ``peaceful'' \nnuclear technology has allowed states such as Iran to acquire uranium \nenrichment or plutonium production facilities useful for weapons \nwithout adequate oversight and monitoring.\n  I support efforts in the UN Security Council to effectively \ncriminalize trafficking in weapons of mass destruction, and work with \nother nations to make sure that effective means to control the spread \nof any WMD technology are in place.\n  Fourth, the United States should expand and accelerate Nunn-Lugar \nthreat reduction programs.\n  This initiative has helped make the United States and the world safer \nover the past 10 years by improving security and taking much of the \nSoviet era nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons arsenal and \ninfrastructure out of circulation. Yet funding for Nunn-Lugar has \nremained flat at about $1 billion annually over the past several years.\n  The bipartisan Baker-Cutler Commission proposed last year that U.S. \nefforts for nuclear security should be increased to $30 billion over \nten years, and I believe it is critical that we increase Nunn-Lugar \nfunding so that resources are commensurate with the challenge.\n  Fifth, we must redouble our efforts to secure and remove all \nunprotected nuclear material, especially material at the world's most \nvulnerable sites.\n  During the Cold War more than twenty tons of HEU were distributed \naround the world to research reactors and other facilities. Most of \nthis material is poorly guarded and much is stored at extremely \nvulnerable sites.\n  Along with Senators Reed, Nelson, and Levin I recently introduced \nlegislation to give our government the direction, tools, and resources \nnecessary to secure and remove nuclear materials from around the world \nin an expeditious manner by creating a single, integrated U.S. \ngovernment program, with a defined budget and resources, to facilitate \nthe removal of these materials. It is my hope that Congress will take \naction on this legislation soon.\n  Sixth, the United States should work to achieve a global halt to the \nproduction of weapons usable fissile materials through the Fissile \nMaterial Cut off Treaty--FMCT.\n  Progress on multilateral negotiations to end the supply of new \nmaterial for nuclear bombs has been stalled for years.\n  Now, a shift in China's position opens the way for progress. \nUnfortunately, the Bush administration has decided to reevaluate its \nsupport for such an agreement.\n  Seventh, the United States should seek to engage in discussions with \n``states of proliferation concern'' to look for ways to bring such \nstates into the community of responsible nations.\n  These are states that have nuclear weapons or may be pursuing them \nand include: India, Pakistan, Iran, Israel, Libya, North Korea, Syria, \nBrazil, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia.\n  Despite the administration's claim of a Libya success story, other \nnations appear to be drawing different conclusions from the \nAdministration's approach on these issues.\n  We are experiencing on-going crises involving the North Korean \nnuclear weapons programs, and Iran now appears to be on the verge of a \nnuclear weapons capability.\n  Finally, the United States and other nuclear weapon states must \nreduce the role of nuclear weapons in their own thinking.\n  For the United States to be increasing funding for the research and \ndevelopment of a new generation of nuclear weapons even as we are \ntelling others that they should not pursue these weapons themselves may \nwell provoke the very proliferation we seek to prevent.\n  I strongly support a robust military to safeguard America's National \nSecurity interests.\n  But I believe we will make our nation and our allies less secure--not \nmore--if the United States opens the door to the development, testing, \nand deployment of new tactical and `low-yield' nuclear weapons.\n  The administration claims that it is not seeking to develop these \nnuclear weapons.\n  But I think we've seen that the facts demonstrate that this is not \nthe case.\n  That is why those of us who do not want the nuclear door opened need \nto stand firm and oppose these efforts by the administration to develop \nthese weapons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4488-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4488-S4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                JAMES MONROE, FIFTH PRESIDENT 1817-1825\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today on the 198th anniversary of \nhis birth, to recognize James Monroe, a Virginia patriot, and honor his \nservice to our Nation as a soldier, a diplomat, a legislator and as the \nfifth President of the United States of America.\n  James Monroe, born April 28, 1758 in Westmoreland County, was born, \nraised, and educated in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Foregoing his \nstudies at the College of William and Mary, James Monroe joined the \nWilliamsburg Militia in 1775 in defiance of the British King. He served \ngallantly in the Continental Army on the battlefield at Harlem Heights, \nWhite Plains, Trenton, Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth, eventually \nrising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.\n  A student of Thomas Jefferson's after serving in the Revolutionary \nWar, James Monroe was an adherent of Mr. Jefferson's principles of \nindividual freedom and restrained representative government, which \nwould guide him through fifty years of public service. Elected to the \nVirginia General Assembly in 1782, Monroe served in the Confederate \nCongress and in the first United States Senate before his first of\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\ntwo terms as Minister to France. He returned to his Virginia, and as \nmany students of Mr. Jefferson have done since, served four years as \nGovernor.\n  During Thomas Jefferson's Presidency, James Monroe returned to France \nand was essential in the negotiation of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. \nHis foreign policy experience led James Madison to name him both \nSecretary of State and Secretary of War as the United States was once \nagain pulled into war with Great Britain in 1812.\n  Elected President of the United States in 1816, Monroe's Presidency \nhas long been referred to as the Era of Good Feeling, during which time \nhe helped resolve long-standing grievances with the British, acquired \nFlorida from the Spanish in 1819, signed the Missouri Compromise and \nrenounced European intervention or dominion in the Western Hemisphere \nwith one of our Nation's greatest foreign policy documents, the Monroe \nDoctrine.\n  In 1820, Monroe achieved an impressive re-election, losing only one \nelectoral vote, reserving a unanimous election for George Washington.\n  My own family has many strong ties to the legacy of James Monroe. My \nwife Susan and I enjoyed our wedding on the grounds of his home \nAshlawn-Highland in Charlottesville where her family has worked for \nmany years. In fact, part of Monroe's property in Albemarle County, is \nnow on the grounds of his teacher's great institution of learning, the \nUniversity of Virginia and is respectfully referred to as Monroe's \nHill.\n  The life of James Monroe is one that embodied Virtue, Honor and \nCommitment during his accomplished life of public service. It is \nfitting that he would pass from this Earth on July Fourth, 1831.\n  It is with sincere admiration that I respectfully ask my colleagues \nto recognize James Monroe's one hundred and ninety-eighth birthday as a \nreminder of his remarkable and magnificent leadership for the people of \nVirginia and the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4489-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   CONGRATULATING SISTER JANICE RYAN\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

This award is conferred \nannually by Kids on the Block--Vermont, a theatrical troupe that \nperforms with puppets to deliver messages of personal safety, \ndiversity, and acceptance of disabilities. As an honoree, Sister Janice \nis being acknowledged for her outstanding contributions to children and \nfamilies statewide.\n  I have admired Sister Janice ever since I first met her. Her career-\nlong dedication to education and to helping those who need it most has \nencompassed serving in many capacities, including teacher, professor, \nadministrator, advocate, mentor and role model. Each one of these alone \nare worthy of praise in their own right.\n  One of Sister Janice's first of many outstanding accomplishments was \nthe development of the special education program at Trinity College, \nwhere she served as a professor, Chair of Education and President. She \ncontinued on that path of service in helping to pass groundbreaking \nlegislation that ensured the educational rights of children with \ndisabilities.\n  Sister Janice's passion and commitment to the children of Vermont and \nthe Nation is unsurpassed. From 1995 to 1999 Sister Janice served as \nEducation Director on my staff. Her experience was invaluable. I am \nforever indebted to her for her service.\n  All who know Sister Janice know how dedicated she has been her entire \nlife in serving others. She now serves as the Deputy Director for the \nVermont Department of Corrections. There are very few people in this \nworld who have given so much and asked so little in return. I hope \nSister Janice knows that her years of giving have not gone unnoticed. \nThis award shows how much she is appreciated even though it is \nimpossible for us to fully recognize her contributions.\n  I am so proud to stand here and tell you about such a great \nVermonter. I wish her my deepest congratulations for an award she so \ngreatly deserves. Everyone who has the opportunity to benefit from \nSister Janice's service is extremely lucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4489-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING PARENTS ANONYMOUS OF SOUTH EASTERN KENTUCKY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I rise today to salute six \nremarkable young women who will soon be presented with the Girl Scout \nGold Award by Girl Scouts-Kickapoo Council in Peoria, IL.\n  The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest achievement in Girl \nScouting. It is presented to Senior Girl Scouts who have demonstrated \noutstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community \nservice, career planning, and personal development. Nationwide, less \nthan 3 percent of Senior Girl Scouts earn the Gold Award each year.\n  To earn the Girl Scout Gold Award, a Girl Scout must satisfy several \nrequirements. First, she must fulfill a series of preliminary tasks, \nincluding the completion of four Interest Project Patches, the Career \nExploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and the Senior \nGirl Scout Challenge. Upon completion of these four tasks, the Girl \nScout then must design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award project, \nintegrating all of the skills and knowledge that she has gained through \nher years in Girl Scouting. The project must demonstrate a substantial \ncommitment to community service and leadership and be carried out over \nthe course of at least 50 hours.\n  Leslie Carter, of Girl Scout Troop 47, will be presented with the \nGirl Scout Gold Award for her service as a personalized aide for a \nstudent with special needs during the summer school term. Leslie's \nproject involved planning lessons and activities that helped the girl \nimprove her socialization skills, enabling the student to be more \nreceptive to academic lessons, try new activities, and improve her \nabilities.\n  Tiffany Cremer, of Girl Scout Troop 47, will be honored with the Girl \nScout Gold Award for her project which aimed to increase public \nawareness of Girl Scout events, service projects, and programming, by \npublishing articles and photographs in local newspapers across Fulton \nCounty, IL.\n  Kendall Juers, of Girl Scout Troop 555, will receive her Girl Scout \nGold Award for her efforts to refurbish the collection of the Glen Oak \nPrimary School Library. Kendall collected new and used books to be \ndonated to the library and also made bags that the children will use to \nprotect the books they check out of the library and bring home.\n  Alicia McCombs, of Girl Scout Troop 47, will receive her Girl Scout \nGold Award in recognition of her role in codirecting a school play and \nfulfilling a variety of additional responsibilities, including set \nbuilding, costumes, makeup, and lighting.\n  Diana Newlan, of Girl Scout Troop 555, will be presented with the \nGirl Scout Gold Award in recognition of her efforts to reorganize her \nschool's music library, including cataloging, repairing, and replacing \nsheet music.\n  Sarah Rosecrans, of the Juliette Girl Scout Troop, will be honored \nwith the Girl Scout Gold Award for her leadership in planning a \ncouncilwide event for Brownie Girl Scouts, enabling the younger girls \nto learn about and prepare for Junior Girl Scouts, the next level in \nGirl Scouting.\n\n[[Page S4490]]\n\n  For each of these young women, I expect that the completion of the \nGirl Scout Gold Award is only the first step toward a lifetime of civic \ninvolvement. I take this opportunity to congratulate each of these \nyoung women for their hard work and dedication in earning the Girl \nScout Gold Award and to publicly recognize them for their exceptional \nleadership and service to their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4490-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4490-S4491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN TRIBUTE TO THE PETTYS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this year many of our colleagues \nare seeking the NASCAR vote, but I think it would be wise if each \nmember in this body, instead, sought out the NASCAR heart.\n  My neighbors in South Carolina are Pattie and Kyle Petty. In May \n2000, the Pettys faced a terrible tragedy, as their young son, Adam, \nthe next great racing hope in the family, died during a practice \nsession. Pattie and Kyle didn't retreat after that, but have worked \never since to bring Adam's dream of a camp for chronically ill children \nto reality. Many NASCAR drivers, owners, sponsors, and fans have \ncontributed, and the Victory Junction Gang Camp will open its doors in \nJune.\n  I bring to the attention of my colleagues the following article from \nthe April 23 USA Today, outlining the good work of the Petty family and \nI ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                    [From USA TODAY, Apr. 23, 2004]\n\n              Legendary Racing Family Hopes To Turn Corner\n\n\n            kyle petty helps make his son's dream a reality\n\n                           (By Chris Jenkins)\n\n       As a race car driver, Kyle Petty can't hope to match the \n     success of his father and grandfather. As an executive, he \n     can't hope to compete with NASCAR's mega-teams that have \n     millions more to spend on the best cars, drivers and \n     mechanics. As a father, he can't hope to put his son's death \n     in a racing accident nearly four years ago completely behind \n     him.\n       But Petty does hope, and he seems to radiate hope to those \n     around him through his sincere nature and gentle, quick wit. \n     Other drivers might be better at turning left on the \n     racetrack. They don't have his gift for turning life's \n     negatives into positives.\n       ``No matter how bad your day is, when you see Kyle, your \n     day's better,'' driver Tony Stewart says. ``He tells you a \n     silly joke that makes you laugh or something that makes you \n     feel better.''\n       Petty, 43, gets angry--furious, actually--when he and his \n     cars don't measure up. And he recently woke up crying in the \n     middle of the night, missing his son, Adam.\n       But in the right-hand column of Petty's emotional ledger is \n     the camaraderie he feels with others in the NASCAR community, \n     optimism that his family's team eventually will return to \n     victory lane and, above all, the completion of Adam's dream: \n     a $20 million-plus retreat for chronically ill children.\n       ``I've always been incredibly optimistic that as bad as it \n     is, it's got to get better,'' Petty says.\n       It would be easy to dwell on what might have been. Had Adam \n     Petty lived, many in NASCAR believe his electric talent and \n     sponsor-friendly personality would have driven the Petty \n     Enterprises team back to the prominence it once enjoyed. \n     Petty doesn't allow such thoughts: ``If you do, you'll just \n     go crazy.''\n       Kyle's father, seven-time NASCAR champion Richard Petty, \n     66, says it took years for Kyle's upbeat personality to \n     resurface. ``It took him a long time to get over it,'' \n     Richard says, pausing to reconsider his use of the phrase \n     ``over it.''\n       ``Not to get over it. To get it beside of him instead of in \n     front of him.''\n       Says Stewart: ``I think when you see what Kyle's been \n     through as a person, a lot of people at that point would kind \n     of retreat and kind of put themselves in their own little \n     hole and shut themselves out from the rest of the world.\n       ``With Kyle and (wife) Pattie, it's just the opposite. He's \n     such a positive person that you can't help gravitate toward \n     people like him and you want to be surrounded by people like \n     him.''\n\n\n                          ``Camp'' a misnomer\n\n       A tour of the Victory Junction Gang Camp, a retreat in \n     rural Randleman, N.C., for chronically ill children, revealed \n     two minor flaws.\n       The first is in its name: A ``camp'' has shoddy log cabins, \n     leaky canoes and a slimy pond. This place feels more like a \n     trendy suburban subdivision. There are new buildings--a \n     theater, a gym, a pool and more--trimmed in bright colors and \n     stainless steel, resort-quality guest cottages and medical \n     facilities where volunteer doctors will care for campers' \n     special needs.\n       The second flaw, pointed out by Kyle and Pattie Petty, is a \n     bent pedestrian bridge girder that was rammed by an errant \n     delivery truck. It's March, three months before the camp is \n     to open. This setback doesn't seem to be stressful. Instead, \n     the Pettys laugh, reminded of the time Adam, at 15, \n     accidentally mangled the family van by running into an \n     overhang at his grandfather's house.\n       Fond stories about Adam, the only one of the Pettys' three \n     children who seriously pursued a driving career, still waft \n     through the garage. Once he was spotted carrying a briefcase \n     around the infield, an accessory not often associated with \n     drivers. Bystanders couldn't let that oddity pass without \n     comment, so they asked him what he was carrying. Grinning, he \n     opened the briefcase to reveal a hairbrush and some gum.\n       For Kyle, almost anything can trigger memories. ``The way \n     the sun shines, the way you see a car on the racetrack,'' he \n     says. ``I'll hear somebody holler, say a name and turn around \n     expecting to see Adam standing there. And it just tweaks you \n     just right. And it hurts you. And it just breaks your heart.\n       ``And I'm not the only person in this boat, believe me. \n     There's plenty of other families out all over this country \n     who have lost kids. I'm sure they all feel the same way.''\n       Adam died in May 2000 during a practice session at New \n     Hampshire International Speedway. NASCAR officials determined \n     that he died of a neck injury, the same type that would kill \n     Dale Earnhardt nine months later. Drivers now are required to \n     wear safety collars that help prevent neck injuries, and the \n     wall Adam hit is covered with an impact-absorbing barrier \n     system.\n       Kyle Petty doesn't blame NASCAR. He knows it might sound \n     odd to outsiders, but being around racers offers ``a lot of \n     comfort.''\n       The camp embraces racing as its theme. Used race cars will \n     be suspended from the cafeteria ceiling. An obstacle course \n     is built from tires. One building looks like a giant race \n     car--Adam's car. ``Racing is all Adam knew,'' Petty says.\n       Often when something is done in someone's memory, it is \n     said he or she would have wanted it this way. In Adam's case, \n     this is literally true: After helping his sponsor, Sprint, \n     promote a product that allowed kids in different hospitals to \n     communicate, Adam became determined to do something else for \n     those kids--even if, as his grandfather says, that meant \n     offering to sign over the rights to his winnings for the next \n     20 years to a loan officer if he'd lend Adam the money to \n     build a camp. But the project never got rolling until after \n     his death.\n       ``Most 19-year-old kids (are) looking out for themselves,'' \n     Richard says. ``And he was, don't get me wrong. But he had \n     feelings for other kids, too. So that just inspired us that \n     much more, that it was his idea originally. We're going to do \n     it come heck or high water.''\n       NASCAR and many of its drivers, team owners and sponsors \n     have chipped in for the camp, which will welcome its first \n     group in June; Stewart has pledged to raise at least $1 \n     million. Fans have donated money and time. Nursing home \n     groups have sent box loads of handmade teddy bears and \n     quilts, gifts to campers.\n       The project is personal to rookie driver Brian Vickers, who \n     befriended Adam and the other Petty children, brother Austin, \n     22, and sister Montgomery, 18. All four grew up attending the \n     same home-schooling classes from a tutor. Vickers isn't \n     comfortable talking about Adam and doesn't mention the \n     significant donation he's quietly making to the camp.\n       Asked if Adam was talented enough to become a star, Vickers \n     looks at the floor and says, ``Yeah.''\n\n\n                           Team loses ground\n\n       Most of today's big-time racing teams have moved into \n     gleaming buildings designed to attract tourists and impress \n     sponsors in suburban Charlotte. Then there's Petty \n     Enterprises' humble jumble of white shacks in Randleman, a \n     town short on stoplights and long on religious radio \n     programming.\n       Founded in 1949 by Kyle's grandfather, NASCAR pioneer Lee \n     Petty, then made famous by Richard, the team has won 268 \n     races and 10 NASCAR championships. Most of that success came \n     before the NASCAR boom of the 1990s. When corporate America \n     began waking up to the popularity of NASCAR in the late \n     1980s, Richard was past his prime, though he'd drive until \n     1992.\n       Other teams were winning races, so they landed big \n     sponsors. Having more money allowed those teams to develop \n     technology to make their cars faster.\n       The Pettys fell behind; they've won three races since 1984, \n     none since '99. Adam was supposed to change that. When he \n     died, the promise of a young driver who could rally \n     crewmembers and attract sponsorships died with him. ``We had \n     a lot of stuff lined up around how we were going to do his \n     career and stuff like that,'' Richard says. ``So when the \n     accident happened, everything just went into limbo. For six \n     months or a year there, we just basically survived.''\n       Today the team, which fields cars for Kyle and journeyman \n     Jeff Green, 41, has funding from Georgia-Pacific and General \n     Mills, plus associate sponsors. It's significant money (exact \n     amounts are not disclosed), but nowhere near what marquee \n     teams command.\n       But the team's problems might not all be financial. Years \n     ago it was common for drivers to run teams. As the business \n     of racing became more complex, other teams added layers of \n     management. Today Petty is the only driver with a major team \n     who has extensive executive responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\n       ``Definitely, he tries to handle way, way too much,'' says \n     Robbie Loomis, who worked for the Pettys before becoming Jeff \n     Gordon's crew chief in 2001. ``He's good at about everything, \n     but when you get stretched so thin and get pulled in so many \n     directions, it's hard to tell what direction to go in.''\n       Petty says he enjoys being busy but concedes that the \n     return of Dale Inman, the crew chief for Richard Petty's \n     championship teams, is making his job easier. Although Inman \n     is 67 and can't offer much in the way of technical advice, \n     Petty says Inman's presence helps crewmembers believe the \n     team can win. Petty compares it to Joe Gibbs returning to \n     coach the NFL's Washington Redskins.\n       Although Petty says this isn't his last season as a driver, \n     Loomis says Petty's retirement could be the first major step \n     toward a team resurgence. When Petty stops driving and \n     focuses on running the team, Loomis says, ``You're going to \n     see a whole new Petty Enterprises.''\n       The team is improving slowly; Petty's recent 12th-place \n     finish at Las Vegas Motor Speedway was cause for mild \n     celebration. The lack of research-and-development money \n     continues to show, as Petty and Green finish in the bottom \n     half of the field most of the time.\n       Though nice guys, as the saying goes, might finish last, \n     that doesn't mean they have to like it; a disappointing race \n     can transform Petty from friendly to fierce. But his \n     outbursts aren't without perspective and don't last long.\n       ``I can deal with how we run a lot better, sometimes, \n     because of Adam,'' Petty says. ``Because nothing is as bad as \n     Adam, no matter what. I can go to the racetrack, run dead \n     last. I can go to the racetrack, not make the race. That's \n     still not the worst day.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                   gang camp's aim: helping sick kids\n\n       About the Victory Junction Gang Camp:\n       Campers will be grouped according to the disease they have \n     been diagnosed with; a group of children with hemophilia will \n     visit the camp June 20-25, and seven other groups of children \n     will visit during the camp's eight-week season.\n       Campers, ages 7-15, will be selected based on their \n     doctors' recommendations and will not pay a fee to attend.\n       The camp is seeking volunteer counselors and donations.\n       Online: www.victoryjunction.org.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4491-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:12 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3942.

A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Geologic \nMapping Act of 1992; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing, along with Senators \nMurkowski, Domenici, Burns, Roberts, Bunning, Cochran, Crapo, Bennett, \nand Reid, the National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 2004. \nThis is an act that has been very beneficial to the Nation and deserves \nto be reauthorized.\n  The National Geologic Mapping Act was originally signed into law in \n1992, creating the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program \n(NCGMP). This program exists as a partnership between the USGS and the \nState geological surveys, whose purpose is to provide the Nation with \nurgently-needed geologic maps that can be and are used by a diverse \nclientele. These maps are vital to understanding groundwater regimes, \nmineral resources, geologic hazards such as landslides and earthquakes, \nand geology essential for all types of land use planning; as well as \nproviding basic scientific data. The NCGMP contains three parts: \nFedMap--the U.S. Geological Survey's geologic mapping program, \nStateMap--the State geological survey's part of the act, and EdMap--a \nprogram to encourage the training of future geologic mappers at our \ncolleges and universities. All three components are reviewed annually \nby a Federal Advisory Committee to ensure program effectiveness and to \nprovide future guidance.\n  FedMap geologic mapping priorities are determined by the needs of \nFederal land-management agencies, regional customer forums, and \ncooperatively with the State geological surveys. FedMap also \ncoordinates national geologic mapping standards. StateMap is a \ncompetitive program wherein the States submit proposals for geologic \nmapping that are critiqued by a peer review panel. A requirement of \nthis section of the legislation is that each Federal dollar be matched \none-for-one with State funds. Each participating State has a State \nAdvisory Committee to ensure that its proposal addresses priority areas \nand needs as determined in the NGMA. The success of this program \nensured reauthorization of similar legislation in 1997 and in 1999 with \nwidespread bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. To date \napproximately $50M has been awarded to State geological surveys through \nStateMap, and these Federal dollars have been more than matched by \nState dollars.\n  In 2003, more than 450 new digital geologic maps were published by \nNCGMP, covering over 120,000 square miles of the Nation. These high \nquality geologic maps will be used by a very broad base of customers \nincluding geotechnical consultants, Federal, State and local land \nmanagers, and mineral and energy exploration companies. Information on \nhow to obtain all of these maps is provided on the Internet by the \nNational Geologic Map Database, allowing ease of access for all users.\n  EdMap has trained over 550 university students at 118 universities \nacross the Nation. The best testament to the quality of this training \nare its beneficiaries--an unusually high percentage of these students \ngo on to careers in Earth Science, becoming university professors, \nenergy company exploration scientists, or mapping specialists \nthemselves. Their EdMap program experience provides them with a \nremarkable self-confidence, having completed a difficult and \nindependent field mapping experience. At this very moment, a former \nEdMap student, Sergeant Alexander Stewart, is serving his Nation in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, where his geologic mapping skills have been \nput to excellent use training his unit in all aspects of map making and \ninterpretation.\n  Mr. President, the National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act \nbenefits numerous citizens every day by assuring there is accurate, \nusable geologic information available to communities and individuals so \nthat safe, educated resource use decisions can be made. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and am committed to its timely \nconsideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\n                                S. 2353\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to direct the \nSecretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to jointly \nconduct a study on the feasibility of designating the Arizona Trail as \na national scenic trail or a national historic trail; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nKyl in introducing the Arizona Trail Feasibility Study Act. This bill \nwould authorize the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to conduct \na joint study to determine the feasibility of designating the Arizona \nTrail as a National Scenic or National Historic Trail. A companion bill \nis being introduced in the House of Representatives today by \nRepresentative Kolbe and rest of the Arizona delegation.\n  Since 1968, when the National Trails System Act was established, \nCongress has designated twenty national trails. This legislation is the \nfirst step in the process of national trail designation for the Arizona \nTrail. If the study concludes that designating the Arizona Trail as a \npart of the national trail system if feasible, subsequent legislation \nwill be introduced to designate the Arizona Trail as either a National \nScenic Trail or National Historic Trail.\n  The Arizona Trail is a beautifully diverse stretch of public lands, \nmountains, canyons, deserts, forests, historic sites, and communities. \nThe Trail begins at the Coronado National Memorial on the U.S.-Mexico \nborder and ends in the Bureau of Land Management's Arizona Strip \nDistrict on the Utah border. In between these two points, the Trail \nwinds through some of the most rugged, spectacular scenery in the \nWestern United States.\n  For the past 10 years, over 16 Federal, state and local agencies, as \nwell as community and business organizations, have worked to form a \npartnership to create, develop, and manage the Arizona Trail. \nDesignating the Arizona Trail as a national trail would help streamline \nthe management of the Trail to ensure that this pristine stretch of \ndiverse land is preserved for future generations to enjoy.\n  The corridor for the Arizona Trail encompasses the wide range of \necological diversity in the state, and incorporates a host of existing \ntrails into one continuous trail. The Arizona Trail extends through \nseven ecological life zones including such legendary landmarks as the \nSonoran Desert and the Grand Canyon. It connects the unique lowland \ndesert flora and fauna in Saguaro National Park and the pine-covered \nSan Francisco Peaks, Arizona's highest mountains at 12,633 feet in \nelevation. In fact, the Trail route is so topographically diverse that \na person can hike from the Sonoran Desert to Alpine forests in one day. \nThe Trail also takes travelers through ranching, mining, agricultural, \nand developed urban areas, as well as remote, pristine wildlands.\n  With nearly 700 miles of the 800-mile trail already completed, the \nArizona Trail is a boon to recreationists. The Arizona State Parks \nrecently released data showing that two-thirds of Arizonans consider \nthemselves trail users. Millions of visitors also use Arizona's trails \neach year. In one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S., the \ndesignation of the Arizona Trail as a National Scenic or National \nHistoric Trail would ensure the preservation of a corridor of open \nspace for hikers, mountain bicyclists, cross country skiers, \nsnowshoers, eco-tourists, equestrians, and joggers.\n  I commend the Arizona Trail Association for taking the lead in \nbuilding\n\n[[Page S4496]]\n\na coalition of partners to bring the Arizona Trail from its inception \nto a nearly completed, multiple-use, non-motorized, long-distance \ntrail. Trail enthusiasts look forward to the completion of the Arizona \nTrail. Its designation as a national trail would help to protect the \nnatural, cultural, and historic resources it contains for the public to \nuse and enjoy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 2355. A bill to make available hazardous duty incentive pay to \nuniformed service members performing firefighting duties; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Pay \nfor Military Firefighters Act. This bill authorizes hazardous duty \nincentive pay for our Nation's military firefighters.\n  It may come as a surprise to many of my colleagues, as it did to me, \nthat military firefighters are not currently eligible to receive \nhazardous duty incentive pay. This issue was first brought to my \nattention in a letter I received several months ago from an Air Force \nStaff Sergeant stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base. The letter \nstated, ``We are in one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. We \nface danger not only when we deploy like other jobs that get this pay \nbut we face hazards at our home station.''\n  As the Staff Sergeant said, firefighting is in itself a dangerous \nprofession, but military firefighters must confront a wide variety of \nthreats and are exposed to toxic materials distinctive to the military. \nThe fires they fight often involve fuel and propellants, munitions, or \nchemicals which present unique and extremely dangerous situations. \nThese servicemembers face risks not only when in combat, but as a part \nof their every day duties. Despite these dangers, most of the \napproximate 5,000 military firefighters serving in the Armed Forces are \nnot eligible to receive hazardous duty incentive pay. If these \nservicemembers are willing to take the risk, our nation should be \nwilling to provide them the benefits they deserve.\n  In addition to being the right thing to do, I believe there are \nbroader reasons to support hazardous duty incentive pay for military \nfirefighters. First, there is an issue of fairness. Federal civilian \nfirefighters, who also face great risk and are critically important to \nprotecting our nation, rightly have risk calculated into their \ncompensation package. This creates a situation where federal civilian \nand military firefighters, who often work side-by-side, are exposed to \nthe same risk but are compensated differently.\n  Second, it is my understanding that each of the Services supports \nproviding this benefit to our military firefighters because they see it \nas a manning and retention issue. In fact, according to survey results, \nlack of hazardous duty incentive pay was cited by military firefighters \nas one of the top three reasons for morale and retention problems. The \nAir Force has specifically stated that the lack of hazardous duty \nincentive pay is a primary factor in poor retention rates among its \nmilitary firefighters. In my view, providing hazardous duty incentive \npay is essential to retaining our best firefighters and maintaining \nthis crucial capability within our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased the Fair Pay for Military firefighters \nAct has been endorsed by both the Fleet Reserve Association and the Air \nForce Sergeants Association and I thank them for their assistance in \npreparing this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the full text \nof two letters from these distinguished organizations be printed in the \nRecord and the bill be printed in the Record.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Fair Pay for \nMilitary Firefighters Act and to extending hazardous duty incentive pay \nbenefits to our nation's military firefighters. There can be no doubt \nthat firefighting is one of the most dangerous professions. Military \nfirefighters understand this threat and deserve the recognition of \nreceiving hazardous duty incentive pay for the sacrifices they make and \nthe risks they take.\n  There being no objection, the two letters and the text of the bill \nwere ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Fleet Reserve Association,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 22, 2004.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: The Fleet Reserve Association (FRA) \n     has been advised that you plan to introduce a bill to \n     recognize the regimen that requires military firefighters to \n     put themselves in harm's way by authorizing their eligibility \n     to receive Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP). FRA strongly \n     endorses this initiative.\n       There is no doubt these firefighters rate special \n     consideration in the performance of their duties. They race \n     to quell fires placing themselves in jeopardy from dangerous \n     traffic conditions. They rush into burning buildings to fight \n     flames and smoke, rescue persons in peril, and face the \n     possibility of structures falling on them at any moment. They \n     rush to stop burning aircraft from exploding, fight toxic \n     chemical spills, rescue victims in danger of losing their \n     lives, resolve hazardous material conditions, and even free \n     kittens caught in tree tops. All are dangerous and can be \n     life threatening at any time.\n       It is the Association's understanding that the military \n     services are in favor of authorizing this special pay to \n     their military firefighters. However, there are forces within \n     the Administration that believe military firefighters, all \n     enlisted service members, do not deserve HDIP. But the \n     question arises that if their sacrifices are not worthy of \n     recognition then why do civilian personnel, working side-by-\n     side with these uniformed personnel, receive a risk factor \n     incorporated in their federal pay checks?\n       FRA applauds your leadership on this proposal, and remains \n     committed to working with you and your staff on its \n     advancement. Please contact our legislative department at \n     (703) 683-1400 if the Association can be of assistance.\n                                                 Joseph L.

Tim Johnson,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: On behalf of the 135,000 members of \n     this association, thank you for introducing legislation which \n     would provide Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay for military \n     firefighters. Your efforts will undoubtedly pave the way to \n     correct an inequity that senior military leaders have \n     identified as a contributing factor to low retention and \n     morale among enlisted firefighters.\n       Military firefighters face hazardous duty every day--not \n     just in wartime. They are confronted with fuel fires and \n     explosive situations on our flightlines and in the \n     environments unique to executing the military missions \n     required to protect this nation. Like you, we are extremely \n     proud of their courage and dedication. We are pleased you \n     have taken the lead to honor them and to provide them \n     equitable compensation for their intrepidity.\n       Senator Johnson, thank you again for your leadership and \n     your dedication to enlisted military members. AFSA will \n     continue to inform Airmen of all ranks at our chapters around \n     the world that they have a dedicated champion in Washington \n     thanks to your untiring efforts. We look forward to continue \n     working with you on this and other matters of mutual concern. \n     Please let me know when we can be of further assistance to \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Richard M.

A bill to require the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget to issue guidance for, and provide oversight of, the \nmanagement of micropurchases made with Government-wide commercial \npurchase cards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nRuss\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\nFeingold, to introduce the ``Purchase Card Waste Elimination Act of \n2004,'' to help eliminate wasteful spending through the use of \ngovernmental credit cards.\n  Today, the Governmental Affairs Committee explored the federal \ngovernment's use of ``purchase cards,'' which are commercial charge \ncards used by federal agencies to buy billions of dollars worth of \ngoods and services. The Committee heard the results of the General \nAccounting Office's investigation into waste, fraud, and abuse in the \npurchase card program.\n  The American people have the right to expect the federal government \nto spend their tax dollars carefully and wisely. While this is true at \nall times, it is never more so than today, when the government faces \nenormous fiscal pressures and a growing budget deficit.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee has a mandate to help safeguard \nthose tax dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse. To meet this mandate, \nthe Committee has launched an initiative to root out government waste. \nToday's hearing was part of that effort and focused on wasteful, \ninefficient, and in some cases, fraudulent, transactions using purchase \ncards.\n  These cards were first introduced by the General Services \nAdministration on a government-wide basis in 1989. Purchase cards are \nused primarily for making routine purchases such as office supplies, \ncomputers and copying machines. Purchase cards are similar to the \npersonal credit cards we all carry, but with one important difference: \nThe taxpayers pays the bill. Although the card is only supposed to be \nused for official purposes, the Federal Government is responsible for \npaying all charges by authorized cardholders, regardless of what was \npurchased.\n  While legitimate purchases are usually small, they nevertheless add \nup to big money. Purchase card use has soared during the past decade--\nfrom less than $1 billion in fiscal year 1994 to more than $16 billion \nin fiscal year 2003. There are more than 134,000 purchase cardholders \nin the Defense Department alone.\n  This explosive growth presents both challenges and opportunities. \nWhile there are many benefits to the purchase card, such as expediting \npurchases, cutting red tape, and saving administrative costs, the \nGeneral Accounting Office and the Inspectors General have reported that \ninadequate controls over purchase cards leave agencies vulnerable to \nwaste, fraud, and abuse.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee heard testimony describing how \nsmarter use of purchase cards could save taxpayers hundreds of millions \nof dollars. A GAO report that I requested along with Senator Feingold \nand Congresswoman Schakowsky, which is being released today, highlights \nseveral wasteful purchasing practices.\n  The GAO concludes that many agency cardholders fail to obtain readily \navailable discounts on purchase card buys. In too many cases, purchase \ncardholders are buying goods and services from vendors that already \nagreed to provide government discounts through the GSA schedule, yet \ncardholders often lack the information and training needed to obtain \nthe discounted prices. As a result, GAO found numerous instances of \ncardholders paying significantly more for items for which discounts \nalready had been negotiated. In light of the fact that conscientious \nshoppers often can obtain savings beyond the schedule discounts, these \nfindings indicate that some federal agencies are substantially \noverpaying for routine supplies.\n  For example, an analysis of the Department of Interior's purchase \ncard buys of ink cartridges found that most of the time the cardholder \npaid more than the government schedule price to which the vendors had \nalready agreed. One vendor had agreed to a schedule price of $24.99 for \na particular ink cartridge, yet of 791 separate purchases of this \nmodel,only two were at or below that price. Some purchasers paid $34.99 \nor about 40 percent more for the same item.\n  In conducting its investigation, the GAO examined six agencies that \ntogether account for over 85 percent of all government purchase card \ntransactions. If the six agencies reviewed in this study negotiated \nautomatic discounts of just 10 percent from major vendors, and if \nagency employees had used those discounts, GAO estimates annual savings \nof $300 million. Over 10 years, that's $3 billion. Pretty soon, as \nSenator Dirksen once observed, we're talking real money.\n  The GAO also found that agencies should be making greater efforts to \ncollect and analyze data on purchase card transactions. This would help \nagencies to eliminate waste and to expose fraud and abuse.\n  We must assure taxpayers that the federal government is shopping \ncarefully, wisely and honestly. That's why the legislation we introduce \ntoday would require the Office of Management and Budget to direct \nagencies to better train cardholders and to more effectively scrutinize \ntheir purchases. This legislation would also instruct the General \nServices Administration to increase its efforts to secure discount \nagreements with vendors and to better provide agencies with the tools \nneeded to control wasteful spending. According to testimony by GAO, \nthis legislation would be a strong first step to eliminating $300 \nmillion in wasteful spending.\n  The American people have the right to expect the federal government \nto spend their tax dollars carefully and wisely. I urge my colleagues \nto cosponsor this legislation and help eliminate wasteful purchase card \nspending.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 2357.

Mr. President, today, I am joined by Senators Leahy, \nKennedy, and Feinghold in introducing the American Neighborhoods Taking \nthe Initiative--Guarding Against Neighborhood Gangs (ANTI-GANG) Act, \nwhich is a comprehensive, tailored bill that will help State and local \nprosecutors prevent, investigate, and prosecute gang crimes in their \nneighborhoods.\n  The National Youth Gang Center has reported evidence of resurgence in \ngang violence, and this is clearly reflected in Chicago, IL, where 45 \npercent of the homicides last year were gang-related. In Chicago, there \nare 98 identified gangs, with an estimated 100,000 gang members; over \n13 percent of the gang members nationwide are located within Chicago's \ncity limits.\n  I would like to commend the State and local prosecutors and law \nenforcement agencies for their work in fighting this problem. The ANTI-\nGANG Act would authorize $862.5 million in grants over the next 5 years \nto provide them with the tools they need and have specifically \nrequested of Congress to combat violent gangs.\n  For example, the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) wrote \nthe following: ``We must find new methods of protecting those \nindividuals brave enough to come forward as\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\nwitnesses. Our biggest problem is getting the financial help to \nestablish, and run, meaningful witness protection programs.'' The \nNational Alliance of Gang Investigators (NAGI) also has identified a \ntrend in witness intimidation that is ``dramatically affecting the \nprosecution of violent gang offenders.'' The ANTI-GANG Act responds by \nauthorizing $300 million over 5 years for the protection of witnesses \nand victims of gang crimes. This bill also would allow the Attorney \nGeneral to provide for the relocation and protection of witnesses in \nState gang, drug, and homicide cases, and it would allow States to \nobtain the temporary protection of witnesses in Stage gang cases \nthrough the Federal witness relocation and protection program, without \nany requirement of reimbursement for those temporary services.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act also authorizes $200 million for grants to develop \ngang prevention, research, and intervention services. However, these \ngrants should not be limited to those areas already identified as \n``high intensity'' interstate gang activity areas. The NAGI also has \nidentified a trend of gangs migrating from larger cities to smaller \ncommunities, which is fueled in large part by an increase in gang \ninvolvement in drug trafficking. This may be related to the spread of \nmethamphetamine, which is the fastest-growing drug in the United States \nand, according to Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, the ``single-\ngreatest threat to rural America today.'' In response to these trends, \nthe ANTI-GANG Act would allow rural communities and other jurisdictions \nto apply for these grants, to prevent gang violence from occurring in \nthe first place.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act also authorizes $262.5 million over five years for \nthe cooperative prevention, investigation, and prosecution of gang \ncrimes. Most of this funding would be for criminal street gang \nenforcement teams made up of local, State, and Federal law enforcement \nauthorities that would investigate and prosecute criminal street gangs \nin high intensity interstate gang activity areas (HIIGAAs). \nImportantly, this bill would allow HIIGAAs to be integrated with High \nIntensity Interstate Drug Trafficking Areas (HIIDTAs), to avoid \nconflicts in those areas where the two entities would coexist.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act also authorizes $100 million over five years for \ntechnology, equipment, and training to identify gang members and \nviolent offenders and to maintain databases to facilitate coordination \namong law enforcement and prosecutors.\n  In addition to these new resources, the ANTI-GANG Act will \neffectively strengthen the ability of prosecutors to prosecute violent \nstreet gangs, by creating a stronger federal criminal gang prosecution \noffense. This new offense criminalizes participation in criminal street \ngangs, recruitment and retention of gang members, and witness \nintimidation. At the same time, it responds to concerns raised by the \nNDAA regarding potential conflicts with local investigation and \nprosecution efforts, by requiring certification by the Department of \nJustice before any prosecution under this bill could be undertaken in \nfederal court.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act also promotes the recruitment and retention of \nhighly-qualified prosecutors and public defenders by establishing a \nstudent loan forgiveness program modeled after the current program for \nfederal employees. Almost a third of prosecutors' offices across the \ncountry have problems with recruiting or retaining staff attorneys, and \nlow salaries were cited as the primary reason for recruitment and \nretention problems. This proposed loan forgiveness program is supported \nby the American Bar Association, the NDAA, the National Association of \nProsecutor Coordinators, the National Legal Aid and Defender \nAssociation, and the American Council of Chief Defenders.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act will effectively strengthen the ability of \nprosecutors at the local, state, and federal level to prosecute violent \nstreet gangs, and it will give state and local governments the \nresources they need to protect witnesses and prevent youth from joining \ngangs in the first place. This bill achieves these important goals \nwithout increasing any mandatory minimum sentences, which conservation \njurists such as Justice Anthony Kennedy have criticized as ``unfair, \nunjust, unwise.'' It also does not unnecessarily expand the federal \ndeath penalty--a measure which has been included in other federal gang \nlegislation but is opposed by the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, NAACP, ACLU, and National Association of Criminal Defense \nLawyers.\n  Finally, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Coalition \nhas raised the following concerns regarding federal gang legislation \nthat would allow more juveniles to be prosecuted as adults in the \nfederal system: ``[T]he fact remains that transfer of youth to the \nadult system, simply put, is a failed public policy. Comprehensive \nnational research on the practice of prosecuting youth in the adult \nsystem has shown conclusively that transferring youth to the adult \ncriminal justice system does nothing to reduce crime and actually has \nthe opposite effect. In fact, study after study has shown that youth \ntransferred to the adult criminal justice system are more likely to re-\noffend and to commit more serious crimes upon release than youth who \nwere charged with similar offenses and had similar offenses histories \nbut remained in the juvenile justice system. Moreover, national data \nshow that young people incarcerated with adults are five times as \nlikely to report being a victim of rape, twice as likely to be beaten \nby staff and 50 percent more likely to be assaulted with a weapon than \nyouth held in juvenile facilities. A Justice Department report also \nfound that youth confined in adult facilities are nearly 8 times more \nlikely to commit suicide than youth in juvenile facilities.''\n  In light of these concerns, the ANTI-GANG Act provides Congress with \nthe necessary data to decide whether to expand the federal role in \nprosecuting juvenile offenders, by requiring a comprehensive report on \nthe current treatment of juveniles by the states and the capability of \nthe federal criminal justice system to take on these additional cases \nand house additional prisoners. The American Bar Association has \nwritten that this study is ``the more prudent course of action at this \ntime.''\n  The ANTI-GANG Act is a comprehensive, common-sense approach to fight \ngang violence. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  The American Neighborhoods Taking the Initiative--Guarding Against \n                   Neighborhood Gangs (ANTI-GANG) Act\n\n\n                                overview\n\n       The American Neighborhoods Taking the Iniative--Guarding \n     Against Neighborhood Gangs (ANTI-GANG) Act of 2004 is a \n     comprehensive, tailored bill that will help state and local \n     prosecutors prevent, investigate, and prosecute gang crimes \n     in their neighborhoods. This bill contains four major \n     provisions:\n       (1) It gives state and local prosecutors the tools they \n     need and have specifically requested of Congress to combat \n     violent gangs by authorizing $52.5 million for the \n     cooperative prevention, investigation, and prosecution of \n     gang crimes; $20 million for technology, equipment, and \n     training to identify gang members and violent offenders and \n     to maintain databases to facilitate coordination among law \n     enforcement and prosecutors; $60 million for the protection \n     of witnesses and victims of gang crimes; and $40 million for \n     grants to develop gang prevention, research, and intervention \n     services.\n       (2) It replaces the current provision on criminal street \n     gangs in federal law, seldom-used penalty enhancement, with a \n     stronger measure that criminalizes participation in criminal \n     street gangs, recruitment and retention of gang members, and \n     witness intimidation. The ANTI-GANG Act targets gang violence \n     and gang crimes in a logical, straightforward manner.\n       (3) It will provide Congress with the necessary data to \n     decide whether to expand the federal role in prosecuting \n     juvenile offenders by requiring a comprehensive report on the \n     current treatment of juveniles by the states and the \n     capabilities of the federal criminal justice system to take \n     on these additional cases and house additional prisoners.\n       (4) It promotes the recruitment and retention of highly-\n     qualified prosecutors and public defenders by establishing a \n     student loan forgiveness program modeled after the current \n     program for federal employees.\n       The ANTI-GANG Act will effectively strengthen the ability \n     of prosecutors at the local, state, and federal level to \n     prosecute violent street gangs, it will give state and local \n     governments the resources they need to protect witnesses and \n     prevent kids from joining gangs in the first place. This bill \n     achieves these important goals without increasing any \n     mandatory minimum sentences\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\n     (which conservative jurists such as Justice Anthony Kennedy \n     have criticized as ``unfair, unjust, unwise''). It also \n     respects the traditional principles of federalism, by \n     requiring certification by the Department of Justice before \n     any prosecution under this bill may be undertaken in federal \n     court and by not unnecessarily expanding the federal death \n     penalty.\n\n\n            SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY OF THE ANTI-GANG ACT\n\n                     Title I--Criminal Street Gangs\n\n       Sec. 101. Criminal Street Gangs--Definitions. Defines a \n     criminal street gang as a preexisting and ongoing entity \n     (e.g., having already committed crimes); targets violent \n     criminal street gangs by requiring that at least one \n     predicate gang crime be a violent gang crime; establishes \n     evidentiary relevance of gang symbolism in prosecutions; and \n     allows federal prosecution of neighborhood gang activity when \n     those activities substantially affect interstate commerce.\n       Sec. 102. Criminal Street Gangs--Prohibited Acts, \n     Penalties, and Forfeiture. Creates three new federal crimes \n     to prosecute cases involving violent criminal street gangs. \n     (1) It prohibits the recruitment and forced retention of gang \n     members, including harsher penalties if an adult recruits a \n     minor or prevents a minor from leaving a criminal street \n     gang. (2) It prohibits participation in a criminal street \n     gang if done with the intent to further the criminal \n     activities of the gang or through the commission of a single \n     predicate gang crime. (3) It prohibits witness intimidation \n     and tampering in cases and investigations related to gang \n     activity. Before the federal government may undertake a \n     prosecution of these offenses, the Department of Justice must \n     certify that it has consulted with state and local \n     prosecutors before seeking an indictment and that federal \n     prosecution is ``in the public interest and necessary to \n     secure substantial justice.''\n       Sec. 103. Clerical Amendments.\n       Sec. 104. Conforming Amendments.\n       Sec. 105. Designation of and Assistance for ``High \n     Intensity'' Interstate Gang Activity Areas. Requires the \n     Attorney General, after consultation with the governors of \n     appropriate States, to designate certain locations as ``high \n     intensity'' interstate gang activity areas (HIIGAAs) and \n     provide assistance in the form of criminal street gang \n     enforcement teams made up of local, State, and Federal law \n     enforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute criminal \n     street gangs in each designated area. The ANTI-GANG bill also \n     allows for HIIGAAs to be integrated with High Intensity \n     Interstate Drug Trafficking Areas (HIIDTAs), to avoid \n     conflicts and bureaucratic morasses in those areas where the \n     two entities would coexist. Subsection (c) authorizes funding \n     of $40 million for each fiscal year 2005 through 2009.\n       Sec. 106. Gang Prevention Grants. Requires the Office of \n     Justice Programs of the Department of Justice to make grants \n     to States, units of local government, tribal governments, and \n     qualified private entities to develop community-based \n     programs that provide crime prevention, research, and \n     intervention services designed for gang members and at-risk \n     youth. Subsection (f) authorizes $40 million for each fiscal \n     year 2005 through 2009. No grant may exceed $1 million nor \n     last for any period longer than 2 years.\n       Sec. 107. Gang Prevention Information Grants. Requires the \n     Office of Justice Programs of the Department of Justice to \n     make grants to States, units of local government, tribal \n     governments to fund technology, equipment, and training for \n     state and local sheriffs, police agencies, and prosecutor \n     offices to increase accurate identification of gang members \n     and violent offenders and to maintain databases with such \n     information to facilitate coordination among law enforcement \n     and prosecutors. Subsection (f) authorizes $20 million for \n     each fiscal year 2005 through 2009. No grant may exceed $1 \n     million nor last for any period longer than 2 years.\n       Sec. 1089. Enhancement of Project Safe Neighborhoods \n     Initiative to Improve Enforcement of Criminal Laws Against \n     Violent Gangs. Expands the Project Safe Neighborhood program \n     to require United States Attorneys to identify and prosecute \n     significant gangs within their district; to coordinate such \n     prosecutions among all local, State, and Federal law \n     enforcement agencies; and to coordinate criminal street gang \n     enforcement teams in designated ``high intensity'' interstate \n     gang activity areas. Subsection (b) authorizes the hiring of \n     94 additional Assistant United States Attorneys and funding \n     of $7.5 million for each fiscal year 2005 through 2009 to \n     carry out the provisions of this section.\n       Sec. 109. Additional Resources Needed by the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation to Investigate and Prosecute Violent \n     Criminal Street Gangs. Requires the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation to increase funding for the Safe Streets \n     Program and to support the criminal street gang enforcement \n     teams in designated high intensity interstate gang activity \n     areas. Subsection (b) authorizes $5 million for each fiscal \n     year 2005 through 2009 to expand the FBI's Safe Streets \n     Program.\n       Sec. 110. Expansion of Federal Witness Relocation and \n     Protection Program. Amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3521(a)(1), which \n     governs the Federal witness relocation and protection \n     program, to make clear that the Attorney General can provide \n     for the relocation and protection of witnesses in State gang, \n     drug, and homicide cases. Current law authorizes Federal \n     relocation and protection for witnesses in State cases \n     involving ``an organized criminal activity or other serious \n     offense.''\n       Sec. 111. Grants to States and Local Prosecutors to Protect \n     Witnesses and Victims of Crime. Authorizes the Attorney \n     General to make grants available to State and local \n     prosecutors and the U.S. Attorney for the District of \n     Columbia for the purpose of providing short-term protection \n     to witnesses in cases involving an organized criminal \n     activity, criminal street gang, serious drug offense, \n     homicide, or other serious offense. State and local \n     prosecutors will have the option of either providing the \n     witness protection themselves or contracting with the United \n     States Marshals Service for use of the Federal witness \n     protection and relocation program. Subsection (d) authorizes \n     $60 million for each fiscal year 2005 through 2009 to fund \n     the program. By providing significantly increased resources \n     and flexibility for State and local prosecutors, this \n     provision responds in a meaningful way to the need for \n     effective witness protection emphasized by prosecutors during \n     the September 17, 2003, hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n       Sec. 1112. Witness Protection Services. Amends 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3526 to allow States to obtain the temporary protection \n     of witnesses in State gang cases through the Federal witness \n     relocation and protection program, without any requirement of \n     reimbursement for those temporary services. Currently, \n     complex reimbursement procedures deter State and local \n     prosecutors from obtaining witness protection services from \n     the Federal government in emergency circumstances.\n\n     Title II--Related Matters Involving Violent Crime Prosecution\n\n       Sec. 201. Study on Expanding Federal Authority for Juvenile \n     Offenders. This section requires the General Accounting \n     Office to do a comprehensive report on the advantages and \n     disadvantages of increasing Federal authority for the \n     prosecution of 16- and 17-year-old offenders. Some have \n     proposed indicting and prosecuting more juveniles in Federal \n     courts as a step in combating gang violence. Although there \n     is insufficient data to support this proposition, it is \n     appropriate for the GAO to review the current treatment of \n     such offenders by the States and the capability of the \n     Federal criminal justice system to take on these additional \n     cases and house additional prisoners. With this review, \n     Congress can knowledgeably consider whether to expand the \n     Federal role in prosecuting juveniles.\n       Sec. 202. Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act. This \n     section establishes a student loan repayment program for \n     prosecutors and public defenders that is modeled after the \n     program currently available to federal employees. This would \n     increase the ability of federal, state, and local prosecutors \n     and public defenders to recruit and retain highly-qualified \n     attorneys. Attorneys in this program must agree to serve for \n     a minimum of three years. Participants can receive up to \n     $10,000 per year and a total of up to $60,000; these amounts \n     are identical to the limitations in the program for federal \n     employees. Subsection (h) authorizes $25 million for fiscal \n     year 2005 and such sums as may be necessary for each \n     succeeding fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the introduction \nof the ANTI-Gang Act with my good friends on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenators Durbin, Kennedy and Feingold.\n  The American Neighborhoods Taking the Initiative--Guarding Against \nNeighborhood Gangs Act of 2004 is a bill carefully crafted to target \nviolent criminal street gangs whose activities extend beyond the \nneighborhood and have a substantial impact on Federal interests.\n  As a former county prosecutor, I have long expressed concern about \nmaking Federal crimes out of every offense that comes to the attention \nof Congress. I know that States have competent and able police \ndepartments, county sheriffs' offices, prosecutors and judges. Gangs \nare, more often than not, locally-based, geographically-oriented \ncriminal associations, and our local communities are on the front lines \nof the fight against gang violence. We should be supplementing the work \nof our State and local law enforcement officers, not usurping them. \nThis is why this bill specifically targets only those gangs where there \nis a provable Federal interest. This is why this bill requires \nconsultation with our State and local counterparts before embarking on \na Federal prosecution of historically State crimes. And this is why \nmajor provisions of the bill are directed toward helping State and \nlocal law enforcement officers prevent, investigate, and prosecute gang \ncrimes in their own neighborhoods.\n  There are four major sections of the bill:\n  First, the bill gives State and local prosecutors financial resources \nto guard against neighborhood gangs by authorizing $72.5 million for \nthe cooperative prevention, investigation, and prosecution of gang \ncrimes; $40 million for grants to develop gang prevention,\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\nresearch, and intervention services; and $60 million for the protection \nof witnesses and victims of gang crimes. Federal funds are also \nprovided for hiring new Assistant U.S. Attorneys and to fund \ntechnology, equipment and training grants to increase accurate \nidentification of gang members and violent offenders and to maintain \ndatabases with such information to facilitate state and Federal \ncoordination.\n  The first defense in protecting our youth against gang influence is a \ngood offense. I have long thought that programs aimed at combating gang \nactivity must incorporate gang prevention and education--programs that \nwould examine why our youth choose to associate in gangs and prey on \nothers--to be effective. When Chairman Hatch appropriately targeted \ngang violence as a subject for a full Committee hearing last year, all \nagreed that we should be doing more to deter our youth from joining \ngangs in the first place. This bill heeds that call.\n  Another unifying theme of the expert witnesses at the Committee's \nhearing was the serious need for Federal assistance in protecting \nwitnesses who will provide information about and testify against gangs \nfrom intimidation. Our bill not only provides funding to help protect \nwitnesses, it also makes it a Federal crime to intimidate witnesses in \ncertain State prosecutions involving gang activity.\n  Second, the bill defines a Federal criminal street gang by using \nwell-established legal principles and providing recognizable limits. \nRather than create yet another cumbersome and broad-reaching Federal \ncrime that overlaps with numerous existing Federal statutes, this bill \nactually targets the problem that needs to be addressed: violent \ncriminal street gangs. It recognizes that gangs are ongoing entities \nwhose members commit crimes more easily simply because of their \nassociation with one another. Gangs prove the old adage: there is \nsafety in numbers. Gang members can be sheep-like in their loyalty and \nallegiance to the gang. In this regard, the bill also explicitly and \nevenhandedly addresses the evidentiary significance of gang symbolism \nin gang prosecutions.\n  In addition to witness intimidation, other important crimes \nestablished by this bill include: One, participation in criminal street \ngangs by any act that is intended to effect the criminal activities of \nthe gang; two, participation by committing a crime in furtherance of or \nfor the benefit of the gang, and three, recruitment and retention of \ngang members. There are increased penalties for those who target minors \nfor recruitment in a criminal street gang.\n  Third, the bill requires a comprehensive report on the current \ntreatment of juveniles by the States, and the capability of the Federal \ncriminal justice system to take on these additional cases and house \nadditional prisoners, so that Congress can make an informed decision \nabout whether or not to expand the Federal role in prosecuting juvenile \noffenders.\n  Some have suggested that the Federal Government has been unable to \nproceed effectively against gang crime because of Federal law's \nprotections for juvenile offenders. I have not seen sufficient evidence \nto support his claim, but I think that Congressional consideration of \nthis issue would benefit greatly from a comprehensive General \nAccounting Office study on this topic. We need to know both whether \njustice would be served by increasing the Federal role, and whether the \nFederal system--including both our prosecutors and the Bureau of \nPrisons--is prepared for such a step.\n  Fourth, the bill promotes the recruitment and retention of highly-\nqualified State and local prosecutors and public defenders by \nestablishing a student loan forgiveness program modeled after the \ncurrent program for Federal employees.\n  We have worked very hard in crafting this legislation not to further \nblur the lines between Federal and State law enforcement \nresponsibilities or to add more burdens to the FBI as the primary \nFederal investigative agency. Federal law enforcement has been faced \nwith a unique challenge since the September 11 attacks. The FBI is no \nlonger just an enforcement agency, but also has a critical terrorism \nprevention mission. This mission is a daunting one, and our Federal law \nenforcement resources are not limitless. I, for one, do not want the \nFBI or U.S. Attorneys to focus these limited resources on cases that \nare best handled at the local level.\n  Combating gang violence should not be a partisan battle. The tragedy \nof gang violence affects too many. No community can afford to lose a \nsingle youth to the arms of a waiting gang. No gang should be allowed \nto flourish without consequence in our communities. I urge your support \nfor this important bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support S. 2358, the \nAnti-Gang Act. This critical legislation will provide State and Federal \nlaw enforcement with the tools and resources needed to successfully \nfight the expanding presence of violent gangs that bring drugs like \nmethamphetamine into our communities.\n  Time and time again, we in Congress have heard the call of \nprosecutors and law enforcement for more resources to combat the \nproblem of gang violence. The Anti-Gang Act gives local prosecutors and \nlaw enforcement what they have asked Congress for most--targeted \nfinancial assistance. The bill will help combat the growth and \nproliferation of violent gangs by authorizing funds for the cooperative \nprevention, investigation, and prosecution of gang crimes. In addition, \ngrant money will be made available for the protection of witnesses and \nvictims of gang violence. These funds will not be tied to restrictive \nformulas that would keep the majority of the assistance from reaching \nsuburban and rural communities. This money will be able to go to the \ncommunities in Wisconsin and the rest of the country where rural and \nsmaller law enforcement agencies are financially limited in their \nability to deal with the exploding increase in gang violence associated \nwith methamphetamines and other narcotics.\n  The Anti-Gang Act also promotes hiring and long-term service of \nhighly qualified prosecutors and public defenders by establishing a \nstudent loan forgiveness program. Prosecuting gangs is some of the most \ndemanding and challenging work a prosecutor will tackle. Loan \nforgiveness will allow Assistant District Attorneys and Assistant \nAttorney Generals to remain in public service and allow them to take \ntheir wealth of experience and use it to combat gang violence.\n  The Anti-Gang Act also replaces the current Federal RICO statute that \nwas never intended to be used against violent street gangs with a tough \nstatute that not only criminalizes participation in criminal street \ngangs, but addresses the serious problem of the recruitment and \nretention of gang members. The Anti-Gang Act targets gang violence and \ngang crimes in a logical, straightforward manner. The bill also \nrecognizes that the vast majority of gang investigations and \nprosecutions have been and will continue to be done at the State and \nlocal level. The bill requires that Federal prosecutors consult with \nState and local law enforcement before seeking an indictment and that a \nFederal prosecution is in the public interest and necessary to secure \nsubstantial justice.\n  Finally, the Anti-Gang Act will provide Congress with the data \nnecessary to decide whether to expand the Federal role in prosecuting \njuvenile offenders by requiring a comprehensive report on the current \ntreatment of juveniles by the States and the capability of the Federal \ncriminal justice system to take on more juvenile cases and to house \nadditional prisoners. Some have proposed indicting and prosecuting more \njuveniles in Federal courts as a way of combating gang violence without \nbeing able to tell us why this is necessary and what effect it might \nhave on the criminal justice system. With this review, Congress can \nintelligently consider whether to expand the Federal role in \nprosecuting juveniles.\n  Our citizens should be able to send their children to school, use \ntheir parks and walk their streets without fearing that ever-spreading \ngang violence will grow unfettered in their community. The Anti-Gang \nAct is an important step towards making all of our neighborhoods safe \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleagues \nSenator Durbin, Senator Leahy, and Senator Feingold in introducing this \nimportant legislation, the ANTI-GANG Act.\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\n  Gang violence is a serious problem in many communities across the \nnation, and it deserves a serious response by Congress. The key to \nsuccess is an effective strategy that rejects partisanship and ``lock-\nem-up'' sound bites in favor of tough, targeted law enforcement; \naggressive steps to take guns out of the hands of criminal gang members \nand other violent juvenile offenders; and heavy emphasis on prevention \nprograms that discourage gang membership and provide realistic \nalternatives for at-risk youth.\n  The past decade saw a dramatic reduction in violent juvenile crime, \nin large part because of these crime-fighting strategies. Many of us \nremember the dire ``juvenile superpredator'' predictions that were \ncommon before that reduction took place. In 1996, William Bennett and \nJohn Walters wrote that America was a ``ticking crime bomb,'' faced \nwith the ``youngest, biggest, and baddest generation'' of juvenile \noffenders that our country had ever known. Fortunately, these \npredictions were wrong. From 1993 to 2001, arrest rates for violent \njuvenile crime fell by more than two-thirds. We're still reaping the \nbenefits of this lower crime rate today.\n  The decrease in crime is explained partly by the sensible measures \ntaken by Congress on gun safety in the early 1990's, including the ban \non assault weapons. In 1999, the National Center for Juvenile Justice \nconcluded that all of the increase in homicides by juveniles between \nthe mid-1980's and mid-1990's was firearms-related. The Surgeon General \nconcluded that guns were responsible for both the epidemic in juvenile \nviolence in the late 1980's and the decrease in violence after 1993. \n``It is now clear,'' the Surgeon General wrote, ``that the violence \nepidemic was caused largely by an upsurge in the use of firearms by \nyoung people. . . . Today's youth violence is less lethal, largely \nbecause of a decline in the use of firearms.'' The current ban on \nassault weapons is scheduled to expire in September, and given its \nproven results against crime, it is reckless for anyone to oppose its \ncontinuation.\n  Another factor that contributed to the remarkable decrease in \njuvenile violent crime was the innovative, cooperative crime-fighting \nstrategy developed in Boston and other communities across the nation. \nThe Boston strategy was neither a ``liberal'' nor a ``conservative'' \napproach. It engaged the entire community, including police and \nprobation officers, clergy and community leaders, and even gang members \nthemselves in a united effort to crack down on gang violence, \nstrengthen after-school prevention programs, and take guns out of the \nhands of juvenile offenders. This strategy was very successful--\njuvenile homicides dropped 80 percent from 1990 to 1995--and it \nsucceeded without prosecuting more juveniles as adults, without housing \nnonviolent juvenile offenders in adult facilities, and without spending \nhuge sums of money on new juvenile facilities.\n  The call for expanding federal prosecution of juveniles as adults was \nalready controversial in those years when juvenile violent crime was at \nits peak. It makes no sense today, when juvenile violent crime rates \nhave fallen to historic lows.\n  Unfortunately, an expansion is exactly what is sought by the \nsupporters of S. 1735, the Gang Prevention and Effective Deterrence \nAct. Their bill responds to the problem of gang violence in the wrong \nway. They want the expanded federal prosecution of juveniles as adults. \nThey want to federalize a broad range of street crimes now being \nprosecuted effectively at the local level. They want to create an \nunnecessary bureaucratic morass by duplicating law enforcement efforts \nnow taking place on drug trafficking. They support a one-size-fits-all, \nWashington-knows-best approach to juvenile crime that ignores the \nachievements of the past decade and will only make the current problem \nof gang violence worse.\n  Our bill, the ANTI-GANG Act, avoids the most serious defects of S. \n1735 by recognizing, first and foremost, the primary role of state and \nlocal law enforcement in responding to violent crime. The American Bar \nAssociation and the Judicial Conference have both called on Congress to \nconsider the risks of federalizing offenses that have traditionally \nbeen the responsibility of state criminal justice systems. Many of us \nsupport the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act (S. 966), to deal \nwith hate crimes. It would require the Justice Department to certify \nthe need for federal involvement before commencing federal prosecution \nof a hate crime. We also oppose the enactment of federal ``concealed \ncarry'' laws, which would undermine state and local gun-safety laws.\n  Instead of ignoring the primary role of state and local governments \nin fighting violent gang crimes in their communities, our ANTI-GANG Act \nstrengthens that role, by giving local law enforcement and prosecutors \nthe resources they need. It authorizes $52 million for cooperative \nprevention, investigation, and prosecution of gang crimes. It \nauthorizes $20 million for technology, equipment, and training, so that \nstate and local sheriffs, police agencies, and prosecutors can improve \ntheir identification of gang members and maintain databases with \ninformation to facilitate coordination among law enforcement and \nprosecutors. It authorizes $60 million for the protecting and \nrelocation of witnesses and victims of gang crimes, and $40 million for \ngrants for gang prevention, research, and intervention services.\n  The resources in our bill for witness relocation and protection are \nparticularly important. At a Judiciary Committee hearing last \nSeptember, state and local prosecutors specifically asked for \nCongress's help in protecting witnesses of gang crimes. Our bill \nresponds to this need by authorizing $60 million in assistance. By \ncontrast, the most recently revised version of S. 1735 authorizes only \n$12 million.\n  In addition, our bill amends the current law on governing federal \nwitness relocation and protection to make clear that the Attorney \nGeneral can use these provisions to support witnesses in state gang, \ndrug, and homicide cases. We also allow states to obtain the temporary \nprotection of witnesses in gang cases, without any requirement of \nreimbursement. The current complex reimbursement procedures deter state \nand local prosecutors from obtaining witness protection assistance from \nthe federal government, even in emergencies. Our bill offers \nneeded relief to state prosecutors undertaking difficult prosecutions \nof gang offenders, but no such relief is included in S. 1735.\n\n  The ANTI-GANG Act respects the primary role of state and local \ngovernments in fighting street crime, but it also recognizes that \nviolent gangs can be a substantial impact on federal interests. \nAccording to the most recent National Drug Threat Assessment, criminal \nstreet gangs are responsible for the distribution of much of the \ncocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and other illegal drugs being \ndistributed in communities throughout the United States. Gang activity \ninterferes with lawful commerce and undermines the freedom and security \nof entire communities.\n  The current provision on criminal street gangs in federal law is a \nseldom-used penalty enhancement. To address these legitimate federal \ninterests, the ANTI-GANG Act replaces that provision with a stronger \nset of measures criminalizing participation in criminal street gangs, \nrecruitment and retention of gang members, and witness intimidation. It \nalso increases penalties for gang members who target minors for \nrecruitment. It targets gang violence and gang crimes in a sensible \nway, avoiding the confusing and counterproductive approach taken in S. \n1735. Before any federal prosecution can take place under our bill, a \nhigh-level representative from the Justice Department, after \nconsultation with state and local prosecutors, must certify that the \nfederal prosecution is in the public interest and necessary to achieve \nsubstantial justice.\n  The Act strengthens the ability of prosecutors at all levels--\nfederal, state and local--to prosecute violent street gangs, and it \ndoes so without increasing any mandatory minimum sentences or \nunnecessarily expanding the federal death penalty to include state \nmurder offenses.\n  An increasing number of judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and \nother criminal justice authorities now agree that mandatory minimum \nsentences are, in the words of Justice Anthony Kennedy, ``unfair, \nunjust, and unwise.'' They are inconsistent with and undermine the \nsentencing guidelines that Congress established in the Sentencing\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\nReform Act of 1984. The supporters of S. 1735 have commendably removed \nsome of the mandatory sentencing provisions in their original bill, but \neven a single increased mandatory minimum is counterproductive and \nunjustified.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act also requires the General Accounting Office to \nconduct a comprehensive study and report on the current treatment of \njuveniles by states and local governments and the capability of the \nBureau of Prisons and other parts of the federal criminal justice \nsystem to take on the additional cases that would result from an \nexpansion of the federal prosecutions of juvenile offenders as adults. \nThis report will enable Congress to make a better informed decision on \nthis criminal issue.\n  Finally, the Act encourages the recruitment and retention of highly-\nqualified prosecutors and public defenders by establishing a student \nloan forgiveness program modeled on the current program for federal \nemployees. According to the National District Attorneys Association, \nthis provision ``would allow prosecutors to relieve the crushing burden \nof student loans that now cause so many young attorneys to abandon \npublic service.'' The provision is also strongly supported by the \nNational Legal Aid and Defender Association and the American Council of \nChief Defenders.\n  I commend my colleagues for their leadership in developing this \nimportant legislation to protect American communities from gang \nviolence without undermining fundamental principles of fairness and \nfederal-state relations. I urge the Senate to approve it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2359. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na refundable tax credit for small business health insurance costs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Healthy \nEmployees, Healthy Small Businesses Act of 2004. This legislation \naddresses a number of fundamental problems: the fact that millions of \nhard working American families have no health insurance, they live in \nfear that financial ruin is just one illness away, or that a family \nmember will need medical treatment that they simply can't afford; the \nfact that small businesses in this country are facing health care costs \nthat are skyrocketing far beyond the rate of inflation, and that as \nmuch as many small business owners would like to provide health \nbenefits to their employees, it is becoming more and more difficult for \nthem to afford these costs; and the fact that this health care dilemma \nis damaging our Nation's competitive position internationally.\n  In 2002, 44 million Americans lived without health insurance for the \nentire year. 85 percent of these uninsured people belong to working \nfamilies.\n  Think about that. The vast majority of the people in the United \nStates of America who have no health insurance work.\n  These uninsured workers are trapped in the middle--in fact, most of \nthem are middle class families. They do not receive health coverage \nthrough their jobs. They are too young to qualify for Medicare. They \nearn too much to qualify for a public health insurance program.\n  Yet they cannot afford private insurance plans.\n  For each one of those 44 million people, and each one of those \nmillions of families, living without health coverage causes real and \nserious problems.\n  Living without health insurance is difficult for anyone. It is \nespecially hard for parents with children. In addition to the constant \nworry about whether their child will have an accident or get sick, \nthere are serious long-term consequences for kids who grow up without \nhealth insurance.\n  Uninsured kids have a higher rate of acute and infectious diseases \nthan children who are covered by health insurance, and uninsured kids \nactually have a higher number of hospitalizations, because their \nproblems don't get treated until they become serious.\n  Uninsured children are: four times as likely to have necessary care \ndelayed; five times more likely to use a hospital emergency room as \ntheir regular source of care; and six times as likely as other children \nto go without the care they need.\n  But having no health care is a problem even when kids are not sick. \nIt forces parents into the kinds of choices that none of us would want \nto make, and that nobody in America should have to make.\n  When your daughter is uninsured, you have to think twice about \nsigning her up for a youth soccer league, because she might break her \narm.\n  When your son has no health coverage, maybe it is not safe to let him \nride his bike through the neighborhood, or try out his friend's new \nrollerblades.\n  Accidents happen to everyone, especially to active children. But when \nyour family has no health insurance, a simple fall requiring a few \nstitches, a broken bone, or a minor sports-related injury could result \nin hundreds or even thousands of dollars in emergency room fees.\n  In the end, in a lot of families, living without health insurance \nsometimes means that kids do not get to do very much living at all.\n  In her book The Betrayal of Work, Beth Shulman asked Flor Segunda, a \nworking mom with no health insurance, about how her family's uninsured \nstatus affects her kids. Segunda says:\n\n       Doctors require immediate payment before they will see you, \n     but many times I don't have the money. Right now, [my son] \n     Luis has a temperature. But I try to take care of it myself \n     because I can't afford to take him to the doctor every time. \n     It is one of the reasons I don't like my children to play \n     outside. They will get sick and I can't afford it.\n\n  A lack of access to health care can destroy a family's financial \nsecurity in a heartbeat--that is certainly true. But it can also deny \nuninsured kids some of the most basic and simple pleasures of being a \nchild: going outside to play, joining a tee-ball team, riding a bike.\n   Surely we can do better.\n  Living without health insurance is a terrible problem. So why are so \nmany families forced to do it? Who are these families trapped in the \nmiddle--earning too much to qualify for free care, but not enough to \npay for private insurance?\n  It turns out that more than half of the uninsured people in our \ncountry live in a family supported by someone who works for a small \nbusiness--meaning a company that employs fewer than 100 workers.\n  This is not because small businesses are less committed to their \nworkers than larger employers. On the contrary, the small business \nowners in my State seem to care a great deal about their employees. \nMost small business owners work closely with their employees, and they \nunderstand that the success of their enterprise depends on the loyalty \nof the people who work for them.\n  The reason small businesses are less likely to provide health \ninsurance is simply a matter of economics.\n  At a small business, where people are delivering a product or service \nwith just a handful of employees, the margin between revenues and costs \ncan be pretty slim.\n  That does not leave much room for error--or for rising costs. But \nhealth care costs are spiraling out of control.\n  Every year for the last several years, we have seen double-digit \ninflation in health care prices. With health care costs rising out of \nsight, small business owners are rightly concerned about whether these \nuncontrolled prices represent too much of a risk to their overall \nbusiness health.\n\n  My legislation would create a Federal refundable tax credit to \nreimburse small employers for part of the costs they incur for \nproviding health insurance coverage to their employees.\n  The HEHSB tax credit would operate on a sliding scale, providing a \nlarge tax credit to all businesses with fewer than 50 employees, but \ngiving the greatest tax relief to the smallest enterprises.\n  Last year, the average health insurance plan for a single person \ncosts $3,383, of which the employee paid an average of $508 and the \nemployer paid an average of $2,875.\n  For a family policy, the average cost totalled $9,068, with the \nemployee bearing $2,412 and the employer shouldering $6,656.\n  Under my bill, companies with fewer than 10 employees would be \neligible to claim a credit of 50 percent of the cost of each eligible \nemployee's policy, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual policy or \n$3,400 for a family policy.\n  Companies with 25 to 50 employees would be eligible to claim a credit \nof 35 percent of the cost of each eligible employee's policy, up to a \nlimit of $750 for\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\na self-only policy or $1,700 for a family policy.\n  I believe that this legislation will give more small business owners \nthe ability to do what they want to do in the first place: provide \ntheir first-rate employees with first-rate benefits.\n  It will shield them from the worst risks associated with rising \nhealth care costs.\n  And I hope that it will eventually result in families like the \nSegundas feeling a little more security and happiness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MILLER:\n  S.J. Res. 35. A joint resolution to repeal the seventeenth article of \namendment to the Constitution of the United States; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, we live in perilous times. The leader of \nthe free world's power has become so neutered he cannot, even with the \nsupport of the majority of the Senate, appoint highly qualified \nindividuals endorsed by the American Bar to a Federal court. He cannot \nconduct a war without being torn to shreds by partisans with their eyes \nset, not on he defeat of our enemy but on the defeat of our President.\n  The Senate has become just one big, bad, ongoing joke, held hostage \nby special interests, and so impotent an 18-wheeler truck loaded with \nViagra would do no good.\n  Andrew Young, one of the most thoughtful men in America, recently \ntook a long and serious look at the Senate. He was thinking about \nmaking a race for it. After visiting Washington, he concluded that the \nSenate is composed of:\n\n       A bunch of pompous, old--\n\nAnd I won't use his word here, I would say ``folks''--\n\n     listening to people read statements they didn't even write \n     and probably don't believe.\n\n  The House of Representatives, theoretically the closest of all the \nFederal Government to the people, cannot restrain its extravagant \nspending nor limit our spiraling debt, and incumbents are so entrenched \nyou might as well call off 80 percent of the House races. There are no \ncontests.\n  Most of the laws of the land, at least the most important and lasting \nones, are made not by elected representatives of the people but by \nunelected, unaccountable legislators in black robes who churn out \nvolumes of case law and hold their jobs for life. A half dozen dirty \nbombs the size of a small suitcase planted around the country could \nkill hundreds of thousands of our citizens and bring this Nation to its \nknees at any time, and yet we can't even build a fence along our border \nto keep out illegals because some nutty environmentalists say it will \ncause erosion.\n  This Government is in one hell of a mess. Frankly, as Rett Butler \nsaid--my dear, very few people up here give a damn.\n  It is not funny. It is sad. It is tragic. And it can only get worse--\nmuch worse. What this Government needs is one of those extreme \nmakeovers they have on television, and I am not referring to some minor \nnose job or a little botox here and there.\n  Congressional Quarterly recently devoted an issue to the mandate \nwars, with headlines blaring: ``Unfunded Mandates Add to Woes, States \nSay; Localities Get the Bill for Beefed Up Security; Transportation \nMoney Comes With Strings, and Medicare Stuck in Funding Squabbles,'' et \ncetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n  One would think that the much heralded Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n1995 never passed. The National Conference of State Legislatures has \nset the unfunded mandate figure for the States at $33 billion for 2005. \nThis, along with the budget problems they have been having for the last \nfew years, has put States under the heel of a distant and unresponsive \ngovernment. That is us. And it gives the enthusiastic tax raisers at \nthe State level the very excuse they are looking for to dig deeper and \ndeeper into the pockets of their taxpayers.\n  It is not a pretty picture. No matter who you send to Washington, for \nthe most part smart and decent people, it is not going to change much \nbecause the individuals are not so much at fault as the rotten and \ndecaying foundation of what is no longer a Republic. It is the system \nthat stinks, and it is only going to get worse because that perfect \nbalance our brilliant Founding Fathers put in place in 1787 no longer \nexists.\n  Perhaps, then, the answer is a return to the original thinking of \nthose wisest of all men, and how they intended for this government to \nfunction. Federalism, for all practical purposes, has become to this \ngeneration of leaders, some vague philosophy of the past that is dead, \ndead, dead. It isn't even on life support. The line on that monitor \nwent flat some time ago.\n  You see, the reformers of the early 1900s killed it dead and cremated \nthe body when they allowed for the direct election of U.S. Senators.\n  Up until then, Senators were chosen by State legislatures, as James \nMadison and Alexander Hamilton had so carefully crafted.\n  Direct elections of Senators, as great and as good as that sounds, \nallowed Washington's special interests to call the shots, whether it is \nfilling judicial vacancies, passing laws, or issuing regulations. The \nState governments aided in their own collective suicide by going along \nwith that popular fad at the time.\n  Today it is heresy to even think about changing the system. But can \nyou imagine those dreadful unfunded mandates being put on the States or \na homeland security bill being torpedoed by the unions if Senators were \nstill chosen by and responsible to the State legislatures?\n  Make no mistake about it. It is the special interest groups and their \nfundraising power that elect Senators and then hold them in bondage \nforever.\n  In the past five election cycles, Senators have raised over $1.5 \nbillion for their election contests, not counting all the soft money \nspent on their behalf in other ways. Few would believe it, but the \ndaily business of the Senate in fact is scheduled around fundraising.\n  The 17th amendment was the death of the careful balance between State \nand Federal Government. As designed by that brilliant and very \npractical group of Founding Fathers, the two governments would be in \ncompetition with each other and neither could abuse or threaten the \nother. The election of Senators by the State legislatures was the \nlynchpin that guaranteed the interests of the States would be \nprotected.\n  Today State governments have to stand in line because they are just \nanother one of the many special interests that try to get Senators to \nlisten to them, and they are at an extreme disadvantage because they \nhave no PAC.\n  You know what the great historian Edward Gibbons said of the decline \nof the Roman Empire. I quote: ``The fine theory of a republic \ninsensibly vanished.''\n  That is exactly what happened in 1913 when the State legislatures, \nexcept for Utah and Delaware, rushed pell-mell to ratify the popular \n17th amendment and, by doing so, slashed their own throats and \ndestroyed federalism forever. It was a victory for special-interest \ntyranny and a blow to the power of State governments that would cripple \nthem forever.\n  Instead of Senators who thoughtfully make up their own minds as they \ndid during the Senate's greatest era of Clay, Webster, and Calhoun, we \nnow have too many Senators who are mere cat's-paws for the special \ninterests. It is the Senate's sorriest of times in its long, checkered, \nand once glorious history.\n  Having now jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge of political reality, \nbefore I hit the water and go splat, I have introduced a bill that \nwould repeal the 17th amendment. I use the word ``would,'' not \n``will,'' because I know it doesn't stand a chance of getting even a \nsingle cosponsor, much less a single vote beyond my own.\n  Abraham Lincoln, as a young man, made a speech in Springfield, IL, in \nwhich he called our founding principles ``a fortress of strength.'' \nThen he went on to warn, and again I quote, that they ``would grow more \nand more dim by the silent artillery of time.''\n  A wise man, that Lincoln, who understood and predicted all too well \nthe fate of our republican form of government. Too bad we didn't listen \nto him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4504]]\n\n                              S.J.

Res. 345\n\n       Whereas, 4.5 million children in the United States are \n     living in grandparent-headed households--a 30% increase from \n     1990 to 2000--and an additional 1.5 million children are \n     living in households headed by other relatives;\n       Whereas 70% of grandparents who report they are responsible \n     for the grandchildren living with them are under the age of \n     60, many of whom are still in the workforce and making a \n     valuable contribution to the national economy;\n       Whereas, an increasing number of parents are unable to \n     raise their own children due to substance abuse, \n     incarceration, illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, child abuse and \n     neglect, domestic and community violence, unemployment and \n     poverty, and other serious community crises;\n       Whereas, grandparents and other relatives raising children, \n     especially those without formal legal custody or guardianship \n     of the children under their care, face a variety of \n     unnecessary barriers, including difficulties enrolling \n     children in school, authorizing medical treatment, \n     maintaining their public housing leases, obtaining affordable \n     legal services, and accessing a variety of federal benefits \n     and services;\n       Whereas, grandparents and other relatives have stepped \n     forward at great personal sacrifice to their financial and \n     health status, to provide safe and loving homes and keep \n     thousands of children from unnecessarily entering the formal \n     foster care system;\n       Whereas children feel content to live in an environment \n     with people that they know, who are familiar, and who are \n     able to provide them with extended family as additional \n     support and a family history, which gives them a sense of \n     belonging.\n       Whereas the time, effort, and unselfish commitment shown by \n     these family members is worthy of recognition.\n       Whereas, almost one-fifth of grandparents who report that \n     they are responsible for the grandchildren living with them \n     live in poverty;\n       Whereas, grandparents and other relatives have taken over \n     the care of abused and neglected children who have been \n     removed from their homes even though they often fail to \n     receive the same services and supports offered to non-related \n     foster parents.\n       Whereas, grandparents and other relatives, whether raising \n     children inside or outside of the foster care system, need \n     better access to health insurance, respite care, child care, \n     special education, housing, and other benefits, and where \n     appropriate, support from Temporary Assistance For Needy \n     Families, federal foster care and subsidized guardianship \n     programs.\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that\n       (A) Congress and all Americans should recognize and \n     publicly laud the commitment of grandparents, aunts, uncles, \n     and other relative caregivers raising children whose parents \n     are unable or unwilling to do so;\n       (B) Congress urges institutions and government entities at \n     every level to promote public policies that support, and \n     remove barriers to these caregivers;\n       (C) Congress should establish new and expanded appropriate \n     supports and services, such as respite care, housing, and \n     subsidized guardianship, for grandparents and other relatives \n     who are raising children inside and outside of the foster \n     care system.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be submitting a \nresolution that urges Congress to expand the supports and services \navailable to grandparents and other relatives who are raising children \nwhen their biological parents can no longer take care of them. I am \npleased to have worked with my friend and colleague, Senator Olympia \nSnowe, in crafting this important bill.\n  Today, in Albany, NY, there is a ``GrandRally'' going on to celebrate \nand honor the almost 300,000 children who live in grandparent-headed \nhouseholds--a total of 6.3 percent of all children in New York State. \nAnother 112,000 children live in households headed by other relatives. \nI am so pleased that this resolution coincides with the GrandRally \nbecause they compliment each other nicely.\n  Nationwide, four and a half million children are living in \ngrandparent-headed households and an additional 1.5 million children \nare living in households headed by other relatives. This represents a \n30 percent increase between 1990 and 2000.\n  Kinship care families came to be because there are many tragic \ninstances when parents are unable to raise their own children. Serious \nillness, death, substance abuse, incarceration, domestic violence, and \nunemployment are just some of the reasons that have forced grandparents \nand other relatives to step forward, often at great personal sacrifice, \nto provide safe and loving homes for the children in their care. This \nhas allowed thousands of children to live with extended family rather \nthan strangers.\n  We know that children are better off living in an environment with \npeople that they know, who are familiar, and who are able to provide \nthem with extended family as additional support. When foster children \nare placed with family members rather than strangers, they gain a \ncritical sense of belonging and a family history.\n\n[[Page S4505]]\n\n  Unfortunately, these grandparents and other relatives raising \nchildren often face a number of unnecessary barriers, including \ndifficulties enrolling children in school, authorizing medical \ntreatment, and accessing a variety of government benefits and services. \nAlmost one-fifth of grandparents who are serving as the parents for \ntheir grandchildren are living in poverty.\n  The time, effort, and unselfish commitment of these family members is \nworthy of recognition.\n  This resolution encourages institutions and government entities at \nevery level to promote public policies that support these caregivers by \nexpanding existing services such as respite care, housing, and \nsubsidized guardianship for grandparents and other relatives who are \nraising children inside and outside of the foster care system.\n  I want to thank all of my colleagues who are cosponsors of this \nresolution. Senator Snowe and I are being joined by a diverse, \nbipartisan group of Senators whose commitment to this issue \ndemonstrates the broad range of support for kinship care families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 101--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n REGARDING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SUPREME COURT DECISION IN BROWN \n                    V. BOARD OF EDUCATION OF TOPEKA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Roberts) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 101\n\n       Whereas Oliver L. Brown is the namesake of the landmark \n     United States Supreme Court decision of 1954, Brown v. Board \n     of Education (347 U.S. 483, 1954);\n       Whereas Oliver L. Brown is honored as the lead plaintiff in \n     the Topeka, Kansas case which posed a legal challenge to \n     racial segregation in public education;\n        Whereas by 1950, African-American parents began to renew \n     their efforts to challenge State laws that only permitted \n     their children to attend certain schools, and as a result, \n     they organized through the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People (the NAACP), an organization \n     founded in 1909 to address the issue of the unequal and \n     discriminatory treatment experienced by African-Americans \n     throughout the country;\n       Whereas Oliver L. Brown became part of the NAACP strategy \n     led first by Charles Houston and later by Thurgood Marshall, \n     to file suit against various school boards on behalf of such \n     parents and their children;\n       Whereas Oliver L. Brown was a member of a distinguished \n     group of plaintiffs in cases from Kansas (Brown v. Board of \n     Education), Delaware (Gebhart v. Belton), South Carolina \n     (Briggs v. Elliot), and Virginia (Davis v. County School \n     Board of Prince Edward County) that were combined by the \n     United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, \n     and in Washington, D.C. (Bolling v. Sharpe), considered \n     separately by the Supreme Court with respect to the District \n     of Columbia;\n       Whereas with respect to cases filed in the State of \n     Kansas--\n       (1) there were 11 school integration cases dating from 1881 \n     to 1949, prior to Brown v. Board of Education in 1954;\n       (2) in many instances, the schools for African-American \n     children were substandard facilities with out-of-date \n     textbooks and often no basic school supplies;\n       (3) in the fall of 1950, members of the Topeka, Kansas \n     chapter of the NAACP agreed to again challenge the ``separate \n     but equal'' doctrine governing public education;\n       (4) on February 28, 1951, the NAACP filed their case as \n     Oliver L. Brown et al. v. The Board of Education of Topeka \n     Kansas (which represented a group of 13 parents and 20 \n     children);\n       (5) the district court ruled in favor of the school board \n     and the case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court;\n       (6) at the Supreme Court level, the case was combined with \n     other NAACP cases from Delaware, South Carolina, Virginia, \n     and Washington, D.C. (which was later heard separately); and\n       (7) the combined cases became known as Oliver L. Brown et \n     al. v. The Board of Education of Topeka, et al.;\n       Whereas with respect to the Virginia case of Davis et al. \n     v. Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors--\n       (1) one of the few public high schools available to \n     African-Americans in the State of Virginia was Robert Moton \n     High School in Prince Edward County;\n       (2) built in 1943, it was never large enough to accommodate \n     its student population;\n       (3) the gross inadequacies of these classrooms sparked a \n     student strike in 1951;\n       (4) the NAACP soon joined their struggles and challenged \n     the inferior quality of their school facilities in court; and\n       (5) although the United States District Court ordered that \n     the plaintiffs be provided with equal school facilities, they \n     were denied access to the schools for white students in their \n     area;\n       Whereas with respect to the South Carolina case of Briggs \n     v. R.W. Elliott--\n       (1) in Clarendon County, South Carolina, the State NAACP \n     first attempted, unsuccessfully and with a single plaintiff, \n     to take legal action in 1947 against the inferior conditions \n     that African-American students experienced under South \n     Carolina's racially segregated school system;\n       (2) by 1951, community activists convinced African-American \n     parents to join the NAACP efforts to file a class action suit \n     in United States District Court;\n       (3) the court found that the schools designated for \n     African-Americans were grossly inadequate in terms of \n     buildings, transportation, and teacher salaries when compared \n     to the schools provided for white students; and\n       (4) an order to equalize the facilities was virtually \n     ignored by school officials, and the schools were never made \n     equal;\n       Whereas with respect to the Delaware cases of Belton v. \n     Gebhart and Bulah v. Gebhart--\n       (1) first petitioned in 1951, these cases challenged the \n     inferior conditions of 2 African-American schools;\n       (2) in the suburb of Claymont, Delaware, African-American \n     children were prohibited from attending the area's local high \n     school, and in the rural community of Hockessin, Delaware, \n     African-American students were forced to attend a dilapidated \n     1-room schoolhouse, and were not provided transportation to \n     the school, while white children in the area were provided \n     transportation and a better school facility;\n       (3) both plaintiffs were represented by local NAACP \n     attorneys; and\n       (4) though the State Supreme Court ruled in favor of the \n     plaintiffs, the decision did not apply to all schools in \n     Delaware;\n       Whereas with respect to the District of Columbia case of \n     Bolling, et al. v. C. Melvin Sharpe, et al.--\n       (1) 11 African-American junior high school students were \n     taken on a field trip to Washington, D.C.'s new John Philip \n     Sousa School for white students only;\n       (2) the African-American students were denied admittance to \n     the school and ordered to return to their inadequate school; \n     and\n       (3) in 1951, a suit was filed on behalf of the students, \n     and after review with the Brown case in 1954, the United \n     States Supreme Court ruled that segregation in the Nation's \n     capitol was unconstitutional;\n       Whereas on May 17, 1954, at 12:52 p.m., the United States \n     Supreme Court ruled that the discriminatory nature of racial \n     segregation ``violates the 14th Amendment to the \n     Constitution, which guarantees all citizens equal protection \n     of the laws'';\n       Whereas the decision in Brown v. Board of Education set the \n     stage for dismantling racial segregation throughout the \n     country;\n       Whereas the quiet courage of Oliver L. Brown and his fellow \n     plaintiffs asserted the right of African-American people to \n     have equal access to social, political, and communal \n     structures;\n       Whereas our country is indebted to the work of the NAACP \n     Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., Howard University \n     Law School, the NAACP, and the individual plaintiffs in the \n     cases considered by the Supreme Court;\n       Whereas Reverend Oliver L. Brown died in 1961, and because \n     the landmark United States Supreme Court decision bears his \n     name, he is remembered as an icon for justice, freedom, and \n     equal rights; and\n       Whereas the national importance of the Brown v. Board of \n     Education decision had a profound impact on American culture, \n     affecting families, communities, and governments by outlawing \n     racial segregation in public education, resulting in the \n     abolition of legal discrimination on any basis: Now therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the Congress recognizes and honors the 50th anniversary \n     of the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education \n     of Topeka;\n       (2) the Congress encourages all people of the United States \n     to recognize the importance of the Supreme Court decision in \n     Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka;\n       (3) by celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Brown v. \n     Board of Education of Topeka, the Nation will be able to \n     refresh and renew the importance of equality in society; and\n       (4) the Rotunda of the Capitol is authorized to be used on \n     May 13, 2004 or June 17, 2004 for a ceremony to commemorate \n     the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark decision \n     in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 \n     (1954);\n\n     physical preparations for the ceremony shall be carried out \n     in accordance with such conditions as the Architect of the \n     Capitol may prescribe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4505-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4505-S4506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3052.

GRANTS TO IMPROVE THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF FOREST \n                   BIOMASS FOR ELECTRIC ENERGY, USEFUL HEAT, \n                   TRANSPORTATION FUELS, PETROLEUM-BASED PRODUCT \n                   SUBSTITUTES, AND OTHER COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Thousands of communities in the United States, many \n     located near Federal lands, are at risk to wildfire. \n     Approximately 190,000,000 acres of land managed by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior \n     are at risk of catastrophic fire in the near future. The \n     accumulation of heavy forest fuel loads continues to increase \n     as a result of disease, insect infestations, and drought, \n     further raising the risk of fire each year.\n       (2) In addition, more than 70,000,000 acres across all land \n     ownerships are at risk to higher than normal mortality over \n     the next 15 years from insect infestation and disease. High \n     levels of tree mortality from insects and disease result in \n     increased fire risk, loss of old growth, degraded watershed \n     conditions, and changes in species diversity and \n     productivity, as well as diminished fish and wildlife habitat \n     and decreased timber values.\n       (3) Preventive treatments such as removing fuel loading, \n     ladder fuels, and hazard trees, planting proper species mix \n     and restoring and protecting early successional habitat, and \n     other specific restoration treatments designed to reduce the \n     susceptibility of forest land, woodland, and rangeland to \n     insect outbreaks, disease, and catastrophic fire present the \n     greatest opportunity for long-term forest health by creating \n     a mosaic of species-mix and age distribution. Such prevention \n     treatments are widely acknowledged to be more successful and \n     cost effective than suppression treatments in the case of \n     insects, disease, and fire.\n       (4) The byproducts of preventive treatment (wood, brush, \n     thinnings, chips, slash, and other hazardous fuels) removed \n     from forest lands, woodlands and rangelands represent an \n     abundant supply of biomass for biomass-to-energy facilities \n     and raw material for business. There are currently few \n     markets for the extraordinary volumes of byproducts being \n     generated as a result of the necessary large-scale preventive \n     treatment activities.\n\n[[Page S4518]]\n\n       (5) The United States should--\n       (A) promote economic and entrepreneurial opportunities in \n     using byproducts removed through preventive treatment \n     activities related to hazardous fuels reduction, disease, and \n     insect infestation; and\n       (B) develop and expand markets for traditionally underused \n     wood and biomass as an outlet for byproducts of preventive \n     treatment activities.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Biomass.--The term ``biomass'' means trees and woody \n     plants, including limbs, tops, needles, and other woody \n     parts, and byproducts of preventive treatment, such as wood, \n     brush, thinnings, chips, and slash, that are removed--\n       (A) to reduce hazardous fuels; or\n       (B) to reduce the risk of or to contain disease or insect \n     infestation.\n       (2) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 4(e) of the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. \n     450b(e)).\n       (3) Person.--The term ``person'' includes--\n       (A) an individual;\n       (B) a community (as determined by the Secretary concerned);\n       (C) an Indian tribe;\n       (D) a small business, micro-business, or a corporation that \n     is incorporated in the United States; and\n       (E) a nonprofit organization.\n       (4) Preferred community.--The term ``preferred community'' \n     means--\n       (A) any town, township, municipality, or other similar unit \n     of local government (as determined by the Secretary \n     concerned) that--\n       (i) has a population of not more than 50,000 individuals; \n     and\n       (ii) the Secretary concerned, in the sole discretion of the \n     Secretary concerned, determines contains or is located near \n     land, the condition of which is at significant risk of \n     catastrophic wildfire, disease, or insect infestation or \n     which suffers from disease or insect infestation; or\n       (B) any county that--\n       (i) is not contained within a metropolitan statistical \n     area; and\n       (ii) the Secretary concerned, in the sole discretion of the \n     Secretary concerned, determines contains or is located near \n     land, the condition of which is at significant risk of \n     catastrophic wildfire, disease, or insect infestation or \n     which suffers from disease or insect infestation.\n       (5) Secretary concerned.--The term ``Secretary concerned'' \n     means--\n       (A) the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to National \n     Forest System lands; and\n       (B) the Secretary of the Interior with respect to Federal \n     lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior \n     and Indian lands.\n       (c) Biomass Commercial Use Grant Program.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary concerned may make grants to \n     any person that owns or operates a facility that uses biomass \n     as a raw material to produce electric energy, sensible heat, \n     transportation fuels, or substitutes for petroleum-based \n     products to offset the costs incurred to purchase biomass for \n     use by such facility.\n       (2) Grant amounts.--A grant under this subsection may not \n     exceed $20 per green ton of biomass delivered.\n       (3) Monitoring of grant recipient activities.--As a \n     condition of a grant under this subsection, the grant \n     recipient shall keep such records as the Secretary concerned \n     may require to fully and correctly disclose the use of the \n     grant funds and all transactions involved in the purchase of \n     biomass. Upon notice by a representative of the Secretary \n     concerned, the grant recipient shall afford the \n     representative reasonable access to the facility that \n     purchases or uses biomass and an opportunity to examine the \n     inventory and records of the facility.\n       (d) Improved Biomass Use Grant Program.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary concerned may make grants to \n     persons to offset the cost of projects to develop or research \n     opportunities to improve the use of, or add value to, \n     biomass. In making such grants, the Secretary concerned shall \n     give preference to persons in preferred communities.\n       (2) Selection.--The Secretary concerned shall select a \n     grant recipient under paragraph (1) after giving \n     consideration to the anticipated public benefits of the \n     project, including the potential to develop thermal or \n     electric energy resources or affordable energy, opportunities \n     for the creation or expansion of small businesses and micro-\n     businesses, and the potential for new job creation.\n       (3) Grant amount.--A grant under this subsection may not \n     exceed $500,000.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated $50,000,000 for each of the fiscal years \n     2004 through 2014 to carry out this section.\n       (f) Report.--Not later than October 1, 2010, the Secretary \n     of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of the \n     Interior, shall submit to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources and the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Resources, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the \n     Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives a \n     report describing the results of the grant programs \n     authorized by this section.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Phone Bill Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC.--02. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Customer bills for telecommunications services are \n     unreasonably complicated, and many Americans are unable to \n     understand the nature of services provided to them and the \n     charges for which they are responsible.\n       (2) One of the purposes of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996 (Public Law 104-104) was to unleash competitive and \n     market forces for telecommunications services.\n       (3) Unless customers can understand their \n     telecommunications bills they cannot take advantage of the \n     newly competitive market for telecommunications services.\n       (4) Confusing telecommunications bills allow a small \n     minority of providers of telecommunications services to \n     commit fraud more easily. The best defense against \n     telecommunications fraud is a well informed consumer. \n     Consumers cannot be well informed when their \n     telecommunications bills are incomprehensible.\n       (5) Certain providers of telecommunications services have \n     established new, specific charges on customer bills commonly \n     known as ``line-item charges''.\n       (6) These line-item charges have proliferated and are often \n     described with inaccurate and confusing names.\n       (7) These line-item charges have generated significant \n     confusion among customers regarding the nature and scope of \n     universal service and of the fees associated with universal \n     service.\n       (8) The National Association of Regulatory Utility \n     Commissioners adopted a resolution in February 1998 \n     supporting action by the Federal Communications Commission to \n     require interstate telecommunications carriers to provide \n     accurate customer notice regarding the implementation and \n     purpose of end-user charges for telecommunications services.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to require the \n     Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade \n     Commission to protect and empower consumers of \n     telecommunications services by assuring that \n     telecommunications bills, including line-item charges, issued \n     by telecommunications carriers nationwide are both accurate \n     and comprehensible.\n\n     SEC.--03. INVESTIGATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER BILLING \n                   PRACTICES.\n\n       (a) Investigation.--\n       (1) Requirement.--The Federal Communications Commission and \n     the Federal Trade Commission shall jointly conduct an \n     investigation of the billing practices of telecommunications \n     carriers.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of the investigation is to \n     determine whether the bills sent by telecommunications \n     carriers to their customers accurately assess and correctly \n     characterize the services received and fees charged for such \n     services, including any fees imposed as line-item charges.\n       (b) Determinations.--In carrying out the investigation \n     under subsection (a), the Federal Communications Commission \n     and the Federal Trade Commission shall determine the \n     following:\n       (1) The prevalence of incomprehensible or confusing \n     telecommunications bills.\n       (2) The most frequent causes for confusion on \n     telecommunications bills.\n       (3) Whether or not any best practices exist, which, if \n     utilized as an industry standard, would reduce confusion and \n     improve comprehension of telecommunications bills.\n       (4) Whether or not telecommunications bills that impose \n     fees through line-item charges characterize correctly the \n     nature and basis of such fees, including, in particular, \n     whether or not such fees are required by the Federal \n     Government or State governments.\n       (c) Review of Records.--\n       (1) Authority.--For purposes of the investigation under \n     subsection (a), the Federal Communications Commission and the \n     Federal Trade Commission may obtain from any \n     telecommunications carrier any record of such carrier that is \n     relevant to the investigation, including any record \n     supporting such carrier's basis for setting fee levels or \n     percentages.\n       (2) Use.--The Federal Communications Commission and the \n     Federal Trade Commission may use records obtained under this \n     subsection only for purposes of the investigation.\n       (d) Disciplinary Actions.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Federal Communications Commission \n     or the Federal Trade Commission determines as a result of the \n     investigation under subsection (a) that the bills sent by a \n     telecommunications carrier to its customers do not accurately \n     assess or correctly characterize any service or fee contained \n     in such bills, the Federal Communications Commission or the \n     Federal Trade Commission, as the case may be, may take such \n     action against such carrier as such Commission is authorized \n     to take under law.\n       (2) Characterization of fees.--If the Federal \n     Communications Commission or the Federal Trade Commission \n     determines as a result of the investigation under subsection \n     (a) that a telecommunications carrier has characterized a fee \n     on bills sent to its customers as mandated or otherwise \n     required by the Federal Government or a State and that such \n     characterization is incorrect, the Federal Communications \n     Commission or the Federal Trade Commission, as the case may\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\n     be, may require the carrier to discontinue such \n     characterization.\n       (3) Additional actions.--If the Federal Communications \n     Commission or the Federal Trade Commission determines that \n     such Commission does not have authority under law to take \n     actions under paragraph (1) that would be appropriate in \n     light of a determination described in paragraph (1), the \n     Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Trade \n     Commission, as the case may be, shall notify Congress of the \n     determination under this paragraph in the report under \n     subsection (e).\n       (e) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission \n     and the Federal Trade Commissions shall jointly submit to \n     Congress a report on the results of the investigation under \n     subsection (a). The report shall include the determination, \n     if any, of either Commission under subsection (d)(3) and any \n     recommendations for further legislative action that such \n     Commissions consider appropriate.\n\n     SEC. _04. TREATMENT OF MISLEADING TELECOMMUNICATIONS BILLS \n                   AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS RATE PLANS.\n\n       (a) Federal Trade Commission.--The Federal Trade Commission \n     shall treat any telecommunications billing practice or \n     telecommunications rate plan that the Commission determines \n     to be intentionally misleading as an unfair business practice \n     under the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et \n     seq.).\n       (b) Federal Communications Commission.--The Federal \n     Communications Commissions shall, upon finding that any \n     holder of a license under the Commission has repeatedly and \n     intentionally engaged in a telephone billing practice, or has \n     repeatedly and intentionally utilized a telephone rate plan, \n     that is misleading, treat such holder as acting against the \n     public interest for purposes of the Communications Act of \n     1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. _05.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4) was passed--\n       (1) ``to end the imposition, in the absence of full \n     consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, \n     local, and tribal governments without adequate Federal \n     funding, in a manner that may displace other essential State, \n     local, and tribal governmental priorities'';\n       (2) to provide ``for the development of information about \n     the nature and size of mandates in proposed legislation'';\n       (3) ``to establish a point-of-order vote on the \n     consideration in the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     legislation containing significant Federal intergovernmental \n     mandates without providing adequate funding to comply with \n     such mandates'';\n       (4) to require that ``Federal agencies prepare and consider \n     better estimates of the budgetary impact of regulations \n     containing Federal mandates upon State, local, and tribal \n     governments before adopting such regulations, and ensuring \n     that small governments are given special consideration in \n     that process''; and\n       (5) to establish the general rule that Congress shall not \n     impose Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal \n     governments without providing adequate funding to comply with \n     such mandates.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 constituted an \n     important pledge on the part of the Federal Government, in \n     general, and Congress, in particular, to refrain from \n     imposing Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal \n     governments without providing adequate resources to \n     compensate State, local, and tribal governments for the cost \n     of complying with such mandates;\n       (2) at this time when State, local, and tribal governments \n     are struggling to cope with the worst State and local fiscal \n     crisis since World War II, it is urgently important that \n     Congress adhere to its commitments under the Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act of 1995; and\n       (3) Congress should not pass laws mandating that States or \n     localities spend new money or forgo collecting currently \n     collected revenues, unless Congress--\n       (A) has clear and precise estimates of the budgetary \n     impacts of such mandates upon States, local governments, and \n     tribal governments; and\n       (B) provides adequate funding to cover the cost to States \n     and localities of complying with such mandates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3063. Mr. CARPER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to \namendment SA 3048 proposed by Mr. McCain to the bill S. 150, to make \npermanent the moratorium on taxes on Internet access and multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce imposed by the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                   TITLE II--CORPORATE SUBSIDY REFORM\n\n     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Corporate Subsidy Reform \n     Commission Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal subsidies, including tax advantages, which may \n     have been enacted with a valid purpose for specific \n     industries or industry segments can--\n       (A) fall subject to abuse, causing unanticipated and \n     unjustified windfalls to some industries and industry \n     segments; or\n       (B) become obsolete, anticompetitive, or no longer in the \n     public interest, making such subsidies unnecessary or \n     undesired;\n       (2) it is unfair to force the United States taxpayer to \n     support unnecessary subsidies, including tax advantages, that \n     do not provide a substantial public benefit or serve the \n     public interest;\n       (3) the Congress has been unable to evaluate methodically \n     those Federal subsidies that are unfair and unnecessary and \n     require reform or elimination; and\n       (4) a Commission to advise the Congress is essential to a \n     comprehensive review of such unfair corporate subsidies and \n     to the reform or elimination of such subsidies.\n\n     SEC. 203. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to establish a fair and \n     deliberative process that will result in the timely \n     identification, review, and reform or elimination of \n     unnecessary and inequitable subsidies, including tax \n     advantages, provided by the Federal Government to entities or \n     industries engaged in profit-making enterprises.\n\n     SEC. 204. DEFINITION.\n\n       For purposes of this title, the term ``inequitable Federal \n     subsidy''--\n       (1) except as provided in paragraph (2), means a payment, \n     benefit, service, or tax advantage that--\n       (A) is provided by the Federal Government to any \n     corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, or \n     business trust other than--\n       (i) a nonprofit organization described under section \n     501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that is exempt \n     from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986; or\n       (ii) a State or local government or Indian Tribe; and\n       (B) provides an unfair competitive advantage or financial \n     windfall; and\n       (2) does not include a payment, benefit, service, or tax \n     advantage that is awarded for the purposes of research and \n     development in the broad public interest on the basis of a \n     peer reviewed or other open, competitive, merit-based \n     procedure.\n\n     SEC. 205. THE COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established an independent \n     commission to be known as the ``Corporate Subsidy Reform \n     Commission'' (hereafter in this title referred to as the \n     ``Commission'').\n       (b) Duties.--The Commission shall--\n       (1) examine the programs and laws of the Federal Government \n     and identify such programs and laws that provide inequitable \n     Federal subsidies;\n       (2) review inequitable Federal subsidies; and\n       (3) submit the report required under section 206(c) to the \n     Congress, making recommendations regarding the termination, \n     modification, or retention of inequitable Federal subsidies.\n       (c) Limitations.--\n       (1) Creation of new programs or taxes.--This title is not \n     intended to result in the creation of new programs or taxes. \n     The Commission established in this section shall limit its \n     activities to reviewing existing programs or laws with the \n     goal of ensuring fairness and equity in the operation and \n     application thereof.\n       (2) Elimination of agencies and departments.--The \n     Commission--\n       (A) shall limit its recommendations to the termination or \n     reform of payments, benefits, services, or tax advantages; \n     and\n       (B) shall not recommend the termination of any Federal \n     agency or department.\n       (d) Advisory Committee.--The Commission shall be considered \n     an advisory committee within the meaning of that term in the \n     Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C.

Mr. GRAHAM of Florida submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed to amendment SA 3048 proposed by Mr. McCain to the bill S. \n150, to make permanent the moratorium on taxes on Internet access and \nmultiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce imposed by the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act; which was ordered to lie on the table; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Whereas the United States, its people and its armed forces, \n     are committed to winning the war on terrorism;\n       Whereas winning this global war will require a sustained \n     sacrifice from our troops, an expensive commitment of U.S. \n     resources, and effective and credible intelligence community, \n     and considerable cooperation of the international community;\n       Whereas winning this global war will also require that our \n     leaders correctly prioritize the national security threats \n     facing this nation, develop a plan for defeating those \n     threats, and urgently implement the measures required to \n     defeat those threats;\n       Whereas senior Bush Administration officials have \n     acknowledged that terrorism was not their top priority prior \n     to September 11, 2001, their strategy to counter this threat \n     took eight months to develop, and this strategy was not \n     implemented until after September 11, 2001.\n       Whereas Richard Clarke, President Bush's former senior \n     counter-terrorism advisor, has testified under oath that the \n     Bush Administration did not consider terrorism the top \n     priority and reports indicate that terrorism was discussed at \n     only two of the 100 meetings of the Bush Administration's \n     National Security Council prior to September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas Richard Clarke also testified that he provided Bush \n     Administration officials a memo on January 25, 2001 outlining \n     a counter-terrorism strategy and in September, 2001 the \n     Administration approved a counter-terrorism strategy that, \n     according to Clarke, was virtually identical to the strategy \n     outlined in his January memo;\n       Whereas the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, were \n     the deadliest ever directed against the United States and \n     there have been more terrorist attacks by al-Qaeda and \n     related groups in the 30 months since September 11, 2001 than \n     there were in the 30 months before September 11;\n       Whereas the Administration's policies have generated \n     growing hostility and resentment of the United States \n     throughout the Middle East and the world and majorities in \n     key Muslim countries have a more favorable opinion of Osama \n     Bin Laden than they do the United States;\n       Whereas the assessment by David Kay, the Administration's \n     chief weapons inspector, that there are no weapons of mass \n     destruction in Iraq has eroded the confidence of the American \n     people and the world in the assessment of our intelligence \n     community and our policymakers;\n       Whereas the bipartisan, bicameral joint congressional \n     inquiry into the intelligence\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n\n     community's activities before and after September 11, 2001, \n     discovered many strengths and weaknesses within the community \n     pertaining to counter-terrorism;\n       Whereas many of the joint inquiry's testimony and documents \n     remain classified and inaccessible, including June 11, 2002 \n     testimony by Richard Clarke and a twenty-eight page section \n     that addresses the involvement of a foreign government in \n     supporting several of the hijackers who carried out the \n     September 11 attacks;\n       Whereas Richard Clarke and the Majority and Minority \n     Leaders of the United States Senate have requested that \n     Clarke's June 11, 2002, testimony before the Joint Inquiry be \n     declassified; and\n       Whereas an Administration decision to selectively \n     declassify parts of documents or of individual documents will \n     not present to our troops and the American people the \n     complete information they need and deserve;\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the June 11, 2002 testimony of Richard Clarke before \n     the joint inquiry should immediately be declassified and \n     publicly released in its entirety;\n       (2) the twenty-eight pages of the joint inquiry report \n     discussing foreign government involvement in the September 11 \n     terrorist plot should be immediately declassified and \n     publicly released in their entirety, as well as any other \n     joint inquiry documents and testimony whose classification \n     can no longer be justified;\n       (3) the January 25, 2001 memorandum prepared by Richard \n     Clarke outlining a plan of action against the al-Qaeda \n     terrorist organization and the Bush Administration's \n     September 4, 2001 National Security Directive addressing \n     terrorism should be immediately declassified and publicly \n     released in their entirety; and\n       (4) the Bush Administration should immediately prepare and \n     publicly release a list of the dates and topics of all \n     National Security Council meetings that took place before \n     September 11, 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3075.

Therefore, it is important that Congress examine the \n     issues surrounding the availability and subscription to \n     broadband service.\n       (2) The Federal Communications Commission recently \n     concluded that advanced telecommunications capability is \n     being deployed in a reasonable and timely manner and that \n     although investment trends in general have slowed recently, \n     investment in infrastructure for advanced telecommunications \n     remains strong.\n       (3) Approximately 89 percent of Americans have access to \n     broadband service provided by either the cable or telephone \n     companies.\n       (4) Some communities, such as those in rural and urban \n     areas do not have access to broadband service.\n       (5) According to numerous reports approximately 21 percent \n     of consumers subscribe to broadband service, leading many to \n     believe that the low adoption of broadband by consumers is \n     not due to low availability, but instead to a lack of demand \n     by consumers.\n       (6) Cable and telephone companies generally provide \n     broadband service with speeds of up to 1.5 megabits per \n     second to residential consumers. How ever, many in the \n     technology industry state that higher speeds are needed to \n     provide telemedicine, video conferencing, movie and music \n     over the internet and other internet applications.\n       (7) The Federal Communications Commission's policies for \n     promoting broadband deployment must not undermine competition \n     or universal service.\n       (8) Congress must explore ways to ensure that broadband \n     service is available to all Americans and that no one is left \n     behind. This includes exploring ways to increase deployment \n     in unserved and underserved areas, address consumer demand \n     factors, facilitate innovation that results in higher service \n     speeds, and promote consumer confidence when using the \n     Internet.\n\n         Subtitle A--Trust Fund for Broadband Loans and Grants\n\n     SEC. --101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sales and Use Tax Fairness \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the November 12, 2002, Streamlined Sales and Use Tax \n     Agreement establishes minimum requirements for a sales and \n     use tax system that simplifies and harmonizes State sales and \n     use tax laws and administrative procedures; and\n       (2) the Agreement, once implemented, will eliminate any \n     undue burden on interstate commerce associated with requiring \n     remote sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the sales and use tax \n     system established by the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax \n     Agreement provides sufficient simplification and uniformity \n     to warrant Federal authorization to States that are parties \n     to the Agreement to require remote sellers, subject to the \n     conditions provided in this Act, to collect and remit the \n     sales and use taxes of such States and of local taxing \n     jurisdictions of such States.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION TO REQUIRE COLLECTION OF SALES AND USE \n                   TAXES.\n\n       (a) Grant of Authority.--Once ten States comprising at \n     least twenty percent of the total population of all States \n     imposing a sales tax, as determined by the 2000 Federal \n     census, have petitioned for membership under the Streamlined \n     Sales and Use Tax Agreement in the manner required by the \n     Agreement, have been found to be in compliance with the \n     Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, and have \n     become Member States under the Agreement, any Member State \n     under the Agreement is authorized, notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, to require all sellers not qualifying for \n     the small business exception provided under subsection (b) to \n     collect and remit sales and use taxes with respect to remote \n     sales to purchasers located in such State. Such authorization \n     shall terminate if the requirements of the preceding sentence \n     cease to be met. Such authorization shall also terminate for \n     any Member State if such Member State no longer complies with \n     the minimum requirements of the Agreement existing on \n     November 12, 2002, or if such requirements are no longer \n     complied with by ten States that otherwise meet the \n     requirements of this subsection. Determinations regarding \n     compliance with the requirements of this subsection shall be \n     made by the Governing Board (or, where provided by the \n     Agreement, the States petitioning for membership under the \n     Agreement) subject to the governance provisions of Section 5.\n       (b) Small Business Exception.--No seller shall be subject \n     to a requirement of any State to collect and remit sales and \n     use taxes with respect to a remote sale where the seller and \n     its affiliates collectively had gross sales nationwide of \n     less than $5,000,000 in the calendar year preceding the date \n     of such sale.\n       (c) Reasonable Seller Compensation.--The authority provided \n     in subsection (a) shall be conditioned on acceptance and \n     implementation by all Member States under the Agreement of a \n     requirement that such States provide reasonable and uniform \n     compensation for expenses incurred by sellers related to the \n     collection and remittance of the sales and use taxes of such \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 5. GOVERNANCE.\n\n       (a) Petition.--Any person who may be affected by the \n     Agreement may petition the Governing Board for a \n     determination on any issue relating to the implementation of \n     the Agreement.\n       (b) Review in Court of Federal Claims.--Any person who has \n     submitted a petition under subsection (a) may bring an action \n     against the Governing Board in the United States Court of \n     Federal Claims for judicial review of the action of the \n     Governing Board on that petition if--\n       (1) The petition related to (A) an issue of whether a State \n     has met or continues to meet the requirements for Member \n     State status under the Agreement, or (B) an issue of whether \n     the Governing Board has performed a non-discretionary duty of \n     the Governing Board under the Agreement; and\n       (2) The petition was denied by the Governing Board in whole \n     or in part with respect to that issue, or the Governing Board \n     failed to act on the petition with respect to that issue \n     within six months of the date on which the petition was \n     submitted.\n       (c) Timing of Action for Review.--An action for review \n     under this section shall be initiated within 60 days of the \n     Governing Board's denial of the petition as provided in \n     subsection (b), or, if the Governing Board failed to act on \n     the petition as provided in subsection (b), within 90 days \n     following the expiration of the six-month period following \n     the date on which the petition was submitted.\n       (d) Standard of Review.--In any action for review under \n     this section, the court shall set aside the actions, \n     findings, and conclusions of the Governing Board found to be \n     arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \n     not in accordance with law.\n       (e) Jurisdiction.--Chapter 91 of Title 28 of the United \n     States Code is amended by adding at the end thereof:\n\n     Sec. 1510. Jurisdiction regarding the Streamlined Sales and \n       Use Tax Agreement\n\n       The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have \n     exclusive jurisdiction over actions for judicial review of \n     determination of the Governing Board of the Streamlined Sales \n     and Use Tax Agreement under the terms and conditions provided \n     in section 5 of the Sales and Tax Fairness Act.\n\n     SEC. 6.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4) was passed--\n       (1) ``to end the imposition, in the absence of full \n     consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, \n     local, and tribal governments without adequate Federal \n     funding, in a manner that may displace other essential State, \n     local, and tribal governmental priorities'';\n       (2) to provide ``for the development of information about \n     the nature and size of mandates in proposed legislation'';\n       (3) ``to establish a point-of-order vote on the \n     consideration in the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     legislation containing significant Federal intergovernmental \n     mandates without providing adequate funding to comply with \n     such mandates'';\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\n       (4) to require that ``Federal agencies prepare and consider \n     better estimates of the budgetary impact of regulations \n     containing Federal mandates upon State, local, and tribal \n     governments before adopting such regulations, and ensuring \n     that small governments are given special consideration in \n     that process''; and\n       (5) to establish the general rule that Congress shall not \n     impose Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal \n     governments without providing adequate funding to comply with \n     such mandates.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 constituted an \n     important pledge on the part of the Federal Government, in \n     general, and Congress, in particular, to refrain from \n     imposing Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal \n     governments without providing adequate resources to \n     compensate State, local, and tribal governments for the cost \n     of complying with such mandates;\n       (2) at this time when State, local, and tribal governments \n     are struggling to cope with the worst State and local fiscal \n     crisis since World War II, it is urgently important that \n     Congress adhere to its commitments under the Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act of 1995; and\n       (3) Congress should not pass laws mandating that States or \n     localities spend new money or forgo collecting currently \n     collected revenues, unless Congress--\n       (A) has clear and precise estimates of the budgetary \n     impacts of such mandates upon States, local governments, and \n     tribal governments; and\n       (B) provides adequate funding to cover the cost to States \n     and localities of complying with such mandates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3080.

Mr. President, tomorrow morning, following morning \nbusiness, the Senate will resume consideration of the Internet tax \nbill. There will be up to 1 hour of debate prior to the cloture vote on \nthe Daschle amendment on renewable fuels. If all time is used, the \ncloture vote on the Daschle amendment will occur at approximately 12 \ntomorrow, and that will be the first rollcall vote of the day. If \ncloture is not invoked on the Daschle amendment, the Senate will \nimmediately proceed to a cloture vote on Domenici amendment No. 3051 on \nenergy policy. If cloture fails on the Domenici amendment, the Senate \nwill proceed to a cloture vote on the pending McCain substitute. \nTherefore, up to three rollcall votes are possible beginning at 12 \ntomorrow.\n  It is my hope we will be able to make progress on the bill tomorrow. \nIf we are able to invoke cloture, we would move forward with Internet-\ntax-related amendments.\n  Senators should therefore anticipate additional votes during \ntomorrow's session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I chose not to object to the unanimous consent request \ndealing with what we are going to be doing tomorrow. We would just hope \nthat the good offices of the majority leader would allow, if, in fact, \ncloture is not invoked on Daschle or Domenici, and we have to go to \nMcCain, that we could have some arrangement that we could have a little \nbit of debate before voting on the McCain cloture because we have our \nparty policy luncheon tomorrow. It may not be a bad idea, and we can \ncertainly discuss this with others on the majority side, for Senator \nMcCain and others, if, in fact, cloture is not invoked on those first \ntwo motions that have been filed, that we have a little time to get rid \nof the two energy matters and get back on Internet and discuss that, \nand that would put us with just a short debate of maybe an hour or so \ninto the end of the policy luncheon.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand their policy luncheon is \ntomorrow, and clearly we will make every consideration for them to \ncontinue with that. We will schedule the votes--it depends on how each \nof these cloture votes go--after discussion over the course of the \nmorning. Again, the first rollcall vote will begin at approximately \nnoon tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/28/senate-section/article/S4624-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
