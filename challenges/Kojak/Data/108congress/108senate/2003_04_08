Forgive us whenever we deny the ``better \nangels'' of our nature, thus depriving ourselves of divine guidance and \nhelp.\n  We need Thy help now as a nation of nations, peerless in military \npower and economic potential, that we do not fall into the temptations \nof overweening superiority or self-centered isolationism. We know from \nthis Republic's foundation, recognizing divine endowments received, \nthat righteousness alone exalts a nation and where this vision is \nlacking, people cast off restraint and perish. Save us from such an end \nthrough corruption of the spirit. Teach us that we are alive for a \npurpose and that popularity in the world does not necessarily equate \nwith divine approval. May we learn individually and collectively from \nthe words of the old hymn:\n\n     Some will hate thee, some will love thee,\n     Some will flatter, some will slight;\n     Cease from man, and look above thee:\n     Trust in God and do the right.\n\n  Lord God, we need Thy help daily to discern the right. Knowing how \nmixed human motives can be, keep this Nation ever facing toward good \nends of liberation from oppression, humanitarian help, others' self-\ndetermination and lasting peace. In this sinful world, grant wisdom to \nthose creating necessary firebreaks of lesser evil to contain and \nextinguish the greater, since fervent wishing will not make it so.\n  Comfort and bless all whose suffering is part of the price of peace. \nGive grace to this Senate as they make decisions that will affect many, \nand grasp each opportunity for good afforded by the sacrifices made. \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4919-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4919-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning \nbusiness today until 10:30 a.m. This is the time set aside for Senators \nto honor the men and women fighting in Iraq.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume debate on the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen to be a circuit court judge for the Fifth \nCircuit. A number of Senators have indicated they are prepared to speak \non her nomination, and I hope they will do so during today's session.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, the Senate has only confirmed two circuit \ncourt nominees this year. We have a total of six circuit court \nnominations pending on the Executive Calendar awaiting Senate action. I \nwill continue to work with the Democratic leader to try to schedule \nthese judicial nominations for a vote at a time certain.\n  Having said that, it is my hope that later today we will be able to \nreach a consent agreement to vote on the pending Owen nomination. I \nhope Members will not object to that agreement once they are given an \nopportunity to speak during today's session.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly \nparty lunches.\n  It is my expectation that the Senate will take up the CARE Act this \nafternoon under the agreement reached last week. There is an \nunderstanding that although we will begin this bill this afternoon, we \nwill not finish the CARE Act until Wednesday morning. In addition, \nthere are a number of other remaining issues that may be addressed this \nweek prior to the April recess, and therefore Senators should expect \nvotes each day of the session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, from 10:30 until 12:30, is there any need \nthat we, in effect, guard the floor, and that there will be no call for \nthe vote on the Owen nomination this morning?\n  Mr. FRIST. That would be fine. We do not expect to vote between 10:30 \nand 12:30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4919-6", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I am going to continue what the \nSenate has been doing since our troops started the invasion of Iraq, \nand that is to take the first period before we go on to the business of \nthe day to salute the troops who are in the field protecting our \nfreedom.\n  Today, I want to salute the members of the 507th Maintenance Company. \nThis is the company out of Fort Bliss in El Paso, TX, who really were \nthe first to be captured, the first prisoners of war shown on Iraqi \ntelevision. Some of them have now been recovered, but there are still \nfive missing.\n  The rescue of PFC Jessica Lynch was a moment of triumph but also \nsadness, as the celebration was tempered by the recovery of the remains \nof fallen soldiers who were later identified as her comrades in arms. \nGeneral Renuart at CENTCOM described the rescue this way: A special ops \nsoldier called to Private Lynch saying:\n\n       Jessica Lynch, we're United States soldiers and we're here \n     to protect you and take you home. . . .\n\n  As he walked over to her bed, took his helmet off, she looked up to \nhim and said:\n\n       I'm an American soldier, too.\n\n  General Renuart also described the recovery of the remains of the \nsoldiers who had been killed because they were told by the same sources \nthat there were remains of other soldiers on the ground outside the \nhospital where Jessica lay. He said:\n\n       At the same time, the team was led to a burial site, where, \n     in fact, they did find a number of bodies that they believed \n     could be Americans missing in action. They did not have \n     shovels in order to dig those graves up, so they dug them up \n     with their hands. And they wanted to do that very rapidly so \n     they could race the sun and be off the site before the sun \n     came up; a great testament to the will and desire of \n     coalition forces to bring their own home.\n\n  That one line says all you will ever need to know about the character \nof the young men and women in the military today, who refuse to leave \ntheir fallen comrades behind: They dug them up with their hands, and \nraced the sun.\n  On Friday evening, the families of those whose remains were recovered \nwere officially notified that their loved ones had been killed in \naction. We mourn their loss.\n  They were PFC Lori Ann Piestewa, the first American woman soldier \nkilled in the Iraq war. This is a picture showing the two friends, PFC \nJessica Lynch and PFC Lori Piestewa. They were at Fort Bliss the day of \ntheir deployment. They were roommates and friends.\n  Private First Class Piestewa was a Hopi Indian, one of the few \nAmerican Indian women serving in the military. She was PFC Jessica \nLynch's good friend and roommate.\n  ``Our family is proud of her; she is our hero,'' her brother Wayland \nsaid Saturday. ``We are going to hold that in our hearts. She will not \nbe forgotten. It gives us comfort to know that she is at peace right \nnow.''\n  Behind me are the pictures of some who have died in action, and I am \ngoing to speak about each of them.\n  In Texas, there is a town called Comfort that lived up to its name by \nembracing and comforting the parents of SP James Kiehl. In Comfort, TX, \nthe parents of SP James M. Kiehl are being comforted by their friends \nand neighbors. The 6-foot 8-inch soldier was a high school basketball \nplayer and a member of the band. The people of Comfort, moved by James' \ndeath, created an impromptu memorial where basketballs, flower \narrangements, personal notes, and even baseball bats have been left as \ntributes to James. His father summed up the family's feelings this way:\n\n       We just want everyone to know we support the President and \n     the troops, and we believe in what James went over there for.\n\n  James Kiehl's wife, Jill, is staying with her parents in Des Moines, \nIA, and is expecting their first child next month.\n  In Mobile, AL, Rev. Howard Johnson, Sr., buried his son, Army PFC \nHoward Johnson, Jr., from the same pulpit of the Truevine Baptist \nChurch where he had stood so many times offering words of comfort to \nhis congregation. Reverend Johnson said of his son:\n\n       Howard, you out ran me, but I'll see you in the morning.\n\n  SGT Donald Walters of Kansas City, MO, fought in Operation Desert \nStorm and had followed in his father's footsteps by joining the \nmilitary. His father, Norman Walters, is an Air Force veteran and said \nthis about his son:\n\n       He was a patriotic guy. He felt it was his duty to serve \n     his country.\n\n  Sergeant Walters leaves behind a wife and three daughters.\n  MSG Robert Dowdy and PVT Brandon Sloan were both from Cleveland, OH. \nMaster Sergeant Dowdy's brother-in-law had this to say about the career \nsoldier:\n\n       He was ready to accept the challenge. That's the type of \n     person he was. He knew going in what he was in store for and \n     who he was and what he was about.\n\n  Private Sloan's father, the Rev. Tandy Sloan, proudly said his son \n``was very committed to the cause of country.''\n  PVT Ruben Estrella-Soto was from El Paso, TX. This is his graduation \npicture. His father said his son\n\n     had a lot of desire to do something with his life, and wanted \n     to go into the military so he could get education.\n\n  CWO Johnny Villareal Mata was from Amarillo, TX. He played football \non the Pecos High School Eagles football team and graduated in 1986. \nSoon thereafter he joined the Army. The family remembered him this way:\n\n       Our hearts are saddened, and we share the pain with the \n     other families. He will be deeply missed and will never be \n     forgotten.\n\n  SP Jamaal Addison of Roswell, GA, is remembered by his step-\ngrandmother as ``a mild-mannered, quiet child'' who attended Bible \nstudy every Wednesday night before joining the Army.\n  The 507th Maintenance Company still has five soldiers who are \nprisoners of war. They are SP Shoshana Johnson, SP Edgar Hernandez, SP \nJoseph Hudson, PFC Patrick Miller, and SGT James Riley. I have talked \nwith Claude Johnson, Shoshana's father, several times. He and his wife \nEunice are caring for Shoshana's 2-year-old daughter.\n  These five have not been seen publicly since several hours after they \nwere taken prisoner March 23, and the International Committee of the \nRed Cross has not yet been able to visit them in captivity. We join all \nAmericans in urging the Iraqi Government to treat those prisoners in \naccordance with the Geneva Convention, just as we have treated the \nthousands of Iraqi prisoners we hold.\n  We pray those prisoners of war from the 507th Maintenance Company \nwill be returned safely to their families. We pay tribute to them today \nfor the sacrifices they have made.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute to \nour men and women in uniform serving at home and abroad and honor their \nservice to this Nation. Our service men and women have risen to the \ncall in the fight against terrorism. They have risen to the call to \nensure peace and stability in the world. And they have risen to the \ncall to provide humanitarian aid to those in need.\n  One of the great aspects about America is our military. We have a \nhistory in our armed services, a rich and deep history of honor and \nintegrity, and we see that firsthand in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  I wish to acknowledge the ultimate sacrifice of two of our servicemen \nwho fell in the line of duty: Hospital Corpsman Michael Vann Johnson, \nJr., a 25-year-old Navy medic serving in the 3rd Battalion of the 5th \nMarine Expeditionary Force. Michael was born in Little Rock where his \nmother still lives. I talked with her by phone the other day. She is a \nsoldier in her own right.\n  LCpl Thomas Blair was a 24-year-old marine whose father, Al Blair, \nresides in Gravette, AR.\n  They died very bravely, both serving their country and both trying to \nmake life better for mankind. I pray for their families, and I honor \nthem as brave and selfless men who put their lives on the line to make \nthe world safer for others.\n  I also pray for Iraq and the Iraqi people. I pray that after Saddam \nHussein leaves power and that regime ends, the next government in Iraq \nwill be peaceful; that it will not be oppressive of its own people; \nthat it will not be aggressive toward its neighbors; that Iraq will \nbecome a solid rock in the Middle East and in that part of the world \nand a model of stability.\n  I also honor the service of LCpl James, or as we know him, ``Jason,''\n\n[[Page S4921]]\n\nSmedley of the U.S. Marine Corps. Jason was wounded in combat and, by \nthe grace of God, he is returning to us now. When not fighting for his \ncountry, he serves in the office of my colleague from Arkansas, Senator \nBlanche Lincoln, assisting Arkansans. We look forward to having Jason \nback, around and helping Arkansans in the many ways he does.\n  Military service is not a job; it is a calling. It takes a special \nperson to pledge to serve their country, risking life and limb in doing \nso. It takes courage, commitment, and a true sense of self to be \nprepared to deploy and fight for America.\n  I have two young children, ages 7 and 9, and I think about the \nchildren of our military men and women. I think about the boys and \ngirls whose fathers and mothers are far from home or working long hours \nin the United States. I want them to know we appreciate the sacrifices \nthey are making, that we admire their valor in keeping their spirits \nup, and that their parents are doing a job that epitomizes the best in \nhuman character.\n  I pray to God for peace, for world peace, and for the safe return of \nour troops, and I thank God. I thank God for allowing me to serve the \npeople of this Nation in this way. As a Senator and a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, I stand ready to work with my colleagues and \nthe President to provide any and all support possible to ensure the \nsuccess of our military forces conducting these operations.\n  Our Nation is one of diverse views, diverse ideologies, and diverse \nopinions. That is one of the aspects that make America great. We might \nnot all agree on how we got to this point; nonetheless, we come \ntogether as one country to support the service men and women who are \ncurrently risking life and limb for this great Nation. They put \nthemselves in harm's way not for personal aggrandizement or advancement \nbut for immense love of country, liberty, and family.\n  If they can hear me today, I say be assured that the American people \nare behind you.\n  When appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee a few weeks \nago, GEN John Keane, Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, testified to \nthe courage of our military personnel. He said, when asked what is \ntheir greatest challenge, his division commanders replied: Keeping our \nsoldiers from being too brave. They are brave, but we want them to \nreturn home.\n  This is not just for our regular Armed Forces but also for our \nReserves and our members of the National Guard. They all play a very \nkey role in maintaining strong national defense. Just as we should \nthank our military overseas and at home, we should also thank our first \nresponders who protect our hometowns. Firefighters, police, health care \npersonnel, they risk their lives every day and sacrifice precious time \nwith their families every day to keep us safe from those who would try \nto do us harm. Their commitment and contributions to national security \nand homeland security should not be forgotten. We all salute their \nspirit.\n  I urge all Americans to pray for our troops, their families and our \nPresident, as we defend our Nation and the world from those who seek to \ndo us harm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, as I stand on the floor of the Senate, it \nis crystal clear that the reign of the dictator of Iraq is quickly \ncoming to an end. In fact, he may already have fallen as a result of \nyesterday's bombings. There is no question that his death grip around \nthe throats of the Iraqi people is being lifted; his fingers pried by \nAmerican, British, and other coalition forces at places such as Basra, \nMosul, and Baghdad. But the freedom of Iraq has come at a loss, a loss \nof American, British, and Iraqi lives. I mourn the death of each and \nevery one of our sons and daughters, folks who volunteered to stand in \nharm's way for freedom and liberties we wish for all people. They are \nsons and daughters of a great American revolution that never ends. The \ncause of freedom and liberty never ends.\n  We see pictures every day of uncommon valor, the soldiers who rescued \na young Jessica Lynch from her captors, the young men and women who \ndashed hundreds of miles from Iraq to the borders of Baghdad to \nliberate the people of that oppressed nation, or the soldiers--and \nthere was one scene I watched on the news of three soldiers with a \nreporter. They had enough juice in a cell phone to make one call. One \nof the soldier's wives was pregnant, but instead of calling their \nfamilies, they chose to call the parents of a fallen comrade to see how \nhis mom and dad were doing.\n  There are dozens of pictures of American soldiers comforting the \npeople of Iraq, bringing them food and offering them compassion. These \nare America's sons and daughters. They are the pictures of America that \nthe world sees today. They are the pictures of America that bring hope \nto oppressed people of the world. They are SPC Joshua Sams of St. \nFrancis, MN, a paratrooper in the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Following in \nthe boot steps of a military family, Joshua's father was in the Army \nduring the Korean war. Two of his brothers are in the Army now and one \nis in the National Guard awaiting deployment. Joshua joined the \nNational Guard at the age of 17. After 2 years, he wanted to do more \nfor his country, and Joshua's mom said her son had trained hard for \nmonths and was anxious to go to Iraq, was ready to go to Iraq, ready to \nheed the call of duty. Two weeks ago today, Joshua was among the brave \nparatroopers who leapt into northern Iraq and remains there today \nguarding a vital airstrip. Thank you, Joshua, for your service, for \nyour commitment and for your bravery.\n  I would also like to take a moment to pay tribute to David Bloom, a \nMinnesotan. Like millions of Americans, I watched the broadcasts of \nDavid Bloom of NBC from Iraq, a young man full of promise with a young \nvibrant family. This dedicated reporter left all of us much too soon. \nIt is a long way from the shady streets of Edina, MN, David Bloom's \nhometown, to the outskirts of Baghdad. We are heartbroken at the death \nof David Bloom.\n  Like every other American, he was there as a volunteer. His job was \nnot to fight but to help tell the world the truth about the courage and \nintegrity of our country, even at war. He turned out to be an \noutstanding representative of these qualities himself.\n  Americans have always known that freedom and security come at a \nterribly high price. It humbles and inspires us all how many are \nwilling to pay it for us. David Bloom made Minnesotans proud and he \nserved his profession and his Nation with great valor. Our prayers and \nsupport will be with his spouse and his daughters.\n  I would like to use the words of some of his colleagues and friends \nto demonstrate the professionalism and humanism of this wonderful \nreporter. The following remarks were on MSNBC recently. Tom Brokaw \nsaid:\n\n       David was the consummate reporter. He'd land in my office \n     without knocking, slide the chair up to my desk and then \n     begin to suck all the oxygen out of the room asking questions \n     how to cover the story or who should he be contacting. And \n     then, in a flash, he'd be gone.\n\n  Tim Russert, one of David's mentors, says:\n\n       He had a sense of decency and civility. He didn't go for \n     the cheap shot. You fuse that with professionalism, and he \n     had something viewers wanted to watch, embrace.\n\n  Yes, the sacrifice of our troops and their families must never be \nforgotten. But we must also remember the outpouring of love back at \nhome and the countless acts of kindness and support on behalf of our \nfighting men and women. I think of the small Catholic grade school in \nHampton, MN, that has just 57 students in the entire school. The \nschoolchildren came up with a wonderful way to show their affection and \nappreciation for our troops on the battlefield.\n  They issued a ``penny challenge'' last week. Each class was given a \npail and children were asked to drop pennies, do what they can, even on \na small scale to show their support. Administrators were amazed at how \nmuch money they raised, more than $1,000 with the money going for care \npackages to U.S. troops in Iraq. Parents were very supportive as well, \nbut the smallest children were the ones who collected the most money, \nthe kindergartners.\n  Another show of support came from the magic of television. Believe it \nor\n\n[[Page S4922]]\n\nnot, the first pitch of the Minnesota Twins's home opener this week was \nthrown out from the Middle East by a group of Minnesota soldiers. Josh \nTverger, a U.S. Army specialist from Norwood Young America, MN, threw \nout the first pitch from the Kuwaiti desert. In the Metro Dome, Army SP \nGreta Lind of Le Sueur, MN, was on the receiving end. It was all \naccomplished through the spectacular technical satellite links similar \nto what our military has put to such stunning use on the battlefield, \nand now on the ballfield.\n  Yes, there is much love at home. There is also much sadness in many \nhomes and villages of those who have given their lives. We thank them. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with those who are on the front line \ntoday. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who have \ngiven the ultimate sacrifice. If we could hug every one of them, moms \nand dads and sisters and brothers, I would do it and I know the Senator \nfrom Georgia would do the same.\n  They have our love. They have our prayers. They have our thoughts. \nGod bless them all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \na wonderful statement. Certainly, every single life that is lost over \nthere is appreciated and will be appreciated forever in the hearts of \nAmericans because those young men and women are protecting the freedom \nwe enjoy.\n  David Bloom, a constituent of the Senator from Minnesota, was also \nprotecting our way of life. He was protecting the freedom of the press. \nHe was serving so well to do that. I knew David personally, as most \nMembers did, because he was such a special person and he did his job, \nworked hard, and was here a lot. We very much miss him and we know so \nmany of his colleagues miss him, as well.\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about T.R. Fehrenbach, a constituent of \nmine, who wrote what many think is the definitive book on the Korean \nwar called ``This Kind of War.'' It is appropriate today. We have been \namazed at the technological capability of our military in the war in \nIraq. They have launched missiles, dropped bombs, and delivered other \nordnance on the battlefield with pinpoint accuracy. I came across a \npicture today reminiscent of our soldiers from an earlier era that \nreminds me of some basic truths that apply no matter how much \ntechnological capability we might acquire.\n  I have a picture of American troops from the Army's 101st Airborne \nDivision marching into Bastogne during World War II. This was the \ncounterattack against the Germans. We see the 101st Airborne Division. \nI have another picture taken last week of the 101st Airborne Division, \nnearly 60 years later--a column from the First Brigade march into \nNajaf, Iraq, on Wednesday, April 2, 2003, doing basically the same \nthing.\n  These photographs demonstrate an old axiom about military operations \nthat was written by Ted Fehrenbach in ``This Kind of War,'' a book \nabout the Korean war:\n\n       Americans in 1950 rediscovered something that since \n     Hiroshima they had forgotten: You may fly over a land \n     forever; you may bomb it, atomize it, pulverize it and wipe \n     it clean of life--but if you desire to defend it, protect it, \n     and keep it for civilization, you must do this on the ground, \n     the way the Roman legions did, by putting your young men into \n     the mud.\n\n  I know Ted Fehrenbach and I know he would have said today, by putting \nyour brave young soldiers and marines in the mud, because what he is \nsaying essentially is the same today as it was in 1950. And that is, if \nyou want to protect a land and keep it for civilization, you must have \nour young men and women willing to go in on the ground. The truth is \nstill the same today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4922-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MORNING BUSINESS CLOSED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and resume consideration of Executive \nCalendar 86, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Priscilla \nRichman Owen, of Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise today to express my unqualified support for the \nconfirmation of Justice Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Last evening I talked about the importance of this debate and \nthis vote. I talked about this vote as an opportunity to remedy the \nmistreatment Justice Owen received last September when she was voted \ndown in committee, along party lines, and blocked from receiving a \nSenate vote. We know she would have been confirmed in the Senate by \nboth Democrat and Republican Members, but unfortunately she was never \nallowed to make it to that point. I talked about this vote as an \nopportunity for the Senate to show we can be fair to a well-qualified \nnominee and provide him or her a simple up-or-down vote.\n  Finally, I talked about this vote as an opportunity to place a great \njudge, Justice Owen, on the bench. I convened a hearing for Justice \nOwen last month because I wanted to provide all of my colleagues an \nopportunity to ask questions of her and to hear her answers. I want to \nclear up misstatements and misrepresentations of her record dating back \nto last year. I was confident Justice Owen would again demonstrate her \nintelligence and capacity for Federal judicial service. To put it \nmildly, she certainly did not disappoint. She handled questions with \ninsightful and substantive answers. She was a superb witness, one of \nthe best we have ever had before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  We heard valuable testimony from Senator Cornyn, a new Senator, but \nno newcomer to Justice Owen's record or the workings of the Judiciary. \nIn fact, he served with Justice Owen on the Texas Supreme Court for a \nperiod of 3 years, serving side by side with her. He had been a Texas \ntrial judge before that time. He also served as a Texas State attorney \ngeneral for the last 3 years. Senator Cornyn answered a frequent \ncriticism leveled at Justice Owen, a criticism that is false, that she \nis out of the mainstream on her own court. If anyone would know whether \nJustice Owen, in fact, fits this characterization, Senator Cornyn would \nknow. He worked next to her, heard the very same oral arguments she \ndid, examined and debated the same law and facts with her, and decided \nthe very same cases she did.\n  There is no doubt, then, Justice Cornyn disagreed with Justice Owen \nat times. I can reel off a few case names as well as anyone. But the \nsignificant thing is that he supports her confirmation despite attempts \nby some to create division where none exists.\n  Former Texas Supreme Court Justices John L. Hill, Jack Hightower, and \nRaul Gonzalez, all Democrats, are united in concurring with Senator \nCornyn's opinion calling Justice Owen unbiased and restrained in her \ndecisionmaking and applauding her for her impeccable integrity, for her \ngreat character and great scholarship. The diverse and formidable \ngroup, made up of 15 former presidents of the Texas State bar, wrote in \na letter of support: Although we prefer different party affiliations \nand span the spectrum of views of legal and policy issues, we stand \nunited in affirming that Justice Owen is a true, unique, and \noutstanding candidate for the appointment to the Fifth Circuit.\n  There is no dissent from Hector De Leon, immediate past president of \nLegal Aid of Central Texas, who applauds Justice Owen's commitment to \nimproving the quality of legal services for the poor, or from Mary Sean \nO'Reilly, lifelong member of the NAACP, pro-choice Democrat who worked \nwith Justice Owen on gender and family law issues. They are joined in \nsupport by E. Thomas Bishop, president of the Texas Association of \nDefense Counsel, who writes: I cannot imagine a more qualified, \nethical, and knowledgeable person to sit on the Fifth Circuit; and \nWilliam B. Emmons, self-styled Texas trial attorney, Democrat, and ``no \nfriend of Priscilla\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\nOwen''--those are his words--who, nevertheless, said: Justice Owen will \nserve the Fifth Circuit of the United States exceptionally well.\n  Those who have been in support of Justice Owen are familiar with her \nrecord of service, but it deserves brief review in the Senate. \nPriscilla Owen is a native of Palacios, Texas, a town located on the \nsouthern coast of Texas, grew up in Waco, TX, and attended school \nthere. Following graduation from high school, Justice Owen enrolled in \nBaylor University where she received a bachelor of arts degree cum \nlaude. She attended Baylor University School of Law with a scholarship, \nagain excelling in studies by achieving cum laude and serving as a \nmember of the law review. She scored the highest score in the State on \nthe Texas bar exam after finishing school, a terrific accomplishment in \na State the size of Texas.\n  Justice Owen worked for the Houston firm Andrews & Kurth as a \ncommercial litigator for 17 years, gaining seasoning in appearances \nbefore Texas State and Federal courts and courts elsewhere.\n  Besides extensive work in oil and gas litigation, she handled \nsecurities matters and did work on cases heard by the Texas Railroad \nCommission. She became a partner with the firm in the mid-1980s.\n  Priscilla Owen successfully ran for a seat on the Texas Supreme Court \nin 1994 and was reelected in the year 2000 for another 6-year term. Her \nreelection run in 2000 was supported by every major Texas newspaper. \nShe won with 84 percent of the popular vote.\n  Based on this shining record of academic and professional \nachievement, the American Bar Association awarded Justice Owen a \nunanimous well-qualified rating. That is after sending representatives \ninto the State, talking to people on all sides of various issues; \ntalking to people on both sides of the political spectrum, both \nDemocrats and Republicans; talking to fellow members of the bar, those \nwho knew her the best. They came up with a unanimously well-qualified \nrating, the highest rating the American Bar Association can give.\n  This rating does mean that Justice Owen is at the top of the legal \nprofession in her legal community; that she has outstanding legal \nability, breadth of experience, and the highest reputation for \nintegrity, and that she has demonstrated or exhibited the capacity for \njudicial temperament. Only a few people achieve that select highest \nrating.\n  Justice Owen is a member of the prestigious American Law Institute, \nthe American Judicature Society and the American Bar Association, and a \nFellow at the Houston and American Bar Associations. She has taken a \ngenuine interest in improving access to justice for the poor while \nserving on the bench as a liaison to State committees on pro bono and \nlegal services for the indigent. She worked with others to successfully \npetition the Texas State Legislature to provide better funding for \norganizations devoted to helping the poor with legal support services.\n  Earlier, I mentioned a letter of support for Justice Owen, which was \nsent by Hector De Leon, past President of Legal Aid of Central Texas. \nLet me just quote a small part of that letter, because it makes the \npoint better than I can, regarding Justice Owen.\n\n       Justice Owen has an understanding of and a commitment to \n     the availability of legal services to those who are \n     disadvantaged and unable to pay for such legal services. It \n     is that type of insight and empathy that Justice Owen will \n     bring to the Fifth Circuit.\n\n  Justice Owen is active in her church and respected in her community. \nShe is a mentor to young women attorneys, having made it to the top of \nthe legal profession during a period of time when relatively few women \nwent to law school--fewer were hired by preeminent firms--and even \nfewer are advanced thereafter to partnership. Justice Owen did all \nthree.\n  As a judge, Justice Owen is an advocate for breaking glass ceilings \nin the legal field. She has served on the Texas Supreme Court Gender \nNeutral Task Force, a working group seeking to promote equality for \nwomen in the Texas legal system, and addressing problems of gender bias \nin the profession. And, she served as one of the editors of the Gender \nNeutral Handbook, a guide made available to all Texas lawyers and \njudges, and intended to educate and create awareness about gender bias.\n  If you look at her record, it is hard for me to imagine why my \ncolleagues on the other side of the floor, on the Judiciary Committee, \nvoted against her in any way. I don't see how they could possibly vote \nagainst her with the record that she has. But they did. I suspect that \npolitics had a little bit to do with it.\n  Justice Priscilla Owen is an excellent choice for the Fifth Circuit. \nThere is no doubt that some will pull isolated bits and pieces out of \nJustice Owen's rich and textured background in an attempt to discredit \nand diminish her accomplishments and abilities and jurisprudence. There \nis no doubt some will avoid mentioning the positive aspects of Justice \nOwen's career, and despite this fact, it bears noting once more that \nthose who know Priscilla Owen best know what a terrific judge she is \nnow and will be on the Federal court.\n\n  I have come to know Justice Owen and her record and I agree she has \nbeen an excellent State judge, and she promises to be an excellent \nFederal judge. I ask my distinguished colleagues in the Senate to join \nme in voting for the confirmation of Justice Priscilla Owen to the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I certainly hope this great justice \nis not going to be filibustered, as Miguel Estrada has been.\n  Nevertheless, we are prepared for whatever happens here. She stands \nin a unique position as one of the finest women lawyers in the country, \none of the finest women justices in the country, and one of the finest \npeople who really has worked so hard for women and women's issues and \ngender issues who has ever served in any court in this country. It is \nvery difficult for me to see how anybody could vote against her.\n  I hope we can have this vote, up or down, within a relatively short \nperiod of debate. I hope everybody will get to the floor and say what \nthey have to say about Justice Owen, and we will be happy to enter into \ndebate at any time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to say first how much I \nappreciate Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who \nhas done an incredible job under very trying circumstances on the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen.\n  Senator Hatch saw early on what an outstanding person we have in \nPriscilla Owen, and though on a straight party-line vote she was turned \ndown by the committee last year, and was unable to get to the floor \neven for a vote this year, with Senator Hatch's leadership she has been \nable to come out of committee, again on a straight party-line vote. I \nam very hopeful she will get a fair chance for a floor vote because she \nis one of the most outstanding people I know.\n  She has waited 1 year and 11 months. That is when the President first \nnominated her for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Priscilla Owen \nwas among the group of 11 judicial nominees announced by President Bush \non May 9, 2001. She is the kind of judge the people of the Fifth \nCircuit need on the bench, an experienced jurist who follows the law \nand uses good common sense. She has been nominated to a vacancy that \nhas been classified as a judicial emergency and that should be filled \nexpeditiously.\n  Justice Owen is an 8-year veteran of the Texas Supreme Court. She is \nhighly qualified. She graduated cum laude from Baylor Law School in \n1977. Thereafter, she earned the highest score on the Texas bar exam. \nBefore joining the Texas Supreme Court in 1994, she was a partner in a \nmajor Texas law firm where she was a commercial litigator for 17 years.\n  She has used her legal talents to help those in need. She has worked \nto improve access to legal services for the poor. She fought to \nincrease funding for these programs.\n  She has also helped organize a group known as Family Law 2000, which \nseeks to educate parents about the effects of divorce on children, and \nto lessen the adversarial nature of legal proceedings when a marriage \nis dissolved.\n  Justice Owen enjoys broad support. The American Bar Association \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary has voted her unanimously \nwell\n\n[[Page S4924]]\n\nqualified. To merit this ranking, the ABA requires that the nominee \nmust be at the top of the legal profession in his or her legal \ncommunity, have outstanding legal ability, breadth of experience, the \nhighest reputation for integrity, and either have demonstrated or \nexhibited the capacity for judicial temperament.\n  I would say her judicial temperament has been proven in the 1 year 11 \nmonths that she has waited for confirmation because the way she has \nconducted herself has been exemplary. She has been available to meet \nwith any Senator. She has answered every question. She has gone back \ninto records to make sure that she was answering exactly correctly. She \nhas maintained complete silence about this process about which I am \nsure she has some strong opinions. But I think she has shown her \njudicial temperament by being very much on an even keel, basically \nsaying: I would love to be on the Fifth Circuit, but I am very happy on \nthe Texas Supreme Court.\n  Of course, she is well regarded by those who know her best. We do \nelect judges in Texas. In 2000, Justice Owen was reelected to the \nSupreme Court with 84 percent of the vote. She was endorsed by every \nmajor newspaper in Texas--every one.\n  The Dallas Morning News called her record one of ``accomplishment and \nintegrity.'' The Houston Chronicle wrote she ``has the proper balance \nof judicial experience, solid legal scholarship, and real world know-\nhow.''\n  Despite the fact that she is a well-respected judge who has received \nhigh praise, her nomination has been targeted by special interest \ngroups that have mischaracterized her views.\n  Let me read the words of former elected attorney general and Texas \nSupreme Court Chief Justice John L. Hill, Jr., a lifelong Democrat, \ndenouncing the false accusations about Priscilla Owen's record by \nspecial interest groups.\n\n       Their attacks on Justice Owen in particular are \n     breathtakingly dishonest, ignoring her long-held commitment \n     to reform and grossly distorting her rulings. Tellingly, the \n     groups made no effort to assess whether her decisions are \n     legally sound. . . . I know Texas politics and can clearly \n     say that these assaults on Justice Owen's records are false, \n     misleading, and deliberate distortions.\n\n  That is a quote from former chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court, \nJohn Hill, elected as a Democrat.\n  Senator Hatch has taken the extraordinary step of holding a second \nhearing on Justice Owen in order to get the record straight and because \nSenator Leahy, the ranking member, really insisted that she have \nanother hearing. She did so well in those hearings. I watched them \nafter I introduced her. Once again, her evenhandedness and her legal \nbrilliance came through.\n\n  One issue that came up during the hearings involves Texas's parental \nnotification statute. I believe Justice Owen has demonstrated that she \nis a judge who follows and upholds the law, and in this line of cases \nshe has consistently applied Supreme Court precedent to help interpret \nuncertainty in the statute. The cases in question deal strictly with \nstatutory interpretation of Texas law, not with constitutional rights.\n  These are not abortion cases. They are issues of parental \ninvolvement. They are notification--not consent--laws. Forty-three \nStates have passed some form of parental involvement statute. During \ntwo lengthy committee hearings, Justice Owen defended her decisions as \nconsistent with U.S. Supreme Court rulings.\n  In addition, almost all of the cases that came to the supreme court \nwere cases in which she voted to affirm the district court and the \ncircuit court of appeals rulings. So it would have been highly unusual \nfor the supreme court to overturn the trier of fact and the first \nappellate court.\n  I hope my colleagues will see that her methods of statutory \ninterpretation are sound and that she is an exemplary judge.\n  I urge my colleagues not to filibuster this well-qualified nominee \nbut to give her an up-or-down vote. I hope we will confirm this \noutstanding supreme court judge from Texas who has waited almost 2 \nyears now for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals appointment.\n  If there were anything in her record against integrity or competence \nor judicial demeanor, it would be a different case, but that is not the \ncase about Priscilla Owen, whom I know well, whom I have been with on \nmany occasions. I know the people who appear before her court. She is \nrated outstanding by all who know her, who are giving any kind of an \nobjective view.\n  I hope this Senate will not do to Priscilla Owen what has happened to \nanother well-qualified nominee, Miguel Estrada, who also has a sterling \nacademic record, who also has a record of integrity and experience. I \nhope this Senate will not start requiring 60 votes, where the \nConstitution requires a simple majority for qualified nominees.\n  Let's have a vote up or down. We do not need a new standard. In fact, \nif we had a new standard, it should go through the constitutional \nprocess. We should have a constitutional amendment that says Supreme \nCourt and circuit court and district court judge nominees will be \nrequired to have 60 votes. It would take a constitutional amendment to \ndo that. But Miguel Estrada is being required to have 60 votes. I hope \nthat is not the standard we put on Priscilla Owen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate has begun an \nextraordinary, actually unprecedented, debate to reconsider the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen to the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit. In the history of the country, there has never been \na time when a President has resubmitted a circuit court nominee already \nrejected by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the same vacancy. \nUntil 4 weeks ago, never before had the Judiciary Committee rejected \nits own decision on such a nominee and granted a second hearing. We \nhave a case where the Senate Judiciary Committee, having decided not to \ngive even one hearing to President Clinton's nominees to the Fifth \nCircuit from Texas, Enrique Moreno and Jorge Rangel, in fact having \ndecided not to give a satisfactory hearing to President Bush's nominees \nto the DC and Sixth Circuits, John Roberts and Deborah Cook, the \ncommittee nonetheless proceeded with another hearing for Justice Owen.\n  It is unprecedented both in its procedures but also in its political \npartisanship.\n  What did we learn in that second hearing? We learned that given some \ntime, Justice Owen was able to enlist the help of the talented lawyers \nworking at the White House and the Department of Justice in their \npolitical arm to come up with some new justification for her activism. \nWe learned that given six months to reconsider the severe criticism \ndirected at her by her Republican colleagues, she still admits no \nerror. Mostly, I think we learned that the objections expressed last \nSeptember were sincerely held then, they are sincerely held now. \nNothing Justice Owen amplified about her record--indeed, nothing anyone \nelse tried to explain about her record--actually changed her record.\n  In September, when we considered this nomination in the committee the \nfirst time, I said I was proud the Democrats and some Republicans had \nkept to the merits of the nomination and chose not to vilify or \ncastigate or unfairly characterize and condemn without basis Senators \nworking conscientiously to fulfill their constitutional responsibility.\n  After hearing some of the ugly things that were subsequently said at \nthat business meeting, some of the accusations made against my \ncolleagues and those interested citizens across the country who \nexpressed opposition to Justice Owen's nomination, I was sorely \ndisappointed that some in the Senate had not kept solely to the merits.\n  I continue to believe what Senator Feinstein said that day is true. \nBy doing its job on the nomination, by exercising due diligence, by \nexamining records, by not just rubber stamping every nominee the \nPresident sent us, the Judiciary Committee showed itself to be alive \nand well.\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\n  We confirmed the overwhelming majority of the President's judicial \nnominees, 100 out of 103 considered while I was chairman--incidentally, \nsetting an all-time speed record. We took the time to look at their \nrecords. We gave each person who was nominated to this lifetime seat on \nthe Federal bench the scrutiny he or she deserved. We did not have the \nassembly line which seems to be in overdrive since this last Congress \ntook over.\n  The rush to judgment on so many of the nominees before us does not \nchange the fact that we fully and fairly considered the nomination of \nPriscilla Owen last year. The record was sufficient when we voted last \nyear. It did not need any setting straight.\n  I voted ``no'' the last time this nomination was before us. In sharp \ncontrast to the record of the district court nominee Cormac Carney who \nwas just confirmed by the Senate--he came to us with strong bipartisan \nsupport--Justice Priscilla Owen is a nominee whose record is too \nextreme in the context of the very conservative Texas Supreme Court. \nHer nomination presents a number of areas of serious concern to me.\n\n  The first area is her extremism even among a conservative Supreme \nCourt of Texas. The conservative Republican majority of the Texas \nSupreme Court has gone out of its way to criticize Justice Owen, the \ndissents she wrote and the dissents she joined in ways that are highly \nunusual, and highlight not a law-oriented activism but an ends-oriented \nactivism.\n  A number of justices on the Texas Supreme Court have pointed out how \nfar from the language of statutes she has strayed in her attempts to \nlegislate from the bench, to go far beyond what the legislature \nintended.\n  One example is a majority opinion in a case called Weiner v. Wasson. \nIn this case, Justice Owen wrote a dissent advocating a ruling against \na medical malpractice plaintiff, a plaintiff who was injured while he \nwas still a minor. The issue was the constitutionality of a Texas State \nlaw requiring minors to file medical malpractice actions before \nreaching the age of majority or risk being outside the statute of \nlimitations. Of interest is the majority's discussion of the importance \nof abiding by a prior Texas Supreme Court decision, a decision that was \nnow stare decisis, unanimously striking down a previous version of the \nstatute.\n  In what reads as a lecture to the dissent, one of the very respected \nmembers of the Texas Supreme Court, then-Justice John Cornyn, explains \non behalf of the majority:\n\n       Generally, we adhere to our precedents for reasons of \n     efficiency, fairness and legitimacy. First, if we did not \n     follow our own decisions, no issue could ever be considered \n     resolved. The potential volume of speculative relitigation \n     under such circumstances alone ought to persuade us that \n     stare decisis is a sound policy. Secondly, we should give due \n     consideration to the settled expectations of litigants like \n     Emmanuel Wasson, who have justifiably relied on the \n     principles articulated in the previous case. . . . Finally, \n     under our form of government, the legitimacy of the judiciary \n     rests in large part upon a stable and predictable \n     decisionmaking process that differs dramatically from that \n     properly employed by the political branches of government.\n\n  That Justice Cornyn sure knows how to write. He did a great job on \nthis one. Now, I may not agree with him on all other things, I may not \neven agree with him on the issue before us now, but I sure agree with \nhis decision there.\n  Actually, I speak of it as being a conservative Supreme Court. In the \n30 years I was practicing, we had a pretty conservative Supreme Court \nin Vermont, and I suspect they would have written the same thing. I \nsuspect most supreme courts would have written the same lines about \nstare decisis. I do not think that is a case whether one is \nconservative or liberal on their supreme court. I suspect we could go \nthrough all 50 States, whether it is Wyoming, Vermont, Texas, or \nanywhere else, and find similar language.\n  The Republican majority on the Texas Supreme Court followed \nprecedent. They followed stare decisis.\n  In Montgomery Independent School District v. Davis, Justice Owen \nwrote another dissent which drew fire from a conservative Republican \nmajority, this time for her disregard for legislative language. In a \nchallenge by a teacher who did not receive reappointment to her \nposition, the majority found the school board had exceeded its \nauthority when it disregarded the Texas Education Code and tried to \noverrule a hearing examiner's decision on the matter. Justice Owen's \ndissent advocated for an interpretation contrary to the language of the \napplicable statute.\n  The majority, which included Alberto Gonzales, now counsel at the \nWhite House, and two other appointees of then-Governor Bush, was quite \nexplicit about the view that Justice Owen's position disregarded the \nlaw:\n\n       The dissenting opinion misconceives the hearing examiner's \n     role in the . . . process by stating that the hearing \n     examiner ``refused'' to make findings on the evidence the \n     Board relies on to support its additional findings. As we \n     explained above, nothing in the statute requires the hearing \n     examiner to make findings on matters of which he is \n     unpersuaded.\n\n  The majority also noted the dissenting opinion's misconception, \nspeaking of Justice Owen's opinion:\n\n       The dissenting opinion's misconception of the hearing \n     examiner's role stems from its disregard of the procedural \n     elements the Legislature established in subchapter F to \n     ensure that the hearing-examiner process is fair and \n     efficient for both teachers and school boards. The \n     Legislature maintained local control by giving school boards \n     alone the option to choose the hearing-examiner process in \n     nonrenewal proceedings. . . . By resolving conflicts in \n     disputed evidence, ignoring credibility issues, and \n     essentially stepping into the shoes of the factfinder to \n     reach a specific result, the dissenting opinion not only \n     disregards the procedural limitations in the statute but \n     takes a position even more extreme than that argued for by \n     the board. . . .\n\n  Then we have Collins v. Ison-Newsome, another case where a dissent, \njoined by Justice Owen, was roundly criticized by the Republican \nmajority of the Texas Supreme Court. The court cogently stated a legal \nbasis for its conclusion that they had no jurisdiction to decide the \nmatter before it, and as in other opinions where Justice Owen was in \ndissent, took time to explicitly criticize the dissent's position \ncontrary to the clear letter of the law.\n  At issue was whether the Supreme Court had the proper ``conflicts \njurisdiction'' to hear the interlocutory appeal of school officials \nbeing sued for defamation. The majority explained that it did not \nbecause published lower court decisions do not create the necessary \nconflict between themselves. The arguments put forth by the dissent, in \nwhich Justice Owen joined, offended the majority, and they made their \nviews known, writing:\n\n       The dissenting opinion agrees that ``because this is an \n     interlocutory appeal . . . this Court's jurisdiction is \n     limited,'' but then argues for the exact opposite \n     proposition. . . . This argument defies the Legislature's \n     clear and express limits on our jurisdiction. . . . The \n     author of the dissenting opinion has written previously that \n     we should take a broader approach to the conflicts-\n     jurisdiction standard. But a majority of the Court continues \n     to abide by the Legislature's clear limits on our \n     interlocutory-appeal jurisdiction.\n\n  Listen to what they said. Justice Owen says because this is an \ninterlocutory, the appeals court's jurisdiction is limited, but as the \nmajority point out, she then argued for the exact opposite proposition.\n  They go on to say, ``[W]e cannot simply ignore the legislative limits \non our jurisdiction. . . .''\n  She was defiant of legislative intent, a total disregard of \nlegislatively drawn limits.\n  I agree with what President Bush said during the campaign, he wanted \npeople who would interpret the law on courts and not make the law. We \nhave someone here who, time and again, substitutes her judgment for the \nlegislature's judgment. In fact, she wants to be both the legislature \nand the judiciary.\n  You can be one or the other. You cannot be both, not in our system of \ngovernment.\n  We are already saddled with an activist Supreme Court, the U.S. \nSupreme Court. We are creating more activist courts of appeals. This is \nsomeone who fits into the absolute motto of being an activist judge.\n  Frankly, I am opposed to the idea of having activists judges either \non the liberal side or the conservative side. I want judges who \ninterpret the law who do not make the law, justices who are fair and \nopen to all litigants. I want litigants to be able to walk into a \ncourtroom and look at the judge and say, it really does not make any \ndifference whether I am plaintiff, defendant, rich, poor, liberal, \nconservative,\n\n[[Page S4926]]\n\nwhat political party I belong to, what color I am, what religion I \npractice, that judge will hear my case fairly. That judge will either \nrule with me or rule against me but it will be based on the facts and \nthe law before the judge and not because of their particular ideology \nor their particular bent or their desire to substitute themselves and \ntheir opinion, either for the executive or for the legislative branch \nof Government.\n  Some of the most striking examples of criticism of Justice Owen's \nwritings, or the dissents and concurrences she joins, come in a series \nof parental notification cases heard in 2000.\n  In the case of Jane Doe I, the majority included an extremely unusual \nsection explaining the proper role of judges, admonishing the dissent \njoined by Justice Owen for going beyond its duty to interpret the law \nin an attempt to fashion policy. Giving a pointed critique of the \ndissenters, the majority explained that:\n\n       In reaching the decision of granting Jane Doe's \n     application, we put aside our personal viewpoints and \n     endeavored to do our jobs as judges--that is, to interpret \n     and apply the Legislature's will as has been expressed in the \n     statute.\n\n  In a separate concurrence, Justice Alberto Gonzales wrote to construe \nthe law as the dissent did ``would be an unconscionable act of judicial \nactivism.''\n  I will speak further on this. I see the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, who I understand may have a differing view than I do on this \nnomination, and I do want to make sure he is given a chance. I will \nspeak for a few more minutes and then yield.\n  I note one thing. Justice Owen has been nominated to fill a vacancy \nthat has existed since January 1997. We are now in the year 2003. This \nvacancy has existed for 6 years. One might wonder why nobody was \nnominated during that time. Actually, they were. President Clinton \nfirst nominated Judge Jorge Rangel, a distinguished Hispanic attorney \nfrom Corpus Christi, to fill that vacancy. He had one of the highest \nratings of the American Bar Association, a majority found him well \nqualified. He was strongly supported by so many across the political \nspectrum who wrote to me. It was not a question of being voted down; he \nwas never even allowed to have a hearing.\n  Finally, after 15 months, out of frustration, he asked the President \nto withdraw his nomination. He said, if I am not going to be allowed to \nhave a hearing, to say nothing about a vote, I am leaving.\n  Then September 16, 1999, 4 years ago, President Clinton nominated \nEnrique Moreno, another Hispanic attorney, to fill that same vacancy. \nThis Harvard-educated lawyer also received a rating of well qualified \nfrom the ABA, and his was a unanimous well qualified.\n  Members may be wondering what the vote was on him. Well, there wasn't \na vote. There was not even a hearing. He waited for a year and a half \nand never got a hearing. So both of these people were carefully \nrejected by not having a hearing.\n  For years, as I have spoken before, we needed 100 votes to get any \nnominee through. Unless every single Senator, every single Senator \nagreed, the nominee would not get a hearing. Time and time again, \ndozens upon dozens upon dozens of cases, every single Democratic \nSenator agreed they should at least have a hearing and a vote, and at \nleast one Republican would disagree, and they would never be given a \nhearing. As Allen Snyder, DC Circuit, never given a vote. Elena Kagan, \njust named the dean of the Harvard Law School, never given a hearing or \na vote; Robert Cindrich, Third Circuit, never given a hearing or a vote \nby the Republicans; Steven Orlofsky, Third Circuit, never given a \nhearing or a vote by Republicans; James Beatty in the Fourth Circuit, \nnever given a hearing or a vote by Republicans because not all of them \nagreed. If one disagreed, if one objected, they were not given a \nhearing or a vote. Andre Davis, Fourth Circuit, never given a hearing \nor a vote because at least one Republican disagreed. They needed 100 \nvotes to make it. Elizabeth Gibson, Fourth Circuit, never given a \nhearing or a vote because one Republican disagreed.\n\n  The Fifth Circuit, Alston Johnson, never given a hearing or a vote, \nbecause at least one Republican disagreed. Kent Markus, in the Sixth \nCircuit, Kathleen McCree Lewis, eminently well qualified, at least one \nRepublican disagreed, never given hearings, never given votes. James \nDuffy in the Ninth Circuit, never given a hearing or a vote, because at \nleast one Republican disagreed. And the same could be said about so \nmany others. James Lyons in the Tenth Circuit. Interestingly enough, in \nthe Tenth Circuit never given a hearing or a vote because one \nRepublican disagreed, and Democrats had helped move forward somebody \nwho many disagreed in that same circuit.\n  I might point out that of all these people, and so many others, there \nare dozens of others, but all of these had ratings of well qualified \nfrom the ABA. But at least one Republican disagreed, and if just one \nRepublican disagreed, they were never allowed to have a hearing or a \nvote.\n  Interestingly enough, it wasn't until May of last year, in the \nhearing chaired by Senator Schumer, that this committee heard from any \nof President Clinton's three unsuccessful nominees for the Fifth \nCircuit. Last May, Mr. Moreno and Judge Rangel testified, along with \nother of President Clinton's nominees, about their treatment by the \nRepublicans, when the Republicans were in charge of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. These nominees were told by at least a couple of \nthe members, senior members of the Republican Party, that if somebody \nin their caucus disagreed, that was too bad. It had nothing to do with \ntheir qualifications. They were not going to fill that vacancy.\n  This happened in a number of circuits, including the Fifth Circuit. \nIn fact, when the committee held its hearing on the nomination of Judge \nEdith Clement to the Fifth Circuit in 2001, it was the first hearing on \na Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 years. By contrast, Justice Owen was the \nthird nomination to the Fifth Circuit on which the Judiciary Committee, \nunder my chairmanship, held a hearing in less than 1 year. In spite of \nthe treatment by the former Republican majority of so many moderate \njudicial nominees of the previous President, we proceeded last July \nwith a hearing on Justice Owen.\n  So Justice Owen was the third nominee to this vacancy. She was the \nfirst to be afforded a hearing before the committee. Actually, I set \nthat hearing. I even set the vote on a day that President Bush \npersonally asked me to set the vote. After having set it on the day he \nasked me to, the political arm of the Justice Department immediately \nstarted calling all these editorial writers and others, saying: It is \nterrible she is being set for a vote on that day.\n  It was interesting. They then, as they had the right to do, put it \noff for several weeks, the vote. I almost wonder what the vote would \nhave been had it been on the day the President asked to have the vote, \nand the day I agreed with the President to have the vote, and then was \ncastigated by the White House for going along with what President Bush \nwanted. It is, with this administration, sort of: No good deed goes \nunpunished.\n  But then I think it is interesting what happened. Because after the \nRepublicans put it off and we did not have the vote on the day the \nPresident asked, there was so much partisan politicking that went on on \nher behalf that I think it solidified at least a couple of votes \nagainst her on that committee. We will never know.\n  But, even though Republicans had blocked many of President Clinton's \nnominees for the Fifth Circuit, we moved forward in a hearing for \nPriscilla Owen. At her hearing a couple of weeks ago, her second \nhearing, her unprecedented hearing, the chairman was very dismissive of \nour concerns and our efforts to evaluate this nomination on the merits. \nBut the irony is, she has been before this committee twice now and \nneither time did the explanations change the facts before us. The \nPresident has said, and I am sure all his pollsters will tell him, \npeople agree with this, as they should, the standard for judging \njudicial nominees would be that they ``share a commitment to follow and \napply the law, not make law from the bench.''\n  Everybody agrees with that. I agree with that. I don't know anybody \nwho disagrees with that. But that is not Priscilla Owen's record. She \nis ready to make law and legislate from the bench.\n  She is not qualified for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. \nThis\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\nis something that affects all of us, these decisions. To put somebody \nin a lifetime appointment like that who has already shown she is an \nactivist judge, I think is wrong. The President spoke of judicial \nactivism without acknowledging that ends-oriented decisionmaking can \ncome easily to ideologically motivated nominees. In the case of \nPriscilla Owen, we see a perfect example of such an approach to law. I \ndo not support that. I will not.\n\n  I am perfectly willing to consent to the confirmation of consensus, \nmainstream judges. I have on hundreds of occasions. When I was \nchairman, I did not allow the past rule--the past practice of anonymous \nholds. We even had a number I did not support, but brought them to a \nvote. When they got through the committee they came on the floor.\n  Justice Owen was plucked from a law firm by political consultant Karl \nRove. She ran as a conservative pro-business candidate for the Texas \nSupreme Court. She certainly got a lot of support from the business \ncommunity. Then she fulfilled her promise; she became the most \nconservative judge on a conservative court. She stood out for ends-\noriented, extremist decisionmaking.\n  Now she is being asked to be placed in a lifetime appointment one \nstep below the Supreme Court. I do not support that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to take the next few minutes to \nrespond to some of the comments the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee has made with regard to the process by which we confirm \njudicial nominees of the President, and to specifically respond to some \nof the areas of criticism that he and a handful of special interest \ngroups have directed at the nomination of Priscilla Owen.\n\n  I believe, even though I am a new Member of the Senate--having been a \nSenator for all of about 4 months now--I have, at least in this area, \nsome special knowledge I would like to share with my colleagues with \nregard to this particular nominee because for 7 years I served on the \nTexas Supreme Court and for 3 years concurrently with Justice Priscilla \nOwen.\n  So during that time I had the chance to work with her on a daily \nbasis, learn her work habits and her frame of mind when it came to \naddressing her responsibilities as a judge on the highest court of my \nState. I believe in each instance the criticism the ranking member has \nlodged--really repeating that which special interest groups have lodged \nunfairly against Priscilla Owen since her nomination on May 9, 2001--\ncan be refuted, or at least explained in a way that I think \ndemonstrates she should be given the opportunity for an up-or-down vote \nin the Senate, where I am convinced that a bipartisan majority of this \nbody stands ready to confirm her nomination.\n  Senator Leahy has gone through some history of the Clinton \nadministration and the nominees of that administration and the \ntreatment--unfair treatment, in his eyes--of President Clinton's \nnominees. I think what we are supposed to conclude from that is that \nsomehow this game of tit for tat, or what is sauce for the goose is \nsauce for the gander, somehow rises to the high level of performance \nthat the American people have cause to expect of us whom they send to \nthe Senate.\n  I contend that rather than serve the interests of the American \npeople, the way in which the Senate Judiciary Committee proceedings \nhave been conducted for some time now--particularly as evidenced now by \nthe filibuster being imposed against the nomination of Miguel Estrada--\nhave been a disservice to the American people.\n  I have supported--and Senator Leahy has said he agrees with me--that \nwe need to find some way to bring a conclusion to this downward spiral, \nin a way that serves the interests of the American people and does \ncredit to this institution. I hope, in the days that lie ahead, we will \nfind an opportunity to do that. I trust we will. I only hope the Senate \ndoes not grab defeat from the jaws of victory in terms of our \nopportunity to reform this broken system of judicial confirmation, one \nthat does not reflect well on this institution.\n  Senator Leahy talked about how unprecedented this nomination is, \npointing out that last year, during Senate Judiciary Committee \nhearings, Justice Owen was voted down in a strict party-line vote, and \nthat she would now be renominated by the President and then brought to \nthe floor. I guess these are unprecedented times when it comes to \njudicial confirmation proceedings.\n  As I mentioned just a moment ago, we have an unprecedented filibuster \nby the Democratic minority of Miguel Estrada, someone who, I believe, \nwould receive a majority vote from a bipartisan group of Senators on \nthis floor should the Senate just be allowed to vote. Of course, we \nhave been through, I think, four cloture motions, which have failed, \nwhich means that debate continues on that nomination. Here again, \nunprecedented in the annals of this institution: a circuit court judge \nbeing filibustered for no good reason, I would contend.\n  Senator Leahy says Justice Owen is an activist, someone who would \nimpose her own will or political judgment on the people regardless of \nwhat precedent had established earlier decisions by the highest court \nin the land or what the legislature says. But the way he explains what \nhe means by ``activism'' I think equates with: I don't agree with the \nresults of the decision.\n  If that is the definition of ``activism,'' then activism has no \nmeaning, or certainly no commonly understood meaning, because, of \ncourse, any reasonable person might disagree with the outcome of any \njudicial decision and thereby label that judge who made the decision an \nactivist. But that is certainly not the commonly understood meaning: \njust the fact that judges may, in fact, disagree with each other from \ntime to time.\n  I think some have pointed out, as an example of Justice Owen's \nfailings, that some judges at different times have had cause to \ndisagree with her decision. But, in fact, that is what we expect of \njudges--certainly at the highest levels of our judiciary--that they \nwill do their very best to research the law, to comb the record, to try \nto discern what precedents might apply, what statutes that have been \npassed by Congress might apply, and then to apply that law to the facts \nas decided by the fact finder in order to reach a decision.\n  At the highest levels of our judiciary we commit that decision to \nnine people, and frequently they disagree with each other. We do not \npoint that out as a fault or a failing; we view that as a strength \nbecause in the debate, the dialog, the back and forth--the conversation \nreally--these judges have, we believe the public purpose for which the \njudiciary was created is served. I believe that to say it represents a \nfailing or represents a reason a judge should not be confirmed turns \nthe whole purpose of that body on its head.\n  Senator Leahy claimed that Justice Owen is simply too extreme to be \nconfirmed--this notwithstanding the fact that in her last election to \njudicial office in the State of Texas, 84 percent of the voters voted \nin her favor.\n  She has been endorsed by a bipartisan group of the leadership of the \nbar in my State, Republicans and Democrats alike, former presidents of \nthe Texas Bar Association. She has received the highest endorsement, \nthe highest recommendation given by the American Bar Association. How, \nin any fair-minded person's view, could Justice Owen be characterized \nas too extreme in light of those simple facts?\n  As some evidence of his argument that Justice Owen is somehow an \nactivist, somehow too extreme, Senator Leahy has pointed to language in \na number of opinions where she has been criticized for rewriting \nstatutes. As somebody who has, for better or worse, served for 13 years \nas a judge before I came to this institution, I can tell you, that is \nsimply the way judges talk to each other when they disagree about the \noutcome in any case. They do their very best to research the law, to \ntry to ascertain what the legislative intent is in any particular case, \nand then they reach a conclusion. Someone who disagrees with that judge \nmay say: Well, I disagree. I believe you are rewriting the statute. It \nis not as serious nor certainly as consequential a statement as Senator \nLeahy might suggest. It is just another way of saying: I disagree.\n\n[[Page S4928]]\n\n  Here again, judges disagree, particularly on the most difficult \nquestions that confront our States or this Nation. We expect judges to \nspeak their mind. We expect judges to enter into intelligent debate and \ndiscussion, and when they disagree, so much the better. But finally--\nfinally--there has to be a decision. That is where the majority comes \ninto play and makes a final decision.\n  So judges being accused of rewriting statutes does not have nearly \nthe sinister connotation that some might suggest and, in fact, to me \njust represents judges trying to do their jobs to the best of their \nability.\n  I just have to mention that Senator Leahy pointed to one case where \nJustice Owen and I disagreed when I was on the Texas Supreme Court, the \nWeiner v. Wasson case, and it was one of a number of cases where she \nand I disagreed. But, here again, the fact that we disagreed does not \nmake her incompetent to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals or \nunqualified or somehow activist. It means simply that we had different \nopinions of how the law ought to be ascertained, what that law was, and \nhow it should be applied to the facts.\n  The language Senator Leahy read, with which he said he agreed, about \nthe importance of stare decisis, adheres to the precedents set out by \nour highest court in terms of setting expectations of the litigants, \nachieving finality of a decision rather than relitigating the same \nlegal questions over and over again. That was no lecture but merely an \nexplanation to the one who was challenging the constitutionality of the \nstatute in that case or the one who claimed the statute was \nconstitutional; in fact, it was important that we adhere to an earlier \ndecision where we had held a similar statute unconstitutional. It was \ncertainly not a lecture.\n  It just goes to prove that when you read the written record in black \nand white, sometimes it fails to impart enough information to make an \ninformed decision about what is going on. That is why we have juries, \nto listen to witnesses, confront witnesses face to face in court. That \nis why, as appellate judges, we defer to the facts found by juries and \nlower courts, because they are in the best position to determine the \nveracity of the testimony and the credibility of the witness. That is \nwhy a written record can sometimes simply mislead you into a wrong \nconclusion, which has happened in the case of Justice Owen.\n  I could not support the nomination of Justice Owen to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals more strongly. This court, of course, covers \nthe States of Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana and all Federal appeals \nthat come from those States. I firmly believe Justice Owen deserves to \nbe confirmed. She will be confirmed by a bipartisan majority of the \nSenate as long as the Senate applies a fair standard and as long as we \ncontinue to respect Senate traditions and the fundamental democratic \nprinciple of majority rule by permitting an up-or-down vote on her \nnomination.\n  The American people desperately need the Nation's finest legal minds \nto serve on our Federal courts, particularly vacancies such as those on \nthe Fifth Circuit, which have been designated judicial emergencies by \nthe U.S. Judicial Conference. We must ensure that all judicial nominees \nunderstand that judges must interpret the law as written and not as \nthey personally would like to see them written.\n  Justice Owen satisfies both of these standards with flying colors. \nShe is, quite simply and by any measure, an impressive attorney and \njurist. She graduated at the top of her class at Baylor Law School and \nwas an editor of the Law Review at a time when few women entered the \nlegal profession. She received the highest score of her class on the \nbar examination, and she was extremely successful as a practicing \nattorney in Houston, TX, and across the State for 17 years before she \nbegan her service on the Texas Supreme Court, where she has served with \ndistinction for 8 years.\n  I alluded to this a moment ago, but in her last election not only did \nshe receive the overwhelming majority of the statewide vote, she was \nendorsed by virtually every Texas newspaper editorial board--hardly the \nrecord of an out-of-the-mainstream nominee. She has the support of \nprominent Democrats in Texas, including former members of the Texas \nSupreme Court such as former Chief Justice John Hill, former Justice \nRaul Gonzalez, and a bipartisan array of former presidents of the State \nbar association.\n  The American Bar Association has given her its unanimous and highest \nwell-qualified rating, which some in this Chamber have called the gold \nstandard.\n  I cannot understand nor fathom how any judicial nominee can receive \nall of these accolades from legal experts and public servants across \nthe legal and political mainstream unless that nominee is both \nexceptionally talented as a lawyer and a judge who respects the law and \nsteadfastly refuses to insert his or her own political beliefs into the \ndecision of cases.\n\n  Based on this amazing record of achievement and success, it is no \nwonder that Justice Owen has long commanded the support of a bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate while her nomination has lingered since May of \n2001.\n  I would like to talk about my own personal perspective on this \nnominee, having worked with her for 3 years. During that time, I had \nthe privilege of working closely with Justice Owen. I had the \nopportunity to observe on a daily basis precisely how she approaches \nher job as a jurist, what she thinks about the job of judging in \nliterally hundreds, if not thousands, of cases. During those 3 years, I \nspoke with Justice Owen on countless occasions about how to read \nstatutes faithfully and carefully and how to decide cases based on what \nthe law says, not how we personally would like to see it read or to \nhave come out.\n  I saw her take careful notes, pull the law books from the shelves and \nstudy them very closely. I saw how hard she works to faithfully \ninterpret the law according to her oath and to apply the law as the \nTexas Legislature has written.\n  I can testify from my own personal experience, as a former colleague \nand as a former fellow justice, that Justice Owen is an exceptional \njudge, one who works hard to follow the law and enforce the will of the \nlegislature, not her will.\n  Not once did I see her try to insert her own political or social \nagenda into her job as a judge. To the contrary, Justice Owen believes \nstrongly, as do I, in the importance of judicial self-restraint, that \njudges are called upon not to act as legislators or as politicians but \nas judges, to faithfully read statutes and to interpret and apply them \nto the cases that come before the court.\n  It is because I have such a deep admiration for Justice Owen that I \nhave taken such a personal interest in talking about her nomination and \nhoping, not beyond hope, that Senator Leahy and others who, I am \nconvinced, have profoundly misjudged this nominee will reconsider their \nviews and perhaps will take what I have to say today in the overall \ncontext of the nominee and reconsider her nomination.\n  On the morning of Justice Owen's confirmation hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee last month, I published an op-ed in the Austin \nAmerican-Statesman discussing Justice Owen's qualifications for the \nbench.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print that op-ed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     [From the Austin American-Statesman, Thursday, Mar. 13, 2003]\n\n                        The Real Priscilla Owen\n\n                     (By John Cornyn, U.S. Senate)\n\n       After 22 months of obstruction, the record on Texas \n     judicial nominee Priscilla Owen will finally be set straight \n     this morning in a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. \n     For the second time, Owen comes before the committee and will \n     prove, once again, that she deserves to be confirmed to the \n     5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Circuit's jurisdiction \n     encompasses Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n       Owen is an impressive attorney and jurist. She graduated at \n     the top of her class from Baylor Law School and edited the \n     Law Review there, during a time when few women entered the \n     legal profession. She received the highest score on the bar \n     exam.\n       After practicing law in Texas for 17 years, Justice Owen \n     won a seat on the Texas Supreme Court, and Texans re-elected \n     her in 2000 with 84 percent of the statewide vote. Her \n     nomination has received broad, bipartisan support, including \n     former state Supreme Court justices and prominent Texas \n     Democrats such as John Hill and Raul Gonzalez, 15 former \n     presidents of the State Bar of Texas and many other leading \n     Texans.\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\n       Owen's qualifications and record of accomplishment caused \n     the American Bar Association to unanimously rate her ``well-\n     qualified'' for the Federal bench--its highest rating--which \n     some Democrats have called the ``gold standard.'' But even \n     that was not enough for the 10 Democrats on the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee last year who blocked a vote on Owen by \n     the full Senate.\n       Democrats on the Judiciary Committee used Owen as a \n     political football last year in an attempt to embarrass \n     President Bush and ridicule Texas during key elections. They \n     tried unfairly to brand the native Texan as an extremist.\n       Partisan opponents point out that other judges sometimes \n     disagree with Owen. But there is nothing wrong with \n     disagreement; no two judges agree all the time--which is \n     precisely why the Texas Constitution establishes a Supreme \n     Court of nine justices. When the law is unclear, a good judge \n     like Justice Owen searches in good faith for the right \n     answer.\n       As a former justice on the Texas Supreme Court, I often \n     agreed with Owen. When we disagreed, I always found her \n     professional and her rulings based on a fair reading of the \n     law.\n       Abortion advocates criticize her rulings on Texas's \n     parental notification law. Unlike more restrictive states, \n     Texas generally requires minors only to notify one parent \n     before an abortion. The criticism is misplaced: Owen did not \n     write the law, the state Legislature did.\n       Her opponents claim, disingenuously, that her \n     interpretations of that law are out of the mainstream. Yet \n     the author of the parental notification law, Texas state Sen. \n     Florence Shapiro, filed briefs supporting Owen's view and \n     endorses her nomination to the Federal bench. And among the \n     few parental notification cases heard by her court, Owen \n     dissented less frequently than two other justices. Owen's \n     record is hardly one of an extremist.\n       When we set the record straight, it will be obvious in \n     Washington--as it has long been in Texas--that Priscilla Owen \n     is an outstanding person and well-qualified judge who \n     deserves confirmation to the Federal court of appeals. After \n     22 months, Texans and the 5th Circuit have already waited \n     long enough.\n       Cornyn, a Republican, is a member of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Senator Hatch, chairman of the committee, also gave me \nthe opportunity to chair a portion of the hearing at which Justice \nOwen's nomination was voted out. I publicly thank him for that special \nopportunity to not only express my strong support but to demonstrate it \nat that hearing.\n  At the same time I have taken a deeply personal interest in this \nnomination, I also want to step back and carefully consider the \narguments that have been presented by opponents of the nomination.\n  I have mentioned some of those at the outset, particularly in \nresponse to what Senator Leahy had to say. I am forced to conclude \nJustice Owen's opponents have no real arguments--none that stand up \nunder scrutiny; at least none that will withstand scrutiny under any \nreasonably fair standard.\n  It bears noting, by the way, that Justice Owen's opponents are the \nsame folks who predicted Lewis Powell's confirmation to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States would mean ``justice for women will be \nignored.''\n  Her opponents, the special interest groups who oppose her nomination, \nare the same folks who argued Judge John Paul Stevens had demonstrated \n``blatant insensitivity to discrimination against women'' and ``seems \nto bend over backward to limit'' rights for all women.\n  Amazing as it may seem, her opponents are the same folks who \ntestified that confirming David Souter to the Supreme Court would mean \n``ending freedom for women in this country.'' Then the same folks who \nsaid they ``tremble for this country, if you confirm David Souter,'' \neven described now-Justice Souter as ``almost neanderthal'' and warned \n``women's lives are at stake'' if the Senate confirms Souter.\n  Well, the rhetoric and the histrionics and the lack of credibility of \nthose outlandish verbal assaults on judicial nominees sound all too \nfamiliar because, of course, these are many of the same accusations \nbeing made against Justice Owen, which are equally unfounded.\n  This reminds me of the story of the little boy who cried wolf. After \nthese repeated charges, accusations, and shrill attacks--and we have \nheard many of the same directed against Miguel Estrada, without \nfoundation--it makes you wonder just how credible these special \ninterest groups really are that oppose some of President Bush's highly \nqualified nominees. It also makes you wonder whether these special \ninterest groups makes these claims not because they believe they are \ntruthful, but because they have another agenda, some other reason for \nmaking these claims, for scaring people.\n  In the particular case of Justice Owen, the attacks are, I am sad to \nsay, true to form and conform to past patterns and practice, for they \nare, like the attacks of the past on the judges whose names I have \nmentioned, unfair and without foundation in either fact or law.\n  I mentioned just a moment ago how I believe the critics--people like \nthe distinguished Senator from Vermont--point out judges sometimes \ndisagree about the interpretation of statutes. You may read one judge's \ncriticism of another judge's interpretation as ``rewriting a statute.'' \nI hope you will consider those comments and take them into account, as \nI hope others will who currently oppose Justice Owen's nomination. But \nif that is the standard--and I don't think it should be--then such a \nstandard would also disqualify numerous U.S. Supreme Court justices, \nwhom Owen's opponents are known to adore.\n  For example, in a 1971 opinion, Justices Hugo Black and William O. \nDouglas sharply criticized Justices William Brennan, Harry Blackmun, \nand others, stating that the ``plurality's action in rewriting the \nstatute represents a seizure of legislative power that we simply do not \npossess.''\n  In a 1985 decision, Justice John Paul Stevens accused Justices Lewis \nPowell, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Byron White of engaging in ``judicial \nactivism.'' Of course, these are not the only examples that pervade the \nU.S. Reports.\n  Would Justice Owen's opponents apply the same standard and exclude \nfrom consideration or confirmation their own favorite justice from \nFederal judicial service? I imagine not. Fairness only dictates that \nJustice Owen not be made to suffer from this same absurd and \nunreasonable standard either.\n\n  This whole issue reminds me of the scene from the movie ``Jerry \nMaguire,'' when Cuba Gooding, Jr., tells Tom Cruise: ``See, man, that's \nthe difference between us. You think we're fighting, I think we're \nfinally talking.''\n  Well, simply put, this is the way judges talk in opinions, and it \ncertainly does not disqualify Justice Owen from confirmation.\n  Those who emphasize critical quotes about Justice Owen from other \njustices on the Texas Supreme Court think they are fighting, but \nactually the justices are just talking. They are just judging and they \nare just doing the duty they were asked to do and took an oath to \nperform.\n  Mr. President, I note we have about 5 minutes remaining on the clock, \nso I will cut short the remainder of my remarks. I will be back on the \nfloor as needed, depending upon how this debate continues. It is my \nhope we will see a unanimous consent agreement to achieve a limit on \ndebate, an adequate time certainly, where everybody who wants to be \nheard can be heard on this highly qualified nominee. I hope during that \ndebate the people listening--both colleagues in the Senate and those \nlistening across this country--will take all of the debate into \naccount, both the charges and the answers, some of which I have given \ntoday, and make their own assessment of the credibility of some of \nthese charges--charges which I believe are unfair and unfounded and \nwithout any merit as regards Justice Owen.\n  Finally, let me just say I hope the Democratic minority in this body \ndoes not choose to make the same ill-considered decision to filibuster \nJustice Owen as they made in the case of Miguel Estrada. I believe \ndebate is important. But, of course, sooner or later, we have to, and \nwe should, do what the voters of our States have sent us here to do, \nwhat the Founders of this country, the Framers of our Constitution, \nexpected us to do--that is, to vote. They expected the Senate to be a \nbody where debate would be favored--and certainly it is that--where \nnothing happens precipitously--and certainly it is that--and where \nenough debate and time can be taken to cool tempers and emotions and \npassions and make the very best decisions we can possibly make on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  But after everything has been said once, or twice, or five times, or \n10 times, or a hundred times, you would\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\nthink the Senate should vote. I believe the Senate should vote. I \nbelieve that is what the Framers expected, and I believe they never \nconsidered a minority of this body could obstruct the will of a \nbipartisan majority when it comes to the nomination of a highly \nqualified judicial nominee.\n  I hope at the appropriate time there will be that unanimous consent \nagreement and we will continue to debate Justice Owen's nomination for \na reasonable period of time--as long as anyone has anything new to \nsay--but, in the end, that we will have an up-or-down vote, which is \nsomething currently being denied to Miguel Estrada. I certainly hope \nthe precedent that has been set now in the case of Miguel Estrada--\nwhich I believe is a black mark on the record of this institution--will \nnot be repeated in the case of Priscilla Owen.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4930-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow return to legislative session and proceed to the consideration of \nS. 476, the CARE Act, as provided under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 476) to provide incentives for charitable \n     contributions by individuals and businesses, to improve the \n     public disclosure of activities of exempt organizations, and \n     to enhance the ability of low-income Americans to gain \n     financial security by building assets, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have a few remarks on the legislation. \nI am sure my good colleague, Senator Baucus, has remarks as the manager \nfor the Democratic Members. We would also like to take quick action on \na managers' amendment that is in order under a unanimous consent \nagreement. There are a few issues that have to be cleared on the \namendment.\n  I rise to speak on the CARE Act of 2003. I will first talk generally \nabout the charitable provisions in the bill and then talk about those \nprovisions designed to combat corporate tax shelters.\n  The CARE Act seeks to support that great American tradition--helping \na neighbor in need. Our Nation's tradition of caring and charitable \nsupport goes back to the founding. When faced with tragedy or hardship \nin our communities, we have always been a people who have rolled up our \nsleeves to pitch in, rather than leaning on a shovel waiting for the \ngovernment to show up.\n  The charitable tradition in America has certainly been for the common \ngood. Unfortunately, there are not many K Street lobbyists for \ncharities and for the common good.\n  That is why this legislation is a direct testimony to the leadership \nof President Bush. There is no question that but for his efforts, this \nlegislation for the common good would not have seen the light of the \nSenate floor.\n  Let me note that commentators have rushed to state that the \nPresident's efforts to strengthen America's charitable tradition has \nbeen watered down. Nothing could be further from the truth. This \nlegislation goes far in meeting the President's ambitious goals for a \ngreater role for charities in assisting those most in need.\n  And legislation is only part of the story. The President's speeches \nand visits have done even more to energize the charitable sector of \nthis country. Hardly a week goes by when I am not stopped by someone \nwho runs a charity, or is active in a charity, and they ask me how they \ncan get involved in the President's proposal, how they can help. \nClearly, President Bush's words have been heard by America's charities \nand they are eager to turn his words into deeds of compassion and aid.\n  In addition to this legislation being a tribute to President Bush's \nleadership, let me also note the tremendous efforts of Senators \nSantorum and Lieberman to bring this bill to the Senate floor. I \ncommend them for their energy in making the CARE Act a reality. \nFinally, I'm pleased to have worked with Senator Baucus, the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee. This legislation continues our \nbipartisan efforts as to tax legislation.\n  Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues let me now highlight \nsome of the major tax provisions of the CARE Act that encourage \ncharitable giving.\n  First, is the creation of a charitable deduction for nonitemizers. \nGiven that over half of Americans do not itemize their tax return, this \nprovision will encourage taxpayers to give to charities, regardless of \nincome. The legislation allows for charitable deduction of up to $500 \nfor a married couple giving over $500 per year. For an individual \nfiling single, it is a deduction of up to $250 for a person who gives \nover $250 per year. For example, an individual who doesn't itemize and \ngives $400 to charity, could deduct $150 from their taxes. This \nprovision was designed to encourage new giving and also limit possible \nabuses.\n  Next is a major provision that will provide for tax-free distribution \nfrom Individual Retirement Arrangements, IRAs, to charities. This is a \nprovision that is important to many major charities, particularly \nuniversities. The Finance Committee heard testimony from the President \nof the University of Iowa about the importance of this provision in \nencouraging new giving. The legislation provides that direct \ndistributions are excluded from income at the age of 70\\1/2\\ and \ndistributions to a charitable trust can be excluded after the age of \n59\\1/2\\.\n  We then have language that encourages donations of food inventory, \nbook inventory and computer technology. I would note that my \ncolleagues, Senator Lugar, and Senator Lincoln, a member of the Finance \nCommittee, were strong advocates for the legislation involving food \ndonation. I'm particularly pleased that this legislation will give \nfarmers and ranchers a fairer deal when it comes to donation of food.\n  Conservation is also a part of this bill. Efforts to conserve our \nland and limit development benefit our Nation as well as farmers and \nranchers who work on the land. The CARE Act contains language I have \nlong supported that will encourage conservation of land through a 25-\npercent reduction in the capital gains tax of the sale of undeveloped \nland, or conservation easements. The sale must be to a charitable \norganization and the land must be dedicated for conservation purposes. \nI am pleased that President Bush also included this proposal in his \nbudget.\n  The bill also encourages gifts of land for conservation purposes. \nThis is an issue long advocated by Senator Baucus, which I am pleased \nto support.\n  These are the major tax provisions that encourage charitable giving \ncontained in this bill. I would note that I am pleased that the \nlegislation does contain provisions requiring greater sunshine and \ntransparency in the work of charities. It is my belief that just as we \nare encouraging people to write more checks, we need to ensure that \nthose checks are being cashed for a charitable purpose. In addition, \nthe bill authorizes a serious increase in funding for the Exempt \nOrganizations Office at the IRS to better police the few bad apples \namong the nonprofits.\n  My colleagues should also be aware that this legislation addresses \nthe abuse of charities by terrorist organizations, making it easier to \nshutdown or suspend such organizations.\n  Let me note also that this bill contains $1.4 billion in new funding \nfor Social Services block grants, SSBG. This is a very important \nprovision that will greatly benefit the States and, more\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\nimportantly, those in need. I would note that this was a matter of \ngreat priority for me, and I am glad to see we have been able to \ninclude this funding. The provision also gives States greater \nflexibility in how to use the SSBG funds.\n  My colleagues will be pleased to know that this bill is fully paid \nfor. I turn now to discuss those provisions regarding abusive corporate \ntax shelters that are of great importance.\n  We have known for many years that abusive tax shelters, which are \nstructured to exploit unintended consequences of our complicated \nFederal income tax system, erode the Federal tax base and the public's \nconfidence in the tax system. Such transactions are patently unfair to \nthe vast majority of taxpayers who do their best to comply with the \nletter and spirit of the tax law.\n  As a result, the Finance Committee has worked exceedingly hard over \nthe past several years to develop several legislative discussion drafts \nfor public review and comment. Thoughtful and well-considered comments \non these drafts have been greatly appreciated by the staff and members \nof the Finance Committee. The collaborative efforts of those involved \nin the discussion drafts combined with the recent request for \nlegislative assistance from the Treasury Department and IRS formed the \nbasis for our most recent approach to dealing with abusive tax \navoidance transactions.\n  The antitax shelter provisions contained in the CARE Act encourages \ntaxpayer disclosure of potentially abusive tax avoidance transactions. \nIt is surprising and unfortunate that taxpayers, though required to \ndisclose tax shelter transactions under present law, have refused to \ncomply. The Treasury Department and IRS report that the 2001 tax filing \nseason produced a mere 272 tax shelter return disclosures from only 99 \ncorporate taxpayers, a fraction of transactions requiring such \ndisclosure.\n  Today's bill will curb non-compliance by providing clearer and more \nobjective rules for the reporting of potential tax shelters and by \nproviding strong penalties for anyone who refuses to comply with the \nrevised disclosure requirements.\n  The legislation has been carefully structured to reward those who are \nforthcoming with disclosure. I wholeheartedly agree with the remarks \noffered by a recent Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, that \n``if a taxpayer is comfortable entering into a transaction, a promoter \nis comfortable selling it, and an advisor is comfortable blessing it, \nthey all should be comfortable disclosing it to the IRS.''\n  Transparency is essential to an evaluation by the IRS and ultimately \nby the Congress of the United States as to whether the tax benefits \ngenerated by complex business transactions are appropriate \ninterpretations of existing tax law.\n  To the extent such interpretations were unintended, the bill allows \nCongress to amend or clarify existing tax law. To the extent such \ninterpretations are appropriate, all taxpayers--from the largest U.S. \nmultinational conglomerate to the smallest local feedstore owner in \nIowa--will benefit when transactions are publicly sanctioned in the \nform of an ``angel list'' of good transactions. This legislation \naccomplishes both of these objectives.\n  This year's legislation contains a new provision that would clarify \nthe economic substance doctrine. The economic substance doctrine was \ncreated by the courts as a flexible text to determine whether a \ntransaction is a tax scam or valid business deal.\n  Last year, there were several court rulings that, in my view, \nmisapplied this doctrine. These rulings now stand as legal precedent \nthat can be used to justify abusive schemes in the future. Today's \nclarification is intended to overturn those rulings. If a court finds \nthat a shelter violates our clarification, the shelter participant \nwould be subject to a strict 40 percent penalty on any tax due. This is \na very tough anti-shelter provision.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues' patience as I have \nreviewed the key provisions of the CARE Act. I think it is legislation \nthat provides needed encouragement for charities and charitable giving \nin this country. In addition, it takes real steps toward addressing \ncorporate tax shelters. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, for the great job he has done in putting \nthis bill together. It is not easy. There are lots of different \ncomponents and many Senators have legitimately different points of \nview. I commend him for his yeoman work. He is not here at the moment, \nbut I want him to know, in the arena of the Senate, and publicly, he \nhas done a great job. The folks in Iowa must be very proud of him.\n  The chairman and I together are considering a bill designed to help \ncharitable organizations--that is the main goal here--and, therefore, \nto help our communities.\n  The bill is called the Charity Aid Recovery and Empowerment Act, \notherwise known as CARE. Our President said it well:\n\n       In order to fight evil we must do good. [And] it is the \n     gathering momentum of millions of acts of kindness and \n     compassion which define the true face of America.\n\n  I think that is very true. More than peoples in any other country, \nAmericans are noted for their openness, their generosity, and their \nkindness. At a time when Americans are at war and our economy is \nsagging, this bill is more important than ever.\n  The economy is in worse shape than it has been in over a decade. Too \nmany Americans go to bed hungry at night. Two million Americans have \nlost their jobs since 2001. Men, women, and children are increasingly \nrelying on charities to meet their needs. The problem is made worse \nbecause our States are strapped with huge budget deficits. States are \nactually the No. 1 provider of social services, but presently they are \nexperiencing the largest deficits they have had in 40 years.\n  This is where charities come in. Charities deliver food, water, \nclothing, and counseling to those in need. They are the first \nresponders to these quiet tragedies. Let me give a few examples from my \nown home State of Montana.\n\n  Each year, the Montana Food Bank Network serves 1.5 million meals, \nincluding 200,000 meals to our State's children. Clearly our children \ncan't learn if they go hungry.\n  There are roughly 30 adult literacy programs in Montana serving over \n5,000 people.\n  Programs such as the Adult Literacy Center in Billings, MT, and the \nLiteracy Volunteers of America in Butte provide free adult literacy \nclasses to anyone who walks in the door, free to anyone who walks in. \nGroups like the Blackfoot Challenge provide local voluntary solutions \nto environmental problems like restoring stream habitat.\n  I copied the model of Senator Bob Graham of Florida. He has what is \ncalled workday projects once a month and I do, too. One day I worked at \nBlackfoot Challenge and all of us together in the Blackfoot Valley--not \nall but a bunch of us, 15 people--volunteered our time and work to \nrestore a stream habitat. Ranchers in the old days just plowed a \nstraight channel through their places and eliminated the meandering \nnature of streams, which made it difficult for bull trout to come up \nand spawn. We decided to do this project together, in part because the \nhigher-ups couldn't agree on anything. The Fish and Wildlife Service, \nState Fish and Wildlife, and Parks and all the government agencies \ncouldn't get together, so locally we just said we are going to do it \nourselves--and we did. It is such volunteer, charitable efforts that \nmake a huge difference.\n  Our State's economy also benefits from tourism, and keeping our \nstreams clean and teeming with fish is good for our economy. In fact, I \nmight say, I was delayed coming to the floor because I was talking to a \nfellow who could hardly wait to get back to Montana because the right \nhatch is going on now. He is going to go fishing in the next couple of \ndays. He couldn't wait to get back home.\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\n  The list goes on: Montanans, working in homeless shelters, churches, \nlibraries, schools, boys and girls clubs, substance abuse centers, and \njails.\n  Our State is not alone. This is true all across our country. In \ncommunities, millions of Americans depend upon the generosity of their \nneighbors and upon charitable organizations. The CARE Act is designed \nto help these organizations, helping them by creating incentives to \nencourage more contributions to charity--help them receive more \ncontributions.\n  Let me describe some of the main provisions of the bill. The \nprovision that has received the most attention is the above-the-line \ndeduction for charitable contributions for people who do not itemize \ntheir deductions. Most Americans actually use the standard deduction--\nabout 70 percent. This says: OK, all you folks who use the standard \ndeduction--that is, you do not itemize your deductions--we will provide \nfor an above-the-line charitable contribution for you as well, even \nthough you do not itemize.\n  I must say, I have some concerns about this provision. Why? Because \nwe tried this before. It didn't work very well. That is why we \neliminated the deduction in 1986. More specifically, I am concerned \nthat the deduction will not provide much of an incentive for charitable \ngiving while making the Tax Code even more complicated. Nonetheless, \nthe President has made this particular proposal a top priority and, in \nlight of that, I am willing to give the proposal a chance. So we \nlimited the proposal to 2 years to give us time to study it and see how \nit is working and gain from the experience.\n  While the nonitemizer deduction has received most of the attention, \nthere are several other provisions of the bill that have strong \nbipartisan support. They could provide a significant boost to \ncharitable giving. First, we provide enhanced deductions for \ncontributions of food, of books, and computers. In response to growing \neconomic hardship and hunger that has gone along with it, we have \nincreased the deduction for contributions of surplus food. In most \ncases, the Tax Code provides the same tax deduction for food hauled to \na landfill as it does for food donated to charities. That does not make \na lot of sense.\n  Businesses that choose to contribute food instead of throwing it away \nare faced with the added costs of storing, packaging, and trucking the \nfood to the charity.\n  So our new enhanced deduction will encourage business, farmers, and \nranchers to contribute the food by offsetting these costs associated \nwith the donations.\n  This makes it easier for the farmer in Montana to receive a fair \ndeduction for giving food to a local food bank, for example.\n  We also make it easier for a publisher to donate extra books to a \nlocal library. Sometimes lots of books get stacked up and cannot be \nsold. I think it is a good idea to be able to donate them. And kids \nwill be able to get much better access to computers and cutting edge \ntechnology.\n  Second, we expand the IRA rollover exception to allow individuals to \ndonate their IRAs directly to charity without taking a tax hit.\n  Under current law, taxpayers, say, who are prospective donors would \ninclude their IRA income as taxable income and then take a \ncorresponding charitable deduction, subject to limits, when they want \nto donate that IRA to a charity. The provision in the bill makes that \neasier, allowing direct giving; that is, streamlining the process and \neliminating the limits that impede giving.\n  Third, in this bill we provide several important new incentives for \nvoluntary conservation; for example, incentives to encourage \ncontributions of conservation easements, which are so important, \nespecially for my State of Montana and throughout the Nation. This \nmeans that cash poor/land rich farmers--which I must say, regrettably, \nis the rule, not the exception--can donate the conservation rights of \ntheir property and get a tax benefit and still keep the family farm in \nthe family.\n  While the majority of the provisions in this bill encourage giving to \ncharities, there are also provisions that help ensure that charities \nare responsible public citizens. As many have noticed, national \nnewspapers have recently detailed the secretive use of charities by \nterrorist organizations. This is, obviously, a serious problem. The \nlarge majority of American charities are law abiding and serve an \ninvaluable function. But there are a few exceptions.\n  So this legislation gives authority to the IRS to immediately revoke \nthe tax-exempt status of charities that are suspected of giving aid to \nterrorist groups. When there is a crisis in confidence with respect to \ncharities, it hurts honest groups. The charities that have worked hard \nto further their noble missions should not be jeopardized because of \nbad ``charities'' doing bad things.\n  The Finance Committee bill attempts to cure this by giving watchdogs \nand donors better tools to monitor the activities of charities. The \nCARE Act gives State attorneys general more authority to review the IRS \nfilings of tax-exempt organizations.\n  In addition, the bill lets donors see more information about \ncommunications between charities and the IRS. These important steps \nwill go a long way to help restore America's confidence in charities.\n  I have just provided some highlights of the bill, but there are a \nnumber of other important provisions. All told, this package includes \nmany proposals that enjoy widespread support. It has bipartisan \nsupport. In fact, many provisions have been approved by the Senate.\n  With war costs on the horizon, and current budget deficits, it is \nessential we pay for this bill. I applaud Chairman Grassley for \ninsisting that these tax cuts be paid for. So let me turn to the \nprovisions which cover the costs.\n  First, we have included a proposal that takes aim at the \nproliferation of abusive tax shelters. I, along with Senator Grassley, \nintroduced the Tax Shelter Transparency Act to encourage more timely \nand accurate disclosure of these abusive transactions. Under the \nproposal, we provide a disincentive to promoters, advisors, and \ntaxpayers by subjecting them to stiff penalties for failing to \nacknowledge these transactions to the IRS.\n  The proposal also clarifies a definition of what is known as economic \nsubstance. That means it forces companies to engage in real business \nplanning instead of tax-driven hoaxes. The Joint Committee on Taxation \nrecently released its Enron report. The transactions it reviewed \ndemonstrate the need for strong anti-avoidance rules to combat tax-\nmotivated transactions. These deals might satisfy the technical \nrequirements of the Tax Code, as well as administrative rules, but they \nserve little or no other purpose than to generate income tax or \nfinancial statement benefits; that is, there is no economic substance \nto the transactions. And the American taxpayers are cheated, frankly--\nthose who do not have the ability to hire high-paid counsel and \naccountants to find these very complicated measures which, frankly, \neven the IRS cannot figure out in a lot of cases.\n  It is just not right when the majority of taxpayers--such as the \nhardware store owner, say, in Butte, MT--have to pay their fair share \nof taxes while these big corporations twist their way out of paying \ntheir own fair share. That is, I think, simply wrong. But it is the \nright thing to do to use this proposal to pay for tax incentives to \nbenefit the charitable community. It is the right thing to do and the \nright time to do it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the CARE Act and \nmy concerns regarding the implementation of President Bush's faith-\nbased initiative.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I am a person of faith. I support the \ngood work that religious organizations undertake every day. I agree \nwith President Bush and the sponsors of this legislation that there is \nan important role for the Federal Government to play in encouraging \nreligious organizations to do more for the good of society.\n  In fact, I support many of the provisions of the CARE Act before us \ntoday. For example, I have been an original cosponsor of the Charitable \nIRA Rollover Act and a cosponsor of the Good Samaritan Hunger Relief \nTax Incentive Act in the last two Congresses. I also\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\nsupport the increased funding for the Social Services block grant.\n  However, when I read the specific details of how the President is \nimplementing his faith-based initiative, I am concerned that the good \nintentions behind this proposal may be lead to troubling, unintended \nconsequences.\n  It appears that what the President wants to achieve with this \ninitiative is to fundamentally change the historic balance in the \nrelationship between government and religion that our founding fathers \nstruck over 200 years ago.\n  I believe and many of my colleagues agree: this Senate debate is \nhistoric. With our deliberations, we will test Constitutional \nprinciples regarding the place of religion in America in a way they \nhave never been tested.\n  That is why many Senators joined me in insisting that the Senate take \nall deliberate time and attention to carefully review this bill and to \nadd language to clarify and improve the bill.\n  Since the Senator from Pennsylvania has agreed not to add language \nthat would raise concerns with respect to church and state, I have \njoined with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island in agreeing not to offer \nour amendments at this time. However, I would like to take this \nopportunity to express my concerns regarding the President's \nimplementation of his faith-based initiative which, if offered at a \nlater time, I hope will be subject to a vigorous, important, and \nhistoric debate in the Senate.\n  We should begin this debate at the beginning. The opening words of \nour Bill of Rights state that:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n\n  For over two centuries, those 16 words have served us well and have \nprotected religious freedom in America.\n  We must continue to respect the diversity of belief in America and \nremember that freedom from government interference was one of the few \nprinciples that early Americans, with a variety of religious \nbackgrounds, could agree on.\n  In fact, many of the settlers who colonized America fled from \nreligious persecution by government officials in their native countries \nand they still do.\n  James Madison recognized that this history of religious persecution \nwas based upon Government involvement in establishing official \nchurches. He believed that Government support of certain religions \ncould threaten the liberty of every citizen to hold his or her own \nreligious convictions.\n  Madison suggested that the Government support of religion differs \nonly in a matter of degree, and he vehemently opposed the payment of \ntaxes in support of any religion.\n  Before the American Revolution, the State of Virginia rescinded a tax \nin support of the Anglican Church, which was their so-called \nestablished church, and instead granted its citizens religious liberty. \nHowever, in 1784, Patrick Henry became concerned with the moral decline \nof Virginians and he proposed a bill to restore the tax to support \n``teachers of the Christian religion.''\n  Madison responded to this proposal with his ``Memorial and \nRemonstrance against Religious Assessments.'' This document--written 16 \nyears before the Bill of Rights was adopted--reveals the earliest \norigins of the concepts behind the first amendment: Madison expressed \nhis opposition to Government involvement in religion because he \nbelieved such involvement would interfere with citizens' right of free \nexercise. Madison also believed that the right of religious freedom was \nas important as freedom of the press, trial by jury, and the right to \nvote.\n  According to Madison, his Memorial was so widely accepted that \nHenry's proposal failed and Virginia instead enacted Thomas Jefferson's \n``Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom in Virginia.''\n  In this bill, Jefferson expressed his belief that religious liberty \nis necessary to ensure that individuals are not forced to support \nreligious opinions with which they disagree, to practice faiths they \nfind abhorrent, or to voice allegiance to one faith over another, and:\n\n       To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the \n     propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is \n     sinful.\n\n  During their Presidencies, Jefferson and Madison had the opportunity \nto illustrate their understanding of the first amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  In 1801, the Danbury Baptist Association wrote a letter to President \nJefferson because it feared that the State of Connecticut would \nestablish the Congregationalist Church as the official religion.\n  Jefferson responded to the Danbury Baptist Association with a letter \non January 1, 1802, in which he reaffirmed his belief that each \nindividual has the right to hold whatever opinion he or she may choose \nand that the Government should not interfere in religion. This reply \ncontained his now-famous view that the purpose of the first amendment \nwas to build a--in Jefferson's words--``wall of separation between \nchurch and state.''\n  President Madison, in his 8 years in office, vetoed only seven \nbills--two of which he believed violated the Establishment Clause of \nthe first amendment.\n  In 1811, Congress passed a bill entitled ``An act incorporating the \nProtestant Episcopal Church in the town of Alexandria in the District \nof Columbia.'' This bill would have enacted the rules of the church as \na matter of law, thereby giving legal force to the provisions of the \nchurch's constitution.\n  Madison believed that even supporting churches in their charitable \nfunctions would give religious organizations too much power in public \nand civic affairs. He wrote that the bill would be ``precedent for \ngiving to religious societies as such a legal agency in carrying into \neffect a public and civic duty.'' Think of those words in the context \nof the proposal before us.\n  Madison also vetoed a bill ``An act for the relief of Richard Tervin, \nWilliam Coleman, Edwin Lewis, Samuel Mims, Joseph Wilson, and the \nBaptist Church at Salem Meeting House, in the Mississippi Territory.'' \nThis bill would have given a Baptist Church specific Federal Government \nproperty for the church's use.\n  Madison believed that:\n\n       reserving a certain parcel of land of the United States for \n     the use of said Baptist Church comprises a principle and \n     precedent for the appropriation of funds of the United States \n     for the use and support of religious societies, contrary to \n     the article of the Constitution which declares that \n     ``Congress shall make no law respecting a religious \n     establishment.''\n\n  Thanks to Jefferson and Madison, first amendment protections have \nmade America the most tolerant society in the world--a tolerance many \nof our critics around the world neither understand nor accept. They \nlive in nations where government and religious belief are so closely \nentwined that diversity of creed is officially discouraged, if not \nprohibited.\n  Each of us, when we return home, can drive through our cities and see \na Protestant church down the street from a Catholic church, next to a \nJewish synagogue which is not too far from a Muslim mosque, and perhaps \nacross the street from a Sikh Gur-dwala. Some churches even share their \nfacilities with congregations from other religious and ethnic groups. \nTo me, this is proof positive that the wisdom of the first amendment is \nalive and well in America today.\n  Although some may argue that the faith-based initiative does not \n``establish a religion,'' the Supreme Court has ``long held that the \nFirst Amendment reaches more than classic, 18th century \nestablishments.''\n  Indeed, the Supreme Court has examined the history of the first \namendment and has come to the same conclusion that I have reached:\n\n       For the men who wrote the Religion Clauses of the First \n     Amendment the `establishment' of a religion connoted \n     sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the \n     sovereign in religious activity.\n\n  That comes from the case of Walz v. Tax Commission in 1970.\n  This is one principle that President Bush seems to be willing to \naccept. I am heartened that the White House publication Guidance to \nFaith-Based and Community Organizations on Partnering with the Federal \nGovernment is clear that faith-based organizations cannot use any part \nof a direct Federal grant to fund religious worship, instruction, or \nproselytization. Such activities must be separate in time or location.\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\n  The President also agrees that faith-based organizations cannot \ndiscriminate against beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries of a \nsocial service on the basis of religion.\n  However, one area where we clearly diverge is the issue of employment \ndiscrimination on the basis of religion.\n  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits most public and private \nemployers with 15 or more employees from discriminating in their \nemployment practices on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, \nand religion.\n  However, religious employers have an exemption with respect to \nreligious discrimination, which was expanded in 1972.\n  I will read the current exemption:\n\n       This subchapter shall not apply . . . to a religious \n     corporation, association, educational institution, or society \n     with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular \n     religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by \n     such corporation, association, educational institution, or \n     society of its activities.\n\n  In 1987, the Supreme Court upheld this title VII religious exemption \nin the case of Corporation of Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos.\n  I support this right of religious organizations to use religious \ncriteria in hiring people to carry out their religious work. I have no \nquarrel with the title VII religious exemption. It makes sense for \npeople of common faith to work together to further their religion's \nmission.\n  At the same time, I recognize that discrimination ``on the basis of \nreligion'' can often include discrimination based on other factors that \nare prohibited by civil rights laws, such as race, ethnicity, and sex.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., observed that the hour of worship is one \nof the most segregated hours in American society. Sadly this is still \ntrue today, but many people of similar racial or ethnic backgrounds do \nprefer to worship together, and there are churches throughout this \nNation that target only certain races or ethnic groups.\n  So, unfortunately, allowing religious organizations to hire only \nmembers of their own religion, in many cases, can also mean hiring only \nmembers of a certain race or ethnic background.\n  For example, if employment is limited to the co-religionists of the \nrecipients, how many African Americans will be hired by Orthodox Jewish \ngroups? How many white people will the Nation of Islam employ as \nsecurity guards in public housing? And what of the many Protestant \ngroups that are overwhelmingly White or overwhelmingly Black or \noverwhelmingly Hispanic?\n  The courts also have read the title VII exemption very broadly to \nallow discrimination on the basis of religion to include the religion's \n``tenets and teachings.'' This broad reading has resulted in situations \nwhere people of faith who do not necessarily follow the accepted \nlifestyle or private behavior of that religion have lost their jobs.\n  Here are some examples of how this law discriminates against people's \neveryday behavior in addition to their religious beliefs:\n  In the case of EEOC v. Presbyterian Ministries, Inc., a Christian \nretirement home fired a Muslim receptionist after she insisted on \nwearing a head covering as required by her faith.\n  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints fired several \nemployees because they failed to qualify for a ``temple recommend,'' \nthat is, a certificate that they were Mormons who abided by the \nchurch's standards in such matters as regular church attendance, \ntithing, and abstinence from coffee, tea, alcohol, and tobacco.\n  This exemption, unfortunately, has had a particularly harsh impact on \nwomen and people of different sexual orientation. Here are some \nexamples of how courts have interpreted this exemption to allow \nemployment discrimination against women and gays under the current \ntitle VII exemption:\n  Numerous Christian schools fired female teachers for having \nextramarital sex or committing adultery; upheld by the court. A \nCatholic school fired a teacher who remarried without seeking an \nannulment of her first marriage in accord with Catholic doctrine; \nupheld by the court. A Catholic school fired a teacher for marrying a \ndivorced man; upheld by the court. A Catholic university refused to \nhire a female professor because her views on abortion were not in \naccord with Catholic teaching; upheld by the court. A Baptist nursing \nhome fired a student services specialist after she was ordained a \nminister in a gay and lesbian church that advocated views on \nhomosexuality ``which were inconsistent with the [school's] perception \nof its purpose and mission''; upheld by the court. A church terminated \nthe employment of an organist on the grounds that his homosexuality \nconflicted with the church's belief; upheld by the court.\n  I regret that these may be unintended discriminatory consequences \ntoday under the title VII exemption where religious organizations hire \npeople using money raised by the church from its own congregation. But \nwhat of the case we are discussing? We are not talking about a \nsituation where churches are spending their own money for their own \nreligious purposes and following their own employment codes and \npractices under the title VII exemption. We are talking about opening \nup a new world where tax dollars are taken from the treasury and given \nto these same churches. What if the money is not raised by the \ncongregation or coreligionists, but the money is being raised from the \ntaxpaying public? What standard should we use?\n  Most scholars agree it is an open legal question as to whether a \nreligious organization can take taxpayer money and use it to \ndiscriminate in hiring employees on the basis of religion. It would \nseem to me that the obvious answer to this question is no. Any other \nresponse would result in taxpayer-funded discrimination. I will return \nto this question and the reasons for my answer after examining asking \nhow this issue fits into the broader picture of the President's faith-\nbased initiative.\n  The faith-based initiative has been marketed as a proposal to ``level \nthe playing field'' for religious organizations that seek government \nfunds to pay for social service programs. However, it appears that the \nsupporters of the initiative do not want to level the playing field; \nthey want to create a special set of rules for religious organizations \nwhich would result in special treatment that other nongovernmental \norganizations do not currently enjoy.\n  President Bush has demonstrated, through his Executive orders and \nagency regulations, that his faith-based initiative goes far beyond \nreligious icons, religious names, religious language in chartering \ndocuments or religious criteria for membership on governing boards. I \ndo not object to any of those stated goals which I have heard from the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Connecticut as well as \nthe President. I have seen the enforcement of rules and standards which \nI think have gone way too far.\n  I can think of my own hometown of Springfield where there is a long-\nsimmering controversy still brought up regularly about whether a \nteacher could come in and teach a driver training course at the \nCatholic high school if that teacher were paid for out of public school \nfunds and that Catholic high school and its classroom had a crucifix on \nthe wall. It rubbed a lot of people of my Catholic religion the wrong \nway, that people would argue that the mere presence of that crucifix \nwas somehow offensive or violated the law. That argument goes to the \nextreme. I do not hold those views. I support the position stated time \nand again by the Senators from Pennsylvania and Connecticut that we \nought to draw a more reasonable line. The House of Representatives, \nwith mottos on the walls ``In God We Trust,'' with our currency \nreflecting that, with chaplains in the House and Senate, we can state a \nreasonable standard that does not violate the basic freedom of religion \nor establishment clause of our Constitution. But I do object to the \nadministration bypassing Congress to write one set of rules for secular \norganizations and another for religious organizations.\n\n  For example, all recipients of government grants currently are \nrequired to abide by a host of regulatory requirements, including \nfiling IRS documentation and complying with all State and local laws. \nSupporters of the faith-based initiative would like to exempt religious \norganizations from complying with these important regulations, such as \nthose dealing with health and safety. Explain that for a moment.\n  If in the State of Illinois or my city of Springfield someone wants \nto run a daycare center and we have decided, for the safety of the \nchildren in the\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\ndaycare center, there should be perhaps a sprinkler system, a fire \nalarm, or a fire escape, certain doors so that kids can get out in case \nof emergency, why, if this becomes a faith-based childcare center, \nshould we reduce or limit that same application of health and safety \nstandards? It doesn't make sense. One of the amendments which needs to \nbe offered as part of this conversation on faith-based initiatives will \naddress that.\n  Take a look at the Teen Challenge substance abuse program which \nPresident Bush has mentioned many times. In 1995, the Texas Commission \non Alcohol and Drug Abuse threatened to close Teen Challenge after \nissuing a 49-page list of violations of State health and safety codes. \nThe list included unlicensed counselors, food preparation that created \na health hazard, a broken smoke detector system, and exposed wires and \nelectrical outlets. Then-Governor Bush responded by exempting faith-\nbased drug treatment programs from all of the State health and safety \nregulations that were followed by their secular counterparts.\n  I don't know how you could reach that conclusion. It is one thing to \nbe imbued with a religion; it is another thing to ignore the obvious. \nIf there is a terrible accident or fire or some disaster, children in \nfaith-based institutions deserve the same level of legal protection as \nthose in institutions run as businesses.\n  This special treatment was not limited to drug treatment programs. \nFaith-based childcare centers and residential children's homes could \nuse an alternative accreditation program that would exempt them from \nState licensing. The special treatment for these alternatively \naccredited facilities was that there were no unannounced inspections of \nthe facilities as required by State law. As a result, the rate of \nconfirmed abuse and neglect at alternatively accredited facilities was \n25 times higher than that of State-licensed facilities. Whom are we \ndoing a favor for by exempting the faith-based charity from standards \nof unannounced inspections to make certain that they are living up to \nthe letter of the law?\n  The complaint rate at alternatively accredited facilities was 75 \npercent compared to 5.4 percent at State-licensed facilities. Due to \nthese staggering outcomes, this accreditation program sunset in 2001 \nand has never been renewed.\n\n  The White House has also given indications it may provide special \ntreatment to religious organizations by exempting them from State and \nlocal laws addressing employment discrimination. I have a great deal of \nrespect for the Salvation Army. They do wonderful work, not only in the \nUnited States but around the world. But they had a rather embarrassing \nincident in July of 2001 when an internal report was discovered that \nstated their group had received a ``firm commitment'' from the Bush \nWhite House to protect religious charities from State and local laws \nregarding sexual orientation discrimination and domestic partner \nbenefits. I hope that is not the goal of the Bush White House in \npushing this faith-based initiative.\n  Over the past 2 years, President Bush and his faith-based initiative \nhave repeatedly eroded 200 years of carefully protected separation \nbetween church and state. In what the Washington Post called ``faith-\nbased by fiat,'' President Bush signed Executive Order 13279, in \nDecember of 2002, to overturn principles of nondiscrimination in \nFederal contracts that have stood for over 60 years.\n  The House of Representatives is currently considering the \nreauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act. The legislation has \nbeen marked up in the House, and it would repeal 20 years of civil \nrights protections against religious discrimination. The House also has \nheld hearings regarding the reauthorization of the Corporation for \nNational and Community Service, known as AmeriCorps. In its proposed \nlegislation, the House would repeal a decade of civil rights \nprotections against religious discrimination in employment that were \nsigned into law by President Bush's father.\n  Finally, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed \nrules to allow religious organizations to use Federal funds to build \ncenters where religious worship is held as long as parts of the \nbuilding are also used for social services.\n  Supporters of the faith-based initiative want to know why we are \nraising these issues now, when Congress included charitable choice \nprovisions in legislation we passed as far back as 1996. The difference \nis this: Then-President Clinton made it clear, as part of the technical \ncorrections package to the welfare reform bill, that nothing included \ntherein would change the fundamental protections against religious \ndiscrimination which were currently in the law. President Clinton did \nthat as well in the reauthorization of Community Services Block Grant \nPrograms in 1998 and the reauthorization of the Substance Abuse Mental \nHealth Services Act in 2000. Unfortunately, in this debate, that same \nassurance has not been given.\n  I want to go to a point which really gets to the heart of the issue. \nIt is a difficult one. It is one for which I don't have an answer. When \nyou talk about faith-based initiatives, you are talking about religion \nin America. The obvious and important question is: What is a religion? \nThere are many that we readily will recognize as being established \nreligions of all different denominations. But when it comes to the \ndefinition of religion, many people self-define their beliefs and \nactivities as religion.\n  Jim Jones led people to a mass suicide in Guyana, and David Koresh \nand his Branch Davidians in Waco, TX, have become scarred in the \nAmerican memory as tragic reminders of what happens when people are \nblindly led by fanatics who use the guise of religion for their own \npersonal, violent agenda. I represent a State which is the home of the \nso-called World Church of the Creator, which has to be one of the most \nperverted extremist groups in America that I know of, which claims \nitself to be a religion. On its Web site, the so-called ``Reverend'' \nMatt Hale--who graduated from law school but was not allowed to be \nlicensed under the rules and practices of the bar in Illinois--proudly \nwelcomes visitors, saying:\n\n       We are a religious, nonprofit organization, with our world \n     headquarters in the State of Illinois. At the time of this \n     writing, we have 24 regional and local branches of the church \n     and members all over the world.\n\n  What are the tenets of his church and religion, of this World Church \nof the Creator? Here is what he says in his own words:\n\n       After 6,000 years of recorded history, our people finally \n     have a religion of, for, and by them. Creativity is that \n     religion. It is established for the survival, expansion, and \n     advancement of our white race exclusively. Indeed, we believe \n     that what is good for the white race is the highest virtue, \n     and what is bad for the white race is the ultimate sin.\n\n  I cannot think of any more hateful rhetoric spewed in the name of \nreligion. That is exactly what is happening today. Recently someone \nchallenged their dismissal of employment because they were members of \nthis church. The court came back and said it is a religion and has to \nbe treated as such for the purpose of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  So here we come to a point where we are talking about giving Federal \ndollars to those who call themselves religions for the purpose of \nperforming social services. What is the threshold question we should \nask? Is this truly a religion or is this something else in the guise of \na religion? What are we doing with taxpayer dollars? Would we want to \nspend $1 supporting the racist views of the World Church of the Creator \nbecause they tell the Federal Government they have a program to deal \nwith drug abuse or to provide childcare services in central Illinois? I \nhope not. But once you have opened this door and start talking about \nFederal dollars given to religion for social services, you open up a \ncan of worms, a set of questions and great challenges that we have not \nfaced for many years, if ever.\n  I am worried as I look across the various religions of the world, not \njust those purporting to be Christian but some who are members of \ndifferent religions that have taken what in fact are extreme views.\n  It was only a little more that a year ago that the people of \nAfghanistan were still suffering under the violent and oppressive \nregime of the Taliban, which suppressed and punished its people in the \nname of Islamic fundamentalist religious beliefs.\n  Thanks to the leadership of the United States and our military, we\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\nhave now liberated the Afghan people from the Taliban, which, like Al \nQaeda, had distorted the peaceful religion of Islam for their own \ndestructive purposes.\n  The leaders of the Taliban were trained in ``madrassas,'' which are \ncharacterized as religious schools. But those familiar with these \ninstitutions often call many of them ``jihad factories'' because of the \nextreme nature of their ``religious'' indoctrination and the militancy \nthey train.\n  At madrassas, the Taliban preached that freedom afforded to women is \nthe main reason for social degradation, and that the best place for \nwomen was inside the four walls of their homes--cut off from education \nand cut off from opportunity.\n  They also preached that television is the ``spark of hell'' \nresponsible for moral degradation, and watching it or listening to \nmusic was un-Islamic and sinful. And when they came to power, the \nTaliban put all of these distorted lessons to practice against their \nown people.\n  The Taliban is perhaps the most recent example of extremism in the \nname of religion that we have witnessed.\n  But since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, we have seen numerous \nradical Islamic fundamentalists utilize their religious ideology as the \ndriving force behind the most active Middle Eastern terrorist groups \nand state sponsors.\n  For example, Hizballah of Lebanon calls itself the ``Party of God'' \nalthough there is nothing godly about its terrorist activities.\n  Hizballah was founded in 1982 as a faith-based organization by \nLebanese Shiite clerics who were inspired by the Islamic ideology of \nIran's Ayatollah Khomeini. Its original goal was to establish an \nIslamic republic in Lebanon. But many of the Shiite Muslims who rule \nHizballah studied in Iran's theological seminaries while receiving \nterrorist training there as well.\n  The trainings paid off as this terrorist group became responsible for \nthe detention of most, if not all, American and other Western hostages \nheld in Lebanon during the 1980s and early 1990s. Eighteen Americans \nwere held hostage during that period, three of whom were killed.\n  Hizballah is also suspected in the April 1983 suicide truck bombings \nof the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the U.S. Marine barracks in October \n1983 that killed 220 Marine, 18 Navy and 3 Army personnel.\n  And Hizballah is also suspected to have been behind the hijacking of \nTWA Flight 847 in 1985, and the killing of a Navy diver, Robert \nStethem, who was on board.\n  Hamas, Al-Jihad, Abu Sayyaf, and Islamic Movement are some of the \nother better-known extremists that argue their organizations are based \non Islamic religious beliefs.\n  There are radical Jewish groups as well, such as Kach and Kahane \nChai. These two Jewish movements seek to expel all Arabs from Israel \nand expand Israel's boundaries to include the occupied territories and \nparts of Jordan. Founded by extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane, these groups \nalso argue for strict implementation of Jewish law in Israel.\n  I do not mean to suggest here that the President's faith-based \ninitiative will necessarily lead to such religious extremism.\n  At the same time, I want to make it clear that this is not an easy \nquestion. To dismiss it simply as a question about whether or not we \nare tolerant of religion is one thing, but the question of whether we \nare going to subsidize religious belief that reaches the extreme is \nreally something else.\n  The important message we must send is that religious organizations \nthat take taxpayers' money should not be able to use those funds to \ndiscriminate in hiring employees on the basis of religion. The American \npeople have been asked their opinion on this issue. The response is \ninteresting.\n  According to the Washington Post, in a 2001 survey conducted by the \nPew Research Center:\n\n       When people were asked whether ``religious groups that use \n     Government funds [should] be allowed to hire only those who \n     share their religious beliefs,'' 78 percent said ``no'' and \n     18 percent said ``yes''--a degree of objection that so \n     surprised researchers that they repeated the question three \n     different ways. . . .\n\n  They received the same answer time and time again. On the other hand, \nthe Bush administration believes that Government-funded discrimination \nin hiring on the basis of religion is acceptable.\n  According to a U.S. Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel \nmemorandum on June 25, 2001:\n\n       We conclude, for the reasons set forth more fully below, \n     that a faith-based organization receiving direct Federal aid \n     may make employment decisions on the basis of religion \n     without running afoul of the Establishment Clause.\n\n  In the only case that directly addressed whether the Title VII \nexemption applies to a position funded by government funds, the \nSouthern District Court of Mississippi ruled that it did not.\n  In the 1989 case Dodge v. Salvation Army, Jamie Dodge was employed by \nthe Salvation Army in its Domestic Violence Shelter as the Victims \nAssistance Coordinator.\n  After the Director of the shelter saw Ms. Dodge using the Salvation \nArmy's copy machine, Ms. Dodge admitted that she had made copies of \nmanuals and information on Wiccan rituals.\n  Soon after making these admissions, Ms. Dodge was terminated.\n  She filed a complaint that because the shelter where she worked \nreceived substantial federal and state funds, the Title VII exemption \ncould not be applied to her.\n  The District Court ruled that ``even though the religious exemption \ndoes permit the Salvation Army to terminate an employee based on \nreligious grounds, the fact that the plaintiff's position as Victims' \nAssistance Coordinator was funded substantially, if not entirely, by \nfederal, state, and local government, gives rise to constitutional \nconsiderations which effectively prohibit the application of the \nexemption to the facts in this case.''\n  Furthermore, the Court held that ``Based on the facts in the present \ncase, the effect of the government substantially, if not exclusively, \nfunding a position such as the Victims' Assistance Coordinator and then \nallowing the Salvation Army to choose the person to fill or maintain \nthe position based on religious preference clearly has the effect of \nadvancing religion and is unconstitutional.\n  Despite this ruling, the issue is considered an open legal question \nbecause the case was not considered beyond the District Court and there \nare several other cases which at least partially address this question.\n  However, this is not just a legal question or a hypothetical line we \nare drawing in the sand.\n  One of the cases I would like to point out is a case that really \ntalks about discrimination firsthand. It is the case of Alan Yorker and \nhis experience with United Methodist Children's Home in Decatur, GA. \nThe children's home, which receives almost half of its money from \nGovernment sources, provides residential group foster care for 70 young \npeople, many of whom are in State custody.\n  Mr. Yorker responded to an advertisement in the Atlanta Journal-\nConstitution for a position at the home. As a psychotherapist with over \n20 years experience counseling young people and their families and over \na decade of experience teaching in Emory University professional \nschools, the home determined that his credentials placed him among the \ntop candidates for the position. He was rushed in for an interview, \nwhere he was required to disclose in an application form his religious \naffiliation, his church and minister. Mr. Yorker, a Jew, supplied the \nnames of his synagogue and rabbi. During the interview, an \nadministrator noted that Mr. Yorker was Jewish and told him that this \nchildren's home doesn't hire people who are Jewish. He was shown the \ndoor.\n  Let me tell you that this didn't happen decades ago; this is of \nrecent vintage. The same administrator told another employee that it is \nthe home's practice to throw the resumes of applicants with Jewish-\nsounding names in the trash. The Yorker name got past her.\n\n  Ironically, Yorker has not always been the family name. Alan Yorker's \nJewish paternal grandfather, Harry Monjesky, spent many years as a \nconductor on the New York Central Railroad. When the railroad began to \nface tough times, Jewish and African-American workers were singled out \nfor layoffs first, regardless of their seniority.\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\nMr. Monjesky was fired and left without a livelihood. Several years \nlater, when Alan's father reached adulthood, he changed his name to \nYorker. He wanted to make sure that his children would be judged by \ntheir merit and not by their surname or private religious beliefs.\n  That is how Alan Yorker's resume landed at the top of the pile \ninstead of the home's trash bin. And nearly a century after his \ngrandfather was turned away by the Railroad because of his religion, \nAlan Yorker faced the same discrimination when applying for a \ngovernment-funded position.\n  I will conclude by saying that these are examples of what is being \ndone in the name of religion. For it to be done by a religious \norganization to achieve a religious goal, with funds raised by co-\nreligionists, is certainly allowed in title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct. To say, however, that we are going to open the Federal Treasury \nand provide millions of dollars to religions for social services, and \nthen approve of their discriminatory activity in the name of religion, \nis branching out in a direction that our Founding Fathers could never \nhave considered, let alone condoned.\n  In light of this complex constitutional issue, I think it is fair to \nask why we even need a faith-based initiative. President Bush believes \nit is necessary because ``people should be allowed to access money \nwithout having to lose their mission or change their mission.'' \nHowever, current law already permits groups that are affiliated with \nreligious entities to provide social services with Government funding.\n  Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services, Jewish Federations, and \nmany other religious organizations have received--and continue to \nreceive--taxpayer funds from the Government to provide much-needed \nservices that our Government is often unable and unavailable to \nprovide.\n  These organizations access Federal funds without changing their \nmissions. For example, Catholic Charities has a publication entitled \n``10 Ways Catholic Charities are Catholic.'' At the same time, Catholic \nCharities in Chicago, which I am proud to represent, also issues the \nfollowing statement on its Web site:\n\n       Catholic Charities employs more than 3,000 dedicated, \n     compassionate and professional men and women, regardless of \n     race, religion, or ethnic background.\n\n  Many Catholic Charities across the Nation have similar equal \nopportunity statements.\n  As thousands of Americans visit our Nation's Capital, many will stop \nat the Jefferson Memorial and read the following inscription, in the \nwords of Thomas Jefferson:\n\n       No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any \n     religious worship ministry or shall otherwise suffer on \n     account of his opinions in matters of religion.\n\n  These words, from Jefferson's ``Bill for Establishing Religious \nFreedom in Virginia,'' are as relevant now as they were in 1785. \nAlthough we don't debate the faith-based initiative proposal in its \nentirety today, I look forward to the opportunity to continue to \nprotect our historic balance in the relationship between church and \nstate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the CARE Act is a significant bipartisan \neffort to create improved opportunities for charitable giving. That is \na goal I wholeheartedly support. Charitable giving is a continuing \nreaffirmation of the deeply held community spirit of the American \npeople. It recognizes our responsibility to help the less fortunate, \nand the work of charitable organizations is essential in protecting the \nwell-being of millions of our fellow citizens.\n  The key provision of the bill will at long last allow those who do \nnot itemize their deductions to receive a tax deduction for their \ncharitable contributions. This deduction will benefit millions of low \nand middle-income families who are already making significant \ncharitable contributions each year, and it will encourage even more \ncharitable contributions in future years.\n  The agreement to remove the controversial title 8 makes sense, so the \nbill can move quickly through Congress. All of us share the goal of \nenhancing community-based services for low-income people through \npublic, private, and faith-based organizations. Our concern with title \n8 was that it failed to see that faith-based organizations do not use \nthese public funds to discriminate on the basis of religion.\n  Many of us continue to be concerned about a separate development on \nthe discrimination issue. The President has issued an Executive order \nrepealing more than 60 years of Federal protections against religious \ndiscrimination in publicly funded programs. Under the President's \norder, organizations can receive public funds and then refuse to hire \npersons because of their religion, their marital status, or their \nsexual orientation. As the Senate considers future legislation to \nsupport and fund community-based organizations that provide social \nservices, including faith-based organizations, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to see that civil rights protections are \nsafeguarded.\n\n  I am pleased that the CARE Act restores funding for the social \nservices block grant. Congress made a promise in 1996 to do so, and it \nis essential to keep that promise, so that vulnerable Americans can \ncontinue to rely on the funding in the years ahead.\n  For too long, Congress has ignored its responsibility to those most \nin need. Since 1995, annual funding for SSBG has been cut by more than \n$1 billion, from a high of $2.8 billion to the current level of $1.7 \nbillion. This bill will restore the amount to $2.8 billion in the next \nfiscal year.\n  The social services block grant pays for critical services for 11 \nmillion children, families, seniors, and persons with disabilities each \nyear. In 2000, $683 million in these funds was used to support child \nprotective services, foster care, and adoption services alone. Twelve \npercent of the funds was used for disability services, and $181 million \nwas used to provide services to the elderly. This program is the only \nFederal source of funding for Adult Protective Services, which provides \nassistance and protection for elderly and disabled adults who are \nvictims of abuse.\n  Restoring these funds is especially important now, when most States \nare cutting and even eliminating the very services and programs that \nthe social services block grant was enacted to support. The economic \ndownturn, escalating State deficits, and reduced funding for social \nservices, has left State program officials with the impossible task of \ndeciding who to help and who to turn away.\n  We must do all we can in Congress to ensure that States have the \nresources they need to support their most vulnerable citizens. I \ncommend my colleagues on the Finance Committee on the provision to \nrestore SSBG in the CARE Act for the coming year. Our goal now is to \nsee that we keep doing that in future years as well.\n  Today's action should not be just a temporary, 1-year fix. We owe a \nlasting commitment to the children, families, and seniors who need our \nhelp the most, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nachieve this goal.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to briefly discuss one of the provisions \nin the CARE Act, an incentive that will encourage the conservation of \nenvironmentally sensitive land. This conservation incentive will allow \nlandowners who own environmentally sensitive land to exclude part of \nthe gain they realize if they sell their land to conservation \norganizations for the purpose of conservation.\n  We are losing our farms, ranches, and open spaces at an alarming \nrate. Many landowners would like to transfer their land to a \nconservation organization that would conserve it or preserve its \noriginal use. For many of them, however, donating land to a \nconservation organization is not an option. Their land is an important \nasset, the sale of which will yield an important source of income.\n  The CARE Act creates a new tax incentive for these ``land rich/cash \npoor'' taxpayers who cannot take advantage of the current law's \ncharitable deduction. This new incentive is an exclusion from income \nfor one-fourth of the gain that taxpayers realize upon a sale of land, \nwhen the land is sold for conservation purposes, to a conservation \norganization. The exclusion will also be available for a transfer of a \npartial interest, such as a conservation easement. With this provision, \nlandowners would pay less tax when they transfer land for conservation \npurposes.\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\n  I first introduced a bill similar to the CARE Act provision in the \n106th Congress. In 2000, both Presidential candidates endorsed this \napproach. This year, and in the previous 2 years, a provision like the \nconservation exclusion in the CARE Act has been included in the \nPresident's budget proposals. It has also been endorsed by a diverse \nrange of interest groups, including the Farm Bureau, Ducks Unlimited, \nthe Land Trust Alliance, the American Farmland Trust, and the Nature \nConservancy.\n  My bill--and President Bush's budget proposals--called for a 50-\npercent exclusion. If, as I believe, this tax incentive proves to be an \neffective way to encourage conservation, I hope that we will someday be \nable to increase the exclusion. This new tax incentive will mean more \nconservation with no new appropriations, and no new restrictions on \nland use. It adopts a new, market-based approach to conservation, using \nfunds that have either been privately raised or set aside by State and \nlocal governments.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Charity, \nAid, Recovery, and Empowerment Act. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of this important legislation, which would encourage more \ncitizens to contribute to non-profit programs and institutions. I want \nto commend my colleagues, Senators Santorum and Lieberman, for \nintroducing this important bipartisan legislation. The CARE Act is \ndesigned to promote charitable giving at a time when charities report \nincreasing demands on their services along with a decline in \ncontributions.\n  After the tragedy of September 11, charitable contributions were \ngreatly deminished. Donations to charitable organizations dropped last \nyear by 2.3 percent and they are lagging even further behind this year. \nAt the same time, more people are turning to charities for help because \nof job lay-offs, health concerns, and the needs of our children. The \ntax incentives contained in the CARE Act to encourage charitable giving \nare needed now more than ever.\n  Included in this bill is language to encourage charitable giving by \nallowing a tax deduction for charitable giving for non-itemizers. \nEighty-six million Americans do not presently itemize their deductions \non their tax returns. This provision would allow for a tax deduction up \nto $250 for individuals and $500 for couples. Organizations such as the \nAmerican Red Cross, the March of Dimes, and other charitable \norganizations that rely on low dollar donations believe that they will \nbe able to generate more donations if everyone could take a deduction \nregardless of which form they file with the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The ability to roll over excess funds from Individual Retirement \nAccounts to a charitable organization or university is also a part of \nthis legislation. Many organizations and universities benefit from \nplanned gift revenues. The IRA rollover provision will allow charities \nto increase the number of planned gifts, while being able to diversify \ntheir planned gift portfolios.\n  I have been a supporter of Individual Development Accounts and was \npleased that this initiative to expand these accounts is included in \nthe bill before us. These accounts are made up of dollar-for-dollar \nmatching contributions up to $500 from banks and community \norganizations to be used by lower-income working families to buy a \nhome, start or expand a small business, or pay for college.\n  I believe that one of the most important provisions that has been \nincluded in this bill is the Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act. This \nimportant provision allows for expanded charitable tax deductions for \ncontributions of food inventory to our nation's food banks. Demand on \nfood banks has been rising, and these tax deductions would be an \nimportant step in increasing private donations to the non-profit hunger \nrelief charities playing a critical role in meeting America's nutrition \nneeds.\n  As I have traveled around Indiana, I have visited many food banks in \nour state. They have confirmed the results of a study by the U.S. \nConference of Mayors that showed demand for food at food banks has \nrisen significantly. The success of welfare reform legislation has \nmoved many recipients off welfare and into jobs. In many states, \nwelfare roles have been reduced by more than half. But we need to \nrecognize that these individuals and their families are living on \nmodest wages. As the states' unemployment rates have risen, so has the \ndemand placed on the food banks and soup kitchens.\n  According to the Conference of Mayors survey, during the last year, \nrequests for emergency food assistance has increased one hundred \npercent. Forty-eight percent of the people requesting emergency food \nassistance are either children or their parents. The number of elderly \npersons requesting food assistance has increased by ninety-two percent.\n  Private food banks provide a key safety net against hunger. According \nto an August 2000 report by USDA, 31 million Americans are living on \nthe edge of hunger.\n  USDA statistics show that up to 96 billion pounds of food go to waste \neach year in the United States. If a small percentage of this wasted \nfood could be redirected to food banks, we could make important strides \nin our fight against hunger.\n  The food bank provisions under the CARE Act would allow farmers and \nsmall business owners to take a deduction when they donate food to \ntheir community food bank. Currently this deduction is available to \nlarge corporations but not to small businesses. This approach would \nstimulate private charitable giving to food banks at the community \nlevel.\n  Each citizen can make an important contribution to the fight against \nhunger at a local level. I have been especially impressed by the \nremarkable work of food banks in Indiana. In many cases, they are \npartnered with churches and faith-based organizations and are making a \ntremendous difference in our communities. We should support this \nprivate sector activity, which not only feeds people, but also \nstrengthens community bonds and demonstrates the power of faith, \ncharity, and civic involvement.\n  I would like to thank Senators Santorum, Lieberman, Grassley, and \nBaucus for their efforts in helping America's charities meet their \nfunding goals, and to those individuals who take advantage of the \nservices provided by these groups.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering the CARE Act today. By enacting this legislation, Congress \nacknowledges the inherent good in millions of Americans.\n  The bill includes a number of changes to the tax rules that will make \nit easier for individuals to donate to the tens of thousands of \nworthwhile charities that operate across this nation. By making the \ncharitable deduction available to those taxpayers who don't itemize \ntheir deductions, married couples can deduct as much as $500 of the \ncontributions they make to charity.\n  Provisions in the legislation also make it easier for individuals to \ndonate funds they have saved in an IRA. Rather than having to report \nthis amount in income and then take a commensurate deduction for the \ncontribution, the new rule allows the funds to be transferred directly \nto the charity.\n  The bill also eases the burden of gaining tax benefits for those \nindividuals who wish to make donations of food, books, and scholarly \ncompositions to charity.\n  While these charitable giving incentives are useful to many citizens \nand the charities they desire to help, this legislation may be even \nmore important because it contains strong provisions that will help the \nInternal Revenue Service and the Nation's courts crack down on abusive \ntax shelters.\n  In his last report to the IRS Oversight Board, the IRS Commissioner \nCharles Rossotti identified abusive corporate tax shelters and \npromoters of tax schemes of all varieties as among the most serious \ncompliance problem areas. In addition to the revenue lost by the \nFederal Government--funds that could be used for defending the \nhomeland, education, and protecting the environment--the proliferation \nof these schemes represents in Commissioner Rossotti's words ``a \nfailure of fairness to the millions of honest taxpayers whose \ncommitment to paying their taxes is based on the principle that the IRS \nwill act if they or their neighbors do not pay their fair share.''\n  This administration has been slow to embrace measures that crack down \non those who manipulate the Tax Code to\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\navoid paying their taxes. Despite the previous administration having \nidentified the proliferation of tax shelters as a large and growing \nproblem as far back as 2000, President Bush's initial budget contained \nno legislative recommendations to stem the proliferation of tax \nshelters.\n  Only after it became clear that Congress was going to address this \nissue, did the Bush Administration take notice. Even then, their \napproach to combating this problem was, at best, timid. The Bush \nadministration's solution was to continue to rely solely on the \nService's ability to detect an abusive tax shelter from within the \nminutiae of a taxpayer's tax return. If the Service was fortunate to \nuncover a tax shelter, it could then initiate steps to shut it down. \nThis is a difficult and time-consuming process for the IRS to \nundertake.\n  While disclosure of these schemes by taxpayers and promoters can be \nuseful in combating the proliferation of tax shelters, the IRS also \nneeds some additional tools. This is why the bill includes a statutory \nrequirement that transactions utilized by taxpayers have an economic \nrationale beyond the creation of tax benefits, commonly referred to as \nthe ``economic substance doctrine''. The bill backs up this new \nrequirement with stiff penalties for taxpayers who engage in such \ntransactions.\n  It is a simple requirement. You don't even need to be a tax attorney \nto understand it. Simply put, it would require that transactions \nconducted by taxpayers have a business purpose. What does that mean? \nThe proposal requires that a taxpayer have a reason other than the \ncreation of tax benefits for engaging in a transaction.\n  A cursory review of the recent Joint Committee on Taxation report on \nthe tax returns of Enron Corporation highlights the dire need for this \nlegislative change. The Joint Committee on Taxation found that Enron \npaid total federal income taxes for the period 1996 through 2001 of $63 \nmillion. During this same period Enron reported to investors that it \nhad profits of nearly $6 billion. How was Enron able to paint such \nobviously contrasting pictures?\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation's report, Enron \ntransformed its tax department from an administrative function to a \nprofit center. Enron spent millions of dollars on tax attorneys and \nshelter promoters who helped it cook up transactions that had no \npurpose other than to artificially reduce its tax liability.\n  According to the JCT Report, these transactions:\n\n       demonstrate the need for strong anti-avoidance rules to \n     combat tax-motivated transactions that might satisfy the \n     technical requirements of the tax statutes and administrative \n     rules, but that serve little or no purpose other than to \n     generate income tax or financial statement benefits.\n\n  This bill provides those strong anti-avoidance rules, and I hope they \nwill become law sooner rather than later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator Baucus for \nthe compliments he gave me. More importantly, it emphasizes, as I have \ntried to indicate, the great cooperation I have had from him. \nLegislation such as this has some controversial provisions in it, and \nyou don't get a piece of legislation such as this to the floor without \nthe bipartisan cooperation that has been exhibited. I thank him for \nthat.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 526\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a Managers' amendment)\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration. This is what is referred to as the managers' \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself and Mr. \n     Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 526.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 526) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have already complimented Senator \nSantorum and Senator Lieberman for their joint work on most of the \nprovisions of this legislation. I am happy to have Senator Santorum, \nwho is also a member of the Senate Finance Committee, manage a bill \nthat he has been central to getting those provisions into law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for his kind words and his \ncooperation. I thank the ranking member of the committee for his \ncooperation.\n  There are some things in this legislation that he is not particularly \nenamored with, but he was most cooperative and helpful in moving the \nlegislation forward. We are now at a point where we are within 24 hours \nof passing the legislation. Most of all, I thank my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, who has been a faithful partner--to use \na play on words--a faithful partner in putting this initiative \ntogether.\n  We have worked together closely with the President, who has been \ntruly the motivating force to try to provide some ammunition to the \narmies of compassion out there on the front lines every day, fighting \nfor hope and opportunity for the millions of Americans who have yet to \nrealize their dreams in dealing with the problems that confront them.\n  The President has, through his faith-based initiative, been very \nclear in the role of charitable organizations, particularly people of \nfaith within those organizations, to heal many of the ills that \nconfront society. We are a society that, while very prosperous by any \nmeasure, even at a time of economic downturn that we are experiencing \nright now, we are still the wealthiest country in the history of the \nworld. With that great wealth comes responsibility. So many people have \ntaken up that responsibility, trying to meet and serve those who in a \nsociety of great wealth have experienced a multitude of problems in \ntrying to achieve, both from the economic perspective but again, as I \nsaid before, pursuing their dreams.\n  This piece of legislation, while it is not everything the President \nrequested--it is not all of his faith-based initiative--certainly gets \nat one of the most important components which is the one funding \norganizations which do charitable purposes or have charitable purposes.\n  No. 2, there is a provision called the Compassionate Capital Fund \nwhich is grants to small organizations with less than six employees or \nless than $\\1/2\\ million in funding, to go out and be able to, for the \nfirst time, compete for Federal funds.\n  A lot of these small organizations, most of which are faith based in \nnature, have not been successful in applying for government grants \nprincipally because they don't have the resources or the expertise to \ndo so. When you are running a food pantry with one or two people, most \nof whom are part-time employees and many volunteers, you don't have the \nexpertise to apply for Federal grant dollars or any other kind of grant \ndollars. You try to do what you can to make ends meet. This provides \nthe kind of technical assistance necessary for a lot of smaller, mostly \ninner-city organizations that right now do not take advantage of the \nmoney available through the Federal Government, again, whether they are \nfaith based or not.\n  Most of these organizations are faith based in nature so there is a \nfaith component to this. As I will show later, many of the provisions \nin the act will have a disproportionate benefit to\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\ncharitable organizations which are faith based.\n  It doesn't accomplish a couple of the things the President set out to \ndo. The issue Senator Durbin spoke of earlier having to do with equal \ntreatment, even though it is not in this legislation, let me address it \nvery briefly and then maybe in more detail later on.\n  The whole concept of equal treatment is to allow those who have some \nelement of faith within their organization--and there is a whole range \nacross the charitable organization horizon. There is a whole range of \nfaith, how much faith is integrated into those organizations--some are, \nto use the term, ``saturated'' or completely faith based in nature and \nexpressively faith based in their programs, to the whole range of the \nother side which are those that are exclusively secular and even to \nsome degree hostile to faith. In between there are gradations.\n  What the President has tried to do is instead of, as we do right now, \nas we did prior to the 1996 welfare reform, which allowed for \ncharitable choice, in other words, for some government programs to go, \nthese dollars to go to faith organizations, we sort of eliminated all \nthese people of faith and all these organizations that have faith as a \ncomponent of their mission or their vision or their program and left it \nto a very rather narrow category.\n  We, in 1996, on the Senate floor, with President Clinton signing it, \nsaid we would stop that discrimination against people of faith who \nwanted to act based on their faith to help their fellow man, as long as \nthey didn't do certain things such as use it for faith worship or \nproselytizing, things that are not delivery of service.\n  We expanded greatly the range of faith organizations and nonfaith \norganizations. We expanded greatly those who can participate in \ngovernment funds. When you do that, you run into some problems, some \nquestions.\n  We have seen tremendous success and very few cases where problems \nhave arisen, but in the areas where they have, there have been \nquestions as to what government statutes apply, what provisions or \nregulations apply to faith organizations as opposed to nonfaith \norganizations.\n\n  One of the principal questions has to do with people's religious \nliberties and their ability to practice their faith bumping up against \nother rights. The one that the House of Representatives dealt with and \nthe Senator from Illinois referred to had to do with the issue of \nemployment and whether religious organizations which are provided with \ngovernment funds can say that someone cannot work for that organization \nor they can refuse to hire someone who works for that organization who \ndoesn't share that organization's values with respect to tenets and \nteaching of the faith which is expressed through their program.\n  One of the things I believe is essential to a lot of faith \norganizations, one of the reasons that faith organizations should be \nand need to be included in providing social services, is that a lot of \nthese faith-based organizations don't just treat the symptom. They \ndon't just treat the hunger, if it is someone who comes in for food \nassistance, or they don't just treat the dependency on drugs or \nalcohol, if someone comes in for addiction treatment. It doesn't just \ntreat the problem of a lack of a GED or education, if someone comes in \nfor education and training. What they do, because of their mission, \nthey treat the mind. They treat the spirit and they treat the emotional \nwell-being of this person. They treat the whole person. That is one of \nthe keys to success in trying to truly turn people's lives around in a \nway that brings them back into productive life in America.\n  The key to these faith organizations is having people who have this \nmission they share out there teaching and bringing people in based on a \ncertain core value structure. My argument is, we should not \ndiscriminate against people who have programs that are value laden--\nthose values may be based on Scripture, the Old or New Testament or \nsome other book--as opposed to saying we are going to discriminate \nagainst you because the values you have are based upon a religious \nbelief, as opposed to an organization that is secular and its values \nare not based on a religious belief. I don't understand the reason for \nthe discrimination. I don't believe it should exist.\n  I have had this discussion in brief, and we can talk more about it. I \nam sure we will. But having said all that, none of that is in this \nbill. We decided not to have this issue before us today because the \nneed of getting resources out to the charitable organizations meeting \nhuman service and educational and other needs is, frankly, too urgent.\n  While we will debate this--and I am sure others will want to debate \nthis issue--the true debate will wait for another day. That will be \nwhen the welfare reauthorization comes up. That is where this whole \nconversation of charitable choice and allowing faith-based providers to \nparticipate in government grants came about, back in 1996. And it is \nwhere we should continue that debate. I pledge to you that whether we \nget that bill or have that amendment in committee, or whether we bring \nit to the floor, this will be a topic of discussion and one I encourage \nall Members to think about and participate in.\n\n  But the charitable crisis is real, and that is why I agreed--and my \ncolleagues in the House have been more than cooperative in putting \ntogether, hopefully, a compromise we can quickly get to the President's \ndesk. We understand the crisis is real. Adjusted for inflation, \ncharitable giving 2 years ago, in 2001, was 2.3 percent lower than in \n2000. You have to remember at the end of 2001, unfortunately, we had to \ndeal with the aftermath of 9/11, where there was a tremendous \noutpouring of giving. Even with that outpouring of giving, because of \nthe sluggish economy, charitable giving fell again last year. Corporate \ngiving fell again between 2000 and 2001 by 14.5 percent.\n  Again, we don't have the final numbers for 2002, but it was supposed \nto be off again last year. We saw the American Red Cross--I'll give a \ncouple of examples. Their contributions declined anywhere from 20 to 60 \npercent; Salvation Army, off 5 to 10 percent; United Way, off 4 to 5 \npercent. We can go on and on. Colleges and universities saw a decline \nin the amount of charitable giving to their organizations, too.\n  So what we are doing is trying to respond in a comprehensive way. \nWhen I say that, I mean if you look at this bill, it is carefully \ncrafted to provide incentives for all different types of givers--\ncorporate, foundations, and individuals who don't itemize on their tax \nforms. By the way, if those with IRA rollovers want to give money to \ncharitable organizations, they can do so without having to pay taxes \nunder this legislation. So whether it is the small giver to, hopefully, \nthe retiree, or someone who has a large IRA, or corporations who may \nwant to give more money--all the way down the line to food donations, \nwhich is another area where the Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, \nhas a provision in this legislation that I think is very important, we \nhave a provision that will encourage literally billions of dollars of \nadditional food donations over the next several years by providing a \ntax incentive for corporations; but for the first time, partnerships, \nindividual proprietors, and S corporations will be able to take the \nfair market value of their donation as a deduction--it is up to twice \nthe cost of the basis of that food item--as a deduction for giving to \ncharitable purposes.\n  We have about a billion pounds of food donated right now to people in \nAmerica to help feed the hungry in America. It feeds about 26 million \npeople. There are 96 billion pounds of food wasted in America. That is \njust an enormous amount. It is almost incomprehensible that we are \ntalking about that amount. When you consider the fact that roughly 1 \nbillion pounds of food donated helps feed 26 million, can you imagine, \nif we just increase it by a very small percentage, the amount of \ndonated food there could be and how many people we could feed in \nAmerica?\n  Senator Lugar's legislation is included. We believe it will make a \ndramatic impact on hunger in America. There are a lot of other \nprovisions.\n  I see my colleague from Indiana, Mr. Bayh. I will be on the floor for \na while. I want to give him the opportunity to share with us some of \nthe things he has been active with. He has a provision in the \nlegislation he has shepherded through the process. I will have him talk \nabout that. He has also been a champion and strong supporter of this \nlegislation and the entire package from day one. I thank him for his \nsupport,\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\nand I appreciate him coming to the floor to talk about this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Indiana. I yield \nto him as much time as he may consume.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana for his \nleadership, his friendship, and his devotion to this issue. I have \nlistened with interest to his comments about the importance of ensuring \nthat the incentives in the bill actually increase the charitable \ngiving, as intended, and that we not inadvertently run a risk of lack \nof compliance. I concur with those sentiments and the need for a study \nto make sure we accomplish what it is we intend to accomplish.\n  I also want to begin by thanking our colleague from the State of \nPennsylvania. It is fair to say we would not be here today without \nSenator Santorum's leadership. He has been persistent and willing to \nstrike principled compromises. It has not always been easy, but it is \nto his credit in choosing to make progress rather than just having an \nissue. I thank him. Thanks to him, we are on the cusp of a significant \nbreakthrough with regard to doing some things that will, in fact, lead \nto better care for the American people.\n  To our other colleagues involved in the effort, including Senators \nLieberman, Nelson, Grassley, and my colleague from Indiana, Senator \nLugar, I salute them. I observe that at a time and in our body that is \ntoo often driven by politics and partisanship, this has truly been a \nbipartisan undertaking.\n  As I have observed before, just as faith can move mountains, perhaps \nit can also bring together Members of the Senate and span the political \ndivide that too often separates those of us on one side of the aisle \nfrom the other. That is a good thing that the debate has brought to the \nChamber--a greater sense of comity and devotion to progress and \nbipartisanship.\n  I reflect today, as our military men and women are in harm's way in \nIraq, on the fact that our country's greatest military strength lies \nnot in our weapons systems, not in the planes, the tanks, and the \nmissiles, as important as they are but, rather, in the character, the \nbravery, and the courage those men and women honor us by demonstrating \nin the defense of our national security interests--just so our greatest \nstrength domestically is not the financial markets we enjoy, not the \ntechnology or the factories, as important as they are to our \nprosperity. Instead, it is the innate goodness and spirit of the \nAmerican people. That is what we celebrate today, Mr. President. That \nis what we advance with this legislation, and that is why I am such a \nstrong supporter of the CARE Act. Through its provisions, we will \nenlist literally tens of millions of our fellow citizens in the urgent \ncause of making this country an even better place.\n  As my colleague mentioned, about 70 percent of American taxpayers \ncurrently do not itemize. The provisions of this legislation that will \nallow their charitable contributions to be tax deductible will enlist \nliterally tens of millions of our fellow citizens in philanthropy, \ncharity, good civic works, community level to address the urgent needs \nof our time: Homelessness, hunger, medical needs, fighting drug and \nalcohol abuse and addiction, teen and juvenile violence--these sorts of \nthings--helping to mend the social fabric that is in too great a risk \nthese days.\n  Very often, as my colleagues know, we get consumed in this Chamber in \ndebates not about whether these urgent tasks are being performed, but \ninstead about who is performing them. Mr. President, my strong sense of \nwhere the American people stand today, and my strong sense of where the \nSenate needs to stand today, is on the side of those who are getting \nthese works done, effectively addressing the needs of the American \npeople.\n  When it comes to housing the homeless, feeding the hungry, caring for \nthe sick and afflicted, it is more important these tasks are being \naccomplished in the most effective way rather than getting bogged down \ninto who is accomplishing it and exactly how.\n  We will enlist thousands of additional organizations, empower them, \nand increase their efforts--church groups, civic groups, other groups \ndedicated to doing good deeds, who enlist our citizens in the cause of \nnot only doing well but also accomplishing good, and that is vitally \nimportant for the future well-being of our great society.\n  There are two additional points I think should be remarked upon. \nSenator Santorum alluded to the first. It is the individual development \naccount provisions of this legislation. It involves a bringing together \nof the best thinking on both the left and the right. This provision \nwould empower those who are less fortunate in our society to get a \nstake in the American dream, a stake toward owning a first home, \nstarting a small business, going to college--the kinds of activities \nthat will lead to greater prosperity and progress for individuals who \ncurrently do not have much in the way of hope for either. It gives them \na property interest and a stake in the marketplace in which \ntraditionally those on the ideological right would have a greater \ninterest, but it focuses the property interest and the competitiveness \nin the marketplace on those who are less fortunate, giving them all an \nopportunity to make the most of their God-given talents, something that \nthose on the ideological left speak to with great fervor.\n  This is a provision that brings the best of thinking across the \nideological spectrum, regardless of ideology, to do what is right for \nthe American people. That is why it is a sensible and important step \nthat is included in this legislation.\n  There is something else in this legislation that is near and dear to \nmy heart. We have an outstanding example in my home State of Indiana. I \nknow my colleague from Pennsylvania has spent a great deal of time \nthinking about how to break the cycle of poverty. He has worked \nextensively in the area of welfare reform. As a matter of fact, to set \nan example for his colleagues of actually reaching out to individuals \nwho have been in the welfare system and not only moving them from \nwelfare to work, but moving them into jobs in his own office. I salute \nhim for that success. Again, it is an example we would all do well to \nemulate.\n  As the Senator from Pennsylvania knows well, we spend hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in this country dealing with the manifestations of \nwhat really are deeper underlying causes. If one looks at the causes of \nwelfare dependency, at the causes of juvenile violence, teen pregnancy, \nalcohol and drug abuse, educational and economic underperformance, all \ntoo often one will find the root causes of these manifestations and all \nthe expense we go to in how we treat our children.\n  There is an important provision in this legislation in this regard. \nIt deals with maternity homes. We have an outstanding example: Saint \nElizabeth's in Jeffersonville, IN, in Clark County. It is an \noutstanding example of how this money can be leveraged not only in \nhelping the teen mothers but in helping the children and, in so doing, \nhelping taxpayers and the rest of society.\n  Their experience indicates that 90 percent of these young women who \nare expectant mothers who have the benefits of the services of Saint \nElizabeth's go on to finish their high school education, to get a \ndiploma, to accomplish that first educational step on the ladder toward \na more successful life.\n\n  It is about the same percentage for their children. New babies are \nborn healthy rather than with serious health problems. And about the \nsame percentage of those new mothers do not go on to have additional \nchildren out of wedlock. So it is good for the mothers because they \nfinish their education, it is good for the children because they are \nborn healthy, and it is good for society because we deal with some of \nthe root causes of poverty, homelessness, teen violence, drug and \nalcohol addiction, and education underperformance, and in so doing, \nhelp society as a whole and the taxpayers in addressing these problems \nat the root cause, rather than waiting to address the symptoms, the \nmanifestations at a later stage.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleague. This legislation, frankly, \nhas been too long in coming, but here we are on the cusp of a great \nstep forward to make our Nation not only more prosperous, not only more \nsecure, but more decent, more compassionate, more just. That, at the \nend of the day,\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\nis the test of a great society and a great nation, measured not only by \nthe strength of our arms as being demonstrated abroad as we speak, not \nonly in the size of our gross domestic product, as important as that \nis, but in the opportunity and the decency we demonstrate to our fellow \ncitizens in the course of their daily lives and in our own.\n  For all those reasons, Mr. President, I count myself a strong \nsupporter of this legislation. I again thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania. Without his efforts, we would not be here. I thank those \non our side of the aisle who worked so hard on this legislation. I am \nhopeful that in short order we not only can pass this bill and send it \nto the President for signature, but, in so doing, help millions of our \nfellow citizens. I thank my colleagues for their time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for his \noverly kind words with respect to my participation in this legislation. \nThe Senator from Indiana has been truly one of the people out front and \nhas been very supportive. I cannot count the number of press \nconferences I have asked the Senator from Indiana to be at trying to \nkeep this ball rolling, and at times with a very busy schedule. He has \nalways found time to associate himself with this cause and to continue \nto make sure it was on track in a bipartisan way.\n  That is how we get things done around here. I am very happy to have \nhim as one of the prime cosponsors of this legislation. I again \nappreciate very much his kind words, but even more so appreciate his \ntremendous effort on making this legislation a reality.\n  I see the Senator from Rhode Island. If he is on a time schedule, I \nwill be happy to yield the floor to provide him an opportunity to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend Senators Grassley and Baucus for \nbringing this important legislation to the floor, but I particularly \ncommend and thank Senators Santorum and Lieberman for their principled \nand tireless efforts to bring this legislation to the floor and for \nrecognizing that original versions of this legislation contained \nelements that were, to say the least, controversial.\n  Senator Santorum particularly recognized the need to provide \nadditional resources to faith-based organizations and other charitable \norganizations through new incentives in the tax code to encourage \npeople to contribute to charities. All of these issues compelled him to \nmake a very difficult choice, a very important choice, and I think a \nvery statesmanlike choice to send to the floor today a version of the \nbill that I assume will get the unanimous approval of this Senate.\n  It recognizes our shared belief that the more resources we can direct \nto organizations that are committed to helping people, the better off \nwe will be. The increase in the social service block grant is a \ntremendous step forward and is something I know I am proud of, but \ncertainly the Senator from Pennsylvania has to be very proud of because \nhe is the principal architect of this effort, and the new tax \nadvantages also are very important.\n  Indeed, Senator Santorum and Senator Lieberman worked very hard to \nimprove legislation that in the other body was submitted as the \nCommunity Solutions Act of 2001, known as H.R. 7 in the 107th Congress. \nThat legislation contained a number of controversial and potentially \nunconstitutional provisions, but they worked very diligently, very \ncarefully, very thoughtfully to eliminate those provisions from their \nbill and ultimately today to bring this legislation to the floor, which \nI think and believe will get, as I said, unanimous approval by this \nbody. Certainly I approve of it.\n  The CARE Act is going to provide increased resources for needed \nsocial services, and it is going to do so without including at this \njuncture troubling provisions that were in the original House bill. I \nknow the Senator from Pennsylvania reserves his right to engage again \non this issue--in fact, I believe he will exercise his right in all \nforums, and that is the glory of this body, and we shall engage in more \nextended debate, I think, in the future. But this afternoon is an \nopportunity to commend him, thank him, and recognize his wise and \nstatesmanlike conduct. I again thank Senator Santorum.\n  The debate about church and state in this land precedes, indeed, the \nConstitution of the United States. It has been ongoing since the early \ndays of the American experience. Religion has been an important part of \nour national life throughout our history. Indeed, European immigration \nin large part was motivated by the search for an environment conducive \nto freedom of conscience and religious exercise unhampered by State \ninvolvement.\n  Today, in the year 2003, religion remains a vital force in our \nnational life and religiously affiliated institutions play a critical \nrole in the provision of social services. For example, in 1996, \nFederal, State, and local governments granted $1.3 billion to Catholic \nCharities USA, comprising 64 percent of its budget. In 1999, 53 percent \nof Catholic Charities' budget came from State and local governments, \nand an additional 9 percent came from the Federal Government.\n  In 2001, United Jewish Communities received a Federal grant of $59.8 \nmillion. If indirect payments were included--for example, Medicaid, \nMedicare, vouchers, or food stamps--the amount flowing through \nreligious organizations would be significantly higher.\n  Both of these mission-driven, faith-based groups are independently or \nseparately incorporated as nonprofits and both are able to distinguish \ntheir religious activities from their secular social services \nactivities.\n  So an initial point we must recognize in the debate about faith-based \ninitiatives is that it is not whether religious groups will or should \nplay a role in the spiritual and temporal lives of Americans--they do, \nand they will continue to do so--nor is the question about whether the \ngovernment discriminates against faith-based charitable groups. The \nquestion is how the important roles faith-based organizations play can \ncontinue to meet the constitutional requirement of separation between \nchurch and state, both as a matter of law and as wise public policy.\n  This constitutional standard has strengthened religion in America \ncompared to other countries around the world. We can see on the nightly \nnewscasts the effects of intolerance across the globe, of established \nreligions battling other beliefs. In America, we have been spared much \nof that. I believe it is directly attributable to the wise condition \nincluded in the First Amendment.\n  My awareness and sensitivity to these issues might spring in large \npart from my roots growing up in Rhode Island. As a child, I learned \nthe history of Roger Williams and the founding of the colony of Rhode \nIsland and Providence Plantation. Upon leaving the enforced orthodoxy \nof the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Roger Williams started a settlement \nthat ultimately became Rhode Island. This settlement was founded on his \nbelief, in his words: ``that no man should be molested for his \nconscience.''\n  The spirit of Roger Williams was captured by his contemporary, John \nClarke, in the petition for a new royal charter by the people of Rhode \nIsland in 1663. In his words, the people of Narragansett Bay:\n\n       have it much in their hearts, if they may be permitted, to \n     hold forth a lively experiment, that a flourishing and civil \n     state my stand, yea, and best be maintained. . . . with a \n     full liberty in religious commitments.\n\n  As a result of this religious liberty, Rhode Island became a refuge \nfor people persecuted for their religious beliefs elsewhere. And \nAnabaptists, Quakers, and Jews settled in Rhode Island because of its \ncommitment to religious liberty and tolerance.\n\n  This lively experiment became a model for the Founding Fathers and \nhelped lead to the drafting of the First Amendment: ``Congress shall \nmake no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the \nfree exercise thereof.''\n  In explaining what the First Amendment meant to the Danbury Baptist \nAssociation in 1802, Thomas Jefferson wrote that the combined effect of \nthe establishment and free exercise clauses of the Constitution was a \n``wall of separation between church and state.''\n  Jefferson's comments were not unique to him. Senator Durbin has \nalready made a reference to President\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\nJames Madison. President Madison what was meant by this separation of \nchurch and state extremely clear in several messages he delivered on \nGovernment funding of religious endeavors. In 1811, he vetoed a \ncongressional bill granting the use of some Federal land to a church in \nthe Mississippi territory. President Madison stated:\n\n       Because the bill in reserving a certain parcel of land in \n     the United States for the use of said Baptist Church \n     comprises a principle and precedent for the appropriation of \n     funds to the United States for the use and support of \n     religious societies, contrary to the article of the \n     Constitution which declares that ``Congress shall make no law \n     respecting a religious establishment''. . . Resolved. That \n     the said bill does not pass.\n\n  Indeed, I find it interesting that conservatives would so cavalierly \ndismiss so much of the history of this country and disregard so many of \nthe fundamental principles of the Founding Fathers. President Bush and \nhis conservative followers want to transform the relationship between \nchurch and state by directly funding pervasively sectarian \norganizations. He has done this by regulation and by Executive order, \nsince he has largely been unsuccessful in accomplishing these tasks \nthrough the legislative process.\n  Just consider some of the changes that he has advanced thus far. In a \nJune 2001 Department of Justice memorandum, the Department of Justice \ntook the legal position that faith-based organizations that are given \nFederal taxpayer dollars to run governmental programs should be able to \nengage in employment discrimination on the basis of religion. \nSubsequent to this memorandum, the President by Executive order \noverrode a rule first enunciated by President Franklin Roosevelt that \nthe Federal Government should not give contracts to employers who \nengage in discrimination on the basis of religion. Thus, it is now the \nposition of the White House that government contractors can \ndiscriminate.\n  The President believes the government should fund faith-based \norganizations who use proselytization and prayer to cure drug addiction \nand other social programs. In his State of the Union Address, President \nBush cited one such program in Louisiana that expressly combats drug \nabuse with faith. The head of another often-cited religious program, \nTeen Challenge, boasted to Congress that he was not only able to get \nkids to stop using drugs, he converted Jews into Christians in the \nprocess.\n  In newly proposed HUD regulations, the Administration says that \nFederal funds can be used to construct a religious building used for \nreligious activities if the building also can be used for a public \npurpose such as counseling or a food pantry. At least that is the \nproposal.\n\n  With these and other initiatives, the President is attempting to \nbreach the wall the Founding Fathers set up between church and state. \nThese initiatives are clearly designed to fund proselytization and to \npromote certain types of religion.\n  There are legal challenges being raised to many of these proposals. \nBut the long and short of it is, we have an opportunity to debate and \nto decide these issues through the legislative process, and we have an \nobligation to do so. And when there is a more robust, more extensive \nattempt to legislatively condone or sanction these faith-based \ninitiatives, I believe there are going to be three major areas we will \nneed to address.\n  One area is effective restraints on proselytization with taxpayer \nfunds. The second is compliance with local regulatory standards in the \ndelivery of public programs. And the third is prohibiting the use of \npublic funds in employment discrimination.\n  First, with respect to proselytization. If the separation of church \nand state means anything, then in my mind, it must mean that no \nAmerican should be compelled to pass a sectarian test or participate in \nsectarian exercises to receive a public benefit. This principle should \nbe included in legislation and not left to the more shifting sands of \nregulatory pronouncements.\n  Second, many advocates of faith-based initiatives argue that they \nsimply want a level playing field. Let's take them at their word. If \nState licensing arrangements are appropriate and necessary to protect \nchildren in publicly funded programs, why should religious providers be \nexempt from such licensing requirements? If we consider this issue, we \nwill need to look for the even application of local and state laws, \nparticularly laws with respect to the protection of children and public \nhealth. This is what we will need to do in order to truly create an \neven playing field.\n  Finally, we must address the issue of employment discrimination. \nTitle VII provides an exemption for religious groups in certain \nsituations. In the Amos case, the Supreme Court held that a religious \ngroup using its own funds may claim the Title VII exemption. In the \nwords of the Court, the purpose of the exemption was to alleviate \n``significant governmental interference with the ability of religious \norganizations to define and carry out their religious missions.''\n  Today, with respect to the Administration's proposal, we must \nrecognize that rather than seeking autonomy from governmental \ninterference, religious groups are seeking taxpayer funds to carry out \ngovernmental responsibilities. Indeed, in the one unreported case that \nhas ruled on the use of public funds in this way, the court, in this \nlabor case, concluded that the title VII exception does not apply.\n  As James Madison said in 1785, in his ``Memorial and Remonstrance \nAgainst Religious Assessments,'' in opposition to a proposal by Patrick \nHenry that all Virginians be taxed to support teachers of the Christian \nreligion:\n\n       If ``all men are by nature equally free and independent,'' \n     . . . above all are they to be considered as retaining an \n     ``equal title to the free exercise of Religion according to \n     the dictates of conscience.'' Whilst we assert for ourselves \n     a freedom to embrace, to profess and to observe the Religion \n     which we believe to be of divine origin, we cannot deny an \n     equal freedom to those whose minds have not yet yielded to \n     the evidence which has convinced us. If this freedom be \n     abused, it is an offense against God, not against man: To \n     God, therefore, not to man, must an account be rendered.\n\n  All of this leads me to my final point. In the words of the New \nEngland poet, Robert Frost, ``Good fences make good neighbors.'' What \nmight be permissible under the law does not always guarantee the wisest \npolicy.\n  We need to remember that as we debate the President's faith-based \ninitiative, religion has thrived in America because few people confuse \nreligion with government. Religion has been a citadel of conscience and \na check on government because it draws its strength and its support \nfrom its adherents, not from bureaucratic patrons.\n  The religious communities of America that have been unequivocally \nsupporting the President's attempts to allow discrimination with \nFederal dollars might be mindful of the old saying: Be careful of what \nyou pray for.\n  As the House of Representatives has made clear, we are going to be \ndiscussing this issue in the upcoming months on welfare, SAMSHA, \nNational Service, and other programs. It is my hope the Senate will \nundertake a more careful look at how the charitable choice provisions \nin these bills inhibit the free exercise of religion, rather than \nencourage it.\n  Again, I thank the sponsors and the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee for bringing this bill to the floor. This is \nsomething we will all support, and we will do so with the notion and \nthe idea and the commitment to provide resources for people who want to \nhelp other people, and do so consistent with the spirit and the letter \nof the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island \nfor his kind remarks with respect to the compromise that Senator \nLieberman and I have engaged in to move this legislation forward. I \nappreciate his support of this legislation, as I do that of all of my \ncolleagues.\n  As he stated, and he is correct, I do take issue with his perspective \non the issue of charitable choice and the funding--allowing of \ngovernment funds to be used by organizations that have some element of \nfaith within their structure, whether it has been the guiding \nprinciples of the organization or with the programs that they \nadminister.\n  I do not believe it violates the ``separation of church and state.'' \nI do believe organizations of faith should not\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\nbe discriminated against. We should not be in the business of just \nfunding a set of organizations that have no faith component in them at \nthe expense of those that do--for a lot of reasons, not the least of \nwhich is there is a lot of evidence out there, most of which is \nanecdotal I understand, but a growing body of evidence that \norganizations of faith are much more effective in dealing with \nproblems, particularly the more systemic problems that we have.\n  But I object to the underlying premise of this argument that somehow \nor another we are violating the Founding Fathers' understanding of the \nseparation of church and state.\n  I talk at a lot of schools. I ask kids: What words are in the \nConstitution, ``the free exercise of religion'' or ``separation of \nchurch and state''? Usually about 75 to 80 percent of the kids say, \n``separation of church and state'' is in the Constitution, which of \ncourse it is not.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island talked about the genesis of that in \nreferring to one of the Founding Fathers, referring to the \nestablishment clause as erecting a wall of separation between church \nand state. But what were they talking about? They were talking about \ncertainly the country from which they came, which was England, which \nhad an established church. The Government funded the church, as many \nEuropean countries did historically, for long periods of time. \nCertainly prior to the Reformation, the Catholic Church was intertwined \nvery much so with the state. After the Reformation, each reform church \nhad its own country and was funded in many cases.\n  People came to this country for religious freedom. They did not want \nan established religion. But even at the time in America there were \ncertain colonies that had affinities for different religions. Maryland, \nfor example--neighboring Maryland was considered more of a Catholic \ncolony. Pennsylvania was home to the Quakers--on down the line.\n  There was a concern that that could come over here to this country, \nso they put in this clause that we should not have an established \nreligion.\n  The difference is between the constitutional provisions that allow \nfor the free exercise of religion and the prohibition against the \nestablishment of religion. But this is really about freedom of \nreligion; in other words, to practice whatever religious tenets you \nwant and for the government not to get in your way in doing so.\n  What some are really arguing is freedom from religion, which I can \ntell you is completely antithetical to what our Founding Fathers \nbelieved.\n  We will have this debate. I am looking forward to it because I think \nit is important for the Senate, arguably the greatest deliberative body \nin the world, to talk about these important issues.\n\n  The role of faith in our society is central. It is central to the \nsuccess of America. One of the reasons we are a successful country is \nbecause we are a faith-filled country. One of the reasons we are a \nfaith-filled country is because we have a tremendous marketplace of \nideas, whether it is the street-corner preacher or the old church down \nthe street that has been there for centuries.\n  We have a marketplace of ideas of faith and that is what makes us: \nPeople out preaching the Word, talking about the values that faith \nimparts and the messages that faith imparts and its relevance to \npeople's lives.\n  Here is a statistic I just marvel over. There are more people who go \nto church in America over a weekend, church and synagogue and temple, \nthan to all the sporting events throughout the entire year in America. \nOn one weekend, more people go to their places of worship than to all \nthe sporting events that are held in America over the course of a year. \nThat is remarkable. It is a great thing about America. It is what makes \nus unique. It is because we have not established religion. But it is \nnot because we are saying people need to be free from religion. I think \nthat is one of the concerns I have with the tack that the Senator from \nRhode Island was taking.\n  Let me mention a couple of issues. Again, this is the beginning of a \ndebate that is not about this bill. I repeat, we have taken everything \nhaving to do with the concept of equal treatment out of this \nlegislation. We will save that debate for another day. But there are \nsome things in this legislation I would like to address very briefly.\n  I see the Senator from New Jersey. I will not keep him long.\n  One of the items I am most excited about in this legislation is a \nprovision called individual development accounts. Senator Lieberman and \nI and Senator Feinstein and many others, who have been advocates of \nthis legislation for quite some time, are very excited about it being \npart of this initiative. Individual development accounts are a matched \nsavings account for low-income and low- to moderate-income individuals \nwho will have an opportunity to put up to $500 a year into a savings \naccount and have that matched, dollar for dollar, up to $500. So it \nwill be $1,000 total.\n  It is an exciting opportunity for these individuals to be able to put \nmoney aside. For what? So they can put it aside for three reasons: to \nbuy a home, to get education, higher education, or, in some cases, \ntechnical training, vocational training, as well as start a small \nbusiness, start a business. So it is a way for people to save for \nevents in their lives that can transform their future economically: \nbetter education; a home, a place where they can save, invest, and \nbuild equity.\n\n  As everybody knows in this Chamber, the place where most people have \nthe bulk of their savings is in their home, in the equity they have in \ntheir home. So the opportunity for home ownership, and having that \nmoney for a downpayment, is so important. And IDAs create that \nopportunity.\n  And finally, for starting that small business, being that \nentrepreneur--that spirit really drives America and really is the \nladder of success so many people in America have access to--we want to \ncreate a nest egg for people to be able to buy that first piece of \nequipment. If you want to start a landscaping service, you can buy that \nlawn mower, you can buy the other tools you need to do that job, or a \nvariety of other interests people get engaged in as their first \nbusiness.\n  So we, Senator Lieberman and I, are very excited about this \nopportunity. We think it builds not just the opportunity for access to \nthe home or to the education or to that small business, but it builds \nthe virtue of deferred gratification. That is a virtue we sometimes do \nnot practice very much in America, but it is a virtue of delaying the \nexpenditure of that dollar, to put it aside, to save it for something \nthat is more important than what you immediately have before you. And \nwhen I am talking about gratification, I am not talking about luxuries. \nI am talking about maybe simple things, maybe very minor things in the \nlives of people who are low to moderate income. But deferring that to \nsomething that may be transformational in their lives is really \nsomething we should create incentives to do because, again, it helps \npeople move up that ladder of success in America.\n  I see a couple of my colleagues are in the Chamber. I am happy to \nyield the floor for their input.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from New Jersey yield for a consent \nrequest?\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 10 minutes, \nfollowing the Senator from New Jersey, to speak on the bill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reserving the right to object, I may have a Senator on \nthe way down to the Chamber who is trying to fit in here. How long is \nthe Senator from New Jersey going to speak?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Less than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Once again, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. \nAnd I assure my friend from North Dakota, although it is not my time to \ngive, I am happy he is going to be recognized.\n  Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes to talk about the \nlegislation before us, the CARE Act, and note its timeliness, because I \nthink fundamental to a lot of good ideas is the fact that it is time to \nencourage participation in the spirit of harmony and unity within our \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S4945]]\n\n  I have been struck by the fact I have not heard a call for either \nparticipation or voluntary--call it sacrifice, if you will, although \ncompared to what our young men and women are doing in Iraq, nothing we \nare going to do here looks like that much of a sacrifice--but it does \nshow good intent. To me, that is important.\n  So I am pleased the sponsors of this bill, Senators Lieberman and \nSantorum, have agreed to make this more palatable by removing \ncontroversial language that raised some constitutional and civil rights \nconcerns.\n  The bill contains several very good provisions, including changes to \nthe Tax Code we all hope will increase charitable giving and certainly \nencourage the spirit of charitable giving, as well as being an \nincentive.\n  In addition, the bill increases funding for the social services block \ngrant by over $1 billion. That will restore some of the cuts that have \nbeen made in the program over the years. This increase in the social \nservices block grant funding will benefit thousands of Americans who \nare suffering in this economy, who truly need help.\n  If the President's faith-based initiative means anything, then, \nobviously, this dedication of funding for charitable work by religious \nand secular charities confirms that is an appropriate thing to do; that \nis, to look to our charitable interests to firm up the fact we do feel \nsome commitment to commemorate the sacrifice that is being made by so \nmany.\n  If this funding disappears in conference, I think it would be tragic \nbecause it would say, OK, if it passes the Senate--and I certainly hope \nand believe it will--and then suddenly this mystery hole opens up \nbetween here and the House of Representatives--and these things often \nfall in it--then it is left to people who have a curiosity about what \nhappened, as they say, on the way to the other forum, when things just \ndisappear. But it is a convenient sleight of hand for those who really \ndon't want to support it but don't want to be identified with \nwithdrawing their support.\n  So even though this bill is silent on civil rights issues, the \nPresident's overall faith-based initiative contains some disturbing \ncivil rights problems. The President has announced several policies \nthat I think should trouble Americans who care deeply about civil \njustice and equality.\n\n  The President has issued an Executive order that authorizes \norganizations that receive Federal funding to discriminate in \nemployment--it is based on religion--for Government-funded positions. \nThat is not fair, it is not appropriate, and I certainly don't think it \nis appropriate for faith-based organizations.\n  A policy that says ``Catholics need not apply'' should never, ever be \nfunded by the Federal Government. If a religious group wants to \nrestrict employment with their own money, that is their business, but \nthey should not be able to discriminate in staffing up Government \nprograms paid for with public dollars, tax dollars.\n  The American people agree. A poll by the Pew Forum on Religion and \nPublic Life found that 78 percent of Americans oppose allowing \nreligious groups that receive Federal funding to discriminate in \nemployment.\n  And it is not merely a hypothetical problem. It is a real-life \nproblem.\n  In Georgia, a man named Alan Yorker sent his resume to a Government-\nfunded faith-based program for troubled youths. The position he sought \nwas paid for with taxpayer dollars. The faith-based group said they \nwere impressed with his resume and called him in for an interview. When \nMr. Yorker arrived, he was asked to fill out an application form. The \nform asked for the name of his church. He wrote in the name of his \nsynagogue. It also asked for the name of his pastor, and he filled in \nhis rabbi's name.\n  When he sat down for the interview, he was told, straight out, they \ndon't hire Jews. A former employee of the organization later told Mr. \nYorker they usually throw resumes with ``Jewish-sounding names'' in the \ntrash, but they did not recognize his last name as Jewish.\n  This was a taxpayer-funded job to perform social service work \npursuant to a Government program. And President Bush thinks maybe it is \nOK to deny someone employment because they are of a different \npersuasion.\n  The administration thinks it is fine for a Government-funded program \nto tell a Catholic or a Mormon they can't get a taxpayer-funded job \nsimply because of their religion. Well, I disagree. I think it is \nwrong. And I am going to join my colleagues, Senators Reed and Durbin, \nin fighting it during this session of Congress.\n  Again, I commend the sponsors of this legislation. The Senator from \nPennsylvania did a very good job, I believe, in developing this \nlegislation, for removing the controversial provisions from the bill \nbefore us.\n  I hope the bill will further the good work that faith-based and \nsecular charities do every day. While this bill moves in the right \ndirection, the administration is on, I believe, the wrong track \nregarding civil rights. I hope the President will reverse that course.\n  Mr. President, our faith should bring us together, not divide us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this is a good piece of legislation. I \nam pleased to rise in support and pleased particularly that it is \nbipartisan legislation that advances very important interests.\n  A wise old fellow from my small hometown once asked me if I had ever \nseen a U-Haul hooked up to a hearse. I said: No. He said: Well, it goes \nto show you, you can't take it with you.\n  He is right. You can't take it with you. The question is, What do you \ndo with the resources you develop over a lifetime? It seems to me you \nfind ways to help other people.\n  There is an old saying that we make a living by what we get but we \nmake a life by what we give. The issue of charitable giving and \nproviding nourishment and incentives to the notion of charitable giving \nis a very important impulse. This legislation advances that in a \nsignificant way.\n  Two years ago I introduced S. 1375, and then, in this Congress, S. \n283. I am pleased that these provisions were included in this \nlegislation by the Senate Finance Committee. Let me describe what they \nare and why they are so important.\n  The provisions in the CARE Act that relate to the legislation I have \nintroduced, with some of my colleagues, allow individuals to make tax-\nfree outright gifts to charities from their IRAs at age 70\\1/2\\ and \ncharitable life-income gifts at age 59\\1/2\\. The reason that is \nimportant--to be able to make tax-free gifts from IRAs to charities--is \nthey won't face adverse tax consequences when they rollover that money \nfrom their IRAs. The detrimental tax consequences have persuaded some \nthat they can't roll these assets over into a charity.\n  I heard from a good many charities, when I introduced this \nlegislation 2 years ago, that people frequently ask them about being \nable to give to a charity by using their IRAs to make the donation \nitself. But many donors decide not to make a gift from their IRA after \nthey are told about the potential tax consequences. Tax-free charitable \nIRA rollovers will eliminate this concern completely.\n  In his fiscal year 2004 budget, President Bush proposed allowing \nindividuals to make tax-free outright charitable IRA rollover \ndistributions after age 65. That proposal has a lot of merit. But the \napproach taken in the Public Good IRA Rollover Act, S. 283, and that's \nincluded in CARE Act, is superior because it will not only allow direct \ncharitable IRA rollovers, but it will allow tax-free life-income gifts \nfrom the IRA at age 59\\1/2\\. That means the assets can be donated to \nthe charities, but the donor retains an income stream from those \nassets. This approach would stimulate more charitable giving, while \ncomporting with the federal government's policy of encouraging \nindividuals to provide for and safeguard adequate resources after \nretirement. This is a very important provision that could put billions \nof dollars of additional dollars from a new source to work for the \npublic good.\n  I'm told that a senior Salvation Army official once said that \n``providing for IRA charitable rollovers would be the single most \nimportant piece of legislation in the history of public charitable \nsupport in this country.''\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\n  I don't think he necessarily understates the proposition. Charitable \ngiving is critically important. The mechanisms by which we incentivize \nand nurture charitable giving are in this legislation and will advance \nthe interests of charitable giving across the country.\n  Let me make another point. This legislation contains more than just \nthat provision. I single that provision out simply because I have been \nworking on it a couple of years.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of principally \nNorth Dakota organizations, 18 of them, that have been working with me \non this proposition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    North Dakota & Fargo-Moorhead Charities that Have Endorsed the \n                        Charitable IRA Rollover\n\n       1.

Prairie Public Broadcasting, Fargo, ND.\n       As of Monday, May 13, 2002.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. The provision in the CARE that deals with charitable \ndeductions for non-itemizers is also very important. All of this coming \ntogether is legislation I am proud to support. It is a significant step \nfor good.\n  Let me say one additional point. In order to pay for these \nproposals--and these proposals are paid for with a revenue portion of \nthe bill--there are additional curbs on tax shelters. I strongly \nsupport that as a matter of good tax policy. Last year, former IRS \nCommissioner Rossetti told Congress:\n\n       Nothing undermines confidence in the tax system more than \n     the impression that the average honest taxpayer has to pay \n     his or her taxes while more wealthy or unscrupulous taxpayers \n     are allowed to get away with not paying.\n\n  He is correct. What we have seen, with front-page stories in journals \nand technical publications, as well as major daily newspapers, is the \ngrowth of abusive tax shelters. Shutting those down makes a lot of \nsense. I don't believe that there is a provision in this bill that \ndeals with the issue of moving corporate headquarters overseas and \nrenouncing your U.S. citizenship in order to save on taxes. But that is \nanother piece we ought to do as well.\n  I simply make the point that the other piece of this bill that is \nimportant is we pay for this, and we pay for it with good tax policy by \ncurbing tax shelters.\n  There are a lot of things in this country that are done that make \npeople feel good. One of those is the charitable giving that Americans \ndo. Americans do a great deal of charitable giving. They do it because \nthey know there is a need, and they know people who need help can count \non others who will offer it. With respect to the provision I have been \nworking on, there is an impediment that has prevented people from \nsaying, I would like to roll over my IRA assets to a charity and \nprovide that charity with resources it needs. To do that under present \nlaw significantly penalizes them through the Tax Code. This legislation \nresponds to that.\n  Allen Huffman on my staff and others have worked together for a long \nwhile on this particular provision of the bill. There are other \nprovisions that have merit as well.\n  I thank the manager of the bill and the ranking member of the \ncommittee who bring it to the floor. When we pass this--and we will--it \nwill represent a significant positive step toward good public policy. I \nam pleased to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I congratulate Senators Santorum and \nLieberman and everybody else who has had a voice and hand in shaping \nand crafting the CARE legislation before us. It makes a significant \ncontribution to the strength of volunteer organizations and charitable \norganizations. It is a very significant contribution to that wonderful \ncause and to this wonderful land of ours. I commend them.\n  I would like to take a moment here to highlight a provision in the \nmanagers' amendment to strengthen the ability of the Securities and \nExchange Commission to detect, investigate, and punish violations of \nFederal securities law. This provision has been added to the CARE Act, \nbecause we have had the support and we have been able to utilize the \nefforts of the managers of this bill, Senators Grassley and Baucus, and \nof the chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senators \nShelby and Sarbanes. This is an effort that Senator Bill Nelson and I \nand others have been involved in for some time. Now it will come to \nfruition, at least in the Senate, tomorrow when we adopt this \nlegislation, including the managers' amendment.\n  I also thank the Securities and Exchange Commission for its \nassistance in crafting this legislation and for the agency's support of \nour efforts to enact it into law. Senator Bill Nelson and I and others \nhave been working on this addition to the SEC enforcement powers for a \nlong time. We are very grateful to all those who have worked with us, \nincluding Senators Corzine and Biden who cosponsored the SEC Civil \nEnforcement Act, S. 183, which we introduced earlier this year--in \nJanuary--which is identical to the language which is in the managers' \namendment.\n  The SEC Chairman, Bill Donaldson, is very supportive of our SEC \nenforcement legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nSEC Chairman supporting this provision and describing it as one that \nwill ``significantly supplement and strengthen the Commission's ongoing \nenforcement efforts'' be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   U.S. Securities\n\n\n                                      and Exchange Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Permanent Subcommittee on \n         Investigations, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I want to express my thanks for your \n     recent introduction of S. 183, your proposal to enhance the \n     Commission's authority to seek civil penalties for violations \n     of the Federal securities laws, increase the penalties the \n     Commission may seek, and eliminate a procedural requirement \n     that may slow the Commission's efforts to trace and recover \n     misappropriated investor funds.\n       I support this proposal, which was previously reflected in \n     a bill you introduced in the 107th Congress, to significantly \n     supplement and strengthen the Commission's ongoing \n     enforcement efforts. I very much appreciate your steadfast \n     dedication to supporting the work of the Commission in \n     protecting investors.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me or Stephen Cutler, \n     Director of the Division of Enforcement, at (202) 942-4500 if \n     we can be of any assistance in this regard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William H. Donaldson,\n                                                         Chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, here is a description of what the Levin-\nNelson provision would do.\n  First, the provision will grant the SEC administrative authority to \nimpose civil monetary fines on any person who violates Federal \nsecurities laws. Under current law, only broker-dealers, investment \nadvisers, and certain other persons are now subject to administrative \nfines by the SEC. Our legislation will allow the SEC to impose \nadministrative fines on anyone who violates Federal securities law, \nincluding, for example, corporate officers, directors, auditors, \nlawyers, or publicly traded companies, none of whom are now subject to \nbeing fined by the SEC in administrative proceedings. These fines, of \ncourse, would be subject to judicial review, as are all SEC \nadministrative determinations.\n  Last year, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I then \nchaired, conducted an extensive investigation into the collapse of \nEnron. As a result of that investigation, the Subcommittee determined \nthat Enron's board of directors and officers and certain major \nfinancial institutions assisted Enron in carrying out deceptive \naccounting transactions and other abuses that misled investors and \nanalysts about the company's finances.\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\n  The Subcommittee's last Enron hearing in December also highlighted \nthe fact that the SEC is in need of additional tools to deal with the \nindividuals and entities that participated in Enron's deceptive \naccounting or tax strategies. Our legislation would give to the SEC new \nauthority to impose an administrative fine on anyone who violates the \nFederal security laws--not just broker-dealers or investment advisers, \nbut also corporate directors or officers, employees, bankers, lawyers, \nauditors, law firms, accounting firms, corporations, financial \ninstitutions, partnerships, and trusts.\n  Second, the provision will significantly increase the maximum civil \nadministrative fine that the SEC is able to impose on persons who \nviolate Federal securities laws. The civil administrative fines that \nthe SEC is currently authorized to impose have statutory maximums that, \ndepending upon the nature of the securities law violation, range from a \nmaximum of $6,500 to a maximum of $600,000 per violation. Again, the \nparticular amount depends upon the nature of the violation. In a day \nand age when some CEOs make $100 million in a single year, and a \ncompany like Enron can report gross revenues of $100 billion in a \nsingle year, a civil fine with a maximum of $6,500 is laughable. Here \nis what one SEC staff stated about the current maximums in a document \ndated June 2002, and this explains why the agency is supporting our \nlegislation:\n\n       The current maximum penalty amounts may not have the \n     desired deterrent effect on an individual or corporate \n     violator. For example, an individual who commits a negligent \n     act is subject to a maximum penalty of $6,500 per violation. \n     This amount is so trivial it cannot possibly have a deterrent \n     effect on the violator.\n\n  Our provision would increase the civil fine maximums from a range of \na maximum of $6,500 to a maximum of $600,000 per violation, depending \non the nature of the securities law violation, to a range that goes \nfrom a maximum of $100,000 to a maximum of $2 million per violation. At \na time when we are seeing corporate restatements and misconduct \ninvolving billions of dollars, these larger fines are critical if the \nfines are to have an effective deterrent or punitive impact on \nwrongdoers.\n  Third, the Levin-Nelson provision would grant the SEC new \nadministrative authority, when the SEC has opened an official SEC \ninvestigation, to subpoena financial records from a financial \ninstitution without having to notify the subject that such a records \nrequest has been made, thereby bringing the SEC's subpoena authority \ninto alignment with the subpoena authority of Federal banking agencies \nlike the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency. This authority would allow the SEC to trace funds, evaluate \nfinancial transactions, and analyze financial relationships without \nhaving to alert the subject of an investigation to the SEC's inquiry. \nUnder current law, the SEC either has to give the subject advance \nnotice of the subpoena or spend precious time seeking to obtain a court \norder to delay notification.\n  Cases we are seeing today involve allegations of persons using \noffshore accounts to move millions of dollars or engage in complex \ntransactions that materially affect the financial statements and tax \nreturns of publicly traded companies in the United States. The SEC must \nbe able to look at financial records quickly without giving the subject \nof the inquiry an opportunity to move funds, change accounts, or \nfurther muddy the investigative waters.\n  This authority is particularly important in light of the Patriot Act \nof 2001, which for the first time requires securities firms to detect \nand report possible money laundering through U.S. securities accounts. \nThe SEC cannot be expected to effectively monitor these anti-money \nlaundering efforts or act quickly to trace possible terrorist financing \nor other suspicious financial conduct if, as is the case now, the SEC \nmust provide advance notice to investigative subjects or obtain court \norders granting delayed notification. No Federal banking agency \noperates under these types of constraints in its anti-money laundering \nefforts, and there is no reason why the SEC should. Our provision would \nmodernize the SEC's oversight authority and bring it into alignment \nwith the Federal banking agencies.\n  Last year, the Sarbanes-Oxley law strengthened law enforcement and \nstiffened penalties for Federal securities crimes. By enacting the \nLevin-Nelson provision this year, Congress would help put some teeth \ninto SEC enforcement on the civil side. We originally offered this \nlegislation as an amendment to the Senate bill that resulted in the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act, but were unable to obtain a vote before time ran \nout. That is why we are back.\n  Investor confidence in U.S. capital markets has not been fully \nrestored, and Congress needs to provide strong leadership to assure \nU.S. investors that their interests are protected. A vigorous SEC that \ncan act quickly to impose civil fines on those who violate Federal \nsecurities laws can help restore investor confidence in the \neffectiveness of U.S. securities laws and capital markets. In addition, \nsince many securities violations warrant civil rather than criminal \ntreatment, strengthening the SEC's civil enforcement authority would \nhelp streamline the available civil enforcement options and give the \nSEC better tools to fashion appropriate civil penalties.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for supporting this provision.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nformer Chairman of the SEC, Harvey Pitt, dated August 30, 2002, also \nendorsing this legislation be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               U.S. Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 30, 2002.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin: This letter responds to your letter of \n     August 9th, seeking my views on your proposal to enhance the \n     Commissions' authority to seek civil penalties for violations \n     of the federal securities laws, increase the penalties the \n     Commission may seek, and eliminate a procedural requirement \n     that may slow the Commission's efforts to trace and recover \n     misappropriated investor funds.\n       The three additional enforcement tools you contemplate \n     reflect recommendations we have made previously in an effort \n     to facilitate our goal of achieving ``real-time \n     enforcement.'' Especially in light of recent events, I \n     believe these proposals would enhance our efforts and the \n     interest of investors. As you know, during this Congressional \n     session, with the bipartisan support of Congress and the \n     Administration, the Commission already has been given, and \n     has begun to implement, greater authority to pursue and \n     punish corporate wrongdoers and enhance corporate \n     accountability. The additional authority about which you \n     inquire would be a welcome addition to our enforcement \n     arsenal, if the proposals achieve bipartisan support.\n       Again, thank you for your interest in strengthening \n     penalties for securities fraud violations. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact me or Stephen Cutler, Director of the \n     Division of Enforcement, at (202) 942-4500 if we can be of \n     further assistance.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                   Harvey L. Pitt.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank the managers and all the other \npersons who worked with us to get this legislation included in the \nmanagers' amendment and, hopefully, passed tomorrow.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I rise in support of the Levin-Nelson \nprovision included in the managers' amendment to the CARE Act of 2003. \nThis provision, the SEC Civil Enforcement Act, will strengthen the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission's authority to prosecute securities \nfraud violations and augment investor protection. Senator Levin is to \nbe commended for his unwavering advocacy on behalf of investors and his \nrole in ensuring that our capital markets retain their reputation as \nbeing the fairest, most efficient, and most transparent in the world.\n  The Levin-Nelson provision has the full support of the SEC Chairman, \nWilliam Donaldson, and it has been supported by the full Commission and \nby former SEC Chairman, Harvey Pitt, who remarked that this provision \nwould promote the SEC's goal of achieving ``real-time enforcement.'' \nThe legislation has been sought by the SEC's Enforcement Division \nbecause it will eliminate inefficiency, provide the SEC with additional \nflexibility, and strengthen the Commission's ability to hold securities \nlaw violators accountable for their actions.\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\n  The SEC Civil Enforcement Act effectively complements the statutory \nframework created by the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor \nProtection Act of 2002--the ``Sarbanes-Oxley Act.'' Against the \nbackdrop of a series of corporate scandals and a severe drop in \ninvestor confidence last year, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act sought to take \nsteps to ensure investors that corporate executives and financial \nreports are trustworthy, accountants and analysts independent, and that \nthe SEC has adequate resources and enforcement authority to fulfill its \nmandate.\n  In its continuing, ``real-time'' investigation into accounting \nirregularities at HealthSouth Corp., the Commission has put these new \npowers to work. As The Wall Street Journal of April 4 noted, ``the \nHealthSouth inquiry has already netted eight criminal convictions, \naccomplishing in just weeks what might have stretched across months or \neven years in the past.''\n  The Levin-Nelson provision will significantly buttress the SEC's \nenforcement efforts in this area. I urge enactment of the provision to \nfurther protect securities investors and help assure the U.S. capital \nmarkets remain the envy of the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the CARE \nAct. I rise to speak in favor of the Charity Aid Recovery and \nEmpowerment Act, or the CARE Act.\n  As the Senate is considering this legislation, it is important to \nremember both Republicans and Democrats have cosponsored the CARE Act. \nThis reflects the bipartisan spirit of this legislation which out of \nthis legislative caldron was created by compromise, and we had last \nyear as the goal of increasing charitable giving and helping the needy.\n\n  In light of the uncertain economy, charities across the Nation are \nserving the needs of more people with fewer resources. This particular \nlegislation is an opportunity to encourage Americans to help their \nneighbors, community, and their country by giving. By extending the \ncharitable contribution deduction for 86 million Americans who do not \nitemize their tax returns, and allowing people to make charitable \ncontributions from their individual development accounts, IDAs, this \nlegislation creates incentives for giving to charity.\n  This legislation also provides an enhanced charitable deduction for \nrestaurants and businesses that make donations of food to charitable \norganizations. For some two decades, my wife Grace and I have been \nworking with organizations to distribute food to the hungry. One such \norganization is back in our State of Florida. It is actually a part of \nour State Department of Agriculture. Its name is Farm Share. What it \noperates on is the original concept of gleaning, which was a biblical \nconcept. In biblical times it was their social security system. When \nthe farmers would go in and harvest the field, they would leave the \nrest of the crop so that then the poor people could come into the field \nand harvest the remaining crop, called gleaning; that was their way to \nsupport those least fortunate in the society of the day.\n  When you take that ancient concept and bring it forward to today, \nlook at all the crops that are wasted. So this concept of Farm Share, a \npart of our State Department of Agriculture, although not going \ndirectly into the field, what we find is enormous amounts of edible \nfood wasted in the distribution process--in the collection, in the \nactual harvesting, then at the packinghouse and the rest of the \ndistribution process.\n  So what Farm Share does is go to the packinghouse where tomatoes, for \nexample, a winter crop in south Florida, might have a blemish on them. \nThey are completely edible, but they might not be marketable for that \nparticular company buying those tomatoes. Or a company that uses a lot \nof tomatoes, such as McDonald's Corporation, wants a tomato of a \ncertain size. So the tomatoes that are not that size are discarded. But \nit is good food that is going to waste. It is a form of gleaning, to \nsave that, to have it packaged, and then ready for distribution.\n  When my wife and I announce a distribution and we reach out to all \nthe soup kitchens and reach out to the churches that are so effective \nthroughout the communities in distributing food to the poor, when we \nsend word out that the next morning there is going to be a distribution \nof food, and you arrive the next morning, there is a lump in your \nthroat to suddenly see the lines of hundreds of hungry people in \nAmerica; that they are so grateful, so orderly, so polite, and so \nthankful for the food that is going to be distributed.\n  It is not unusual I would come as a cosponsor of this act and be very \nthankful that the Senate is considering it. It looks as if we have our \ndifferences worked out, and we are going to be able to pass it. This \nnew legislation is more than just tax provisions. Individual \ndevelopment accounts are also expanded in this legislation. These IDAs \nare special savings accounts that offer matching contributions from \nparticipating banks or community organizations. This innovative program \nencourages low-income families to build assets and proposes reduced \ncosts for banks and community organizations that offer the IDAs.\n\n  This legislation also increases the funding for the social services \nblock grant. That supplies States with resources to support a variety \nof social services. These funds can be used to assist the elderly and \ndisabled so they do not need to enter institutions. Those funds can \nalso be used to prevent child and elder abuse and to prevent things \nthat go on that we read about in the newspaper that we shudder at in \nregard to the care of our elderly. These funds can be used to provide \nchild care, to promote and support adoption, and many other purposes.\n  By creating tax incentives for charitable contributions we can help \nsupport and give incentives to the natural instincts of the American \npeople, which are to be generous, to give. When they do, faith-based \nand community organizations can pass on the gains to a community.\n  We know that faith-based groups are doing good work all over the \ncountry, and their work is already being funded by Federal dollars \nbecause they are running programs that work to better people's lives. \nThese faith-based groups operate soup kitchens, they run homeless \nshelters, and they rehabilitate drug users. Our Nation already funds \nmany of these programs. I have seen these programs all over Florida. I \nhave seen them here in Washington, DC. Anyone would be amazed just a \nstone's throw from where we are in the U.S. Capitol at the kinds of \nprograms going on in the inner city to feed the poor and minister to \nthe least privileged in society.\n  Lives have been changed. I have seen cities, particularly the inner \ncities, being transformed from neglect to respect.\n  This legislation is all about grassroots change, change from the \nground up, by people who are close to the problems and who care enough \nto take up the challenge.\n  I have cosponsored this legislation before. I am going to continue to \nwork with our colleagues to try to find ways to help those who help \nothers.\n  This is one way. As we have been considering this emergency funding \nbill that we just passed and that is now in the conference committee, I \nthank the Senate for increasing the food aid. Back earlier when we were \nconsidering legislation, the task fell to me to increase the \nappropriation with regard to food aid, particularly destined for \nAfrica, where they are experiencing another enormous drought which has \ncaused a great deal of famine and death. The United States is a \ngenerous country. So, too, from our generosity, when we see a problem \nsuch as that, we want to try to take care of it.\n  We passed a level of increased food aid here at $500 million. It was \nwatered down in conference to $250 million. A lot of that money was \nsquirreled away from Africa to meet the food needs there will be in \nIraq. Because of that, a few nights ago on this floor we agreed to an \namendment to the emergency\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\nsupplemental appropriations bill that would have an additional $600 \nmillion to go for emergency food assistance. That will then be able to \nget to Africa with all of its famine that is ravaging the land.\n  It is my hope, as the Appropriations Committees are meeting in \nconference right now on the emergency supplemental to determine the \nfinal outcome, that they will honor all those images they have seen on \ntelevision of starving children and they will not reduce that $600 \nmillion very much.\n  It is with this spirit of thanks, of humility, and thanksgiving that \nI come to speak on behalf of this legislation and to thank the Senate \nand the many participants here who have worked out all the kinks in \nthis legislation so we could pass it in a unanimous fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to call the attention of \nthe Senate to the important events happening right now in the island \nnation of Cuba. Over the past several weeks, Fidel Castro has been \nrounding up democracy activists, independent journalists, librarians, \nand signers of the Varela Project and throwing them in jail.\n  Fidel Castro has used the world's focus on the war in Iraq to divert \nattention in order for him to brutally crack down and further oppress \nCubans who yearn for freedom. It has been difficult to get the exact \nnumber, but we think it is approximately 80 Cubans who have been \narrested. Yesterday, a number of those activists who had been arrested \nwere sentenced to terms of 15 to 25 years--if you can believe that--on \ncharges of ``undermining the socialist state.'' It is reported that at \nleast 11 of those could get life sentences, and at least one could get \nthe death penalty.\n  I take the floor of the Senate to call to its attention that last \nnight the Senate passed S. Res. 97, a resolution introduced by this \nSenator from Florida and cosponsored by the junior Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Allen. The resolution passed the Senate unanimously. It \ncondemns these actions, and it calls for the release of the prisoners \nof conscience in Cuba.\n  Why did the Senate want to take a stand, and why do we want to bring \nfurther attention to this other than has already been in the Nation's \nnewspapers, pointing out that under the cloak of the world's attention \nbeing diverted to Iraq, Fidel Castro has started this crackdown and \nthese arrests and these sentences, even possibly a death sentence? \nWell, it goes back to the fact that the Cuban Government does not like \nthe world's attention that has been brought to the courageous 11,000 \npeople who signed the petition under the Cuban law--the Cuban \nConstitution--which said that if at least 10,000 people sign a \npetition, the issues in that petition are then brought to the national \nassembly for action. Not only did 10,000 brave, courageous Cuban souls \nsign that petition, but over 11,000 did. It called for actions that you \nand I take for granted.\n  It called for freedom of speech, freedom of the press, release of \npolitical prisoners, and a free enterprise economy. It called for them \nto be brought before the Cuban National Assembly.\n  The Varela Project embodies the principles upon which all the world \nagrees: the right of the Cuban people to petition their government for \ncivil and human rights, including free and fair elections.\n  The leader of this project, Oswaldo Paya, has continued to advance \nthis important project at great risk to himself, his family, and his \nassociates.\n  In May of 2002, Oswaldo Paya led a group of Cuban citizens who \ndelivered exactly 11,020 verified signatures to the Cuban National \nAssembly supporting that referendum on civil liberties and all of the \nissues I have mentioned.\n  These are basic rights to which anyone is entitled. Recent reports \nindicate that the Varela network has been especially targeted in this \ncrackdown by Fidel Castro. I take us back to last year, realizing the \ncourageous effort by Senor Paya and the signers of that petition.\n  I sponsored and this Senate adopted the resolution 87 to 0, with the \nhelp of other supporters of the resolution, Senator Dodd and Senator \nHelms. That resolution commended the Varela Project and Oswaldo Paya. \nIt was an early step to providing international attention and support \nto Mr. Paya and those who signed on to the Varela Project.\n  The resolution that was adopted last year 87 to 0 was obviously \nbipartisan, and the resolution that was just adopted last night is \nsimilarly bipartisan and builds on that previous consensus and \nhighlights that upon which we can all agree. What is that?\n  The resolution that was adopted last night condemns the recent arrest \nand other intimidation tactics against democracy activists by the \nCastro regime, and it calls on the Cuban Government to immediately \nrelease those imprisoned during the most recent crackdown for the acts \nthat the Government of Cuba wrongly deems ``subversive, counter \nrevolutionary, and provocative.''\n  The resolution adopted last night also reaffirms S. Res. 272, the \nVarela Project resolution, that the Senate unanimously agreed upon last \nyear, which calls for, among other things, amnesty for all political \nprisoners. The resolution we adopted last night praises the bravery of \nthose Cubans who, because they had simply practiced free speech and \nsigned the Varela Project petition, have now been targeted in this most \nrecent government crackdown.\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\n  The resolution we adopted last night urges the President to demand \nthe immediate release of all the prisoners and to take all appropriate \nsteps to secure their immediate release.\n  I wish to say this to those with whom we have contact from time to \ntime representing the Cuban Government: We in the Senate are watching. \nWe are not going to let Fidel Castro get away with these kinds of \nactions. And we are going to keep the glare of the public spotlight and \nthe glare of world view in the international community on this kind of \nthuggery. We are going to call him to account in the name of human \ndignity and freedom because even in Cuba people are endowed by their \nCreator with certain unalienable rights, among these life, liberty, and \nthe pursuit of happiness.\n  I specifically thank our Foreign Relations Committee which absolutely \nwhizzed this resolution through the committee, our committee chairman, \nSenator Lugar, and our ranking member, Senator Biden. I thank the \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Coleman. I thank my cosponsor, Senator \nAllen. I thank our ranking member of the Western Hemisphere \nSubcommittee, Senator Dodd. All of them gave the green light and \nspeeded this process.\n  I am going to continue to seek common ground with my colleagues as we \nseek to support the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom. I hope \nwith this resolution having just been adopted that the administration \nwill pursue a similar resolution of condemnation in the United Nations, \nand that the administration will seek immediate international support \nto secure the release of these and all freedom-loving Cubans who have \nbeen wrongly jailed because it is only through the constant and \nsustained recognition of this issue that our chances will be improved \nof creating forces of change on that long-suffering island.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida is still in the Chamber, I wish to thank him for his \nimpassioned comments. I am going to be speaking later this week on this \nsame subject. I am one who, for a number of reasons--geopolitically, \nstrategically, and economically--have not supported the current embargo \non Cuba. I am, however--and I feel proud--as Vermonters say, I bow to \nnobody on the question of human rights on this floor.\n  I met with Mr. Castro in Havana a couple years ago at a time when \nthere was another crackdown of dissidents. I told him specifically what \nI felt about that in very strong words. He obviously disagreed with me, \nbut I felt as an American in Cuba, it would be wrong for me not to \nexpress such a view.\n  I will follow with a speech later this week on Cuba, but I hope my \ngood friend from Florida, who has been such an extraordinary leader in \nthis area over the years, when he was in State government in Florida, \nwhen he was in the House of Representatives, and as a Senator--he has \nbeen such an extraordinary leader. I hope he knows, no matter how one \nmight feel about our overall relations with Cuba, no American should \nfind justifiable the silence of those who simply wish to speak to basic \nhuman freedoms, basic human rights--the right of speech, the right of \nreligion. These are issues that, from the time of Thomas Jefferson, \nBenjamin Franklin, John Adams, and George Washington, we have \nenunciated in this country, but I do not know any country that can \nclaim any form of democracy and freedom that would feel that way. I \ncommend my friend. I hope others will listen to him. I hope 90 miles \nfrom his home State that it will be heard as strongly as it was heard \non the floor of the Senate. I commend him.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to say how much I \nappreciate the comments of the Senator. Here is a great example of two \nSenators representing two different parts of the country, at the end of \nthe day, we have the same conclusion--what we want is freedom for that \nisland. That island is the jewel of the Caribbean. Once freedom comes \nto that island, it will economically blossom and prosper. That island \nhas so much rich history and such a beautiful culture.\n\n  The Senator has pointed out that although we might have a difference \nof opinion about topics such as an economic embargo, at the end of the \nday what we earnestly want is change. We want the winds of change to \nblow, and blow very hard and rapidly so that freedom can come to Cuba.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4950-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

An Arab-American man was attacked in the bathroom of a \nsupermarket by one of the store's employees. The teenage attacker \ncalled the man an ``Arab terrorist'' before slamming his head into the \nsteel door of the men's room. The victim was knocked unconscious for a \nbrief time and, when he left the lavatory, his assailant and several \nother employees laughed at him and refused him any aid.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4950-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4950-S4952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORLD HEALTH DAY\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, since 1948 the nations of the world have \ncelebrated April 7 as World Health Day. Yesterday marked this day, \nwhich serves two important and related purposes. It focuses world \nattention on a specific international health issue that in the judgment \nof the World Health Organization, WHO, poses immediate and urgent \nproblems. Further, it is a platform for marshaling resources to address \nthis issue, through programs that will continue long after the day \nends.\n  In years past World Health Day has focused on such crucial matters as \nthe global eradication of polio and emerging infectious diseases. This \nyear's theme is broad: ``Healthy Environments for Children,'' and it \nhas never been more timely. While we have made great progress in the \ntreatment of infant diarrhea, typhoid, typhus, cholera, yellow fever, \nmalaria, dengue fever, and other environment-based diseases, access to \ntreatment is limited or nonexistent in many parts of the world. As a \nresult, every year more than 5 million children--the most vulnerable \nmembers of society--die before reaching the age of 14. When war or \ncivil conflict disrupts life, the danger of infection rises, as it does \namong those living in refugee camps. But there is no escaping the risk \nanywhere that water is contaminated, food unsafe, air polluted, and \nsanitation systems unreliable. Children fall ill in the very places \nwhere they live.\n  From our experience in treating infant diarrhea we know that \ntreatment can be effective and efficient. Every year, 1.3 million \nchildren die of diarrhea often resulting from lack of access to safe \ndrinking water or consuming dirty food. These deaths are preventable. \nIf a child has diarrhea, a simple and effective sugar-and-salt solution \ncalled oral rehydration can treat severe loss of fluids in the body. \nThe cost is minimal: just under 30 cents per child--this low-technology \nsolution can save these children's lives. This year's World Health Day \nis a call to redouble our efforts not only to treat environment-based \ndiseases where they occur, but especially to eliminate the conditions \nwhere they are bred. It can be done.\n  As the grave respiratory infection known as severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome, or SARS, appears to be spreading rapidly, World Health Day is \nalso an appropriate time to consider the vital role that the World \nHealth Organization plays in our interconnected world, where mobility \nliterally gives wings to life-threatening diseases. Today's New York \nTimes documents the\n\n[[Page S4951]]\n\nspread of SARS, under a headline reading ``Fear Reigns as Dangerous \nMystery Illness Spreads.'' SARS apparently first appeared in China last \nNovember. In February, when the Chinese Government began reporting \ncases to WHO, the organization undertook a major international tracking \neffort, and on March 15 WHO took what the New York Times describes as \n``the highly unusual step of issuing the global health alert.'' Just \nlast week the Chinese Government permitted a WHO team to begin work on \nlocation, in the southern Chinese city of Guanzhou, where the infection \nrate is very high. WHO has also created a network of infections-disease \nlaboratories in countries around the globe, and the truly extraordinary \nwork undertaken in these laboratories has led to the tentative \nidentification of the infectious agent. This marks a tremendous step in \ndealing with the intensifying threat to world health that SARS poses. \nAccording to the New York Times, SARS ``has become an international \nepidemic,'' and WHO is instrumental in organizing the international \nresponse.\n  It is not just that WHO provides the administrative framework for a \ncoordinated response to health issues; its personnel are on the front \nlines in every effort to keep diseases from spreading and in treating \nthe victims. For the most part we do not know their names, but we do \nknow that they have dedicated their skill and even their lives to WHO's \nmission.\n  A WHO physician--Dr. Carlo Urbani, Director of Infectious Diseases in \nthe Western Pacific Region for WHO--was the first to recognize SARS as \na new and deadly disease. He threw himself into the fight to control \nthe disease when he saw his first case, in Vietnam, persuading the \ngovernment to adopt infection-control and isolation procedures. He is \ncredited, said the New York Times, with ``shutting down Vietnam's first \noutbreak,'' and he was the first to alert the international medical \ncommunity to the danger. Within weeks of his first intervention with a \npatient, however, he was infected. His heroic efforts cost him his \nlife.\n  Dr. Urbani's medical specialty was worms--nematodes, trematodes, \nhookworms and other parasites, which are, in the words of his WHO \ncolleague, Dr. Kevin Palmer, ``a really basic problem for every child \nin the tropics.'' He knew how much damage these parasites do, and also \nhow relatively little it would take to eliminate this scourge: a 3-cent \npill given twice yearly to schoolchildren. His own efforts fell \nsquarely within the broader campaign to create ``healthy environments \nfor children.'' At the time of his death he was working to secure the \ncooperation of school systems throughout southeastern Asia.\n  An eloquent account of Dr. Urbani's career in medicine and his \ntragic, too-early death appears in the today's edition of the New York \nTimes. I ask unanimous consent to have the entire story, ``Disease's \nPioneer Is Mourned as a Victim,'' printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. SARS is only the most recent of the many international \nhealth emergencies that WHO has faced. In the complex effort to reduce \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS, WHO also plays an important part. It is \nestimated that of the roughly 750,000 new HIV cases in children each \nyear, more than 400,000 could be prevented by treating the most common \nroute of infection, mother-to-child transmission, (MTCT). As in the \ncase of infant diarrhea, we know that simple, cheap and effective \ninterventions are available. The drug nevirapine, for example, reduces \nthe likelihood of transmission of HIV from a mother to her newborn by \nup to 47 percent. It is administered in a single dose to the mother at \nthe onset of labor and in a single dose to the baby in its first 3 days \nafter delivery. The intervention costs less than $4, and the drug is \nnow available at minimal or no cost in most countries where poverty \nlevels are high and resources scarce. The use of nevirapine to address \nMTCT is based on the work and recommendations from WHO.\n  There is hardly any country, no matter how well guarded its borders, \nwhich can be confident of remaining immune from the urgent health \nproblems that beset the world. In fact, for more than half a century \nthe World Health Organization has served us well. Most recently, as \nSARS has spread WHO has stepped into the breach, collecting and \ndisseminating information and facilitating an international response. \nIn oral rehydration and MTCT projects, we have seen how effectively WHO \ncan intervene. We must respond vigorously, therefore, as WHO calls on \nus on World Health Day 2003 to confront and vanquish the environmental \ncauses that bring unnecessary illness and death to millions of the \nworld's children every year. WHO is working to turn this year's \ninitiative into an effective global alliance, to bring to local \ncommunities the resources necessary to raise the health standards of \nchildren most at risk, and thereby transform their lives. The benefits \nfrom these efforts will surely ripple outwards: to families, to \ncommunities, and indirectly to us all. By supporting WHO we can, and we \nshould, make a difference.\n\n               [From The New York Times, April 8, 2003.]\n\n                Disease's Pioneer Is Mourned as a Victim\n\n                       (By Donald G. McNeil, Jr.)\n\n       When the microbe that causes severe acute respiratory \n     syndrome is finally isolated, some people will know what to \n     call it. They want a Latin variation on Carlo Urbani's name.\n       If SARS was an infectious cloud blowing out of southern \n     China, Dr. Urbani was the canary in its path. Working in a \n     hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam, as a mysterious pneumonia felled \n     one nurse after another, he sang out the first warning of the \n     danger, saw the world awaken to his call--and then died.\n       If not for the intuition of Dr. Urbani, director of \n     infectious diseases for the Western Pacific Region of the \n     World Health Organization, the disease would have spread \n     farther and faster than it has, public health officials \n     around the world say.\n       It was a tricky call. There is nothing as telltale about \n     the disease as the bleeding of a hemorrhagic fever or the \n     bumps of a pox, and its symptoms mimic other respiratory \n     conditions.\n       Dr. Urbani, 46, died on March 29, a month after seeing his \n     first case and 18 days after realizing he was coming down \n     with the symptoms himself.\n       ``Carlo's death was the most coherent and eloquent epilogue \n     his life could produce,'' said Nicoletta Dentico, a friend \n     from the Italian chapter of Medecins Sans Frontieres, or \n     Doctors Without Borders, which Dr. Urbani once headed. ``His \n     death was as a giver of new life.''\n       And it was in keeping with his medical philosophy. When Dr. \n     Urbani spoke in 1999 at the ceremony in which Doctors Without \n     Borders accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, he described doctors' \n     duty ``to stay close to the victims.'' ``It's possible to \n     study an epidemic with a computer or to go to patients and \n     see how it is in them,'' said Dr. William Claus, the group's \n     emergency coordinator for Asia. ``Carlo was in the second \n     category.''\n       In Italy, he had pushed the organization into working with \n     the poorest of the poor, with Gypsies in Rome and with \n     African and Albanian boat people who were landing in Sicily \n     and Calabria.\n       Even as a student, said Fabio Badiali, a childhood friend \n     who is now mayor of Castelplanio, their hometown on the \n     Adriatic Coast, he had been a volunteer, organizing groups to \n     take the handicapped on countryside picnics. As a family \n     doctor, he had taken vacations in Africa, traveling with a \n     backpack full of medicine.\n       He had accepted the W.H.O. post, friends said, because he \n     wanted to be back in the third world and working with \n     patients. It was that instinct that took him to the bedside \n     of Johnny Chen, an American businessman who entered Vietnam-\n     France Hospital in Hanoi on Feb. 26 with flulike symptoms.\n       Dr. Urbani might not have been an obvious choice as a \n     consultant in Mr. Chen's case. In his heart, friends said, he \n     was ``a worm guy,'' a specialist in parasites.\n       ``Other people didn't think worms were sexy,'' said Dr. \n     Kevin L. Palmer, W.H.O.'s regional specialist in parasitic \n     diseases and a friend. ``but it's a really basic problem for \n     every child in the tropics.''\n       Dr. Urbani was an expert in Schistosoma mekongi in Vietnam, \n     in the food-borne nematodes and trematodes of Laos and \n     Cambodia and the hookworms of the Maldives.\n       Dr. Lorenzo Savioli, who worked with Dr. Urbani in the \n     Maldives, said they worked from sunup to sundown, ignoring \n     the famous beaches and reefs, tracking hookworm epidemiology \n     and training workers at a malaria control laboratory, who \n     were used to working with blood, in testing for worms. Over \n     rice and fish in the evenings, Dr. Savioli said, they had \n     joked, ``Nobody at headquarters was going to believe we were \n     spending our days in the Maldives over fecal samples.''\n       Dr. Urbani was a worm zealot, Dr. Palmer said, because they \n     did so much damage but could be so easily treated. For \n     example, he said, a 3-cent pill administered to \n     schoolchildren twice a year could rid them of most intestinal \n     worms. Dr. Urbani was working to have school systems in \n     southeastern Asia cooperate.\n       He also attacked a worm that lived on fish farms. He could \n     not get Cambodians and Laotians to give up eating undercooked \n     fish,\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\n     Dr. Palmer said, but he hoped to solve the problem by \n     teaching fish farmers to divert sewage from their ponds.\n       He was also testing the use of a veterinary drug to kill \n     worm larvae that can reach human brains and cause seizures.\n       And, said Daniel Berman, a director of the Doctors Without \n     Borders campaign for cheaper lifesaving drugs, Dr. Urbani was \n     pushing Vietnamese farmers to grow more sweet wormwood, a \n     plant that can produce artemisinin, a new malaria cure.\n       Still, when a troublesome case turned up in Hanoi, Dr. \n     Palmer said, the W.H.O. staff usually said, ``Call Carlo,'' \n     because he was also known as an expert clinical \n     diagnostician.\n       Mr. Chen was such a case, suffering with pneumonia and \n     fever, as well as a dry cough. The hospital suspected that he \n     had the Asian ``bird flu'' that killed six people in 1997 and \n     was stopped by rigid quarantines and the slaughter of \n     millions of chickens and ducks.\n       Rumors of a mysterious pneumonia had been coming out of the \n     Guangdong region of southern China, but the Chinese \n     authorities had been close lipped, even instructing local \n     reporters to ignore it.\n       Although no one then realized the significance, Mr. Chen, \n     48, had also stayed in the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong. He \n     may have picked up the disease from a 64-year-old Guangdong \n     doctor in town for a wedding, staying in Room 911. \n     Investigators theorize that the doctor infected 12 other \n     guests, several from the same floor, who carried the disease \n     to Singapore, Toronto and elsewhere.\n       By the time Dr. Urbani arrived at Vietnam-France Hospital, \n     the microbe that Mr. Chen carried was spreading. Before he \n     died, he infected 80 people, including more than half of the \n     health workers who cared for him. The virulence of his case \n     alarmed world health officials, helping lead to the \n     extraordinary health alert that W.H.O. issued on March 15. \n     But Dr. Urbani, who first saw Mr. Chen in late February, \n     quickly recognized that the disease was highly contagious and \n     began instituting anti-infection procedures like high-filter \n     masks and double-gowning, which are not routine in \n     impoverished Vietnam. Then he called public health \n     authorities.\n       Dr. Palmer recalled Dr. Urbani's conversation: ``I have a \n     hospital full of crying nurses. People are running and \n     screaming and totally scared. We don't know what it is, but \n     it's not flu.''\n       On March 9, Dr. Urbani and Dr. Pascale Brudon, the W.H.O. \n     director in Hanoi, met for four hours with officials at the \n     Vietnam Health Ministry, trying to explain the danger and the \n     need to isolate patients and screen travelers, despite the \n     possible damage to its economy and image.\n       ``That took a lot of guts,'' Dr. Palmer said. ``He's a \n     foreigner telling the Vietnamese that it looks bad. But he \n     had a lot of credibility with the government people, and he \n     was a pretty gregarious kind of character.'' With dozens of \n     workers at the hospital sick, it was quarantined on March 11. \n     Infection-control practices were instituted at other \n     hospitals, including the large Bach Mai state hospital, where \n     Dr. Claus of Doctors Without Borders oversaw them. Dr. \n     Urbani's quick action was later credited with shutting down \n     Vietnam's first outbreak.\n       In the middle of it, Dr. Savioli said, Dr. Urbani had an \n     argument with his wife, Giuliani Chiorrini. She questioned \n     the wisdom of the father of three children ages 4 to 17 \n     treating such sick patients. Dr. Savioli said Dr. Urbani \n     replied: ``If I can't work in such situations, what am I here \n     for? Answering e-mails, going to cocktail parties and pushing \n     paper?'' In an interview with an Italian newspaper, Ms. \n     Chiorrini said her husband knew the risks. ``He said he had \n     done it other times,'' she recalled, ``that there was no need \n     to be selfish, that we must think of others.''\n       But on March 11, as he headed to Bangkok for a conference \n     on deworming schoolchildren, he started feeling feverish and \n     called Dr. Brudon. ``He was exhausted, and I was sure it was \n     because he had had a lot of stress,'' Dr. Brudon said later. \n     ``I said, `Just go.' ``But she had second thoughts. ``I \n     called my colleagues in Bangkok and said, `Carlo doesn't feel \n     well, and we should be careful.' ''\n       Dr. Scott Dowell, a disease tracker for the federal Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention, who is based in Thailand, \n     met him at the Bangkok airport near midnight. Dr. Urbani, \n     looking grim, waved him back. They sat in chairs eight feet \n     apart until an ambulance arrived 90 minutes later, its \n     frightened attendants having stopped for protective gear.\n       For the first week in a Bangkok hospital, Dr. Urbani's \n     fever receded, and he felt a bit better. But he knew the \n     signs. ``I talked to him twice,'' Dr. Palmer said. ``He said, \n     `I'm scared.' ''\n       That was uncharacteristic for a man who was known as big, \n     charming and full of ironic wit. In Italy, he staved off \n     boredom by hang gliding. In Hanoi, he negotiated the insane \n     traffic on a motorcycle and took his children on overnight \n     car jaunts to rural villages. He carried Bach sheet music and \n     stopped at churches, asking if he could play. W.H.O. experts \n     flew in from Australia and Germany to help. One scoured \n     Australian drug companies for ribavirin, a toxic antiviral \n     drug that was said to have helped some cases. It did not help \n     Dr. Urbani, though, and was withdrawn.\n       Then patches showed up on a lung X-ray, and he told his \n     wife to take the children and return to Castelplanio. \n     Instead, she sent them ahead and flew to Bangkok. By the time \n     she arrived, his room had been jury-rigged as an isolation \n     ward. Carpenters had put up double walls of glass, and fans \n     had been placed in the window to force air outside.\n       The couple could talk only by intercom, and Ms. Chiorrini \n     saw him conscious just once. As his lungs weakened, Dr. \n     Palmer said, he was put on a respirator. In a conscious \n     moment, Dr. Urbani asked for a priest to give him the last \n     rites and, according to the Italian Embassy in Bangkok, said \n     he wanted his lung tissue saved for science.\n       As fluid filled his lungs, he was put on a powerful \n     ventilator, sedated with morphine. The end came at 11:45 on a \n     Saturday morning. Doctors and nurses heavily shrouded in \n     anti-infection gear pounded on his chest as his heart stopped \n     four times, Dr. Dowell said, but it was useless.\n       Most of those who had died of SARS were old or had some \n     underlying condition that weakened them, but ``he worked with \n     patients for weeks, and we suspect he got such a massive dose \n     that he didn't have a chance,'' Dr. Palmer said. ``It's very \n     sad,'' Dr. Claus said, ``that to raise awareness as he did, \n     you have to pay such a price.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4952-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4952-S4953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOREIGN AGRICULTURE SERVICE\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, fifty years ago, President Eisenhower and \nSecretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson had the foresight to \nacknowledge that the future of American agriculture was dependent on \nthe development of creative marketing tools and foreign markets for \nU.S. food and agricultural products. With that in mind, the Foreign \nAgricultural Service, FAS, was created to represent American \nagricultural interests worldwide.\n  During the past 50 years, the employees of FAS, working in \ncoordination with partners in the agricultural community and other U.S. \ninternational agencies, have crafted important tools and programs to \ndevelop and expand foreign markets.\n  Recognizing the ever changing global economy, FAS has effectively \ndeveloped the necessary resources to negotiate trade agreements, open \nand maintain foreign markets, and address international food crises and \ndevelopment needs.\n  Today, exports of American food and agricultural products have grown \nfrom less than $3 billion in 1953 to over $50 billion, experiencing a \ntrade surplus year after year.\n  The realities of today's global marketplace, as well as the \nchallenges facing American agricultural producers abroad, make the \nmission and continued success of the Foreign Agriculture Service more \nimportant than ever.\n  Therefore I rise today to submit resolution to congratulate the \nForeign Agriculture Service on the 50th anniversary of its creation, \nand commend its dedicated employees for helping to create benefits for \nAmerican farmers and ranchers by expanding global markets and reducing \nbarriers to free trade.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in recognition of the 50th anniversary of \nthe Foreign Agriculture Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture \non March 10, Senator Cochran and I are today submitting Senate \nresolution to honor that agency's many achievements over the past half \ncentury.\n  During the 83d Congress, President Eisenhower recognized that the \nproductive capacity of the U.S. agricultural sector was outstripping \nthe food and feed needs of our domestic economy. In order to assist \nAmerican farmers and exporters in identifying, capturing, and \nmaintaining overseas markets for our food and fiber, and thus boost the \nsector's earnings, Secretary Ezra Taft Benson established the Foreign \nAgriculture Service, FAS, by memorandum on March 10, 1953. The next \nyear with the passage of the Agriculture Act of 1954, P.L. 83-690, \nagricultural attaches were transferred from the State Department to the \nnew agency.\n  The mission of FAS is to serve U.S. agriculture's international \ninterest by expanding export opportunities for U.S. agricultural, \naquaculture, and forest products and promoting world food security. \nSince its inception, the agency has assisted in expanding U.S. \nagricultural exports from less than $3 billion in 1953 to projected \nexports valued at $57 billion for 2003, in nominal dollars.\n  In addition to providing in-country services and market analysis for \nthe key importing countries in the agricultural attache corps, FAS, \nthrough\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\nheadquarters staff, conducts trade and food aid programs and works with \nstaff from other USDA agencies to analyze world market trends. While \nthe agency is not solely responsible for our large gains in exports \nover the past five decades, no one could argue it has not provided a \ncrucial assistance in that effort. I salute the work of past and \npresent FAS employees and look forward to their contributions in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4953-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       POLITICAL REFORM IN EGYPT\n\n  Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed in the human \nrights record of Burma. Throughout my time in the Senate, I have \nconsistently been critical of political and human rights abuses in \nBurma. I have been deeply troubled by reports, confirmed by the U.S. \nDepartment of State, that Burmese soldiers have systematically raped \nShan women on a massive scale. I am also concerned about repeated \ncharges of forced labor, the suppression of civil liberties, and \nwidespread political repression. Recent events in Burma only serve to \nheighten my concern.\n  I am concerned by the recent decision by United Nations human rights \nenvoy Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, to suspend his missions to Burma after \nfinding a hidden listening device in a room where he was interviewing \npolitical prisoners. The incident raises very serious concerns about \nthe depth of Burma's commitment to improving conditions within its \nborders. I am also concerned about the case of Dr. Salai Tun Than, an \nalumnus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was arrested and \nsentenced in November 2001 after conducting a solitary protest of \npolitical conditions in front of Rangoon City Hall.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I will \ncontinue to monitor human rights in Burma, as I have on human rights \nall over the world. Finally, I would like to offer my praise for \nstudents at several University of Wisconsin campuses who are working to \nhighlight conditions in Burma. I am impressed by their dedication and \nheartened by their commitment to justice and freedom for the Burmese \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4953-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      GRANTING CITIZENSHIP TO IMMIGRANT SOLDIERS WHO DIE IN COMBAT\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues \nthe story of one of my Georgia constituents. It begins with a brave \nyoung 3rd Infantry soldier named Diego Rincon.\n  Diego was a native of Colombia and he came to the United States in \n1989 with his family when he was 5 years old. He enjoyed a life of \nfreedom and safety that might not have been possible in Colombia.\n  Diego was extremely loyal to the country that welcomed him. And after \nthe September 11 attacks, he decided it was time to repay his adopted \nNation.\n  Upon graduation from Salem High School in Conyers, GA, Diego enlisted \nin the Army. He became a member of the ``Rock of the Marne,'' Fort \nStewart's 3rd Infantry Division.\n  Sadly, Private First Class Rincon was killed March 29 in Iraq by a \nsuicide bomber at a military checkpoint. Diego was 19 years old. Three \nother members of his 1st Brigade were also killed.\n  In late February, Diego wrote his final letter home to his mother \njust as his Brigade was getting ready to move out. Let me read just a \nlittle of that letter:\n\n       So I guess the time has finally come for us to see what we \n     are made of, who will crack when the stress level rises and \n     who will be calm all the way through it. Only time will tell.\n       I try not to think of what may happen in the future, but I \n     can't stand seeing it in my eyes. There's going to be \n     murders, funerals and tears rolling down everybody's eyes. \n     But the only thing I can say is, keep my head up and try to \n     keep the faith and pray for better days. All this will pass. \n     I believe God has a path for me.\n       Whether I make it or not, it's all part of the plan. It \n     can't be changed, only completed.\n\n  This 19-year-old was wise beyond his years.\n  Diego joined the Army for the noblest of reasons. He fought and died \nin Iraq while defending our Nation's freedom.\n  And after his death, his family asked one last request of the \nGovernment in return for their son's life--to be able to bury him this \nThursday as a U.S. citizen.\n  I am very pleased and proud to announce today that--with the help of \nthe INS--Private First Class Diego Rincon has been awarded U.S. \ncitizenship. This brave soldier will be buried Thursday as a citizen of \nour great country.\n  But there are thousands of noncitizens fighting in our military right \nnow.\n  So, I, along with my fellow senator from Georgia, Senator Chambliss, \nhave introduced legislation calling for citizenship to be granted \nimmediately to any soldier who fights in our armed services and dies in \ncombat.\n  For those among our troops who are not citizens and who die on the \nbattlefield, I believe the least we can do is to honor them with \nposthumous citizenship.\n  And I believe it should be done automatically by the Government, with \nno delay and no burden on the families.\n  Under our bill, the families of these brave soldiers would not have \nto fill out any forms or make any phone calls.\n  This citizenship would apply only to the deceased soldier and it \nwould not make the soldier's family eligible for any extra benefits or \nspecial treatment.\n  It is simply a final gesture of thanks and gratitude for the ultimate \nsacrifice these immigrant soldiers have made for their adopted country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4953-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4953-S4954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JOHN AND SARA BURCHARD\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Drs. \nJohn and Sara Burchard of Burlington, VT as this year's joint \nrecipients of the Kids on the Block--Vermont ``Puppets' Choice Award.'' \nThis award is conferred annually by Kids on the Block--Vermont, a \ntheatrical troupe, part of a national organization, which performs with \npuppets to deliver messages of personal safety, diversity, and \nacceptance of disabilities. As honorees, John and Sara are acknowledged \nfor their outstanding contributions to children and families statewide.\n  Since their arrival in Vermont in 1970, John and Sara, both long-time \nprofessors of psychology at the University of Vermont, have worked \ntirelessly to improve children's care and families' strength. \nDescribing their contributions as ``outstanding'' is an understatement. \nProfessionally and personally, John and Sara have passionately \ndedicated themselves to making Vermont's communities better.\n  John's academic and professional life has focused on children who \nsuffer from emotional and behavioral problems, for whom he has helped \ndevelop new methods of care. One example of John's innovation is the \n``wrap-around'' approach, bringing care and services to the families, \nrather than relying on clinics. John also served on the Burlington \nSchool Commission and, during the late Richard Snelling's terms as \nGovernor, as Commissioner of the Department of Social and \nRehabilitation Services.\n  Sara's specialty lies with children and adults with developmental \ndisabilities. Sara was an important voice of\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\nreason when she led efforts to enable Vermont to become the first state \nto close its institutions for the mentally retarded. Helping those with \ndisabilities receive the care they need and deserve has been Sara's \ncalling, and her efforts have been nationally recognized for \nexcellence.\n  As professors, John and Sara have taught and mentored generations of \nstudents who have become compassionate and effective leaders who work \nwith and advocate for the developmentally disabled, children, and their \nfamilies. Their influence extends will beyond their classrooms and \ntheir State, making people's lives healthier and more productive.\n  Again, I wish Drs. John and Sara Burchard congratulations and my \nsincerest best wishes. Their tireless work is helping to make Vermont \nthe kind of place that Vermonters are proud to call home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4954-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING EAST BRUNSWICK HIGH SCHOOL'S SUCCESS IN ``WE THE PEOPLE'' \n                                PROGRAM\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Such a title was earned by Mr. Hirsh's plethora of \ndonations to various charity organizations, his service during World \nWar II in the United States Navy, and his formation of twelve kosher \nkitchens for Jewish seniors in the Los Angeles area.\n  In addition to his dedication to philanthropy, Mr. Hirsh sought to \npositively affect Arab-Israeli relations. In the early nineties, Mr. \nHirsh and his family formed the Hirsh Family Early Childhood \nDevelopment Center in Tel Aviv.\n  While no single accomplishment defined Mr. Hirsh, his friends \nremember him as an altruistic man who was steadfast in his leadership. \nFriend and Congressman Howard L. Berman recalled Hirsh as ``a real \ngeneralist, interested in matters of the greater community.''\n  Mr. Hirsh's dedication to community service is evidenced by his stint \nas president at the Jewish Federation, and in the mid 1980s, he chaired \nthe United Jewish Fund General Campaign. Interestingly, Mr. Hirsh was \nthe greatest contributor to the campaign.\n  Mr. Hirsh owned the Cooper Building in downtown Los Angeles and was a \nformer chairman of the Community Redevelopment Agency in the city of \nLos Angeles.\n  Employees of Mr. Hirsh at the Jewish Journal remember him as being \nobsessed with fair and balanced reporting. Editor-in-Chief of the \nperiodical, Robert Eshman, said that the paper grew ``significantly'' \nunder Stanley's leadership.\n  People of Stanley Hirsh's caliber do not come very often and while \nhis accomplishments still resonate, and his warmth and kindness \nhonored, Mr. Hirsh will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4954-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4954-S4955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1055.

A bill to support certain housing proposals in the fiscal \nyear 2003 budget for the Federal Government, including the downpayment \nassistance initiative under the HOME Investment Partnership Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American \nDream Downpayment Act. I am pleased to have Senator Sessions join me in \nintroducing this bill.\n  Homeownership has long been the American dream, and we are incredibly \nfortunate that in America more and more families have been able to \nachieve the dream of homeownership. In fact, right now more American \nfamilies own their home than ever before, and that number continues to \nincrease.\n  However, for some working families, low income families, women-headed \nhouseholds, minority families, urban dwellers, and young families the \ndream of homeownership remains elusive.\n  This is particularly true for minority families. While Americans \nenjoy the world's greatest opportunities for becoming homeowners, only \n47 percent of African-American and Hispanic families own their homes, \nas compared to 75 percent of white families.\n  We must eliminate this gap in homeownership, so I am pleased to join \nwith President Bush and Secretary Martinez in the initiative to create \n5.5 million new minority homeowner families by the end of the decade.\n  One key component of this initiative is the American Dream \nDownpayment Initiative, which I am pleased to introduced today in the \nSenate. This bill will provide $200 million annually to State and local \ngovernments for downpayment assistance programs.\n  One of the greatest barriers for families in becoming homeowners is \ntheir inability to afford the downpayment requirements and closing \ncosts. These are hard working families that can make mortgage payments, \nthey simply need assistance with the downpayment and closing costs.\n  The American Dream Downpayment Initiative will create 40,000 new \nhomeowners each year, focusing on low-income and first-time homebuyers. \nAnd because the initiative will be administered through HUD's existing \nHOME program, it will minimize bureaucracy and duplication while \nmaximizing flexibility for local jurisdictions.\n  Homeownership has many benefits for cities, neighborhood, and \nfamilies. In fact, a study released by the Homeownership Alliance \nrevealed that children living in an owned home scored nine percent \nhigher on math tests and seven percent higher in reading achievement.\n  Homeownership has the power to transform individual lives and to\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\nstrengthen entire communities. Increasing homeownership, particularly \namong minorities, is a top goal for me.\n  The $200 million for the American Dream Downpayment Fund will help \nmake that dream come true for more American families.\n  I look forward to the opportunity to working with my colleagues to \nget the American Dream Downpayment Initiative enacted into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 811\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 16131 of title 10, United States \nCode, to increase rates of educational assistance under the program of \neducational assistance for members of the Selected Reserve; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, at a time when our men and women in \nuniform are fighting valiantly to bring peace and opportunity to an \noppressed people and ensure the security of our homeland, I am pleased \nto introduce the Selected Reserve Educational Assistance Act of 2003 to \nextend the opportunity of higher education to many of those very same \nmen and women in uniform. This legislation provides our National Guard \nand Reserve personnel, hundreds of thousands of whom are currently \nmobilized, deployed, and fighting around the globe, with educational \nopportunities as intended by the Montgomery GI bill. I am pleased that \nmy colleagues, Senators Tom Daschle, Tim Johnson, and Bill Nelson, have \njoined as cosponsors.\n  Through this legislation, we week to promote both service to country \nand education in a way that is both logical and fair. Members of our \nNational Guard and Reserve are members of our communities. The skills \nthey learn from military service are reflected in the positions of \nleadership they assume among us. These citizen-soldiers have \ndemonstrated their commitment to serve and as members of the ``total \nforce'' deserve opportunities to further improve themselves through the \ncivilian educational opportunities the Montgomery GI bill promotes. \nService and education are prerequisites of a strong, vibrant democracy. \nThis legislation seeks to further this combined effort.\n  The original GI bill, known as the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, was \nenacted in 1944. That bill provided a $500 annual education stipend as \nwell as a $50 subsistence allowance. As a result of this initiative, \n7.8 million World War II veterans were able to take advantage of post-\nservice education and training opportunities, including more than 2.2 \nmillion veterans who went on to college. My own father was among those \nveterans who volunteered for the war, fought bravely, and then returned \nto college with assistance from the GI bill.\n  Since the 1940's various versions of servicemen's education \nassistance have allowed millions of veterans to take advantage of \neducational opportunities. Over time, however, inflation and the \nescalating costs of higher education have eroded the value of those \neducational benefits. During the 107th Congress with the enactment of \nPublic Law 107-103 Senator Johnson and I, along with many of our \ncolleagues, made great strides returning value to educational \nassistance benefits available for active component service members and \nveterans. More remains to be done.\n\n  The United States military is an all volunteer force. In times of \npeace and prosperity and in times of trial, we rely on young men and \nwomen to come forward of their own accord to stand up for our \ncollective defense. Though service to country and patriotism, \nparticularly in times of crisis, factor into recruiting this all \nvolunteer force, benefits still do and ought to matter. We must remain \nvigilant, as we are constantly recruiting new members of our armed \nforces, ensuring the benefits these individuals receive from military \nservice are commensurate with the service they render to this nation.\n  At its inception in 1985, the Reserve Montgomery GI bill program, had \nbeen pegged at 47 percent of basic active component Montgomery GI bill \nbenefits. During the ensuing 18 years, the parity of the reserve \nprogram with its active duty counterpart has slipped. At present the \nChapter 1606 program, Selected Reserve Montgomery GI bill, is only \nabout 28 percent of the Chapter 30 program. This legislation attempts \nto bring the reserve program back in line with the active component \nbenefit.\n\n[[Page S4961]]\n\n  In each of the last three years over 75,000 National Guard and \nReserve members have taken advantage of Veterans Administration \neducational benefits for pursuing their educational or vocational \nobjectives. While those citizen-soldiers currently mobilized may become \neligible for veterans benefits, we must correct the disparity between \nthe active and reserve Montgomery GI bill programs. Only two benefit \nincreases have been legislated in the reserve program since its \ninception in 1985, other than cost-of-living increases. The reserve \nMontgomery GI bill benefit for full-time study stands at $276 compared \nto $985 per month for the Title 38 program. This legislation will bring \nthe reserve Montgomery GI bill benefit to $428 per month in fiscal year \n2004 and $473 per month in fiscal year 2005 and continue out-year \nincreases in accordance with advances in the consumer price index.\n  The Military Coalition comprised of 33 member organizations \nrepresenting over 5.5 million veterans and family members endorses rate \nincreases and funds for the reserve Montgomery GI bill program so that \nNational Guard and Reserve service members can reap an educational \nreturn on their voluntary service to country.\n  It is time to return reserve educational assistance benefits to the \nlevel intended by the original drafting of the Reserve Montgomery GI \nBill.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto require a State to promote financial education under the temporary \nassistance to needy families program and to allow financial education \nto count as a work activity under that program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nAkaka and Sarbanes to introduce the Financial Literacy for Self-\nSufficiency Act.\n  Our bill would require States to promote financial education through \ntheir TANF, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, programs. Financial \neducation--education that promotes an understanding of consumer, \neconomic, and personal finance concepts--is extremely important for all \nfamilies, and is especially important for low-income families who are \nmoving from welfare to work.\n  While TANF focuses on moving families off cash assistance and into \nwork, it fails to provide recipients with the tools they need to \nmaximize their earnings and manage their expenses in order to achieve \nfinancial stability once they are employed. If we truly expect to move \nthese families to achieve financial independence, we must give them the \ntools they will need to make that transition.\n  One of these tools is a bank account. Millions of low-income families \nremain outside of the formal banking system, with many of them spending \ntoo much of their hard-earned dollars at costly check cashing \noperations. In fact, more than eight million families earning under \n$25,000 a year lack a checking or savings account. A study conducted by \nthe United States Department of the Treasury in 2000 found that a \nworker earning $12,000 a year would pay approximately $250 a year just \nto cash their payroll checks at such an outlet. And, nearly 16 percent \nof the checks cashed at check cashing outlets are government benefit \nchecks--including welfare benefit checks.\n  In addition to expanding the number of banks that do business in low-\nincome communities, educating low-income unbanked families about the \nbenefits of formal checking and savings accounts can significantly \nimprove access to financial services.\n  But, financial education isn't just about bank accounts and savings. \nIt is also about protecting low-income families form predatory lending \nand devastating credit arrangements. Financial education that addresses \nabusive lending practices can help prevent unaffordable loan payments, \nequity stripping, and foreclosure. I strongly support legislative \nefforts to end predatory lending practices in our country, but until we \ndo, ensuring that consumers are aware of unfair and abusive loan terms \nis a measure that will provide them some protection from these tactics.\n  Finally, families leaving welfare for work face many challenges, \nincluding securing child care and transportation. One challenge that \noften is not mentioned, however, is the challenge of transitioning from \na benefits-based income to a wage income. Financial literacy programs \nthat educate families transitioning from welfare to work about taxes \nand tax benefits that they may be eligible for, such as the Dependent \nCare Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, will ensure that they \nhave access to these important work benefits.\n  The Financial Literacy for Self-Sufficiency Act will allow States to \nuse their TANF funds to collaborate with community-based organizations, \nbanks, and community colleges to create financial education programs \nfor low-income families receiving welfare and for those transitioning \nfrom welfare to work. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nChairman Greenspan has noted, ``Educational and training programs may \nbe the most critical service offered by community-based organizations \nto enhance the ability of low-income households to accumulate assets.''\n  I hope members of the Senate Finance Committee will join my \ncolleagues and me in promoting financial education for our nation's \nTANF recipients when they act to create a reauthorization framework for \nour nation's welfare program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 813\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``TANF Financial Education \n     Promotion Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S4962]]\n\n       (1) Most recipients of assistance under the temporary \n     assistance to needy families program established under part A \n     of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et \n     seq.) and individuals moving toward self-sufficiency operate \n     outside the financial mainstream, paying high costs to handle \n     their finances and saving little for emergencies or the \n     future.\n       (2) Currently, personal debt levels and bankruptcy filing \n     rates are high and savings rates are at their lowest levels \n     in 70 years. The inability of many households to budget, \n     save, and invest prevents them from laying the foundation for \n     a secure financial future.\n       (3) Financial planning can help families meet near-term \n     obligations and maximize their longer-term well being, \n     especially valuable for populations that have traditionally \n     been underserved by our financial system.\n       (4) Financial education can give individuals the necessary \n     financial tools to create household budgets, initiate savings \n     plans, and acquire assets.\n       (5) Financial education can prevent vulnerable customers \n     from becoming entangled in financially devastating credit \n     arrangements.\n       (6) Financial education that addresses abusive lending \n     practices targeted at specific neighborhoods or vulnerable \n     segments of the population can prevent unaffordable payments, \n     equity stripping, and foreclosure.\n       (7) Financial education speaks to the broader purpose of \n     the temporary assistance to needy families program to equip \n     individuals with the tools to succeed and support themselves \n     and their families in self-sufficiency.\n\n     SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO PROMOTE FINANCIAL EDUCATION UNDER \n                   TANF.\n\n       (a) State Plan.--Section 402(a)(1)(A) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 602(a)(1)(A)) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(vii) Establish goals and take action to promote \n     financial education, as defined in section 407(j), among \n     parents and caretakers receiving assistance under the program \n     through collaboration with community-based organizations, \n     financial institutions, and the Cooperative State Research, \n     Education, and Extension Service of the Department of \n     Agriculture.''.\n       (b) Inclusion of Financial Education as a Work Activity.--\n     Section 407 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C 607) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)(1)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``or (12)'' and \n     inserting ``(12), or (13)''; and\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``or (12)'' each place \n     it appears and inserting ``(12), or (13)'';\n       (2) in subsection (d)--\n       (A) in paragraph (11), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in paragraph (12), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(13) financial education, as defined in subsection \n     (j).''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(j) Definition of Financial Education.--In this part, the \n     term `financial education' means education that promotes an \n     understanding of consumer, economic, and personal finance \n     concepts, including the basic principles involved with \n     earning, budgeting, spending, saving, investing, and \n     taxation.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     take effect on October 1, 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Smith, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Burns, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Levin, Mr. Talent, Mr. Dayton, \n        Mr. Bond, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Pryor, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Coleman, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 816. A bill to amend title XVII of the Social Security Act to \nprotect and preserve access of Medicare beneficiaries to health care \nprovided by hospitals in rural areas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, Senator Thomas and I would like to \nintroduce the Health Care Access and Rural Equity, (H-CARE), Act of \n2003.\n  This proposal is the result of a tripartisan and Bicameral effort. We \nare proud to be joined by 24 Members who also support the bill, \nincluding--Senators Harkin, Grassley, Roberts, Daschle, Dorgan, Smith, \nJohnson, Lincoln, Domenici, Rockefeller, Burns, Bingaman, Jeffords, \nCochran, Levin, Talent, Edwards, Bond, Pryor, Dayton, Snowe, Cantwell \nand Murray. I would also like to thank our House companions, led by \nRepresentatives Moran (R-KS), and Pomeroy.\n  Working together, I believe we are taking important steps toward \nimproving access to health care in our rural communities.\n  In addition, I would like to thank the National Rural Health \nAssociation, the Federation of American Hospitals, the American \nHospital Association, Premier Hospital Alliance and the Coalition \nrepresenting Sole Community Hospitals for their support of this effort.\n  As my colleagues may know, rural health care providers are often \nforced to operate with significantly less resources that larger, urban \nfacilities. In my State of North Dakota, rural hospitals often receive \nonly half the reimbursement of their urban counterparts--for treating \nthe same patient. For example, a rural facility in North Dakota \nreceives approximately $4,200 for treating pneumona, while a hospital \nin New York City can receive more than $8,500.\n  This funding disparity is simply unfair and has placed many rural \nproviders on shaky ground. Continued funding shortfalls have resulted \nin rural providers having much tighter inpatient cost margins than \ntheir urban counterparts--today, the average rural hospital operates \nwith a slim 3.9 percent cost margin compared to 11.3 percent for urban \nproviders). This situation has resulted in more than 43 percent of \nrural hospitals operating in the red.\n  When you look at overall cost margins, the situation is even more \nbleak--rural providers are working with an average negative 2.9 percent \nMedicare margin, compared to 6.3 percent for urban hospitals). Our \nrural facilities cannot continue to provide high quality services if \nthey lose nearly 3 percent on every Medicare patient they serve.\n  To address these problems, the bill we are introducing today would \ntake many important steps to improve the rural health care system.\n  First, it would provide a much-needed low-volume adjustment payment. \nToday, it is nearly impossible for rural hospitals to take advantage of \neconomies of scale realized by facilities located in larger \ncommunities. This situation has resulted in the majority of small \nfacilities losing money. To address this problem, our bill would \nprovide a new, extra payment to hospitals serving less than 2,000 \npatients per year. This provision would provide up to 25 percent in \nadditional funding to help rural providers cover inpatient hospital \nservices.\n  Second, H-CARE would close the gap in payments hospitals receive for \nserving low-income patients. It would do this by allowing rural \nhospitals to receive the same level of special ``Disproportionate \nShare--or DISH Payments'' currently available to urban providers.\n  Third, our legislation would take steps to permanently equalize the \n``base payment amount,'' which has been 1.6 times higher for urban \nfacilities. The recent Omnibus bill temporarily fixed this problem--but \nonly until the end of FY03. Our bill finishes the job.\n  Fourth, this legislation would help hospitals better meet labor costs \nby making some needed improvements to the Medicare ``wage index'' \ncalculation. Across the Nation, rural hospitals have reported that the \nwage index does not accurately account for labor costs in their area. \nOur bill takes steps to address this problem.\n  Fifth, our bill would ensure that rural hospitals continue to be paid \nfairly for outpatient services. It does this by extending a provision \nin current law that protects these hospitals against losses under the \ncurrent Medicare payment system. It also includes measures to protect \nrural hospitals' access to lab services.\n  I am happy to say that this set of proposals would go a long way \ntoward placing rural facilities on much sounder financial footing. Let \nme provide some examples.\n  Today, the average small hospital located in the Midwest receives \n$3,926 as an average payment for inpatient services. If all the changes \nlaid out in our bill are enacted, this will improve payments to smaller \nrural hospitals by about 25 percent.\n  If you look at a more specific service--such as treating pneumonia--\nthis same hospital would see payments increase from about $4,326 to \n$5,405. These increases are clearly big improvements, which will bring \nreimbursements for rural hospitals more in line with their costs.\n  Before I close, I'd also like to mention that this bill would \nestablish a new grant program to help rural hospitals repair crumbling \nbuildings. Under this program, rural providers\n\n[[Page S4963]]\n\ncould apply for up to $5m in loan assistance. It is my hope these \nresources will help strengthen the infrastructure of our Nation's rural \nhospitals.\n  Finally, our bill includes a set of provisions that will make small--\nbut important--changes to the Critical Access Hospital, CAH, program. \nThese include measures to ensure CAHs have 24-hour emergency on-call \nproviders and to ensure they can afford to provide quality ambulance \ncare.\n  In total, the changes laid out in our bill will bring more than $72 \nmillion in new resources to my State of North Dakota over the next ten \nyears. The bill will provide similar benefits to other rural States.\n  Thank you again to my Senate and House colleagues, as well as the \norganizations who worked with us, for your cooperation in developing \nthis important health care proposal. It is my hope that this \nlegislation will help to strengthen and sustain our Nation's rural \nhealth care system.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe ``Health Care Access and Rural Equity Act (H-CARE) of 2003'' with \nSenator Conrad and fellow Senate Rural Health Caucus members, Senators \nHarkin, Grassley, Johnson, Roberts, Domenici, Daschle, Bingaman, Bond, \nLincoln, Cochran, Burns, Rockefeller, Jeffords, Talent, Levin, Smith, \nDayton, Snowe, Edwards, Cantwell, Dorgan, Coleman and Murray. As \nalways, it is important to note that rural health care legislation has \na long history of bipartisan and bicameral collaboration and \ncooperation.\n  The ``Health Care Access and Rural Equity Act of 2003'' will go a \nlong way in addressing current inequities in the Medicare payment \nsystem that continually place rural providers at a disadvantage. This \nlegislation recognizes the unique needs of rural hospitals and levels \nthe playing field between them and their urban counterparts.\n  Rural hospitals are more dependent on Medicare payments as part of \ntheir total revenue. In fact, Medicare accounts for almost 70 percent \nof total revenue for small, rural hospitals. Rural hospitals have lower \npatient volumes, but must compete nationally to recruit providers due \nto the nursing and other health professional workforce shortages.\n  Additional burdens are placed on rural hospitals because of higher \nuninsured rates in rural America. Also, seniors living in rural areas \ntend to be poorer and have more chronic conditions than their urban and \nsuburban counterparts.\n  H-CARE recognizes the special circumstances faced by rural hospitals \nand addresses these issues by equalizing Medicare Disproportionate \nShare Hospital, DSH, payments. These add-on payments help hospitals \ncover the costs of serving a high proportion of low income and \nuninsured patients. Current law allows urban facilities to receive \nunlimited add-ons based on the percentage of these types of patients \nserved. However, small, rural hospital add-on payments are capped at 10 \npercent. H-CARE eliminates the Sole Community Hospital and small rural \nhospital caps, bringing their payments in line with the benefits urban \nfacilities received.\n  This legislation permanently closes the gap between urban and rural \n`'standardized payment'' levels. Inpatient hospital payments are \ncalculated by multiplying several different factors, including a \nstandardized payment amount. The fiscal year 2003 appropriations bill \ncorrected the 1.6 percent disparity, but the provision expires at the \nend of the fiscal year.\n\n  Our bill also acknowledges that low-volume hospitals have a higher \ncost per case, which results in negative operation margins. To \nalleviate this problem, H-CARE creates a low-volume inpatient payment \nadjustment for hospitals that have less than 2,000 annual discharges \nper year and are located more than 15 miles from another hospital. This \nprovision will improve payments for more than one-third of all rural \nhospitals. Almost two-thirds of Wyoming hospitals would qualify for the \nlow-volume provisions in H-CARE, which would result in $26.5 million in \nincreased payments over 10 years.\n  Rural hospitals have long sought changes to the wage index which \nadjusts hospital inpatient payments to reflect the effect of their \nlabor costs. Currently, the labor-related share of hospital inpatient \npayments is set nationally at 71 percent. As rural hospitals generally \nhave a lower wage index than their urban counterparts, their inpatient \npayment is adjusted downward. H-CARE would lower the labor-related \npercent from 71 percent to 62 percent, which will increase payments to \nrural hospitals.\n  There are now more than 700 hospitals nationwide that have converted \nto Critical Access Hospital status. This program was created in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 and allows our smallest communities crucial \naccess to 24 hour emergency services and some hospital care in their \nhome towns. Almost 25 percent of my State's hospitals have downsized to \nCritical Access Hospital status. H-CARE contains several provisions to \nstrengthen this important rural hospital program.\n  It is time for the Federal Government to recognize that rural \nhospitals are long overdue for a fair shake from the Medicare program. \nRural providers care for patients under different circumstances than \nurban hospitals and H-CARE ensures that rural hospitals are paid \naccurately and fairly. I strongly encourage all my colleagues with an \ninterest in rural health to cosponsor this legislation.\n  I also want to thank the American Hospital Association, the \nFederation of American Hospitals, Premier and the National Rural Health \nAssociation for their work and support in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 817. A bill to amend chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, \nrelating to protective orders, sealing of cases, disclosures of \ndiscovery information in civil actions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sunshine in \nLitigation Act of 2003, a measure to address the abuse of secrecy \norders issued by federal courts. All too often, courts sign off on \nsecret settlements that shield important public health and safety \ninformation from the public view from mothers and fathers and children \nwhose lives are potentially at stake, and from public officials we have \nasked to protect our health and safety.\n  The problem is a simple one and has been recurring for decades. An \nindividual brings a cause of action against a manufacturer for an \ninjury or fatality resulting from a product defect. The plaintiff, \noften reticent to continue the litigation process because of grief or \nlack of resources, settles the lawsuit quickly. In exchange, the \ndefendant insists that the plaintiff agree to the inclusion of a \nconfidentiality clause. This mechanism prevents either party from \ndisclosing information revealed during the process of litigation. Both \nof the parties to the lawsuit believe that they have ``won'': the \nplaintiff won a satisfactory financial settlement, and the defendant \nwon the right to conceal ``smoking gun'' documents.\n  But not everybody wins. Future victims of injuries or fatalities \nresulting from the same product defect lose, because they or their \nfamilies must ``re-invent the wheel'' as they litigate virtually the \nsame case. Even worse, the American public loses with this outcome, \nbecause they remain unaware of the critical public health and safety \ninformation which could prevent harm and save lives.\n  Currently, judges have broad discretion in granting protective orders \nwhen ``good cause'' is shown. But these protective orders are being \nmisused. Tobacco companies, automobile manufacturers and pharmaceutical \ncompanies have settled with victims and used the legal system to hide \ninformation which, if it became public, could protect the American \npublic but endanger their business or reputation. We can all agree that \nthe only appropriate use for such orders is to protect trade secrets \nand other truly confidential company information and our legislation \nmakes sure it is protected. But protective orders are certainly not \nsupposed to be used to hide public safety information from the public, \nespecially when such information is neither trade secret nor \nproprietary.\n  There are no records kept of the number of confidentiality orders \naccepted by state or federal courts. However, anecdotal evidence \nsuggests that court secrecy and confidential settlements are prevalent. \nLet me share some examples that illustrate the dangerous and often \ndeadly consequences\n\n[[Page S4964]]\n\nthat result from protective orders: Although an internal memo suggests \nthat General Motors, ``GM'', was aware of the risk of fire deaths from \ncrashes of pickup trucks with ``side saddle'' fuel tanks, an estimated \n750 people were killed in fires involving these fuel tanks. When \nvictims sued, GM disclosed documents only under protective orders and \nsettled these cases only on the condition that these documents remained \nsecret. This type of fuel tank was installed for 15 years before being \ndiscontinued.\n  Sixteen month-old Michael Bancroft was buckled into a Kolcraft \nbooster-style safety seat in his mother's car when the car was involved \nin an accident. Due to a defect in product design, however, the seat \ndid not protect him from a broken neck and paralysis. Kolcraft and the \nBancrofts settled for $4.25 million and signed a confidentiality \nagreement that concealed the product's defect. Because this information \nremained a secret, countless parents continued to feel a false sense of \nsafety when securing their children in Kolcraft safety seats.\n  From 1992-2000, tread separation of certain Bridgestone and Firestone \ntires caused a great number of car accidents, many involving serious \ninjuries or fatalities. Bridgestone/Firestone quietly settled dozens of \nlawsuits resulting from faulty tire crashes, most of which included \nsecrecy agreements. It was only in 1999, when a Houston public \ntelevision broke the story, that the company admitted the defect and \nrecalled 6.5 million tires.\n  Some States have been proactive in dealing with this problem. \nFlorida, for example, has in place a Sunshine in Litigation law that \nseverely limits the ability of parties to conceal information that \neffects public health and safety. Michigan has a rule that requires \nthat secret settlements be unsealed two years after they are approved. \nAnd just last year, the judges of the United States District Court for \nthe District of South Carolina unanimously agreed not to accept any \nsecret settlements at all.\n  While these steps indicate movement in the right direction, we still \nhave a long way to go. It is time to initiate a federal solution for \nthis problem. The Sunshine in Litigation Act is a modest proposal that \nwould require Federal judges to perform a simple balancing test to \nensure that the defendant's interest in secrecy truly outweighs the \npublic interest in information related to public health and safety. \nSpecifically, prior to making any portion of a case confidential or \nsealed, a judge would have to determine by making a particularized \nfinding of fact--that doing so would not restrict the disclosure of \ninformation relevant to public health and safety. Moreover, all courts, \nboth Federal and State, would be prohibited from issuing protective \norders that prevent disclosure to relevant regulatory agencies.\n  And don't just take it from me. During his confirmation hearings \nbefore the Judiciary Committee in January 2001, Attorney General John \nAshcroft voiced his support for this legislation, saying, ``I think \nunnecessarily hiding or otherwise concealing from the public those \n[public health and safety hazards] would be against the interests of \nthe people . . . I think there's great danger in not providing public \ninformation.''\n  This legislation does not prohibit secrecy agreements across the \nboard. It does not place an undue burden on judges or our courts. It \nsimply states that where the public interest in disclosure outweighs \nlegitimate interests in secrecy, courts should not shield important \nhealth and safety information from the public and from regulators. This \nis an entirely reasonable balancing test. It is time to eliminate the \ndark dangers of court secrecy and bring matters of public health and \nsafety into the light, where they belong.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bond, Mr. Pryor, and \n        Mr. Harkin:\n  S 818. A bill to ensure the independence and nonpartisan operation of \nthe Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Independent \nOffice of Advocacy Act of 2003.'' The SBA's Office of Advocacy is, \nunfortunately, one of our government's best kept secrets, and in many \ncases, the best hope for small businesses faced with over burdensome \nFederal regulations. The Office of Advocacy serves two critical roles: \n1. it represents small business' interests before the Federal \ngovernment in regulatory matters--taking advantage of its statutorily \ngranted independence to argue against regulatory actions that impose \ntoo great a burden on small businesses to our economy and the forces \nthat have an effect on them.\n  This bill is designed to build on the success achieved by the Office \nof Advocacy over the past 26 years and to strengthen that foundation by \nmaking the Office of Advocacy a stronger, more effective advocate for \nall small businesses throughout the United States. This bill was \napproved unanimously by the Senate during the 106th and 107th \nCongresses. However, regrettably, the House failed to act in both \ncases.\n  The Office of Advocacy, headed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, is \na unique office with the Federal government. It is part of the SBA, and \nthe Chief Counsel for Advocacy is nominated by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate. At the same time, the Office is also intended \nto be the independent voice for small business within the Federal \nGovernment. It is supposed to develop proposals for changing government \npolicies to help small businesses, and it is supposed to represent the \nviews and interests of small businesses before other Federal agencies \nin rulemaking activities. These roles can sometimes come into conflict.\n  The ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act of 2003'' resolves such \nconflicts in favor of the small businesses that rely on the Chief \nCounsel and the Office of Advocacy to be a fully independent advocate \nwithin the Executive Branch acting on their behalf. The bill would \nestablish a clear mandate that the Office of Advocacy must fight on \nbehalf of small businesses, regardless of the position taken on \ncritical issues by the President and his or her Administration.\n  The Office of Advocacy, under the direction of the Chief Counsel, as \nenvisioned by the ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act of 2003'', would \nbe a wide-ranging advocate, free to take positions contrary to the \nAdministration's policies and to advocate change in government programs \nand attitudes as they affect small businesses. During its consideration \nof the bill in 1999, the Committee on Small Business adopted \nunanimously an amendment to require the Chief Counsel to be appointed \n``from civilian life.'' This qualification is intended to emphasize \nthat the person nominated to serve in this important role should have a \nstrong small business background.\n  In 1976, Congress established the Office of Advocacy in the SBA to be \nthe eyes, ears and voice for small business within the Federal \ngovernment. Since then, the Office of Advocacy has become the \n``independent'' voice for small business. Unfortunately, in certain \ncases, the Office has not been as independent as necessary to do the \njob for small business.\n  For example, funding for the Office of Advocacy currently comes from \nthe Salaries and Expense Account of the SBA's budget. Staffing is \nallocated by the SBA Administrator to the Office of Advocacy from the \noverall staff allocation for the Agency. In 1990, there were 70 full-\ntime employees working on behalf of small businesses in the Office of \nAdvocacy. The current allocation of staff is 49, and fewer are actually \non-board as the result of the long-standing hiring freeze at the SBA. \nThe independence of the Office is diminished when the Office of \nAdvocacy staff is reduced to allow for increased staffing for new \nprograms and additional initiatives in other areas of SBA, at the \ndiscretion of the Administrator.\n  To address this problem, the ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act of \n2003'' builds a firewall to prevent political intrusion into the \nmanagement of day-to-day operations of the Office of Advocacy similar \nto the one that protects Inspectors General. The bill would require the \nFederal budget to include a separate account for the Office of Advocacy \ndrawn directly from General Fund of the Treasury. No longer would its \nfunds come from the general operating account of the SBA. This will \nfree the Chief Counsel for Advocacy from having to seek approval from \nthe SBA Administrator to hire staff for the Office of Advocacy.\n\n[[Page S4965]]\n\n  Additionally, the bill provides that any funds appropriated will \nremain available without fiscal year limitation until expended. This \nwill give the Chief Counsel the flexibility to use these funds as \nnecessary instead of being forced to spend them, perhaps prematurely, \nbecause of the coming end of a fiscal year.\n  The bill would leave unchanged current law that allows the Chief \nCounsel to hire individuals critical to the mission of the Office of \nadvocacy without going through the normal competitive procedures \ndirected by Federal law and the Office of Personnel Management, OPM. \nThis long-standing special hiring authority, which is limited only to \nemployees within the Office of Advocacy, is beneficial because it \nallows the Chief Counsel to hire quickly those persons who can best \nassist the Office in responding to changing issues and problems \nconfronting small businesses.\n  As the New Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have heard repeatedly about the importance of the \nOffice of Advocacy and the vital role it plays for small enterprises \nand the self employed across the nation. With these comments in mind, I \nam committed to ensuring the complete independence of the Office of \nAdvocacy in all matters, at all times, for the continued benefit of all \nsmall businesses. However, so long as any administration controls the \nbudget allocated to the Office of Advocacy, the independence of the \nOffice may be in jeopardy. We must correct this situation, and the \nsooner we do it, the better it will be for the small business \ncommunity.\n  In addition to resolving the critical funding issues, the \n``Independent Office of Advocacy Act of 2003'' would direct the Chief \nCounsel to submit an annual report on Federal agency compliance with \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, RFA, to the President, the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, House Committee on \nSmall Business, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the House \nCommittee on Government Reform, and the Senate and House Committees on \nthe Judiciary.\n  The RFA is a very important weapon in the war against the over-\nregulation of small businesses. It requires agencies to analyze their \nregulations to determine their impact on small businesses before they \nare proposed and to explore alternatives to reduce the regulatory \nburden. In August, 2002, President Bush issued Executive Order 13272, \nwhich requires Federal agencies to establish plans detailing how they \nwill handle their obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and \ndirects the Office of Advocacy to work with the agencies in developing \nthese plans. In addition, the Executive Order directs the agencies to \nrespond to comments from the Office of Advocacy regarding the agencies' \nanalyses. Thus, there is even more reason today to have the Chief \nCounsel report to the President and Congress on how Federal agencies \nare complying with the Regulatory Flexibility Act than there was when \nthis bill was introduced in previous Congresses.\n  The ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act of 2003'' is a sound bill. \nIt is the product of a great deal of thoughtful, objective review and \nconsideration by me; the former Chairman of the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, Senator Bond; staff of the Committee; \nrepresentatives of the small business community; former Chief Counsels \nfor Advocacy and many others. In short, this bill has been thoroughly \nvetted in my Committee and has been approved unanimously by the Senate \nin 1999 and 2001. It is time we see this bill enacted into law, and I \nurge my colleagues to support this important legislation for America's \nsmall businesses and entrepreneurs. I look forward to moving this bill \nthrough the Senate again, and hope that the third time will lead to the \nPresident's desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 818\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Independent Office of \n     Advocacy Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) excessive regulations continue to burden United States \n     small business concerns;\n       (2) Federal agencies are reluctant to comply with the \n     requirements of chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code, and \n     continue to propose regulations that impose disproportionate \n     burdens on small entities;\n       (3) the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business \n     Administration (referred to in this Act as the ``Office'') is \n     an effective advocate for small entities, including small \n     business concerns, that can help to ensure that agencies are \n     responsive to small business concerns and that agencies \n     comply with their statutory obligations under chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, and under the Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-\n     121; 106 Stat. 4249 et seq.);\n       (4) the independence of the Office is essential to ensure \n     that it can serve as an effective advocate for small business \n     concerns without being restricted by the views or policies of \n     the Small Business Administration or any other executive \n     branch agency;\n       (5) the Office needs sufficient resources to conduct the \n     research required to assess effectively the impact of \n     regulations on small business concerns; and\n       (6) the research, information, and expertise of the Office \n     make it a valuable adviser to Congress as well as the \n     executive branch agencies with which the Office works on \n     behalf of small business concerns.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that the Office has the statutory \n     independence and adequate financial resources to advocate for \n     and on behalf of small business concerns;\n       (2) to require that the Office report to the Chairmen and \n     Ranking Members of the Committees on Small Business of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives and the Administrator \n     of the Small Business Administration in order to keep them \n     fully and currently informed about issues and regulations \n     affecting small business concerns and the necessity for \n     corrective action by the regulatory agency or the Congress;\n       (3) to provide a separate authorization for appropriations \n     for the Office;\n       (4) to authorize the Office to report to the President and \n     to the Congress regarding agency compliance with chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code; and\n       (5) to enhance the role of the Office pursuant to chapter 6 \n     of title 5, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend and \ncolleague, Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, Olympia Snowe, in reintroducing the ``Independent \nOffice of Advocacy Act'', which our Committee and the full Senate \nendorsed unanimously last Congress. This legislation will help ensure \nthe Small Business Administration's, SBA, Office of Advocacy has the \nnecessary autonomy to remain an independent voice for America's small \nbusinesses. I would like to thank Senator Snowe and her staff for \nworking with me and my staff to make the necessary changes to this \nlegislation to garner bipartisan support.\n  The independent Office of Advocacy Act rewrites the law that created \nthe Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy to allow for \nincreased autonomy. It reaffirms the Office's statutory and financial \nindependence by creating a separate funding account for the Office from \nthe General Fund of the Treasury instead of being allocated through the \nSBA's annual appropriation.\n  At its heart, this legislation will allow the Office of Advocacy to \nbetter represent small business interests before Congress, Federal \nagencies, and the Federal Government without fear of reprisal for \ndisagreeing with the position of any current Administration.\n  For those of my colleagues without an intimate knowledge of the \ncritical role the Office of Advocacy and its Chief Counsel play in \nprotecting and promoting America's small businesses, I will briefly \nelaborate its important functions and achievements. From studying the \nrole of small business in the U.S. economy, to promoting small business \nexports, to advocating for the best interests of small business in a \nmyriad of areas, to lightening the regulatory burden of small \nbusinesses through the Regulatory Flexibility Act, RFA, and the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, SBREFA, the Office of \nAdvocacy has a wide scope of authority and responsibility.\n  The U.S. Congress created the Office of Advocacy, headed by a Chief \nCounsel to be appointed by the President from the private sector and \nconfirmed by the Senate, in June of 1976. The rationale was to give \nsmall businesses a louder voice in the councils of government.\n  Each year, the Office of Advocacy advises Congress and the executive \nbranch regarding policy issues affecting small businesses, brings \ntogether\n\n[[Page S4967]]\n\nsmall business people with members of Congress, congressional staff and \nexecutive branch officials to resolve issues affecting small business, \npublishes numerous studies and reports, compiles vast amounts of data \nand successfully lightens the regulatory burden on America's small \nbusinesses. In the area of contracting, the Office of Advocacy \ndeveloped PRO-Net, a database of small businesses used by Federal \ncontracting officers to find small business interests interested in \nselling to the Federal Government.\n  The U.S. Congress, the Administration, and, of course, small \nbusinesses have all benefited from the work of the Office of Advocacy. \nIn October 2001, an Advocacy research study titled, The Impact of \nRegulatory Costs on Small Business, established that small businesses \nwith less than 20 employees spend nearly $7,000 each year, per employee \njust to comply with Federal regulations and mandates. By working with \nFederal agencies to implement the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the \nOffice of Advocacy in 2002 saved small businesses over $21 billion in \nforegone regulatory costs that can now be used to create jobs, buy \nequipment and expand access to health care for millions of Americans.\n  Small businesses remain the backbone of the U.S. economy. According \nto a study conducted by the Small business Administration Office of \nEconomic Research and released in January 2003, small businesses \naccount for approximately 99 percent of all employers, account for 51 \npercent of private-sector output, represent 52 percent of GDP and, in \n2002, provided two-thirds of all net new jobs.\n  Small businesses have also taken the lead in moving people from \nwelfare to work and an increasing number of women and minorities are \nturning to small business ownership as a means to gain economic self-\nsufficiency. Put simply, small businesses represent what is best in the \nUnited States economy, providing innovation, competition and \nentrepreneurship.\n  Their interests are vast, their activities divergent, and the \ndifficulties they face to stay in business are numerous. To provide the \nnecessary support to help them, SBA's Office of Advocacy needs our \nsupport.\n  The responsibility and authority given the Office of Advocacy and the \nChief Counsel are crucial to their ability to be an effective \nindependent voice in the Federal Government for small businesses. This \nbill has been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Small \nBusiness Legislative Council and the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses. Small businesses are asking us to do everything we can to \nprotect and strengthen this essential office. I believe this \nlegislation accomplishes that important goal.\n  I have always been a strong supporter of the Office of Advocacy and I \nam pleased to join with Chairwoman Snowe in introducing this \nlegislation, which will ensure that the Office of Advocacy remains an \nindependent and effective voice representing America's small \nbusinesses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Campbell):\n  S. 819. A bill to amend the definition of a law enforcement officer \nunder subchapter III of chapter 83 and chapter 84 of title 5, United \nStates Code, respectively, to ensure the inclusion of certain \npositions; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Law \nEnforcement Officers Retirement Equity act of 2003. I am proud to be \njoined on this bill by my colleagues, Senators Sarbanes, Leahy and \nCampbell. This legislation will ensure that all Federal law enforcement \nofficers have the same retirement options and that their pay and \nbenefits conform with the Federal law enforcement retirement system.\n  Under current law, most Federal law enforcement officers and \nfirefighters are eligible to retire at age 50 with 20 years of Federal \nservice. But, some Federal law enforcement personnel, such as customs \nand immigration inspectors at the Department of Homeland Security or \npolice officers at Veterans Affairs, are not eligible for these same \nbenefits. This legislation will amend current law and grant the same \npay and 20-year retirement to all law enforcement officers.\n  We must honor our Federal law enforcement personnel. The names of \nFederal law enforcement officials who have died in the line of duty are \nengraved on the Law Enforcement Memorial. We include the names of the \nofficers from Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs. We honor them \nwhen they die, but we don't recognize them when they are living.\n  We need to make sure that all Federal law enforcement officers earn \nthe pay and benefits that they deserve. These brave men and women are \nthe country's first line of defense against terrorism and the smuggling \nof illegal drugs at our borders. They have the same law enforcement \ntraining as all other law enforcement personnel, and face the same \nrisks and challenges.\n  For example, U.S. Customs inspectors are responsible for the most \narrests performed by Customs Service employees. Yet, they do not \nqualify for law enforcement officer status. Along with U.S. customs \nagents, uniformed U.S. Customs inspectors are helping provide \nadditional security at the Nation's airports and help enforce U.S. \ncustoms laws. They were among the first to respond to the tragedy at \nthe World Trade Center. After September 11, Customs inspectors are \nplaying a critical role in ensuring that terrorists don't get their \nhands on weapons of mass destruction and smuggle them into the country.\n  In 2002, the U.S. Custom Service impounded over 4,100 pounds of \nheroin and 167,000 pounds of cocaine, and confiscated over 39,000 \nfirearms and 6.4 million rounds of ammunition. In fact, on a typical \nday, employees of the Customs Service inspect over 57,000 trucks and \ncontainers. Customers inspectors are vital in winning the war on drugs \nand keeping America safe from terrorism.\n  Like customs inspectors, immigration inspectors at the Department of \nHomeland Security are also on the front lines of defense against \nterrorism. Immigration inspectors enforce the Nation's immigration laws \nat more than 300 ports of entry. In the normal course of their duties, \nthey enforce criminal law, make arrests, interrogate applicants for \nentry, search persons and effects, and seize evidence. Inspector's \nresponsibilities have become increasing complex as political, economic \nand social unrest has increased globally. The threat of terrorism only \nincreases these responsibilities.\n  These immigration inspectors help secure our borders. In FY 2001, \nover 510 million inspections were performed by these inspectors with \n700,000 individuals denied entry, and approximately 71,000 criminal \naliens were removed from the country.\n  This legislation is cost effective. Any cost that is created by this \nact is more than offset by savings in training costs and increased \nrevenue collection. A 20-year retirement bill for these critical \nemployees will reduce turnover, increase productivity, decrease \nemployee recruitment and development costs, and enhance the retention \nof a well-trained and experienced work force. These vital Federal \nemployees bear the same risks and work under similar conditions to \nother law enforcement officials and deserve to receive the same level \nof benefits.\n  This bill will improve the effectiveness of our inspector and revenue \nofficer work force to ensure the integrity of our borders and proper \ncollection of the taxes and duties owed to the Federal Government. This \nbill is supported by the Fraternal Orders of Police and the National \nTreasury Employees Union. I urge my colleagues to join me again in this \nCongress in expressing support for this bill and finally getting it \nenacted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 819\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish a perchlorate pollution prevention fund and to establish \nsafety standards applicable to owners and operators of perchlorate \nstorage facilities; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nguaranteeing a community's right-to-know about pollution discharges, \nseepage and potential drinking water contamination by the toxic \nchemical perchlorate.\n  Perchlorate is the main ingredient in rocket fuel, which accounts for \n90 percent of its use. Perchlorate is also used in lesser amounts for \nammunition, fireworks, and other products. It dissolves readily in many \nliquids, including water, and moves easily and quickly.\n  The sources of drinking water for up to 10 million Californians and \nmillions of other Americans are contaminated with perchlorate. Alarming \nlevels of perchlorate have been discovered in Lake Mead and the \nColorado River, the drinking water source for millions of Southern \nCalifornians. Communities in the Inland Empire, San Gabriel Valley, \nSanta Clara Valley, and the Sacramento area are also grappling with \nperchlorate contamination. In addition, more than 20 million Americans \nin at least 19 states drink water contaminated with perchlorate.\n  Perchlorate is a clear and present danger to California's public \nhealth. Perchlorate poses a variety of serious health risks relating to \nthyroid function, especially in newborns, children, and pregnant women. \nExposure to perchlorate interferes with the thyroid gland's ability to \nproduce the hormones needed for normal prenatal development. This can \ncause both physical and mental retardation. Perchlorate is also linked \nto thyroid cancer.\n  Despite the gravity of the situation, we currently have no way of \nknowing who is dumping it or where they are dumping it. We cannot wait \nfour more years to address this threat while EPA continues to delay \nregulation and clean ups. Communities need to get moving to protect \ntheir drinking water sooner rather than later. Guaranteeing a community \nthe right-to-know about potential perchlorate contamination is a first \nstep.\n  My bill would do just this. First, my bill addresses the legacy of \nperchlorate contamination by requiring anyone who has stored more than \n375 pounds of perchlorate since January 1, 1950, to report annually to \nthe U.S. EPA, beginning no later than June 1, 2005. This does not apply \nto facilities that store\n\n[[Page S4969]]\n\nperchlorate for a retail or law enforcement purpose. EPA must annually \npublish the list of all perchlorate storage facilities in existence \nsince January 1, 1950, beginning no later than June 1, 2005.\n  Second, my bill would also require anyone who discharges perchlorate \ninto the water to report the discharge, its volume, monitoring methods, \nand remedial actions to the EPA. EPA must publish this information \nannually in the Federal Register beginning no later than June 1, 2005.\n  Third, failure to report as required under my bill would result in \nfines. All fines will be deposited into a loan fund for public water \nsuppliers and private well owners to pay for clean water when their \nwater supply is shut down because of perchlorate contamination.\n  Communities have a right to know what is in their water and where it \ncomes from. My bill will ensure that communities have the necessary \ninformation to act now to address the health threat of perchlorate. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 821. A bill to accelerate the commercialization and widespread use \nof hydrogen energy and fuel cell technologies, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, imagine a world with cars that spew out no \nsmog, no toxic emissions, and no greenhouse gases. The only thing that \nwould come out of the tailpipe would be water pure enough to drink.\n  Imagine a world in which we don't import a drop of Mideast oil, \nbecause clean, domestic, renewable energy sources meet all of our \nneeds.\n  Imagine a world in which we don't need to worry about a terrorist \nstrike on our large nuclear power plants, or a storm causing a blackout \nover a large region, because we get all of our electricity from small \ndistributed generators on farms and in buildings throughout the \ncountry.\n  Sound too good to be true? The technology to do this, using hydrogen \nenergy and fuel cells, is out of the labs and being tested on our \nstreets and in our buildings today. For those of us who have been \nworking for many years to bring this vision into reality, that is very \nexciting. But we still need a major effort to bring the costs down and \ncommercialize the technology.\n  And there is remarkable bipartisan agreement on the need for \ngovernment action. A couple years ago we were fighting for scraps of \nfunding. Now the President has proposed $1.7 billion over 5 years \ntoward getting hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on the road. The Senate \nenergy bill last year, before it died in conference, included tax \nincentives for stationary fuel cells, fuel cell vehicles, hydrogen \nvehicles, hydrogen fueling infrastructure, and hydrogen fuel.\n  But we are still too timid to bring about the fundamental shift to \nthe hydrogen economy. The Department of Energy is working toward a go-\nno go decision by the car companies by 2015, and mass production of \nvehicles by 2020. But the car companies themselves have been talking \nabout commercial vehicles by 2010.\n  We need a bolder, more comprehensive plan. That's why I am \nintroducing the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Energy Act of 2003. This bill \naddresses three critical requirements to bringing hydrogen energy and \nfuel cells into commerce, and start gaining their environmental and \nsecurity benefits, as soon as technically feasible.\n  First we need a technological push. We need better fuel cell stack \ncomponents to reduce costs and improve longevity. We need lighter, more \nefficient ways to store hydrogen on-board vehicles. In the long term, \nwe need cheaper ways of converting renewable energy to hydrogen fuel.\n  This bill reauthorizes the Matsunaga Act, which established the \nFederal hydrogen energy research program. It updates the language and \nsets clearer priorities. It expands the authorization to cover fuel \ncell research and development as well, to reflect the technical and \nbureaucratic reality that research on fuel cells--the most efficient, \nflexible, and cleanest way to use hydrogen energy--has become \ninextricably linked to research on hydrogen energy. It supports work on \ndomestic and international codes and standards, to work through a major \nregulatory barrier to working with combustible hydrogen and to making \nall the infrastructure pieces fit together. It includes a specific \nmandate to do public education on hydrogen and fuel cells and to do \nuniversity training in critical skills needed in the industry. And it \nincreases funding levels over the next few years to accelerate progress \nin pre-commercial technologies.\n\n  Second, and perhaps most important right now, we need a near-term \ndemand pull. As long as the fuel cells and hydrogen appliances are made \nby hand, they will remain very expensive. But it's also expensive to \nbuild the factories to build them more cheaply. We need support to get \nindustry over that initial cost hump.\n  The first step is large demonstration programs that serve a dual \npurpose: they provide a realistic test of how the laboratory \ntechnologies work in the real world, and they provide funding for pre-\ncommercial prototypes of the technologies, including starting to build \na hydrogen fueling infrastructure.\n  The Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Energy Act authorizes several new, large \ndemonstration programs:\n  The main demostration program would provide over $1 billion over 7 \nyears for demonstrations of the full range of fuel cell applications \nand associated hydrogen infrastructure. These demonstrations would \ninclude fleets of fuel cell passenger vehicles, fuel cell buses and \nfarm vehicles, stationary fuel cells in houses and commercial \nbuildings, and portable fuel cells such as auxiliary power units in \ntrucks.\n  A second, closely related program, would provide hydrogen fueling \ninfrastructure over major transportation corridors and entire regions, \nand then demonstrate hydrogen-powered vehicles that are not tethered to \na single pump. Early demonstrations, at least, would likely use \nvehicles that burn hydrogen; these are similar to gas-electric hybrids \nthat you can buy today, but run on hydrogen rather than gasoline. These \nvehicles provide most of the benefits of fuel cell vehicles at a \nfraction of the current cost. They are not as good as fuel cell \nvehicles in the long term, they are less efficient, less flexible, and \nproduce a little pollution, but would move us a long way toward the \ngoal and would provide a good large-scale test of a hydrogen fueling \nsystem.\n  A third program would demonstrate hydrogen and fuel cell technologies \nin foreign countries. Hydrogen energy could have an early application \nin places where a competing fossil fuel infrastructure is not already \nwell-developed. And assisting this application is in our national \ninterest in order to promote global development without causing global \nwarming and other harmful environmental effects, and to increase the \nglobal market for American hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.\n  The last program would focus on emerging technologies for production \nof hydrogen from renewable resources. Two approaches show particular \npromise for clean, efficient production of hydrogen at this time. \nBiorefineries make hydrogen and other products from biomass. And in \n``electrofarming'' the hydrogen is produced and used on the same farm. \nThe hydrogen might be made by growing and reforming biomass, from wind \nenergy, or from farm waste; it could be used in farm vehicles and \nequipment and for heat and electricity in farm buildings.\n  All these demonstration programs would be conducted using competitive \nmerit review of funding proposals from a wide variety of companies and \norganizations, and they would require cost-sharing from awardees.\n  Third, we need to show there will be a market for commercial hydrogen \nand fuel cell technologies in the long term. The Federal Government can \ndo this by buying early commercial products and by providing incentives \nto others to do so, in recognition of their public benefits.\n  The bill includes Federal purchase requirements for both zero \nemission vehicles and stationary fuel cells. The vehicle requirements \nare similar to Federal fleet requirements for purchase of alternative \nfuel vehicles. They would require zero emission vehicles, most likely \nhydrogen fuel cell vehicles, to make up an increasing percentage of \nFederal fleet vehicle purchases up to 75 percent. Alternative fuel \nvehicles with very low emissions, such as hydrogen hybrid vehicles, \nwould get partial credit. For stationary fuel cells, the bill\n\n[[Page S4970]]\n\nwould require modifying energy efficiency regulations for Federal \nbuildings to presume use of fuel cells to power new Federal buildings \nand to encourage their use in older buildings.\n  The bill also provides a broad array of tax incentives for stationary \nand portable fuel cells, hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles, hydrogen \nfueling infrastructure, and hydrogen fuel. These incentives are similar \nto those that have been proposed in the CLEAR Act on alternative fuel \nvehicles, in previous bills on stationary fuel cells, and in last \nyear's energy bill. However, this bill makes some important changes. It \nmakes all the tax credits tradable so that government agencies and non-\nprofit organizations can use them as well as consumers and private \ncompanies. It increases the credit for hydrogen fueling infrastructure \nto recognize the cost of making the hydrogen on-site, not just pumping \nit. It adds an additional incentive for hydrogen from renewable \nresources to encourage a transition to a sustainable hydrogen system. \nAnd most importantly, it extends the tax credits so the industry will \nknow the incentives will be there when they are needed--when real \ncommercial products are available.\n  Finally, the bill ensures effective coordination and oversight of the \nexpanded Federal hydrogen and fuel cell energy activities, with a new \ninteragency task force to coordinate activities, a revamped technical \nadvisory panel, and periodic outside review by the National Academies.\n  These measures will require a significant Federal investment in our \nenergy future. But with these measures we can use hydrogen and fuel \ncell technologies to turn into reality a vision of cars that don't \npollute, of power that won't go out, and of feeling less dependent on \nan area of the world where we are fighting the second war in recent \nyears. It is time to take these steps now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Pryor, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 822. A bill to create a 3-year pilot program that makes small, \nnon-profit child care businesses eligible for SBA 504 loans; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, with most of the country's attention \nfocused on the war in Iraq, important issues at home are falling \nthrough the cracks. Today I rise to talk about one of the needs of \nworking moms and dads and their children--child care. We have a \nshortage of childcare in this country, and it is a problem for our \nfamilies, a problem for our businesses, and a problem for our economy. \nThe Census Bureau estimates that there are approximately 24 million \nschool age children with parents who are in the workforce or pursuing \neducation, and the numbers are growing. There has been a 43 percent \nincrease in dual-earner families and single parent families over the \nlast half a century. As parents leave the home for work and education, \nthe need for quality child care in America continues to increase.\n  As the Ranking Democrat of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I think we can foster the establishment and expansion \nof existing child care businesses through the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA. Today with Senators Harkin, Landrieu, Pryor, \nLieberman, Daschle, Bingaman, and Johnson. I am introducing the Child \nCare Lending Pilot Act of 2003, a bill to create a three-year pilot \nthat allows small, non-profit child care providers to access financing \nthrough SBA's 504 loans.\n  There is a real need to help finance the purchase of buildings, to \nexpand existing facilities and improve the conditions of established \ncenters to meet the demand for child care. It is appropriate to provide \nfinancing through the 504 program because it was created to spur \neconomic development and rebuild communities, and child care is \ncritical to businesses and their employees. Financing through 504 could \nspur the establishment and growth of child care businesses because the \nprogram requires the borrower to put down only between 10 and 20 \npercent of the loan, making the investment more affordable. Another \nadvantage of 504 loans is that they have terms of up to 20 years, with \nfixed interest rates, allowing small businesses to keep their monthly \npayments low and predictable.\n  As anyone with children knows, quality childcare comes at a very high \ncost to a family, and it is especially burdensome to low-income \nfamilies. The Children's Defense Fund has estimated that child care for \na 4-year-old in a child care center averages $4,000 to $6,000 per year \nin cities and states around the Nation. In all but one state, the \naverage annual cost of child care in urban area child care centers is \nmore than the average annual cost of public college tuition.\n  These high costs make access to child care all but non-existent for \nlow-income families. While some states have made efforts to provide \ngrants and loans to assist childcare businesses, more must be done to \nincrease the supply of childcare and improve the quality of programs \nfor low-income families. According to the Child Care Bureau, state and \nfederal funds are so insufficient that only one out of 10 children in \nlow-income working families who are eligible for assistance under \nfederal law receives it.\n  For parts of the country, when affordable child care is available, it \nis provided through non-profit child care businesses. I formed a task \nforce in my home state of Massachusetts to study the state of child \ncare, and of the many important findings, we discovered that more than \n60 percent of the child care providers are non-profit and that there is \na real need to help them finance the purchase of buildings or expand \ntheir existing space. Child care in general is not a high-earning \nindustry, and the owners don't have spare money lying around. Asking \ncenters to charge less or cut back on employees is not the way to make \nchild care more affordable for families and does not serve the children \nwell. An adequate staff is needed to make sure children receive proper \nsupervision and support. Furthermore, if centers are asked to lower \ntheir operating costs in order to lower costs to families, the safety \nand quality of the child care provided would be in jeopardy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation so \nnon-profit childcare providers can access funds to start new centers or \nexpand and improve upon existing centers. As we have done in \nMassachusetts, Senators could bring together 504 lenders, childcare \nproviders not for-profit and non-profit--and the state department of \nchild welfare to facilitate the increase of childcare providers in \ntheir states.\n  As common sense tells us, and the child advocates if we listen, there \nis no magic bullet to addressing the shortage of safe and affordable \nchild care in this country--it takes coordinated and complementary \nefforts to make a real difference. This is as much a child welfare \nissue as a workforce issue, and it makes sense to leverage one of SBA's \neffective resources to try and contribute to making a positive \ndifference. I argue--we argue--that allowing non-profit child care \ncenters to receive SBA loans can increase the availability of child \ncare in the United States. Non-profit child care centers provide the \nsame quality of care as the for-profit centers, and non-profit centers \noften serve our nation's neediest communities. I hope that my \ncolleagues will recognize the vital role that early education plays in \nthe development of fine minds and productive citizens and realize that \nin this great nation, child care should be available to all families in \nall income brackets.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters of support be printed in \nthe Record. These letters demonstrate that this is a good investment \nand good for our country.\n  There being no objection, the additional materials were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Omni Bank, N.A.,\n\n                                    Houston, Texas, July 30, 2002.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: Please accept this letter as my full \n     support of the bill, soon to be introduced, proposing a Pilot \n     Program, operating through the Small Business \n     Administration's 504 Loan Program, that would allow Day Care \n     facilities designated as non-profits to be eligible for the \n     program.\n       I believe the demand for such a product is strong, and is \n     fiscally sound. My reasons are as follows:\n\n       1. Day Care Centers must carry a non-profit designation in \n     order to accept children to the center from low-income \n     families.\n\n[[Page S4971]]\n\n       2. These businesses benefit low-income neighborhoods and \n     enterprise zones by purchasing property, improving the \n     physical appearance of the community and providing safe \n     facilities for the children. The ability to utilize the SBA-\n     504 program would enable these businesses to decrease lease/\n     payment expense and hence, help more children.\n       3. These families are in the most need for quality day care \n     facilities in their community, since many use mass transit to \n     get to work.\n       4. Small businesses have provided most of the job growth in \n     this country in the last ten years. By enabling these Day \n     Care Centers to operate efficiently and provide quality \n     facilities, we will be helping small business gain and \n     maintain employees.\n       5. Designation as a non-profit business does not equate to \n     an inability to pay loans, or other business expenses.\n       OMNIBANK, a 50-year-old community bank in Houston, Texas, \n     has experienced a consistent demand for loans to Day Care \n     Centers. Most loan requests from these entities are for the \n     purpose of acquiring or expanding property (real-estate) or \n     acquiring transportation equipment. An example of a specific, \n     recent request follows:\n       The Executive Director and Owner of Teeter Totter Day Care \n     Center approached OMNIBANK about a loan to purchase the \n     building used to house the Center. The owner, an African-\n     American woman, was experienced in this business. Cash flow \n     to service the debt was sufficient and appropriate under \n     prudent leading guidelines. The only deterrent from making a \n     conventional loan was the amount available for down payment. \n     Twenty percent or more is usually required.\n       Under the SBA-504 Program, a ten percent down payment is \n     allowed and standard procedure for multi-use buildings. \n     Additionally, it offers a fixed rate on the SBA portion of \n     the loan. Most small businesses do not have access to fixed \n     rate mortgages, due to the size of the loan requests, which \n     enhances the attractiveness of the SBA-504 Program even \n     further.\n       As we were preparing the request package, we realized that \n     a non-profit did not quality. The owner would personally \n     guarantee the loan, and even agreed to form a for profit \n     corporation to hold the property, because the underlying \n     tenant was non-profit it would not work. The owner could not \n     change Teeter Totter into a for profit corporation without \n     jeopardizing its subsidies for low-income children.\n       OMNIBANK and the day care center are located in Houston's \n     fifth ward, most of which is classified as low to moderate \n     income. Its population is primarily low-income African \n     Americans and Hispanics. The project was viewed by the Bank \n     as a good loan from a business perspective, with many \n     additional benefits to the community at large.\n       Ultimately, after appealing to SBA for an exception, and \n     spending a great deal of time on the project, the loan was \n     not completed. This delayed a good project from improving \n     many aspects of an already underserved community, due to a \n     simple tax classification.\n       As stated earlier, OMNIBANK receives consistent requests \n     from day care centers, most of which are non-profit. I \n     believe that a Pilot Program as proposed, will prove that \n     these are viable and valuable businesses. I would recommend \n     that all other standard criteria, proven track record, cash \n     flow, management expertise, etc. remain.\n       I look forward to any questions you may have, or any \n     further examples I can provide.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Julie A.

The Guild of St. Agnes is a non-profit child \n     care agency providing child care in Worcester, MA and its \n     surrounding towns. Presently we care for 1200 children aged \n     four weeks to twelve years in child care centers, family care \n     providers' homes and public schools. Of our seven centers, we \n     currently own one.\n       Four of our centers are in old, worn-down buildings, \n     causing us difficulty in recruiting new clients. As we look \n     towards the future, the Guild of St. Agnes has set a goal of \n     replacing these centers with new buildings. In order to \n     accomplish this goal, we need to look for creative funding \n     sources to support our capital campaign. The SBA 504 loan \n     program would allow us to invest 10 percent of our own funds \n     for capital expenses, borrow 50 percent from the government \n     and secure a bank loan for 40 percent. Not only is this loan \n     program attractive to banking institutions, it allows child \n     care agencies like the Guild of St. Agnes to continue to grow \n     during these economically challenging times.\n       I urge you to support the SBA 504 loan program legislation. \n     The future of non-profit child care agencies such as the \n     Guild of St. Agnes depends no it!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Edward P. Madaus,\n      Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   Accion USA,\n\n                                         Boston, MA, July 8, 2002.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: My name is Erika Eurkus, and as a \n     member of your Advisory Committee on Child Care and Small \n     Business, I am writing to voice my support of expanding the \n     SBA 504 loan program to include nonprofit child care centers.\n       I am the greater Boston program director for ACCION USA, a \n     nonprofit ``micro'' lender whose mission is to make access to \n     credit a permanent resource to low- and moderate-income small \n     business owners in the United States--helping to narrow the \n     income gap and provide economic opportunity to small business \n     owners throughout the country. Many of the struggling \n     entrepreneurs we serve are the owners of small, family-based \n     day care centers.\n       At ACCION, I regularly come into contact with women and men \n     whose dream is to operate a successful child care center--to \n     provide a service to the community while making a better life \n     from something they love to do. Often, what keeps these \n     hardworking entrepreneurs from fully realizing that dream is \n     a lack of working capital to begin and grow their businesses. \n     Microlenders like ACCION are the only place they can turn for \n     the crucial capital they need for their businesses. Mauro \n     Leija, an ACCION client in San Antonio, Texas, has tried--and \n     failed--to secure capital from commercial banks. ``The loan \n     officer at the bank said, `Be realistic--you'll never get a \n     loan. You have no college diploma, no capital, no history \n     with any bank,' '' Mauro remembers. This lack of economic \n     opportunity is too often the reality for countless child care \n     providers--most of whom earn an average of $3 per hour for \n     their services.\n       With increased access to capital through the expansion of \n     the SBA 504 loan program, small, nonprofit day care centers \n     can continue to provide their valuable services to the \n     community--and build a better life for their own families at \n     the same time. Suzanne Morris of Springfield, Massachusetts, \n     a longtime ACCION USA borrower, already illustrates the \n     potential successes that an expanded SBA 504--and an \n     opportunity for capital--will bring to day care owners across \n     the country. After years of hard work and several small loans \n     from ACCION, Suzanne has moved her day care out of the home \n     and has expanded her staff to include seven members of the \n     community. The business supports her family of four. She also \n     gives back by training other local home-based day care \n     providers in Federal nutrition guidelines.\n       It is my hope that we can all witness more successes like \n     those of Suzanne by opening the door to funding for small day \n     care providers. Please include nonprofit child care centers \n     in the scope of SBA 504.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Erika Eurkus,\n     Greater Boston Program Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Neighborhood Business Builders,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, July 10, 2002.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing on behalf of Neighborhood \n     Business Builders and the Jewish Vocational Service of Boston \n     in support of legislation to expand availability of SBA 504 \n     loans to non-profit child care centers.\n       I am currently the Director of Loan Funds at Neighborhood \n     Business Builders, which is an economic development program \n     and US SBA Intermediary Microlender. I have been lending and \n     consulting to small businesses for the past year after \n     fifteen years in the private sector as founder of three \n     different companies in Boston and Los Angeles. I have an MPA \n     from the Kennedy School at Harvard University.\n       I am on Senator Kerry's Child Care and Small Business \n     Advisory Committee, and am Co-chair of the Sub Committee on \n     Family Child Care.\n       I support legislative change to the 504 loan program \n     because our committee has uncovered a need for government \n     support of non-profit child care centers. The basic reason \n     for this is that, while we recognize a demand for child care \n     in every part of the country, we do not consider that the \n     market fails to profitably supply child care in every part of \n     the country.\n       For-profit entities are able to access the capital they \n     need by: (1) Demonstrating demand for the service provided \n     and (2) Demonstrating ability to service market rate debt \n     with acceptable risk. Non-profit centers emerge when: (1) \n     Demonstrated demand for the service is evident, but (2) The \n     market will not support the true cost of the service \n     provided. These non-profit centers are unable to access \n     traditional forms of capital because they cannot demonstrate \n     an ability to service debt at an acceptable risk.\n       The SBA 504 loan program would help mitigate the risk to \n     lenders who will then be able to provide the necessary \n     capital for the service that we know is in demand. The tax \n     status of a child care center should be irrelevant, since the \n     501(C)3 status is only granted\n\n[[Page S4972]]\n\n     when there is evidence of a public good being provided.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Eric Korsh,\n     Director of Loan Funds, Neighborhood Business Builders.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            South Eastern Economic\n\n\n                                      Development Corporation,\n\n                                       Taunton, MA, July 10, 2002.\n     Chairman John Kerry,\n     Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \n         Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re non profit child care center eligibility under the SBA 504 \n         program.\n\n       Dear Senator Kerry: As a member of the Advisory Committee \n     on Child Care and Small Business as well as Vice President at \n     South Eastern Economic Development (SEED) Corporation, I am \n     writing in support of the idea of expanding the SBA 504 \n     program to allow for non profit child care centers to be \n     eligible for financing under the program. SEED Corporation is \n     a Certified Development Company certified and accredited to \n     administer the SBA 504 program throughout southeastern \n     Massachusetts. Over the past 2 years, SEED has been the \n     number one SBA 504 lender in the state. SEED is also an \n     approved SBA Microenterprise Intermediary and we have enjoyed \n     and made use of the ability to provide micro loans to non-\n     profit child care businesses since the microenterprise \n     intermediary legislation made the special provision for non \n     profit child care providers to be eligible for SBA micro loan \n     funds. My primary responsibilities at SEED include \n     origination, underwriting and closing SBA 504 loans as well \n     as the oversight and development of SEED's micro loan and \n     business assistance activities.\n       Over the past five years, SEED has assisted over 10 FOR-\n     PROFIT child care businesses to obtain SBA 504 financing for \n     their start-up or expansion projects. However, we have also \n     had to turn away an equal number of non-profit child care \n     centers that were seeking similar assistance due to the fact \n     that non profit entities are not eligible under the SBA 504 \n     program.\n       As we have learned from discussions and analysis with the \n     Advisory Committee on Child Care and Small Business, access \n     to long term, fixed market or below-market rate financing is \n     essential to any child care center. The slim margins that \n     characterize this industry limit any child care center's \n     ability to grow. The SBA 504 program offers the type of fixed \n     rate financing that not only assists the business to keep its \n     occupancy costs under control but also serves to stabilize \n     its operations over the long term. The program also provides \n     an incentive to a bank to provide fixed asset financing to a \n     business that might not otherwise be able to afford a \n     conventional commercial mortgage. The non-profit child care \n     centers provide the same quality of care as the for-profit \n     centers. Preventing non-profit child care centers from making \n     use of the SBA 504 program when their for-profit competitors \n     are able to results in discrimination against the children \n     they serve; and, in general, the majority of child care \n     centers operating in our state's neediest areas are non-\n     profit.\n       For these reasons, I would like to support your efforts to \n     expand the SBA 504 program enabling non-profit child care \n     centers to be eligible for fixed asset financing under the \n     504 program. Thank you for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Heather Danton,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n         The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Executive Office of \n           Health and Human Services, Office of Child Care \n           Services,\n                                        Boston, MA, July 11, 2002.\n     Chairman John Kerry,\n     Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \n         Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kerry: The Massachusetts Office of Child Care \n     Services (OCCS) fully supports expansion of the SBA 504 loan \n     program to include non-profit child care programs. OCCS is \n     the state's licensing agency responsible for setting and \n     enforcing strong health, safety and education standards for \n     child care programs throughout the Commonwealth. OCCS is also \n     the lead state agency responsible for the administration and \n     purchase of all human services child care subsidies across \n     the state. As a result, this agency is greatly invested in \n     the availability of these child care programs and in \n     increasing the capacity of child care services to benefit \n     more families in the Commonwealth.\n       Currently there are approximately 17,000 licensed child \n     care facilities in the Commonwealth which can provide \n     services to over 200,000 children. Many of these facilities \n     are non-profit programs that serve low-income families that \n     are receiving child care subsidies to help them become or \n     remain employed, and families that are or were receiving \n     TANF. The availability and accessibility of child care is one \n     of the main reasons that families can continue to \n     successfully transition from welfare to work. There are \n     currently approximately 18,000 children on the waiting list \n     for a child care subsidy. The reauthorization of TANF may \n     further increase the number of families seeking subsidized \n     child care and Massachusetts must be ready to provide quality \n     care. Accordingly, current and future non-profit programs \n     will greatly benefit from the expansion of the SBA 504 loan \n     program, as will the families that they serve.\n       OCCS is a member of the Advisory Committee on Child Care \n     and Small Business and fully supports the Committee's mission \n     of uniting the small business and child care communities to \n     help providers maximize their income while providing quality \n     child care. Expansion of the SBA 504 loan program will \n     undoubtedly help expand the availability and accessibility of \n     quality child care. Thank you for your support of this \n     important legislation. If I can be of further assistance \n     please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ardith Wieworka,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Western Massachusetts\n\n\n                                        Enterprise Fund, Inc.,\n\n                                    Greenfield, MA, July 12, 2002.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing in strong support of the \n     legislation to expand the use of the SBA 504 program to \n     include the financing of non-profit childcare centers.\n       As a member of Senator Kerry's Childcare Advisory Committee \n     and the Executive Director of the Western Massachusetts \n     Enterprise Fund (which makes loans to non-profits), I have \n     seen a clear need for both more flexible and lower cost \n     financing.\n       The SBA 504 program meets both those needs. By providing up \n     to 40 percent financing, the SBA 504 program can help \n     childcare centers more easily leverage bank financing. \n     Additionally, the program offers highly competitive interest \n     rates.\n       Finally, allowing the SBA to make loans to non-profit \n     childcare centers is not new to the agency. The SBA is \n     already making working capital loans to non-profit childcare \n     centers through its Microenterprise Loan Fund Program.\n       If you have any questions, please to not hesitate to \n     contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Christopher Sikes,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Kyl, Mr. Coleman, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 823. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the expeditious coverage of new medical technology under \nthe Medicare program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ncolleague, Senator Blanche Lincoln, as well as Senators Jeffords, Kyl, \nColeman and Clinton, in introducing the Medicare Innovation \nResponsiveness Act of 2003.\n  Given all that is going on in the world today, it is sometimes \ndifficult to focus on issues related to Medicare coverage, coding and \npayment procedures. But we must, because every day there are seniors \nand people with disabilities in need of lifesaving and life-enhancing \nmedical treatments and technologies.\n  And every day, there are creative people in Pennsylvania, Arkansas, \nand all across our great country developing new ways to prevent and \ntreat illness and save lives. Medicare patients should not be denied \naccess to these new procedures and technologies because the Medicare \nprogram is slow to respond to innovations in medical care and the \nchanging needs of patients.\n  Congress passed legislation with strong bipartisan support in 1999 \nand in 2000 to try to address these problems. Unfortunately, however, \nMedicare has failed to deliver on key commitments in the legislation \nand these barriers persist.\n  That is why we are here today--to introduce legislation that will \nfinally make timely access to lifesaving advanced medical tests and \ntreatments for Medicare patients a reality. Our bill builds on \nconstructive approaches the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nCMS, has taken recently to help Medicare keep up with advancements in \ntreating patients.\n  For example, CMS recently took proactive, unprecedented steps to \naddress one of the newest innovations in minimally invasive cardiology \nthat will soon be available for patients: drug-eluting stents. These \ntiny medal scaffolds, long-used to reopen blocked heart arteries, can \nbe more effective now that researchers have combined them with time-\nreleased drugs to prevent the growth of unwanted cells. The Agency \nestablished new hospital inpatient codes and reimbursements for the new \nstints because it recognized that the technology will quickly become \nthe standard of care when approved by\n\n[[Page S4973]]\n\nFDA in the coming weeks. The Agency understood the potential the stents \nhold to transform patient care and health care delivery--and acted in a \ntimely fashion.\n  This forward-looking approach should be the rule, not the exception, \nin dealing with new treatment breakthroughs. And that is what our \nlegislation today seeks to achieve.\n  At an event where Senator Lincoln and I spoke to underscore the need \nfor this legislation, we were pleased to be joined by medical \nprofessionals from our respective states, people who took time out of \ntheir busy schedules to come to Washington, DC and help us explain the \nimportance of some of the provisions in the bill we are introducing \ntoday.\n  For example, three years after a mandate from Congress, Medicare has \nyet to provide special transitional payments for any new medical device \nused in the inpatient setting. As a result, Medicare will continue to \ntake anywhere from 15 months to five years to integrate a new medical \ntechnology into the inpatient setting--and that is after it has already \nbeen approved as safe and effective by the FDA. Dr. Mark Wholey from \nPittsburgh is involved in research on carotid stenting, and he \ncommented today on the promise of this new treatment option and the \nimportance of reducing barriers to Medicare patient access for new and \ninnovative technologies.\n  In another area of coverage policy, Medicare discourages development \nof breakthrough devices like heart assist devices because it does not \ncover the routine costs of clinical trials for many innovative \ntechnologies. Dr. Walter Pae, Professor of Surgery at Penn State \nUniversity, also came to Washington today to share some details of the \npioneering work he is doing at Hershey Medical Center and to reinforce \nthe importance of patient access to these promising clinical trials.\n  These reforms are reasonable and bipartisan. Most importantly, they \nare critical to patients in need of new and breakthrough technologies. \nI look forward to working with Senator Lincoln and my colleagues on the \nFinance Committee in moving these important reforms in Committee and \nthe Senate this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Kennedy, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 825. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to protect pension \nbenefits of employees in defined benefit plans and to direct the \nSecretary of the Treasury to enforce the age discrimination \nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code 1986; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in the early 1990s, a large number of U.S. \ncompanies began a process of switching their defined benefit pension \nplans to cash balance plans. Many of the employees whose pension plans \nwere to be altered drastically weren't told and didn't notice that they \nwere essentially going to be working for years without earning any more \nbenefits. Their not knowing was viewed as a key benefit by management. \nAnd the retirees were furious.\n  As Keith Williams with Watson Wyatt Worldwide and Amy Viener with \nWilliam Mercer, two firms that put together these plans in 1998 said at \nan Actuaries conference:\n\n       Mr. Williams: I've been involved in cash balance plans five \n     or six years down the road and what I have found is that \n     while employees understand it, it is not until they are \n     actually ready to retire that they understand how little they \n     are actually getting.\n       Ms. Viener: Right, but they're happy while they're \n     employed.\n\n  One of the most abusive practices in cash balance conversions is \nknown as ``wear away.'' Older workers see nothing added to their \npensions as the value of the pensions is frozen, often for many years, \nuntil it reaches the lower value of the new pension plan. At the same \ntime younger workers are getting their pensions increased. In my view, \nthis is clearly age discrimination and bad pension policy. In 1999, I \nintroduced a bill to make it illegal for corporations wear away the \nbenefits of older workers during conversions to cash balance plans. I \noffered my bill as an amendment. Forty-eight Senators, including 3 \nRepublicans, voted to waive the budget point of order so we could \nconsider this amendment. We did not have enough votes then, but I \nbelieve the tide is turning.\n  After that vote, more and more stories came out about how many \nworkers were losing their pensions. In September of 1999, the Secretary \nof the Treasury put a moratorium on conversions from defined benefit \nplans to cash balance plans. That moratorium has been in effect now for \nover three years. In April of 2000, I offered a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution to stop this practice, and it passed the Senate unanimously.\n  But last December, the Treasury decided to end that moratorium. The \nDepartment proposed a regulation that will allow hundreds of companies, \nmany employing thousands of workers each to go forward with conversions \nthat will allow for the wear-away of the current benefits of people \nacross the country. This plan is breathtaking in its audacity. In a \ntime when people have lost their life savings to market downturns and \ncorporate duplicity, they are looking at changing the rules so that \nemployers can once again bolster their bottom line by shifting funds \nfrom the pensions they promised their workers. I will not stand by and \nlet it happen.\n  There are over 800 age discrimination complaints currently pending \nbefore the EEOC based on cash balance conversions. How many more will \nthere be if we again start allowing companies to make these abusive \nconversions?\n  I want to make it very clear: I am not opposed to all cash balance \nplans. Some cash balance plans can be very good. What I oppose is the \nunilateral decision of a company being able to change their plans and \nstop contributing to older employees' pensions while benefits are given \nto newer employees.\n  That is what this issue is all about. It is fairness. It is equity. I \nknow discussion of pension law can become very convoluted. But in \nessence, what some of these companies have been doing to these workers \nis nothing less than sheer thievery. They are able to save millions, in \nsome cases hundreds of millions of dollars, by converting their plans, \nrobbing workers who have been loyal and hard working, robbing them of \ntheir rightful claims on future benefits, It is not right. It is not \nfair.\n  There is one thing that has distinguished the American workplace from \nothers around the world. We have valued loyalty. At least we used to. \nThat is one of the reasons pension plans exist--the longer you work \nsomewhere, the more you earn in your pension program. Obviously, the \nlonger you work someplace, the better you do your job, the more you \nlearn about it, the more productive you are. We should value that \nloyalty.\n  If companies are able to wear away the benefits of the longest \nserving workers, what kind of a signal does that send to the workers? \nIt tells workers they are fools if they are loyal because if you put in \n20 to 25 years, the boss can just change the rules of the game, and \nbreak their promise. It tells younger workers that it would be crazy to \nwork for a company for a long time, that it's best to hedge your bets \nand move on as soon as it is convenient.\n  This destroys the kind of work ethic we have come to value and that \nwe know built this country. But some of these cash balance conversions \ncounter all of that. Her is an analogy. Imagine I hire someone for five \nyears with a promise of a $50,000 bonus at the end of five years of \nservice. At the end of three years, however, I renege on the $50,000 \nbonus. But the employee has three years invested. Had they known that \nthe deal was going to be off, perhaps they would not have gone to work \nfor me. They could have gone to work someplace else for a total higher \ncompensation package. Is that the way we want to treat workers in this \ncountry, where the employer has all the cards and employees have none, \nand employers can make whatever deal they want, but can change the \nrules at any time?\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation. It is simple. It says \nthat you have to give older, longer serving employees a choice, at \nretirement, when their pension plan is converted to a cash balance plan \nto get the benefits earned in the old plan instead. It also says that \nemployers must start counting the new cash balance benefits where the \nold defined benefit plan left off, instead of starting the cash balance\n\n[[Page S4974]]\n\nplan at a lower level than an employee had already earned.\n  In the March 3, 2002 issue of Fortune magazine, Janice Revell said of \nthe possible impending flood of cash balances conversions: ``Brace \nyourself for a very un-fairy-tale ending to this tory. Millions of \nAmerican workers are sure to see a large slice of their retirement \nincome go up in smoke. It may not happen right away, but the groundwork \nis being laid right now.''\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in cosponsoring this \nmeasure, so that we can stop the flood before it starts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4974-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 107--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE TO DESIGNATE \n    THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 2003 AS ``NATIONAL MILITARY FAMILY MONTH''\n\n  Mr. INOUYE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor all our military \nfamilies by introducing a Resolution to designate November 2003, as \nNational Military Family Month. As we all know, memories fade and the \nhardships experienced by our military families are easily forgotten \nunless they touch our own immediate family.\n  Today, we have our men and women deployed all over the world, engaged \nin this war on terrorism. These far-ranging military deployments are \nextremely difficult on the families who bear this heavy burden.\n  To honor these families, the Armed Services YMCA has sponsored \nMilitary Family Week in late November since 1996. However, due to \nfrequent ``short week'' conflicts around the Thanksgiving holidays, the \ndesignated week has not always afforded enough time to schedule \nobservance on and near our military bases.\n  I believe a month long observation will allow greater opportunity to \nplan events. Moreover, it will provide a greater opportunity to \nstimulate media support.\n  A Concurrent Resolution will help pave the way for this effort. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this tribute to our military \nfamilies.\n  I request unanimous consent that the full text of my resolution be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4974-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 108--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF APRIL 21 THROUGH APRIL \n              27 2003, AS ``NATIONAL COWBOY POETRY WEEK''\n\n  Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. \nReid) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I would like to submit a resolution for \nconsideration by the Senate marking the last week in April as ``Cowboy \nPoetry Week.'' Many think cowboys are a thing of the past, but I can \ntell you otherwise. In many western States like Montana, cowboys gather \naround a campfire and swap stories just as frequently as they did one \nhundred years ago. This oral tradition is now captured in written form \nas well, and several websites are dedicated solely to preserving and \ndisseminating cowboy poetry and its history. My resolution will \nrecognize the contribution of cowboy poetry to our history of the West, \nbut also to mark it as a thriving tradition that continues even today. \nI thank my colleagues Senators Baucus, Brownback, Hatch, and Reid for \ntheir support on this issue. The life of cowboys should not be \nrelegated to small weekly radio shows or features done on public \ntelevision; it is important to understand that cowboys live and breathe \na unique culture which few may be exposed to. I would encourage all my \ncolleagues to take a walk in their boots one day, and read a little \ncowboy poetry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4974-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4974-S4975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 109--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \n                                TO POLIO\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 109\n\n       Whereas polio has caused millions of casualties through \n     history, paralyzing millions and killing untold numbers of \n     others;\n       Whereas polio remains a public health threat in today's \n     world, despite being easily preventable by vaccination;\n       Whereas polio is now limited to 10 countries, with the \n     distinct possibility that it can be once and forever \n     extinguished as an affliction on mankind by ensuring the \n     vaccination of all children in these countries under the age \n     of 5;\n       Whereas a Global Polio Eradication Initiative exists that \n     seeks to once and forever end polio as an illness, which \n     includes efforts underway by the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention; and\n       Whereas the United States has the capacity to act to speed \n     the eradication of polio by assisting in the targeting of its \n     few remaining reservoirs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses serious concern about the continuing menace \n     posed by polio;\n       (2) implores the United Nations and its component agencies, \n     the private sector, private voluntary organizations and non-\n     governmental organizations, concerned States, and \n     international financial institutions to act with haste and \n     manifold dedication to eradicate polio as soon as possible; \n     and\n       (3) calls upon the executive branch to provide the \n     necessary human and material resources to end the scourge of \n     polio once and for all, including closely monitoring \n     laboratory stocks of the polio virus.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution supporting \nglobal efforts to eradicate the scourge of polio from the face of the \nearth.\n  It was not so long ago that American parents were afraid to send \ntheir children to public swimming pools in the summer for fear that \nthey would contact this deadly disease. More than 57,000 cases were \nreported in the United States in 1952. President Franklin Roosevelt, \nhimself disabled by polio, established the March of Dimes in 1938 to \nfind a cure for the disease. Sixteen years later, mass vaccination \nbegan, using a serum developed by Dr. Jonas Salk. Infections declined \nnearly 90 percent within three years. Routine administration of the \nSalk vaccine, and the subsequent oral vaccine developed by Dr. Albert \nSabin, soon relegated polio to the history books in the United States \nand many other countries. The disease continued to take its toll, \nhowever, in those parts of the world where universal vaccination was \nbeyond people's means.\n  In 1988, the World Health Assembly set a goal of eradicating polio \nworldwide by the year 2000. In that year there were an estimated \n350,000 polio cases in 125 countries. The World Health Organization, \nthe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF, and Rotary \nInternational spearheaded a global campaign to eradicate polio, as \nsmallpox had been eradicated in 1979. As a result of this campaign, the \nWestern Hemisphere was certified polio free in 1994. The Western \nPacific--including the world's largest country, China--followed suit in \n2000.\n\n[[Page S4975]]\n\nBut polio hung on in 10 countries in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle \nEast, with 480 cases reported in 2001. Since then, Europe has been \ncertified polio-free. But the disease has bounced back in India and \nNigeria, and there were 1,462 cases reported in seven countries in \n2002. The eradication target has been extended to 2005.\n  This resolution seeks to bolster the efforts of the WHO, UNICEF, CDC \nand Rotary International to eliminate this dreaded disease once and for \nall. It has been estimated that doing so would produce direct, global \nfinancial benefits of $1.7 billion a year mostly by eliminating the \nneed for further vaccinations and their associated risks and would free \nmillions from fear.\n  I especially want to commend the efforts of Rotary members worldwide, \nwho have set a goal of raising $80 million this year for polio \neradication. Rotary has committed more than $500 million to the \ncampaign since 1988. This represents the finest spirit of community \naction to address global problems, harkening back to when American \nfamilies collected dimes to wipe out polio in this country. I urge all \nmy colleagues to emulate the spirit of the Rotarians by supporting this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/08/senate-section/article/S4975-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 110--HONORING MARY JANE JENKINS OGILVIE, WIFE OF \n        FORMER SENATE CHAPLAIN, REVEREND DR.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 110, which was \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 110) honoring Mary Jane Jenkins \n     Ogilvie, wife of former Senate Chaplain, Reverend Dr. Lloyd \n     John Ogilvie.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would like to comment, Mr. President, about Mary Jane \nOgilvie. Many public men are described in their own right for their own \naccomplishments, and then their wives are referred to casually.\n  Senator Alan Simpson's wife, who took my wife under her wing when we \nfirst came here, described it this way. She said: ``We are just LWOs, \nwhich means `lovely wives of.' ''\n  Mary Jane Ogilvie was indeed the lovely wife of our Chaplain, Lloyd \nOgilvie, but she was far, far more than an appendage to her husband. \nShe had her own contribution to make to this body and to all of the \nMembers in it.\n  Many wives of important men do not want to have anything to do with \ntheir husbands' careers and create areas of their own. They do not have \nan interest in what their husband does. Mary Jane Ogilvie was an \nincredibly important part of Lloyd Ogilvie's entire career.\n  The two of them were a team, inseparable. Her faith was as strong as \nhis. Her dedication to the ministry and to the Gospel, as they \nunderstood it, was as deep as his. And her friendships forged here in \nthe Senate were as strong as his. She was, as I say, an integral part \nof the ministry he performed here.\n  When she became too ill to carry on her portion of that ministry, he \nwas unable to carry on his, which was very appropriate, in my view, \nbecause they were a team. He had his priorities straight, and he \nrealized that, as important as his work here was, his duty to his wife \nwas even greater.\n  When it became necessary for her, as she sought to find treatment for \nher condition, to move to California, there was never a doubt in Lloyd \nOgilvie's mind that he would move with her. They were a team.\n  Some would have said: Well, she is hospitalized. I have a career. I \nwill stay here. I will call her on weekends or get out there when I \ncan, but I will let her go forward on her own. Lloyd Ogilvie is not \nthat kind of a man, and their marriage was not that kind of a marriage. \nWhen she needed him, she had him, which is a manifestation of the fact \nthat when he needed her, he had her.\n  So this resolution is but a small token of the Senate's gratitude for \nthe contribution that Mary Jane Ogilvie made to the lives of all of us.\n  My wife and I were privileged enough to become friends of this team. \nWe went to dinner together. We had conversations about our families. We \nhad conversations about religion. We had\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\nconversations about the Senate and its spiritual health. As the leader \nof the Senate Prayer Breakfast during the time that Lloyd Ogilvie was \nour Chaplain, I got to know both of them extremely well.\n  It is with great sorrow that we note her passage. But as I have said \nbefore of others to whom we have had to say good-bye in this fashion, \nwe do not mourn for Mary Jane. We know where Mary Jane is. We know that \nall is well with her. Our sense of loss is for ourselves and the fact \nthat we have been deprived now of her company, her spirit, and the joy \nof her life.\n  I join with Senator Kyl and thank Senator Kyl for this resolution in \npaying tribute to a woman whose contribution to the Senate is not \nreflected in the payroll or any official record but is engraved in the \nhearts of all of us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; and that any statements relating to this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I would like \nto extend, through the Chair, to my friend from Utah the appreciation \nof the whole Senate for the content of the remarks of the Senator from \nUtah and the manner in which they were delivered.\n  Those of us who know Lloyd Ogilvie certainly have great respect for \nhim. I told him personally. My first knowledge of his presence was when \nI attended the funeral of the late departed Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nCoverdell. He did such a remarkable job at that funeral. Even though I \nhad seen him here and listened to him give prayers many times, that was \nthe first time I had really felt his presence.\n  I did not know his wife Mary Jane well. I had met her, but that was \nall. It was good to hear from the Senator from Utah about his knowledge \nof Mary Jane Ogilvie, who Reverend Ogilvie talked to me about many \ntimes, as every morning we were here together.\n  So I think the remarks of the Senator from Utah were timely. And I, \non behalf of the whole Senate, extend my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \nkind comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 110) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 110\n\n       Whereas Mary Jane Jenkins Ogilvie, a friend to the United \n     States Senate who succumbed April 1, 2003, to infirmities \n     that she had battled courageously over many years was--\n       (1) petite in size, but grand in character, a woman with \n     strong independent status, while still being steadfastly \n     supportive of her husband during his chaplaincy;\n       (2) an active, vibrant, frank, honest, vigorous, and warm \n     friend, especially to many Senate spouses, during her eight \n     years here;\n       (3) a loving wife and mother who, though she missed her \n     family in California, was a vital partner in her husband's \n     service to the Senate, near the end of which she returned \n     home to California;\n       (4) a devout woman, a fighter to the end, an individual \n     impressive for her style, her spirit, and her strong faith; \n     and\n       (5) the center of her family, cherished by her husband \n     Lloyd, her children Heather, Scott, and Andrew, and her \n     grandchildren Erin, Airley, Bonnie, and Scotter: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) mourns the loss of Mary Jane Jenkins Ogilvie;\n       (2) recognizes her contributions to the Senate family;\n       (3) admires her courage and loyalty; and\n       (4) expresses gratitude that she is now with the Lord.\n\n     SEC. 2.
