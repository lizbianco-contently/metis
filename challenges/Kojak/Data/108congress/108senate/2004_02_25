There will be plenty of time on the \nbill to deliver those statements once the bill is before the Senate.\n  I expect amendments will be offered during today's session, and \ntherefore Members can expect rollcall votes today. We will alert \neveryone as these votes are scheduled.\n  Finally, I encourage any Member who intends to offer an amendment to \nthe bill to contact their respective cloakrooms as soon as possible.

Mr. President, I will use leader time for a statement \nunrelated to the legislation before us.\n  Every year since 1926, Americans have set aside time in February to \nrecognize and celebrate black history. We owe this celebration of Black \nHistory Month to Carter G. Woodson, a brilliant and determined son of \nformer slaves, who made it his mission to write African Americans into \nAmerica's history books.\n  Black History Month actually started out as Black History Week. Dr. \nWoodson chose the second week in February because it marks the \nbirthdays of two men who greatly influenced African American history: \nAbraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.\n  Dr. Woodson said:\n\n       We should emphasize not Negro history, but the Negro in \n     history. What we need is not a history of selected races or \n     nations, but a history of the world void of national bias, \n     race hate, and religious prejudice.\n\n  In 1870, in order to rejoin the Union, the Mississippi State \nLegislature needed to choose someone to fill the seat in the Senate \nonce held by Jefferson Davis. They chose an ordained minister named \nHiram Rhodes Revels.\n  On February 25--134 years ago today--visitors in the Senate galleries\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\nburst into applause as Senator Revels became the first African American \never to serve in the Senate.\n  Five years later, Mississippi sent America its second African \nAmerican Senator, Blanche Kelso Bruce, the first African American to \nserve a full term in the Senate.\n  Although he served only 6 years, Senator Bruce distinguished himself \nas a passionate advocate of civil rights for blacks, Native Americans, \nChinese immigrants, and even former Confederates.\n  Besides Mississippi, there was another bond that connected these \nextraordinary men: a fierce commitment to education.\n  During the Civil War, Hiram Revels not only raised two black \nregiments for the Union Army and fought at one of the war's bloodiest \nbattles, he established a school for freedmen in St. Louis. After \nserving in the Senate, he became president of a college in Mississippi.\n  Blanche Bruce was born a slave. His first teacher was a tutor hired \nto teach his master's son. At 20, he escaped slavery and became a \nteacher in Missouri. He later attended Oberlin College and spent much \nof his life after the Senate working to bring learning to former \nslaves, their children, and grandchildren.\n  It is fitting we remember these two great men of history in this \nChamber where they made history, and it is especially appropriate that \nwe remember them this year, on the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board \nof Education, the Supreme Court ruling that declared once and forever \nthat in America, no child can be consigned to a second-class school on \nthe basis of race.\n  All Americans--not just African Americans, all Americans--are the \nbeneficiaries of the Brown decision. It has made America stronger \nspiritually by realigning our public institutions with our great \nguiding principles.\n  It has also made America strong economically, socially, politically, \nintellectually, artistically, militarily, and in so many other ways by \nrequiring every child in America--every child--be given the opportunity \nto make the most of his or her God-given potential.\n  In this Black History Month especially, America remembers and honors \nThurgood Marshall and Linda Brown, the giant at the head of the NAACP \nbrilliant legal team in Brown, and the brave little 8-year-old girl at \nthe center of the case. We also remember and honor all those who helped \nthem--and there were many--because it takes many people of good will to \nright great wrongs. But it is not enough to remember great turning \npoints in our past. We should also rededicate ourselves to the great \nprinciples at the heart of the Brown decision.\n  This Black History Month, the right of every child in America to \nattend a good school and get a good education, regardless of race or \nincome, is once again in jeopardy. The threat to equal educational \nopportunity today is not as obvious or virulent as it was before Brown. \nWe no longer tolerate laws that say some children can be consigned to \nsecond-rate schools and third- or fourth-rate futures. In fact, our \nlaws today promise to leave no child behind. But the law is not being \nfunded. It is a check written on insufficient funds.\n  I was the first in my family to graduate from college. I could not \nhave gone to college had it not been for the ROTC scholarship I had.\n  I voted for No Child Left Behind because I believe every child in \nAmerica deserves the same opportunities I have been given. I voted for \nNo Child Left Behind because I know investing in the minds of young \npeople is the smartest, most productive investment a nation can make. I \nvoted for No Child Left Behind because I support accountability and \nbecause I have no doubt that students, teachers, principals, parents, \nand school board members in South Dakota and across the country can \nmeet higher standards as long as they are given the resources.\n  I voted for No Child Left Behind because President Bush gave his word \nthat the law would be funded, but that is not what has happened. In the \n2 years since President Bush signed the law, he has proposed three \nbudgets to Congress. All three times, the President has drastically \nunderfunded his own education reform plan. The education budget \nPresident Bush recommended for next year falls $9.4 billion short of \nwhat was originally promised in No Child Left Behind, $9.4 billion less \nthan what is needed to make it work.\n  The program that is most critical to closing the achievement gap \nbetween minority and nonminority students, title I, is cut the \ndeepest--more than $7.1 billion below what the law promises. The \nPresident's education budget does not leave one child behind; it leaves \n4.6 million children behind, and a disproportionate number of them are \nAfrican American and members of other minorities.\n  The President's budget also makes deep cuts in afterschool programs \ndespite strong evidence that good afterschool programs keep children \nsafe and help them academically. It provides less than half the share \nof special education costs the Federal Government committed in 1975. It \nslashes career and technical education. It eliminates dropout \nprevention programs. Despite promising during the campaign of 2000 and \nagain last month in the State of the Union Address to raise the maximum \nPell grant by $1,000, the President's budget actually freezes Pell \ngrants next year for the third year in a row. Three years ago, the \nmaximum Pell grant paid 42 percent of the average annual cost of \nattending college. Today, it covers only 34 percent.\n  The President's neglect of education and his repeated refusal to fund \neven his own educational plan is hurting America. It is hurting \nAfrican-American and other minority children disproportionately. This \nis not a partisan criticism. Republican legislators in Arizona and \nMinnesota have introduced bills that would allow their States to \npartially opt out of No Child Left Behind. They consider it an unfunded \nmandate.\n  Legislatures in at least 10 other States have adopted resolutions \ncriticizing the law and seeking waivers from parts of it. In Utah, a \nRepublican-dominated House has voted not to implement No Child Left \nBehind unless Federal funds are provided adequately. States are being \nput in a horrible bind: Accept huge, costly, unfunded mandates or give \nup tens of millions of dollars or more in Federal education aid, much \nof which is intended and which works to close the achievement gap.\n  Brown v. Board of Education is one of the most inspiring chapters in \nour Nation's history. It gave all American children the promise of \nequal educational opportunity and the No Child Left Behind Act \nreaffirmed that promise in principle, but the promise is hollow unless \nwe fund it. When the Senate debates the budget resolution, we will be \noffering amendments to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act and to \nmake other critical investments in education and training.\n  It is important we remember our history. It is also essential that we \nkeep our promises and invest in our future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/25/senate-section/article/S1532-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1805, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (S. 1805) to prohibit civil \n     liability actions from being brought or continued against \n     manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of \n     firearms or ammunition for damages resulting from the misuse \n     of their products by others.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:30 a.m. will be equally divided between the Senator from \nIdaho, Mr. Craig, and the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, or their \ndesignees.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the leader has obviously taken time. We \nthought we were going to have an hour on each side. Is the vote still \nscheduled for 10:30, or does the leader's time count in that?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The vote will be at 10:30. The time \nhas been reduced proportionately.\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I think we can live with that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. For the information of the \nSenators, each side will have 23 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I believe several of my colleagues will want to be on the \nfloor to speak prior to the cloture vote. As the leadership has said, \nthere is a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1805, the \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. We will vote on that at \n10:30 this morning.\n  I regret that a few of our colleagues are forcing us to go through \nthis procedural step instead of simply moving to the bill. This bill is \nsupported by a strong bipartisan majority in the Senate, and I believe \nas we work our way through it, that kind of bipartisan relationship \nwill clearly demonstrate itself. More than half the Senators, as I have \nsaid, both Republicans and Democrats, are cosponsors of our \nlegislation, including the leadership of both parties. A very similar \nbill passed in the House nearly a year ago by a 2-to-1 vote margin, or \nnearly that margin.\n  Some of our colleagues have already announced they intend to play \npolitics with this bill instead of debating its merits. They have \nalready announced their intention to throw a variety of nonrelated \nbills or amendments at this important--the legislation my guess is to \nattempt to divert the legislation and delay the completion of its \nconsideration. However, I believe this morning's vote will demonstrate \nthat a majority of the Senate is, indeed, ready to proceed to this bill \nand to debate it, as we should, offer legitimate amendments, debate \nthose amendments fully, and vote them up or down if necessary.\n  This legislation addresses a crisis in our courts and the integrity \nof our courts because our courts are now threatened by the kind of \nlawsuits that are simply not necessary but politically motivated. For a \nlong time, the trial bar has attempted to use the court system to \nlegislate social policy or legal activity in this country. What this \nbill does, and what we have worked to do and why it has gained the \nsupport it has, is craft a very narrow exception in the law so that we \nstill hold those responsible accountable for their actions under all \nlaws.\n  What we have always said within the law is that someone cannot be \nheld accountable for someone else's actions, and if someone is \nattempting to reach back through the law when someone is innocent and \nlegal in their acts, then that kind of thing ought to stop. That is why \nwe have worked hard to craft it narrowly.\n  I think Americans clearly understand what we are attempting to do, \nand that is our goal. I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of \ncloture so that we can get into the full and robust debate of this \nlegislation. It is important.\n  I will turn to my colleague, Senator Reed, who will be handling the \nopposition, and then I believe at that time we will probably have \nseveral of our colleagues who wish to speak to it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the so-called \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. At a time when this country \nis faced with extraordinary problems--with economic problems, \ninternational problems--we are devoting very precious time to \nlegislation that is in behalf of a special interest rather than dealing \nwith the broader public interest, the economy of this country and the \ninternational position and status of this country.\n  This is not legislation that is designed to protect the courts. This \nis legislation that is designed to protect gun dealers, the gun \nindustry, manufacturers, and trade associations such as the National \nRifle Association. To suggest this is simply a response to politically \nmotivated cases flies in the face of cases that have been filed, like \nthe cases of the victims of the sniper shootings here in Washington, \nDC; people like Bernice Johnson, whose husband was sitting on a bus \nreading his paper waiting to go on and run his route that day and was \nkilled. It subsequently turns out the weapon that was used in this \ncrime came from a dealer in Washington State who apparently couldn't \naccount for 238 weapons. Mrs. Johnson is not suing to make a political \npoint. She is suing simply because she lost her husband, the father of \nher children, and she would like to hold responsible those people who \nwere negligent.\n  The suggestion that this is a minor exception to the law when people \nare acting legally, following a statute, flies in the face of our \nconcept of civil liability. It is not a question of just following the \nlaw. It is also a question of being responsible for your actions, of \nnot being negligent, of taking due care in the performance of your \nlegal duties. This whole approach is something I think flies in the \nface of basic common sense and the basic law of this country.\n  We are struggling with huge problems across this Nation. Yet we are \nspending precious time here to try to deal with the interests of a \nspecial group of people, a very influential group of people. We are not \nout protecting the rights of Mrs. Johnson and others bringing this \nsuit. We are protecting the rights, frankly, of the gun industry to be \nnegligent and harm people through their negligence.\n  This legislation is not a minor, carefully crafted exception. It \nwould wipe out virtually every opportunity to assess whether a gun \ndealer, a gun manufacturer, or a trade association was negligent in \ntheir activities. It would bar virtually all negligence for product \nliability in State and Federal courts and throw out all pending cases, \ncases that have already been filed prior to this date, prior to the \npotential enactment of this legislation. It is a sweeping immunity to \ngun dealers, gun manufacturers, and even trade associations such as the \nNational Rifle Association.\n  It is no wonder the gun lobby dropped this legislation in the 107th \nCongress, because we were paralyzed here in Washington by a sniper--two \nsnipers, it turns out--who killed people with weapons that were \nobtained through the apparent negligence of a gun dealer. Yet these \nindividuals, these victims and their families, would be denied the \nright to go to court because of this legislation.\n  It is also ironic that this would be the first gun bill to be enacted \nsince Columbine, a situation in which, again, young people, disturbed \nyoung people, were able to go to a gun show using a straw purchaser, \nusing the loophole that exists in buying weapons without a background \ncheck, and then went into a high school in Colorado and wreaked havoc. \nInstead of closing the gun show loophole, we are now trying to open up \na huge highway for the negligence of gun dealers, negligence of the gun \nindustry.\n\n  Talking about the procedural correctness of this approach, this \nlegislation did not go through the Senate Judiciary Committee. There \nwere no hearings, no committee markups were ever scheduled. This very \ncomplicated issue of balancing the rights of plaintiffs versus the \nrights of defendants in the context of civil litigation was never fully \nassessed through hearings. Now we are here and now we must have a \nvigorous debate on this legislation. We must not only look to the \nspecifics of this legislation but also to its impact across the country \nand address some larger issues of gun violence in the United States.\n  Two years ago or so, it was the Washington area snipers who paralyzed \nthis country, certainly paralyzed this area of the country. Today there \nis apparently one or perhaps more gunmen who are stalking innocent \npeople on the highways of Ohio.\n  Gun violence exists and we should do more to stop it. We should use \nthis opportunity to pass provisions that will close the gun show \nloophole, that would reauthorize the ban on assault weapons that has \noperated in the last few years at least to keep the most dangerous \nweapons out of the hands of some very dangerous people. We should \nrequire effective safety locks on handguns. We should improve the \nnational instant criminal background check system so there is a more \naccurate and more effective system of checking.\n  These are the things we should be doing and I hope we can have an \nopportunity to offer amendments in this regard. Every day there are \nhundreds of thousands, millions of families who struggle to do all they \ncan to protect their children and themselves. Here we are telling the \ngun industry: Don't join that effort to make people safer. You can \nignore reasonable, responsible actions. You can be negligent and you \nwill not be brought to justice.\n  I think that is wrong. I think that is bad law, bad public policy. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, to\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\noppose this motion to go forward. There are much more pressing demands \nin this country we should address today: the unemployed, those who are \nstruggling to find jobs in a jobless economy; funding fully our \nnational defense. We have a budget that was presented to us that does \nnot include any money for Iraq and Afghanistan. That is something we \nshould be focused on today.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I commend my colleague for his statement this morning. I \nwant to underscore the last point he is making.\n  Here we are with the highest unemployment figure since the Great \nDepression and we are debating the gun issue. I come from a State that \nprobably has more manufacturers of guns than any other in the country. \nI think Connecticut is still the largest manufacturer. The idea we are \ngoing to take an entire industry and exclude it from liability should \nthere be a just cause to bring them to a bar of justice is rather \nremarkable to me in light of everything else going on in the country. \nSo I commend my colleague from Rhode Island. We come from the same \nregion of the country. We have lost 45,000 jobs in my State in the \nmanufacturing sector in the last 30 months. I ask whether, in his view, \nthere aren't higher priorities we ought to be addressing other than \nexcusing an entire industry from liability against negligence?\n\n  Mr. REED. Reclaiming my time, I agree entirely with the Senator from \nConnecticut. Rhode Island, like Connecticut, is seeing its \nmanufacturing base evaporate. These are real problems. These are \nproblems that affect families throughout this country. This is truly in \nthe public interest, finding an answer to disappearing jobs throughout \nthe country. Yet today we want to protect one very special interest.\n  Let me add, too, as the Senator points out, not only are we trying to \ngive an unprecedented immunity to one industry, this industry is \nvirtually unregulated in the sense of other industries. It is not \ncontrolled by the Product Safety Commission, which would look at the \nproduct design. So one of the only recourses an individual has with \nrespect to negligence claims is through the courts. Here we are eroding \nthat avenue.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. If he will yield further?\n  Mr. REED. I will.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I will join him in opposing cloture \non this bill and I hope the leadership would move on with another issue \nthat I guarantee has a far higher priority with the American public \nthan to satisfy one industry's fear that they might have to appear \nbefore the bar of justice to explain their behavior. The idea we would \nexclude this industry--we tried to do that on another issue on the MTBE \nissue that came up on the energy bill. As my colleague may know, I \noffered the securities reform bill, the National Standards legislation, \nY2K, terrorism insurance. I am also a strong advocate of class action \nreform. I am not an opponent at all of trying to reform the tort \nsystem. But the idea that we would eliminate an entire industry from \nliability due to the potentiality of their products for causing great \nharm is amazing to me. Given the challenges our country faces, it is \namazing we would spend time on this legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for his leadership on this issue. I worked with him and I will \ncontinue. I would like to ask him this question.\n  Am I correct that yesterday the item of business before us was to \nexempt individuals who had been held liable for creating medical \ninjuries from their full accountability and liability in medical \nmalpractice, including pharmaceutical companies and medical device \ncompanies? That was the item on the agenda yesterday. Now, today, we \nare taking up the exemption from liability for gun manufacturers and \ndealers. Does the Senator from Rhode Island detect a pattern here, that \neach day of the week we are going to try to single out another special \ninterest group and give them an exemption from accountability and \nliability in courts in America?\n  I think he is accurate in his description of what we have been doing \nin the last couple of days, which is trying to not provide for the \npublic interest but to protect special interests, and not to provide \nindividual citizens a right, regretfully, when they have been harmed, \nat least a right to make a determination of who should be held liable, \nbut simply and categorically strip away these rights and to protect \nindustries that have powerful influence in Washington.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator: Did he not say this \nbill has never gone through a committee for hearings and for our close \nscrutiny in determining exactly what the impact would be?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Senator is right. There have been no \nhearings. This bill has been brought to the floor directly. That is why \nit is incumbent for us to take a greater amount of time to look over \nthe bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, if we \nlook at existing law in America and at companies, manufacturers, and \ninterest groups that are currently exempt from being held accountable \nin a courtroom for misuse of their products or selling a product, the \nonly one I can think of is the Price-Anderson law relative to the \nnuclear power industry. There are a lot of different exceptions where \nwe have said you can't be sued no matter what you do. Is there a long \nlist we are adding to with this legislation?\n  Mr. REED. The only exception other than Price-Anderson I can think of \nis General Aviation Aircraft, over 18 years old, that has special \nprotection. That is a very narrow protection, and I think it is nothing \nlike contemplated in this legislation.\n  I must also note those aircraft are supervised by the FAA. There is \nsignificant Federal involvement in the design and airworthiness, things \nthat do not apply at all to a weapon.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may ask the Senator a further question, if he will \nyield for a question, is it my understanding if we pass this bill that \nindividuals--for example, the victims of the District of Columbia \nsnipers--who are going after gun dealers who were selling massive \namounts of weapons which they could not even account for, that we may \nin fact eliminate the lawsuits brought by the surviving families of the \nDC snipers against the gun dealers who were just negligently and \nwantonly selling guns without any consideration as to whether they \ncould be misused?\n  Mr. REED. That is my understanding. It is not only my understanding, \nbut it is the understanding of various counsel who looked closely at \nthis legislation and rendered an opinion to that effect.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would further yield for a question, we had \ntwo individuals we believe who were absolutely terrorizing the \nWashington, DC area and killing people with sniper rifles. Then we \nidentified where that rifle was purchased and found out this Bull's Eye \ndealer--whatever the name was--was not even keeping good records of the \nguns that were being sold. The families of the victims who were killed \nby the DC snipers believe the gun dealer should be held liable and \naccountable for its negligence in selling guns without keeping the \nrecords that are required. And the Senator from Rhode Island is telling \nme we are bringing a bill to the floor of the Senate to exempt the gun \ndealer who sold the weapon that killed these innocent people in the \nWashington, DC area from liability. Is that what this debate is all \nabout?\n\n  Mr. REED. That is my view entirely. That is what this legislation \nwill accomplish. It will not only prospectively provide barriers to the \ncourts for victims of negligence like this, but it will reach back and \nprotect these individuals who apparently--at least arguably--were \nnegligent in not properly controlling over 230 weapons, not just the \none the snipers used, which disappeared.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Rhode Island: If we are going to \ndecide to pass laws here on a daily basis to exempt companies across \nAmerica from being held accountable for their negligence and for \nwrongful conduct, does the Senator from Rhode Island share my belief \nthis is going to become an auction process where the Senate, frankly, \nwill decide which special interests we will honor on a weekly basis to \nmake certain they cannot be held accountable by a jury of their peers\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\nand by judges so that individuals who were wronged, like the victims of \nthe District of Columbia snipers, will eventually find they have no \nrecourse? They cannot go to the White House on a gun issue because the \nPresident is on the side of the gun lobby. They cannot go to Congress \nwhich is controlled by Members who apparently pay a lot more attention \nto the gun lobby than gun victims. So we are closing the courthouse \ndoors to the victims of gun violence by the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REED. I think the Senator is entirely correct. His insight also \nis accurate in that I cannot see that other industries, if we pass \nthis, won't come to us and say, We have very valid reasons, too. We are \nbeing assailed every day by these claims. This sets a very dangerous \nand very unfortunate precedent.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for an additional \nquestion? I was curious whether my colleague would share with us what \nproblem this legislation seeks to solve. Normally, when you bring a \nbill to the floor you try to solve the problem. I wonder if my \ncolleague has any idea of the volumes of lawsuits that have been \nbrought against gun manufacturers that the author of this legislation \nis trying to solve.\n  Mr. REED. Very few suits have been filed. There is not an epidemic \nthroughout the Nation, but probably the best evidence is from the \ncompanies themselves. Let me make reference to the 10-K report on \nweapons.\n\n       In the opinion of management, after consultation with \n     special counsel, it is not probable and is unlikely that the \n     outcomes of these claims will have a material adverse effect \n     on the results of the operations or the financial condition \n     of the company as managers believe it has provided adequate \n     reserves.\n\n  So in 10 cases, in the statement required to be sworn to under the \nsecurities laws, Smith & Wesson and other companies have essentially \nsaid there is not a material problem.\n  At this point, because I know there are other speakers who would like \nto respond----\n  Mr. DODD. If the Senator will yield for one more additional question, \nI want to make the point that my colleague is absolutely correct.\n  Further, is he aware that over the last 10 years there have been 33 \ncases brought by municipalities--one in the State of New York--and none \nof them have resulted in conclusions that have been harmful to the gun \nmanufacturing industry? With a population of 280 million people, there \nhave been 33 or 34 cases in almost 10 years, not one of which has \nresulted in an adverse decision for the manufacturers. Is my colleague \naware of that?\n  Mr. REED. I am aware of it. The Senator is correct. We think there \nare less than 100 cases.\n  Mr. DODD. The police chiefs from across the country are urging the \nSenate not to protect gun dealers who arm killers.\n  Mr. REED. I am aware of that. In the course of this debate, I hope we \ncan emphasize that point.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator from Texas, \nlet me make a couple of comments in response to what my colleagues have \nbeen saying this morning.\n  Let's take the gun dealer in Tacoma, WA who is alleged to have sold \nto the sniper who held this area hostage for a time with a gun. His \nlicense has been revoked. There is a criminal investigation, and BATF \nhas asked the Justice Department to file felony charges against the \ndealer. The business is now closed and broke.\n  In other words, what I am saying is if this licensed gun dealer \nviolated current law, he will be shut down. What we are talking about \nhere again is a narrow piece of legislation that deals with civil \nliability--not product liability--and in the case of current Federal \nlaw it does not touch it. The day in court comes.\n  But what the Senator from Connecticut didn't say is even his own gun \nmanufacturers and their associations in those some 30-plus lawsuits \nhave spent millions and millions of dollars before the court system \ndefending themselves, and to date the judges have thrown them out. This \nis called ``death through attrition'' by simply taking to the courts \nand constantly bringing to the courts these kinds of arguments. Here is \nthe reality.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I can't yield at this time. My time is limited. We are \ngoing to be on this for days, as the Senator knows. We will debate it \nthoroughly.\n  But what he is suggesting is running the risk of losing all of his \ngun manufacturers and the hundreds of jobs that are out there. He is \nconcerned about jobs. I think he would be concerned about keeping the \njobs he has in his home State. That is part of this discussion.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I can't yield. Time is limited.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator made reference to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I did it fairly. You are here on the floor. We will talk \nabout this more in the hours to come.\n  Let me yield to my colleague from the great State of Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words on our broken \ncivil justice system. Today we are debating yet another common sense \nreform proposal, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.\n  Despite many recent opportunities, Congress has been unable to enact \nmeaningful tort reform, largely because of strong resistance by trial \nlawyers and their allies in this chamber. Just yesterday we failed to \nreach cloture on medical liability reform that would protect our \nmothers and their children. We have been blocked from enacting broader \nmedical liability reform.\n  And we saw this drama played out last year with the Senate's \nfailure--by one vote--to end a filibuster of the Class Action Fairness \nAct and give the bill a vote on the floor. Despite the fact that a \nbipartisan majority stands ready to pass that bill, the obstructionist \nopposition prevents us from acting.\n  I believe our civil justice system is badly broken. It serves the \ninterests of the few at the expense of the many. It has become almost \nentirely directed not at dealing out justice, but at finding as many \nscapegoats as possible, the wealthier the better.\n  It used to be that if you slipped and fell on a sidewalk, you picked \nyourself up and kept on walking. But nowadays, far too many trial \nlawyers continue to feed the idea that instead of getting up again, you \nought to sue the maker of the sidewalk for making it too hard, the \nmaker of your shoes for not putting enough ridges on your soles, and \neveryone in your near vicinity for not rushing to catch you as you \nfell. After all, there is money to be made.\n  The current system rewards lawyers and short-changes the real \nvictims. There is no doubt that this system of over-litigation cannot \nlast without more negative results. And without reform, I fear the \nentire system will collapse under its own weight.\n  Today, the Senate has the opportunity to take a step in the right \ndirection on this problem, by passing the Protection of Lawful Commerce \nin Arms Act.\n  This bill is simple: it provides that lawsuits may not be brought \nagainst lawful manufacturers and sellers of firearms or ammunition if \nthe suits are based on criminal or unlawful use of the product by \nsomeone else--when a criminal, not the manufacturer, commits a crime.\n  Such lawsuits are not intended to find real fault, but to play on the \nemotions of a jury and drive the gun industry out of business, holding \nlegitimate, law-abiding manufacturers and dealers liable for the \nintentional and criminal acts of others.\n  This bill reinforces years of legal precedent--that individuals and \nbusinesses are responsible for the harm they case, not for the actions \nof third parties over whom they have no control.\n  Many Judges across the Nation recognize the ridiculous nature of \nthese suits. The Louisiana Supreme Court struck down New Orleans' right \nto bring such a suit in the face of State law forbidding it, and said \n``this lawsuit constitutes an indirect attempt to regulate the lawful \ndesign, manufacture, marketing and sale of firearms.''\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\nIn dismissing New York State's case last year, a New York appellate \ncourt observed ``the plain fact that courts are the least suited, least \nequipped, and thus the least appropriate branch of government to \nregulate and micro-manage the manufacturing, marketing, distribution \nand sale of handguns.''\n  Thankfully, many States are acting: 33 States have enacted some form \nof legislation to prevent junk lawsuits against the firearms industry \nbased on the criminal behavior of others. We must follow the lead of \nthe majority of States, and pass this common sense measure.\n  Don't allow any illusions about the intentions of the people involved \nin these suits. At an American Bar Association symposium in 1999, one \nof the plaintiffs' attorneys for the antigun lawsuits explained that \nthe attorneys had read the Dun & Bradstreet reports on the firearms \ncompanies, estimated how much the companies could spend defending \nthemselves against litigation, and then filed so many cases in so many \njurisdictions that the gun companies would not be able to spend the \nmoney to see the cases through to a verdict. The irresponsible tort \ncommunity is simply looking for another law-abiding business to prey \non.\n  And even if all the gun companies in America were put together, they \nwould not constitute a single Fortune 500 company--so the gun companies \nare much more vulnerable to abusive litigation than deep-pocketed \ngiants such as the New York Times.\n  The real way to stop gun crime in America is simple: those who abuse \nthe constitutional right to keep and bear arms by using firearms to \ncommit crimes must be aggressively prosecuted and punished. When I was \nAttorney General of Texas, I joined with then-Governor Bush to launch a \nprogram we called Texas Exile. That program provided local prosecutors \nwith the funds to get more than 2,000 guns off the streets and to issue \nmore than 1,500 indictments for gun crimes, resulting in almost 1,200 \nconvictions in its first 3 years of existence alone.\n  And when President Bush came to Washington, he built upon our success \nin Texas by making Project Safe Neighborhoods one of his top \npriorities. Project Safe Neighborhoods expands on existing programs \nthat target gun crimes in each State. It is a nationwide commitment to \nreduce gun crime in America by networking these existing local programs \nand providing those programs with the additional tools necessary to be \nsuccessful.\n  The Bush administration has committed more than $900 million to this \neffort over three years, using funding to hire new Federal and State \nprosecutors, support investigators, providing training, distribute gun \nlock safety kits, deter juvenile gun crime, and develop and promote \ncommunity outreach efforts as well as to support other gun violence \nreduction strategies. And Texas has seen great success with the \nintegration of Project Safe Neighborhoods with the existing Texas Exile \ninfrastructure.\n  These are the kinds of steps that get real results, not ill-\nintentioned frivolous lawsuits. I question the integrity of any system \nthat would reward such abject agreed. We need to work in this body to \nfix our broken civil justice system, and this bill is a good place to \nstart.\n  I am somewhat bemused by the arguments I have already heard this \nmorning on this motion to invoke cloture. In fact, we want to have a \ndebate. Those who oppose even having a debate are, I guess, not going \nto allow it to happen. I hope they are not successful in blocking \ndebate. It is healthy to have a debate.\n  I am bemused by the suggestion that this is a narrow bill directed \ntoward special interests. Yesterday, we had a narrow bill to protect \nthe special interests known as pregnant women and children. However, \nthe trial lawyers prevailed and we were unable to get that commonsense \ntort reform measure on the floor for debate. I submit that the \nsuggestion is misguided that this is a special interest piece of \nlegislation. This is in the public interest.\n  I suggest the worst thing about the arguments we hear from the other \nside of this debate is they are misdirected. In other words, they \ncontend this bill would immunize lawsuits against gun manufacturers for \nwhat is a lawful activity. The fact is, there is a shrine in our \nConstitution, the right of the people to keep and bear arms. What they \nare trying to do would have the effect of impeding and impairing that \nconstitutional right because, as Senator Craig has pointed out, there \nhave been many lawsuits filed against gun manufacturers for the very \nfact of making a lawful product, none of which, so far as I understand, \nhas been successful but which are destroying these companies which are \nin the business of manufacturing a lawful product, destroying jobs, and \nimpairing ultimately the constitutional right of citizens, people like \nyou, me, and others in this room from owning firearms to protect our \nhomes and our property, our families for use in sporting events, for \nhunting, and other lawful and decent activity.\n  The focus of the opponents of this bill is totally misguided. What we \nought to focus on is the criminals who use firearms illegally to commit \ncrimes. In fact, I have had a little experience in this area as \nattorney general of Texas. With the cooperation of then-Governor Bush, \nwe created a program in Texas called Texas Exile. I wish we could claim \nwe originated the idea but we borrowed the idea from Richmond, VA, \nsomething called Project Exile, which was a cooperative effort of \nlocal, State, and Federal law enforcement officials to target criminals \nwho use guns to commit crimes and convicted felons who could not even \nlegally own a firearm. The great thing about that was, No. 1, it was so \nsuccessful; No. 2, it was not a wedge issue which, clearly, there is an \nattempt to inject wedge politics in this debate. But it was an issue \nwhich everyone could agree: The NRA, the gun control folks, everyone \ncame together and said, yes, that is what we ought to do. Let's focus \non the criminals who misuse this product.\n  Indeed, in 2001, Texas led the Nation in the number of criminal \ndefendants who were indicted for weapons violations in Federal court. \nIn 2000, there were 757 in that year alone, which was almost double the \nnumber of indictments in 1999. This amount was greater than the number \nof defendants indicted on similar charges in the States of New York and \nCalifornia combined.\n\n  How were we able to use the existing criminal law in a way that made \nour streets and our communities and our States safer? We simply \nenlisted the help of local law enforcement to work with Federal law \nenforcement authorities so when a criminal was caught illegally \npossessing a firearm--illegal because a felon cannot legally possess a \nfirearm--or someone under a protective order--it is a Federal offense \nto carry or possess a firearm when you are under a protective order--or \nsomeone who simply used a gun to commit a bank robbery or any other \noffense, we focused on the gun possession portion of that and were \nsuccessful in leading the Nation in the number of prosecutions. That \nsends a very powerful message that if you carry a gun illegally or if \nyou use a gun illegally to commit a crime, then we are coming after you \nwith everything that the law allows.\n  It is a powerful deterrent to the sort of illegal conduct that causes \nthe harm that the opponents of the bill--and I grant their good faith; \nI think they believe in good faith that what they are proposing is a \npath to a good result, a sound result--that is reducing injuries, \nreducing death, but it is misguided. All this does is encourage \nlawsuits against a manufacturer of a legal product when someone \ncriminally misuses that product to cause another person harm.\n  As the Senator from Idaho has noted, this is death by 1,000 cuts or \ndeath by 1,000 lawsuits, so to speak, because anytime a gun \nmanufacturer is sued, even with a frivolous lawsuit, they have to hire \na lawyer, they have to defend that case at greater expense which \nthreatens their economic viability which in turn threatens the jobs of \nthe people who work there in that company.\n  I wish we could have a broader debate on commonsense tort reform \ngenerally, but we have seen what happens when we try to raise these \nissues. We could not even get cloture on a class action reform bill. We \nhave not been able to bring up asbestos reform which is damaging a lot \nof good job providers in this country and not benefiting the people who \nare truly sick but only the lawsuit industry which benefits from \nchurning the cases without really benefiting the people who need \ncompensation.\n  We found in almost every instance--medical liability, class action \nreform,\n\n[[Page S1537]]\n\nor asbestos reform--we are simply not able to even get a debate. We \ncannot even get cloture because we cannot find 60 people in the Senate \nwho are willing to stand up and say this is a serious problem. It is \nraising the costs of health care. It is bankrupting companies in the \ncase of asbestos. It is an abuse of the class action system in the case \nof class action reform where lawyers get millions and consumers get a \ncoupon.\n  So the strategy has been, and it is a good strategy, to try to \nidentify certain types of cases. Yesterday it was obstetrical liability \ncases which have threatened the ability of pregnant women to find \ndoctors to simply deliver their babies.\n  I recounted in my own State in 154 different counties a woman cannot \neven find a doctor to deliver her baby, an obstetrician, because people \nare leaving the practice. It is pricing out of reach health care \nliability insurance, putting people out of business, hospitals out of \nbusiness, and we are simply seeing the tail wag the dog in each of \nthese areas. The tail seems to be the special interest groups that like \nthe status quo, which is a broken civil justice system that does not \nserve justice.\n  I commend the Senator from Idaho for bringing up this bill which \nadmittedly is a narrow bill. Boy, I wish we could have a broader debate \non tort reform, commonsense tort reform generally. When we talk about \nwhat causes job loss in this country, it is the regulation by \nlitigation, it is the tort tax that imposes additional costs on \nconsumers and discourages innovation and entrepreneurs in this country. \nWe are not talking about locking the courthouse door and denying \nsomeone access to justice. I believe strongly we must retain meaningful \naccess to justice for anyone who is harmed by the wrongful conduct of \nany other person. But the system right now benefits the few at the \nexpense of the many in ways that I doubt consumers really understand \nbecause it adds costs to their products, and it makes it harder for \nentrepreneurs and small businesses to open their doors and to hire \npeople to allow them to provide for their families.\n\n  So here we are, rather than taking on a broader tort reform bill, we \nare left with a narrow bill. I congratulate the Senator from Idaho for \nit. I believe we should protect manufacturers of lawful products whose \nproducts are misused by criminals. Let's focus on the criminals, not \nthe people who are providing jobs and are producing a lawful product.\n  With that, I yield back any remaining time I have to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  May I inquire of the time remaining for both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has 5 minutes 40 \nseconds. And 4 minutes 17 seconds are remaining for the minority.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Chair notify me when I have a half minute left?\n  Mr. President, at a time when capitulation to special interest groups \nis a major issue in the Presidential election campaign, it is difficult \nto believe that the Republican leadership in the Senate is serious in \nasking the Senate to accept this flagrant special interest legislation. \nI urge my colleagues to break the stranglehold of the gun industry and \ngun dealers and oppose proceeding to this shameful legislation.\n  The list of issues that demand the Senate's immediate attention is \nlong. Unemployment is a crisis for millions of citizens. Retirement \nsavings are disappearing. School budgets are plummeting. College \ntuition is rising. Health care costs and prescription drug costs are \nsoaring. Federal budget deficits extend as far as the eye can see. The \nwar in Iraq has brought new dangers, imposed new costs, and more and \nmore American lives are being lost each week.\n  The well-being of most American families has declined at an alarming \nrate in the past 2 years. We can and should be acting to meet these \nchallenges. Instead, the Republican leadership wants to spend time on \nthis flagrant pro-special-interest, anti-victim, anti-law-enforcement \nlegislation to give broad legal immunity to the gun industry.\n  This bill's proponents claim they are targeting ``frivolous \nlawsuits.'' But we all know that its real effect would be to prevent \nvictims of gun violence--police officers, innocent bystanders, and \ntheir families--from pursuing valid claims in State and Federal courts.\n  This special interest bill is a direct attack on the interests of law \nenforcement. Police Chief William J. Bratton of the Los Angeles Police \nDepartment recently told it like it is:\n\n       To give gun manufacturers and gun dealers immunity from \n     lawsuits is crazy. If you give them immunity, what incentive \n     do they have to make guns with safer designs, or what \n     incentive do the handful of bad dealers have to follow the \n     law when they sell guns.\n\n  The bill would prevent the families of the victims of the DC snipers \nfrom holding accountable the gunshop in the State of Washington that \nsomehow ``lost'' the assault rifle that was used in the attacks. Under \ncurrent law, if negligence is proved, the families of the victims are \nentitled to seek redress. If this bill is enacted, the gunshop will be \ntotally immunized from liability, and the families' lawsuits will be \nthrown out.\n  Unbelievably, the gun industry and the tobacco industry are the only \ntwo consumer industries that are not subject to Federal consumer safety \nregulations. America does more today to regulate the safety of toy guns \nthan real guns, and it is a national disgrace.\n  The gun industry has worked hard to prevent Federal consumer safety \nlegislation. At the same time, it has conspicuously failed to use \ntechnology to make guns safer, and it has attempted to insulate itself \nfrom its distributors and dealers, once the guns leave the factory.\n  Now it wants to become the only industry in the Nation exempt from \nlawsuits. The overwhelming majority of Americans believes that gun \ndealers and gun manufacturers should be held responsible for their \nirresponsible conduct, like everyone else.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Surely, the Republican leadership has higher domestic \npriorities than providing legal immunity for the gun industry. Surely, \nwe can do better than debate this extraordinarily reckless and \nunprecedented special interest legislation.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  There are 16 seconds remaining for the Senator from Rhode Island and \n5 minutes 13 seconds remaining for the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, if the Senator wants to make his closing \ncomments before I make mine, what time does he have left?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Sixteen seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. All right. It is obvious, Mr. President, by those who have \nalready come to the floor, that this will be a very spirited debate. \nThe great tragedy of debates such as this is that they oftentimes fail \nto read the bill before them, and they make the kinds of salient \npolitical statements that have nothing to do with the legislation at \nall.\n  I invite my colleagues, on S. 1805, to go to section 4 of the bill \nand see how narrowly we have crafted this bill to go directly at civil \nlawsuits that involve a third party criminal act and trying to reach \nback through the courts and back through the law to say to a licensed, \nlegitimate, legal firearms dealer or a licensed, legal gun manufacturer \nthat they have to be responsible for the criminal act of another. That \nsimply has not been the basis of law in our country ever, nor should it \nbe allowed to be the basis of law today.\n  But if that gun manufacturer and if that licensed gun dealer violate \ncivil law, violate the law of the land, then this bill does not hold \nthem harmless. That is the crux of the issue. That is what is important \nabout this legislation.\n  There are a lot of ways to achieve a political goal in this country. \nMany have found that you can file frivolous and junk lawsuits in the \ncourt, and you\n\n[[Page S1538]]\n\ncan slowly but surely bleed down those who you file them against \nbecause they have to come and defend themselves, even though the courts \nconstantly throw out these lawsuits. Hundreds of millions of dollars \nhave already been spent by legitimate gun manufacturers that make those \nfine weapons for our men and women in Iraq, that make those fine \nweapons for our civil law enforcement officers wearing the blue \nuniforms on the streets of America.\n  They would say to them: No, we are going to bust those companies. And \nguess where that cop is going to get his gun. From China or Yugoslavia. \nOr our men and women in uniform are going to have to rely on foreign \ngun manufacturers because we have bankrupt and thrown out of this \ncountry those acting under the law in a legitimate way.\n  That is what S. 1805 is about. It is not about the political agenda \nof many. It is about what we have said in this country is a legitimate \nproduct. We even said so in the Constitution. Most other products we do \nnot talk about in the Constitution. They were not invented. But we did \nspeak to guns and their value in this country. Now we are saying: No, \nwe are going to play the political game. We are going to drag them \nthrough the courts. And they are going to spend all kinds of money to \ndo so.\n  I am not willing to hold anybody harmless who violates the law. I am \nnot willing to hold anybody harmless who allegedly acts in a criminal \nway. Let's find out if they did. The courthouse door is not locked by \nS. 1805. The courthouse door is still open. This law will be applied in \narguments before the court. A judge will make the determination of \nwhether S. 1805 fits or it does not fit. Was the licensed dealer or the \ngun manufacturer acting in a legal way or acting against current \nFederal law? That is how narrowly we have defined it.\n  Even the minority leader, Senator Daschle, has joined with me to \nclarify and refine this bill even more--he will be to the floor to \nspeak to that issue--as we worked to make sure we are on point \ndirecting this specifically at those who continually play the game at \nthe legal bar of this country to file the frivolous or the junk \nlawsuits to drive a legitimate operating American company and industry \nout of business.\n  I hope my colleagues will come now and vote on the cloture motion to \nallow us to proceed so we can fully debate the bill, bring the \nnecessary amendments that others will have for or against the purpose \nof this legislation. We will vote them up or down and move it through \nthe Senate. That is our job. I know there are a lot of issues that are \nimportant. But there are a lot of Americans who view this as a very \nimportant issue for our country.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the legislation before us is a benefit to \nspecial interests, the gun lobby. It will deny individual Americans the \nright to go to court to challenge the conduct of individuals who \nnegligently or allegedly negligently sold weapons. It would be a great \ndistortion of the law. I hope my colleagues will resist this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The hour of 10:30 having arrived, \nunder the previous order the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 363, S. 1805, a bill to prohibit \n     civil liability actions from being brought or continued \n     against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of \n     firearms or ammunition for damages resulting from the misuse \n     of their products by others.\n         Bill Frist, Orrin Hatch, Mitch McConnell, Larry Craig, \n           Jim Talent, John Ensign, John Cornyn, Conrad Burns, \n           Saxby Chambliss, Craig Thomas, Don Nickles, Rick \n           Santorum, Trent Lott, John Sununu, Mike Crapo, Lamar \n           Alexander, Wayne Allard.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I hope now, with a vote of 75 to 22, we \ncould move on to the bill. Certainly, it is our intent to allow this \nbill to be debated fully and for amendments to be offered. Time is \nrunning. Some Senators spoke this morning to the urgency of time to get \non to other issues. Certainly, that is important to all of us. So I \nhope we would be able to do so. I hope now that Senators could come to \nthe floor with their arguments, but most importantly I hope we could \nmove to the bill itself.\n  As you know, under the cloture rule there would be allowed 30 hours. \nI hope those in opposition would not take that 30 hours and allow us to \nget to the bill. What we are trying to do in S. 1805 is very narrowly \ngo through the law and allow law-abiding gun manufacturers and law-\nabiding dealers to be exempt from the kind of harassment and junk \nlawsuits that we have now seen filed in over 30-plus different venues \nover the last several years. All those cases then brought to court were \nthrown out of the court, and the reason was quite simple. The judge \nlooked at them and said: This lawsuit is of no value.\n  Here you had a law-abiding manufacturer, adhering to the laws of the \nUnited States, making a legitimate product, and that person cannot be \nresponsible for a third party action that might have been a criminal \naction and the trial bar trying to reach through that person to a \nlegitimate gun manufacturer or to a licensed gun dealer.\n\n[[Page S1539]]\n\n  In doing so I believe these suits were intended, of course, to drive \nthe gun industry out of business by holding manufacturers and dealers \nliable for the intention and the criminal acts of that third party over \nwhom we all know they have had absolutely no control.\n  Lawsuits have been filed in multiple States with demands of massive \nmonetary damages on a broad and varying range of injunctive relief \nrelating to the design, manufacture, distribution, marketing, and the \nsale of firearms. These demands, if granted, would create major \njudicially imposed restrictions on interstate commerce in firearms and \nammunition.\n  Let me, though, say with that comment, this deals with civil cases, \nnot product liability. If a gun malfunctions and someone is damaged, or \nif the gun manufacturer and the gun dealer were violating civil law, \nthen, of course, this issue that we are debating today has no value. We \nhave clearly narrowed it and cleanly gone after the very kind of \nlawsuit that we have, as I mentioned, seen over the last several years.\n  The bill does something very important to the underlying principles \nof our country. It reinforces centuries of legal precedent based on \nindividual responsibility, not responsibility for actions of third \nparties. Law is based on the act of the individual, and that ought to \nbe the basis of all law. Yet what these lawsuits would argue is that \nsomehow a legitimate, legal manufacturer of a product is liable for the \nway the product is used. I have oftentimes said: What about an \nautomobile? Certainly that is a legitimate product on the road. What \nabout an automobile dealer licensed in his State to sell automobiles? \nIf someone takes the automobile designed to give ultimate pleasure and \nto move people from one point to another and they get drunk and go out \nand get in their vehicle and kill someone, does the trial bar then say \nthat it is the automobile dealer and the automobile manufacturer who \nare liable for the drunk driver who killed someone? That is what they \nare trying to say and that is exactly the fundamental argument here. \nThat is why we think it is time this Congress deal with it in a \nforthright way.\n\n  The House argued this issue over a year ago and, by a 2-to-1 vote \nsaid: No, we are not going to let this kind of lawsuit go forward.\n  But they did something our bill also does. We didn't lock the \ncourthouse door. Some will argue this simply locks any person out of \nthe courthouse who might place an argument against a gun manufacturer \nor licensed firearm dealer. The answer to that is absolutely not. This \nwill be a basis in the law by which lawyers will argue before a judge \nwhether these kinds of charges can legitimately be brought based on the \nevidence at hand. The judge will then make the decision based on the \nlaw as to how we proceed.\n  Many judges, as I have mentioned, have outright rejected these suits \nalready. They literally clutter up the judicial system. Antigun \nactivists are trying to destroy tort law by creating totally new and \nexpansive theories of liability to win restrictions that have been \nrejected in the legislative process. What does that mean? If you can't \nwin it on the floor of the U.S. Senate or in the legislatures of your \nStates, then you get a good attorney and you go before the court and \ntry to argue it there and establish some kind of judicial precedent.\n  I have already suggested that we do not lock the courthouse door, \nthat we simply allow the argument to be placed. We think that, of \ncourse, is important to all citizens, having their day in court and \ntheir right to argue it.\n  Would this bill affect several high-profile cases such as the lawsuit \nagainst a gun dealer in Takoma, WA, a store where the DC snipers, John \nMuhammad and Lee Malvo, got their rifle?\n  Well, it won't, and here is the reason it won't. In the case of that \nsituation, Malvo himself said he stole the gun.\n  What we are also finding is that this particular gun dealer may not \nhave operated in the most legitimate of ways, even though the case will \nnot be brought.\n  There is a criminal investigation underway. The BATF has jerked the \nlicense of the gun dealer. The business is now out of business, and it \nis my understanding that the BATF has asked the Justice Department to \nfile felony charges against the gun dealer. Even within that argument, \nyou have the contradiction of the person who did the shooting saying: I \nstole the gun. And, of course, you have a gun dealer who may have \noperated illegally. Certainly that is a case in action, although what \nis important is this particular bill won't affect that. If that gun \ndealer in Takoma, WA, is found liable, if he acted in a criminal way, \nif he mismanaged his records that he must keep in a way that distorted \nwhat he had and guns were stolen and he never allowed that to be known, \nthen he is at risk.\n  I am not a lawyer. So I can't go to the next step of that argument, \nand I will not. But what I do know and what we have insisted on in the \ncrafting of S. 1805 is that it be very straightforward and very clear. \nSenator Daschle has incorporated within this an amendment that I have \naccepted. He may bring some fine-tuning to the floor. He, too, believes \nwe need to deal with this issue. But he is fine-tuning to make sure \nwhat I just said is absolutely clear in the law. There will be no \narbitrary way for someone to wiggle through the law.\n  Does the bill wipe out century-old tort law principles? The answer is \nquite simply, no. The bill reinforces the century-old legal tenet of \npersonal responsibility that underlies all of our judicial system. \nIndividuals and businesses are responsible for the harm they cause.\n  Let me repeat that. Individuals and businesses are responsible for \nthe harm they cause--not for the action of third parties beyond their \ncontrol.\n  The bill protects the rights of truly injured parties. The exceptions \nallow for legitimate and recognized causes of action. Manufacturers or \nsellers of firearms or ammunition could still be sued if they violated \nFederal or State law, manufactured defective products, violated \ncontracts or warranties, or knowingly sold guns to irresponsible and/or \ndangerous individuals.\n  The law is still out there. The law still provides recourse for an \nindividual who would fall within those categories.\n  But to suggest that the actions of a third party, or the criminal act \nof a third party, is the opportunity to reach through the court by the \ntrial bar to go after the manufacturer of a legitimate legal, law-\nabiding approach or product simply should not be allowed.\n  Most importantly, antigun activist lawyers are the ones who are \ntrying to distort the law by fabricating new theories for imposing \nliability only after having repeatedly failed to cast their political \nagenda right here or in our State legislatures.\n  Just a few years ago, they admitted this when their legislative \nallies introduced a bill that would have expressly created a new \nFederal cause of action against a manufacturer, a dealer, or importer \nwho knew or reasonably should have known that its design, \nmanufacturing, marketing, importation, sale, or distribution practices \nwould likely result in gun violence.\n  How can anyone suggest that any action of the sale of a gun, if it is \ndone legally, results in violence? That is the reality of what we dealt \nwith.\n  There are a good many more issues that we will have an opportunity to \ndiscuss in the course of this.\n  It looks as if Senator Kennedy is on the floor to debate the bill.\n  I reserve my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, just prior to the vote I addressed the \nSenate on a tight timeframe pointing out my concerns about why we were \ntaking this action at this particular time. I have had the opportunity \nto travel the country.\n  We just ended the February recess where we had a chance to get \naround, as well. One of the things that has struck me over the course \nof those travels is the overwhelming concern working families have over \nthe state of the economy. It is reflected in whether they are going to \nbe able to retain their job; if they have a new job, the fact it does \nnot pay as well as the old job; they are concerned about the cost of \nhealth care, the cost of prescription\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\ndrugs; and concern over the increase of tuition. These were the issues.\n  One concern I have meeting at this time is we are considering special \ninterest legislation. We have heard a great deal both by the President \nand during the course of the election. Hopefully, we can free ourselves \nfrom special interest legislation.\n  Our Republican friends offer this legislation, put a cloture motion \ndown immediately, limit the time for any debate and discussion that \nprovides very special interest legislation for the gun manufacturers. \nThat must concern millions of Americans, certainly those who are \nconcerned about the state of the economy, those concerned by the \nfailure of the Senate to increase minimum wage over 7 years. We have 7 \nmillion Americans making $5.15 an hour who have not had a raise for 7 \nyears and we are considering special interest legislation to protect \njust a single industry, the gun manufacturing industry.\n  There are tens of thousands of Americans losing their unemployment \ncompensation every single week yet we are not debating the question of \nthe extension of the unemployment compensation--which is in surplus, \nclose to $18 billion. Senator Cantwell has an amendment to extend that \nfor a temporary period of time, give some relief for all of the workers \nwho cannot find work.\n  Finally, the administration admits we will not have good jobs, good \npay, good opportunities for the future. Finally, the President has \nagreed with that. He differs with his Council of Economic Advisers. For \nweeks we heard from the other side of the aisle: The economy is back. \nAnd now the President agrees the economy is not back.\n  We do not need much Senate time on the issue of a minimum wage \nincrease. I would agree to an hour, half an hour on either side. Let's \nsend to American workers working on the lower rung of the economic \nladder a message that help is on their way. It will benefit primarily \nwomen because they are primarily the recipients of the minimum wage. It \nwill go to mothers and children because many of the women have \nchildren. It is a children's issue, a women's issue. It is a minority \nissue because most of the minimum wage workers are men and women of \ncolor. It is a civil rights issue, a children's issue, and a women's \nissue. Most of all, it is a fairness issue.\n  People wonder why the Senate doesn't do something about increasing \nthe minimum wage. We have the majority of votes but our Republican \nfriends will not let us vote.\n  We hear the pious statements--look who is controlling the time--and \ncan't we go ahead with the Nation's business. The Nation's business is \nincreasing the minimum wage. No, no, we cannot deal with that this \nmorning. No, we are not going to deal with that. We will have special \ninterest legislation for just one industry--that is what the other side \nsays--but not for the 7 million people who would be affected.\n  What about those in need of unemployment compensation? These men and \nwomen have paid into the unemployment compensation. Now they have lost \ntheir jobs through no fault of their own through basic mismanagement of \nthe economy. They lose their jobs and as a result they have difficulty \npaying their mortgage, putting food on the table, making sure their \nchildren are going to be looked after. It is not because of them. They \nare hard-working Americans. They have a record of employment.\n  Under the Cantwell amendment, we extend the unemployment \ncompensation. We did that in other times of our history. We did it in \nthe previous Democratic administration before that Democratic President \nhad created 2 million jobs. We still provided for those who had long-\nterm unemployment, that they would be able to get unemployment \ncompensation even after more job were created.\n  Now we have the loss of 3 million jobs, a sputtering return of \n78,000, a total loss of 2 million jobs, and they are out there and \nlosing every single day whatever unemployment insurance they have. We \nsay, let us at least provide some temporary help.\n  Finally, our President has agreed we are not going to get the kind of \nrecovery and create the 2.6 million jobs the Council of Economic \nAdvisers said would occur. They finally admit that. And we are \nstonewalled to not work on unemployment in the Senate. No, let's look \nafter one industry, not the tens and thousands and millions of hard-\nworking Americans who have worked hard, played by the rules and need \nenough to be able to continue to pay their mortgages and look after \ntheir families. No, no, no, we cannot do that. It might take all of an \nhour. Everyone in this body knows what the issues are. We have to do \nspecial interest legislation.\n  That is not even the end of it. We have the clock ticking on \nunemployment. More than half of the unemployed adults have had to \npostpone medical treatment, 57 percent; or cut back on spending for \nfood, 56 percent. One in four, 26 percent, has had to move to other \nhousing or move in with friends or relatives; 38 percent have lost \ntelephone service; 22 percent are worried they will lose their phone. \nMore than a third, 36 percent, have had trouble paying gas or electric \nbills.\n  One of the principal reasons for the increase in bankruptcy is \nbecause of this kind of challenge. Our Republican friends want \nbankruptcy reform in order to expedite the pursuit of these unemployed \npeople who are having difficult times paying their bills and mortgage. \nThat is what the bankruptcy bill is all about: make the Federal \nGovernment collection agencies for special corporate interests. That is \nwhy they are trying to rush it through. And more and more are going \ninto bankruptcy.\n  Unemployment benefits should be extended with the economy still down \nover 2 million jobs. This chart reflects where we are today, with a \ntotal loss of 2.4 million jobs. These figures are from the Department \nof Labor. The Republicans say, no, no, we have something more important \nto deal with, special interest legislation.\n  This chart shows during the previous administration, they created 2.9 \nmillion jobs, yet they still had the extension of the unemployment \ncompensation for those out of work who had paid in over a long time. \nThe unemployment compensation fund is in surplus, $17 billion. It will \ncost $7 billion and they say it will put a strain on the fund.\n  This is what is happening, the unemployment impact on the family. \nMore than three in four, or 77 percent, of the unemployed Americans say \nthe level of stress in their family is increased. I don't know how you \nput dollars and cents on that figure. Everything is dollars and cents \naround here. This is the kind of pressure and tension and anxiety these \nfamilies are under, the 2.5 million.\n\n  Two-thirds, or 65 percent, of those with children have cut back on \nspending for their children. Those are working families trying to \nprovide for their children clothes, or perhaps a birthday present, \nperhaps an outing, taking them to a baseball game in the spring, a \nhockey game or a basketball game in the winter. That is not there for \nany of these families.\n  Twenty-six percent say another family member has had to start a job \nor increase their working hours. Those are basically the women, the \nmothers, when they can find it. All those mothers are working twice as \nhard now as they did 20 years ago.\n  Twenty-three percent have had to interrupt their education. Imagine \nthat, working families, the unemployed--2.4 million of them--and almost \na quarter of their children have had to interrupt their education \nbecause their parents are unemployed through no fault of their own.\n  That is the pressure they are under. Do you think we can get an \nextension of the unemployment compensation? No, no. We have to deal \nwith this special interest legislation.\n  This is the overall view of where we are in our country now. We have \n13 million children who are going hungry. We have 8 million Americans \nwho are unemployed. We have the 8 million Americans who will lose \novertime pay under the Bush proposal. This is another interesting \nissue. There is no increase in the minimum wage, there is no extension \non unemployment compensation for workers, and now we have the proposal \nto eliminate overtime for 8 million Americans.\n  Well, you have 13 million children who are going hungry, and the \nmillions who are without work.\n  We have 7 million low-wage workers waiting 7 years for an increase in \nthe\n\n[[Page S1541]]\n\nminimum wage. There are 3 million more Americans in poverty--3 million \nmore Americans in poverty--since President Bush took office. Are we \naddressing this issue today? Oh, no, no, no, we do not have the time to \ndo that. We have to rush through this special interest proposal. We do \nnot have time out here on the floor of the Senate to address the issues \nof those who are living in poverty, or the 90,000 workers a week--\n90,000 workers a week; think of that: 90,000 workers a week.\n  Most of us are always impressed during Sunday football games that we \nwatch in our stadiums when they have that incredible view from the \nairplanes or balloons or whatever that shows the stadiums packed with \npeople. They will say: 89,000 people, 75,000 people. I guess it is \n78,000 out in Lambeau Field out in Wisconsin, which I have been to \nrecently. People look out there and they see the mass of people out \nthere: 80,000, 90,000 people. Think of that number of people every \nsingle week--every single week--losing their coverage of unemployment \ncompensation.\n  I want to mention one other area because I see good friends in the \nChamber. My friend and colleague from Iowa will be offering an \namendment on overtime. I know the Senator from the Washington, Ms. \nCantwell, will be here soon to talk about her amendment on the \nunemployment compensation.\n  But one of the cruelest, cruelest, cruelest suggestions that has been \nmade by any administration in the time I have been in the Senate is to \neffectively do away with overtime pay for 8 million Americans and for \nthose who receive training in the Armed Forces and acquire special \nskills.\n\n  Now let us think about the administration's proposal and who they are \ntalking about. Who would be affected by the proposal the administration \nis talking about? Shown on this chart is a list of the professions that \nwould lose the coverage for overtime pay.\n  The idea of a 40-hour workweek has been at the heart and soul of our \nwhole country's ethic. Certainly from the late 1930s it has been a part \nof it. There has been a recognition that if you are going to require \npeople to work overtime, you are going to pay them time and a half. \nThat has been accepted by Republicans and Democrats alike since the end \nof the 1930s. But not under this administration. They are talking about \nlimiting overtime.\n  Who will be the groups that will be affected by the elimination of \novertime? This is the group: It is going to be the policemen, it is \ngoing to be firefighters, it is going to be the nurses, among others. I \nmention policemen and firefighters and nurses because, as we know, they \nare the backbone of homeland security. If we are going to have a \nproblem with chemical or biological warfare, it is going to be those \npolicemen and firefighters and nurses who are going to be the first \nresponders who are going to risk their lives locally in those \ncommunities to try to contain this kind of threat. They are the ones \nwho are going to be on the front lines. Yet those are the very people \nwho this administration feels are being overpaid. Even the police force \nthat is here in the Senate in many functions would be affected.\n  There are a lot of things that are troubling in the United States of \nAmerica today we should be and must be concerned about. I mentioned the \nnumber of children who are living in poverty and what is happening to \nthese families who have seen their jobs outsourced. Many of these \nthings we ought to be working on. But one of the great problems in our \ncountry today is not that our policemen, firefighters, and nurses are \nbeing overpaid. I have not heard anyone say that except the President \nof the United States or the Secretary of Labor. I have not heard anyone \ncome up to me back in Massachusetts saying: You know something, \nSenator, those policemen and firefighters and nurses are being \noverpaid. Do something about it. Do something in Washington about it. I \ndon't hear that. There is no question that some manufacturers believe \nthat and feel that and have asked the administration to do something \nabout it. No question about that. And they did, the administration has. \nI will give you an example.\n  But let me just conclude on this chart--police officers, nurses, \nfirefighters. The interesting part is that women, by and large, are \nmostly in these areas and professions. This reduction in overtime \nprimarily affects women in our workplace.\n  But something that just makes this extraordinary--and has been \ndebated here on the floor of the Senate--this proposal was rejected by \nthe Senate of the United States, rejected by the House, but this \nadministration feels sufficiently strong about this issue that they \ninsisted the Harkin-Kennedy language be taken out of the bill in the \nmiddle of the night behind closed doors--behind closed doors--at the \ninsistence of the major manufacturing companies in this country. And we \nare going to face that. We are going to be facing that in these next \nfew weeks as we have the reauthorization to do it.\n  Now let me point out something on the rates that have been proposed. \nThese are the ones that have been proposed on the overtime. Listen to \nthis. And I am talking about the kinds of skills, cumulative skills \nthat will make people ineligible for overtime. I am reading right from \nthe Federal Register, and I will include the appropriate reference in \nthe Record:\n       However, the word ``customarily''--\n\n  That means the definition about the skills that will be excluded--\n\n     means that the exemption is also available to employees in \n     such professions who have substantially the same knowledge \n     level as the degreed employees, but who attained such \n     knowledge through a combination of work experience, training \n     in the armed forces. . . .\n\n  There it is, the Federal Register, volume 68, No. 61, Monday, March \n31, administration's proposed regs. If you get the skills, training in \nthe Armed Forces, if you happen to be over in Iraq today or Afghanistan \nand you have gone to some training programs in order to provide greater \nprotection for your fellow troops in fighting for our country, maybe a \nmember of the National Guard or Reserve, you get those kinds of \ntraining functions, you come back here, you are out of the Guard, you \nreturn to work, and your boss says: Hey, these new regs say you got the \ntraining in the Armed Forces. Too bad. You are not getting your \nincrease.\n  That is what this says. A number of us raised this in the earlier \ndebate. The Secretary of Labor in January sent a letter to the Speaker \nof the House, Dennis Hastert, saying--and I will include the letter in \nthe Record; it is only a page and a half long--\n\n       I want to assure that your military personnel and veterans \n     are not affected by these proposed rules by virtue of their \n     military duties or training.\n\n  But that training in the Armed Forces can make a worker an overtime-\nineligible, professional employee. This is new language. It is not in \nthe current regulation, and its only purpose is to take away overtime \nfor veterans.\n  Why don't they just drop the language and free us from any kind of \nambiguity? Just say, this was brought to our attention, we are going to \ndrop it, instead of trying to explain it away.\n  Continuing from the letter:\n\n       First, the Part 541 ``white collar exemptions'' do not \n     apply to the military. They cover only the civilian \n     workforce.\n\n  No one is complaining that the rule affects the military workforce. \nThe issue is the veteran who leaves the military to work in the \ncivilian workforce and would lose overtime protections. They are rather \nclever. They say the white-collar exemptions don't apply to the \nmilitary. No one is suggesting it applies to the military. This letter \nis an attempt to mislead. It is very clear. If the administration does \nnot intend to apply these overtime regulations to those who have been \nin the service, they ought to just eliminate it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter from which I have quoted \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Secretary of Labor,\n\n                                     Washington, January 27, 2004.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I write to provide you with the facts to \n     correct the record following last week's Senate floor debate \n     on the Consolidated Appropriations Act with regard to the \n     Department of Labor's proposed revision of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act's overtime exemption regulations. I also would \n     like to thank you for your support and leadership on this \n     important issue.\n       The recent allegations that military personnel and veterans \n     will lose overtime pay,\n\n[[Page S1542]]\n\n     because of proposed clarifications of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA) ``white-collar'' exemption regulations, \n     are incorrect and harmful to the morale of veterans and of \n     American servicemen and women. I want to assure you that \n     military personnel and veterans are not affected by these \n     proposed rules by virtue of their military duties or \n     training.\n       First, the Part 541 ``white collar exemptions'' do not \n     apply to the military. They cover only the civilian \n     workforce.\n       Second, nothing in the current or proposed regulation makes \n     any mention of veteran status. Despite claims that military \n     training would make veterans ineligible for overtime pay, \n     members of Congress should be clear that the Department of \n     Labor's proposed rules will not strip any veteran of overtime \n     eligibility.\n       This has been one of many criticisms intended to confuse \n     and frighten workers about our proposal to revise the badly \n     outdated regulations under the FLSA ``white collar'' \n     exemption regulations. It is disheartening that the debate \n     over modernizing these regulations to meet the needs of the \n     21st Century workforce has largely ignored the broad \n     consensus that this rule needs substantial revision to \n     strengthen overtime protections.\n       The growing ambiguities caused by time and workplace \n     advancements have made both employers' compliance with this \n     rule and employees' understanding of their rights \n     increasingly difficult. More and more, employees must resort \n     to class action lawsuits to recover their overtime pay. These \n     workers must wait several years to have their cases \n     adjudicated in order to get the overtime they have already \n     earned. In fact, litigation over these rules drains nearly $2 \n     billion a year from the economy, costing jobs and better pay.\n       I hope that this latest concern will be put to rest \n     immediately. Once again, I assure you that military duties \n     and training or veteran status have no bearing on overtime \n     eligibility. We hope that future debate on this important \n     provision is more constructive. If we can provide further \n     assistance in setting the record straight, we would be \n     pleased to do so. The Office of Management and Budget has \n     advised that there is no objection from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program to the presentation of this report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Elaine L. Chao.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Bush overtime proposal denies overtime to veterans. \nThe overtime proposal explicitly states that training in the Armed \nForces could disqualify workers from the overtime protection. Many \nemployers, such as Boeing, acknowledge that this will affect much of \ntheir workforce. According to Boeing's comments on the Bush proposal:\n\n       Boeing observes that many of its most skilled technical \n     workers received a significant portion of their knowledge and \n     training outside the university classroom, typically in a \n     branch of the military service. . . .\n\n  There it is. That is the reason. Because many manufacturers wanted \nthat kind of savings for the bottom line. That is why that is in there. \nBecause this company and others have hired people who have been in the \nmilitary, and when they see they have these kinds of skills which are \nnecessary for our Armed Forces, they are being penalized for it.\n  I would be interested in seeing the discussion between the Secretary \nof Defense and the Secretary of Labor in putting these out. So many of \nthese training programs and education programs are programs that \ninspire young people to go in the Armed Forces. They are men and women \nof limited means but have ability and capabilities and understand that \nthey cannot achieve their fullest potential unless they take these \ntraining programs or build the kind of credits in order to get advanced \ndegrees.\n  They ought to be on warning now that if they go ahead and do that, \nthey may very well be knocked out of any kind of overtime protection. \nThat is what this basically says. It is a cruel hoax to so many who are \nin the National Guard now and are going to come back and be in the \ncivilian workforce.\n  I want to read from a letter:\n\n       My name is Randy Fleming. I live in Haysville, Kansas--\n     outside of Wichita--and I work as an Engineering Technician \n     in Boeing's Metrology lab.\n       I'm also proud to say that I'm a military veteran. I served \n     in the U.S. Air Force from August 1973 until February 1979.\n       I've worked for Boeing for 23 years. During that time I've \n     been able to build a good, solid life for my family and I've \n     raised a son who now has a good career and children of his \n     own. There are two things that helped make that possible.\n       First, the training I received in the Air Force made me \n     qualified for a good civilian job. That was one of the main \n     attractions when I enlisted as a young man back in Iowa. I \n     think it's still one of the main reasons young people today \n     decide to enlist. Military training opens up better job \n     opportunities--and if you don't believe me, just look at the \n     recruiting ads on TV.\n       The second thing is overtime pay. That's how I was able to \n     give my son the college education that has opened doors for \n     him. Some years, when the company was busy and I had those \n     college bills to pay, overtime pay was probably 10% or more \n     of my income. My daughter is next. Danielle is only 8, but \n     we'll be counting on my overtime to help her get her college \n     degree, too, when that time comes. For my family overtime pay \n     has made all the difference.\n       That's where I'm coming from. Why did I come to Washington? \n     I came to talk about an issue that is very important back \n     home and to me personally as a working man, a family man, and \n     a veteran. The issue is overtime rights.\n       The changes that this administration is trying to make in \n     the overtime regulations would break the government's bargain \n     with the men and women in the military and would close down \n     opportunities that working vets and their families thought \n     they could count on.\n       When I signed up back in 1973, the Air Force and I made a \n     deal that I thought was fair. They got a chunk of my time and \n     I got training to help me build the rest of my life. There \n     was no part of that deal that said I would have to give up my \n     right to overtime pay. You've heard of the marriage penalty? \n     Well I think that what these new rules do is to create a \n     military penalty. If you got your training in the military, \n     no matter what your white collar profession is, your employer \n     can make you work as many hours as they want and not pay you \n     a dime extra.\n       If that's not a bait and switch, I don't know what is.\n\n  You can't make the case any better--no matter how long we speak, how \nmany charts we have--you can't make the case any better than is being \nmade by this former serviceman.\n\n       And I don't have any doubt that employers will take \n     advantage of this new opportunity to cut our overtime pay. \n     They'll tell us they have to in order to compete. They'll say \n     if they can't take our overtime pay, they'll have to \n     eliminate our jobs.\n       It won't be just the bad employers either--because these \n     rules will make it very hard for companies to do the right \n     thing. If they can get as many overtime hours as they want \n     for free instead of paying us time-and-a-half, they'll say \n     they owe it to the stockholders. And the veterans and other \n     working people will be stuck with less time, less money, and \n     a broken deal.\n       I'm luckier than some other veterans because I have a union \n     contract that will protect my rights for a while anyway. But \n     we know the pressure will be on, because my employer is one \n     that pushed for these new rules and they've been trying hard \n     to get rid of our union.\n       And for all of those who want to let these military penalty \n     rules go through, I have a deal I'd like to propose. If you \n     think it's okay for the government to renege on its deals, I \n     think it should be your job to tell our military men and \n     women in Iraq that when they come home, their service of \n     their country will be used as a way to cut their overtime \n     pay.\n\n  Madam President, is there anyone in this body who doesn't believe \nthat eliminating that possibility isn't of greater urgency than the \nspecial interest provision presently before us in the Senate?\n  Why don't we clear this up once and for all? Why don't we take an \nhour or so and debate the Harkin-Kennedy amendment on this issue? Why \ndon't we vote on that amendment and send it over to the House? Let's \nsend a message to families, nurses, police officers, and firefighters. \nLet's send a message to those who have gotten skills in the National \nGuard. Let's send a message that we stand with them, that we believe \ntheir service is of importance to us in the Senate. Let's put aside the \nspeeches for a little while that will be made by political leaders all \nover the country about how much we appreciate the service of men and \nwomen and do something for them in the Senate now? Now.\n  There are a number of other issues that we could be talking about in \nterms of the state of our economy. I have taken a short period of time. \nI see others in the Chamber who wish to address the Senate. It does \nseem to me that the matters I have mentioned, no matter how you come \nout on them, are of importance to working families in this country. \nAnd, the working families in this country are faced with economic \nchallenges.\n  It is not just the questions about outsourcing, although that is \nenormously important and a matter of great and expanding concern. It is \nwhat is happening with the failed increase in the minimum wage, the \nfailure of providing unemployment compensation, the failure to do the \novertime provisions, the failure to deal with the high\n\n[[Page S1543]]\n\ncost of prescription drugs. There is another amendment we could do to \npermit the Secretary of Health and Human Services to actually negotiate \nand do something about lowering prescription drugs for people. We could \ndo that pretty quickly.\n  People are concerned about the high cost of tuition in colleges, and \nthere are things we can do on that.\n  I say these are the matters that are of principal concern to working \nfamilies across this country. We have seen the loss of manufacturing \njobs, the concerns that working families have. They want some action. \nThey don't want us to yield to special interest provisions. Not only do \nthey not want us to yield to them, but those who have been victims of \nviolence and violent gun activity don't want us to throw their cases \naway, and leading law enforcement officers of this country understand \nthat we should not yield to the special interests as well.\n  I look forward to the opportunity for some discussion and some action \non these issues prior to the time we have a vote. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from California is now in the \nChamber to discuss this bill. We are not on the bill yet. I hope we can \nget there.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has taken ample time to discuss the \nbill, I guess, and other issues. I would like to talk about jobs. I \nthink the Senator is right to talk about jobs, but what he didn't talk \nabout were the jobs in Westfield, MA, at Savage Firearms. They used to \nbe a total of 500 high-paying union jobs strong. They have spent over \nhalf a million dollars fighting the lawsuits that we would like to \nprohibit. Now there they are 160 strong. They have lost jobs in \nMassachusetts. I want the Senator from Massachusetts to stand with me \nand protect the hard-working men and women at Savage Firearms.\n  The bill is about jobs, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts. That \nis what this issue is all about.\n  Why is our bill endorsed by the United Steelworkers and by the United \nAuto Workers? The reason it is endorsed is because these high-paying \njobs at law-abiding gun manufacturing locations are being eliminated by \nthe glut of a thousand lawsuits--in this case over 30--where they have \nhad to go to court, spend a lot of money, and the court threw it out \nbecause it was frivolous, but the company was less viable because these \nare really not big companies.\n  If we took all of the firearms manufacturers in the United States \ntoday and brought them all into one company, they would be smaller than \na Fortune 500 company.\n  Let me read a great quote from the Colt manufacturers, Colt firearms. \nThey are located in Connecticut:\n\n       We today have 383 members from the Colt workforce. By \n     comparison, about 5 years ago, we had over 600 Colt workers \n     who were members of our local. Our members built the finest \n     small arms in the world, including the M-4 carbine, the M-16 \n     rifle, and the M-203 grenade launcher.\n\n  I believe those are the firearms of our military.\n\n       Many of them were shipped to the U.S. military and lawfully \n     provided for the principles of democracy.\n\n  That company is at risk today unless we pass the kind of legislation \nabout which we are talking.\n  I do believe the working men and women of this country are a special \ninterest. I think the tens of millions of law-abiding gun owners in our \ncountry are a special interest. So it is really a matter of how you \ndefine ``special interest.'' If it has been said once on the floor, it \nhas been said 15 times in the last 45 minutes: special interest, \nspecial interest, special interest.\n  Let's talk about the working men and women of the firearms industry. \nLet's talk about the law-abiding gun owners of America as a special \ninterest of us, this country, all Americans. You are darn right we \ndebate special interests on the floor of the Senate, but it really is a \nmatter of definition.\n  Time limit? We are not proposing a time limit. Senators can speak for \nup to an hour on this issue now, and if they want to, they have 30 \nhours postcloture before we get to the bill. I hope we don't spend all \nof that time doing that. I would like to get to the bill. I know the \nSenator from California has talked about an amendment. I think she \nwould probably want to offer that amendment and have it amply debated.\n  We do not want to limit time, but we do want to talk about special \ninterests: law-abiding gun owners in our country, working men and women \nof the law-abiding gun manufacturers, the people who work at legal gun \nshops all over this country that by law are licensed and that by law \ncarry out the law. That is what we are talking about today. Call them a \nspecial interest, if you will. I do. My job is to try, under the law, \nto protect them from the kinds of frivolous lawsuits the trial bar has \ndecided to bring in court after court because they couldn't gain \nlegislation on the floor to change the character of our country. That \nis the issue at hand.\n  I am glad the Senator from Massachusetts has come to talk about \nspecial interests. I wish he would understand that the hard-working men \nand women in Westfield, MA, for Savage Firearms are, in fact, a special \ninterest--a special interest of mine and, I am quite confident, a \nspecial interest of his.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the bill that \nis before this body, and I wish to begin by saying that I have great \nrespect and have enjoyed working with the Senator from Idaho on a \nnumber of issues, including Healthy Forests. But I also must say we \nprofoundly disagree when it comes to guns. So it is probably no \nsurprise to him that I rise to strenuously object to what I see \nhappening here.\n  I think we have to recognize that guns in America are responsible for \nthe deaths of 30,000 Americans a year. The question comes whether we \nshould be giving the gun industry sweeping and unprecedented protection \nfrom the type of lawsuits that are available to every other victim \ninvolving every other industry in America.\n  The simple fact is that over the years, the gun industry has managed \nto lessen, avoid, or prevent any prudent regulation. For example, they \nare exempt from Consumer Product Safety Commission laws, thanks to the \nNational Rifle Association's efforts over the years to keep it that \nway.\n  Secondly, the Federal Government cannot do much to police bad gun \ndealers--and we know there are some--or to enforce gun laws because the \nhands of the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, are tied \nby limits to their authorities which have been put in place by the \nNational Rifle Association. They can only do a once-a-year audit, for \nexample. They only have limited options.\n  The number of ATF agents is kept so low they cannot possibly inspect \nall of the gun dealerships in this country. So today only the court \nsystem offers victims of negligent manufacturers, of which there are \nsome, and dealers, of which there are some, the ability to receive \ncompensation for their injuries. Only the court system provides a means \nfor changing these negligent practices through the threat of legal \nliability.\n  I hope to show that the threat of legal liability has, in fact, \nresulted in more responsible manufacturing and selling principles by \nthis industry. If we remove this one remaining avenue toward enforcing \nresponsibility, victims will have no recourse. Gun owners and gun \nvictims alike will be left virtually powerless against an industry that \nis already immune from so many other consumer protections. So we find \nourselves today on the cusp of yet another NRA victory.\n  Let me be clear, this is not a victory for NRA members, most of whom \nare law-abiding gun owners who might some day benefit from the ability \nto sue a manufacturer that sold them a defective or dangerous gun. No, \nthis will be a victory for those who have turned their organization \ninto a political powerhouse, unconcerned with the rights of the \nmajority of Americans who want prudent controls over firearms.\n  I do not support meritless lawsuits against the gun industry. I do \nnot think anybody does. It is my belief gun manufacturers and dealers, \nthough, should be held accountable for irresponsible marketing and \ndistribution practices, just as anyone else would be,\n\n[[Page S1544]]\n\nparticularly when these practices may cause guns to fall into the hands \nof criminals, juveniles, or mentally ill people.\n  This legislation has one simple purpose: to prevent lawsuits from \nthose harmed by gun violence. These include: suits filed by cities and \ncounties which face rising law enforcement and medical costs due to \nincreased gun crimes, crimes often committed using guns that flood the \nillegal market with the full knowledge of the distributors that the \nlegal market could not possibly be absorbing so many of these weapons; \nsuits filed by organizations on behalf of their members; and victims of \nviolent crimes and their families who are injured or killed as a result \nof gun violence or defective guns that malfunction due to negligent \ndesign or manufacture.\n  This issue is not an abstract one. When people vote for this gun \nliability absolution today, they are going to be hurting a lot of \npeople all across this land, and I want to point out a few because this \nbill affects the lives of real gun victims, victims not simply of \ncriminal misuse by a well-designed firearm, but victims of guns that \nhave been designed poorly or marketed in ways which quite frankly \nshould be illegal.\n  One of the cases that could be affected by this legislation, though \nthis would ultimately be decided by a judge, is that of Brandon \nMaxfield, a 7-year-old from my State, Oakland, CA.\n\n  On April 6, 1994, Brandon was shot in the chin by his babysitter. The \nshooting left him a quadriplegic and he will never be able to walk \nagain.\n  The babysitter, a friend of the family, was simply trying to remove a \nbullet from the chamber of a weapon that was found in the house, a .38 \ncaliber Saturday night special, when the gun accidentally fired.\n  Here is the key: The weapon was clearly designed in an inherently \ndangerous way. It can only be unloaded when the safety is in the off \nposition and can therefore fire.\n  Now common sense might say when you want to unload a gun you would \nfirst put the safety on. It defies common sense, on the other hand, to \ndesign a firearm so it can only be unloaded in the firing position. \nAfter all, one might expect the gun to accidentally fire as someone \nlike Brandon's babysitter struggles to unload it.\n  Finally last year, after 9 years of litigation, a jury found the \nmanufacturer and distributor of Saturday night specials partially \nliable for Brandon's injuries. This was a tremendous victory for \nBrandon and his family and a victory for all people who want to see \nguns made safer. This bill, however, would take away Brandon's right to \nsue, and I will explain why a bit later.\n  The bottom line, though, is Brandon's case was not frivolous. The \njury did not think it was. Without the threat of lawsuits, companies \nlike the one that made the gun in this case will have little incentive \nto change the design, but this legislation would remove the threat of \nthat suit, depriving Brandon of compensation but, even worse, depriving \nthe public of this key avenue to improving the habits of gun \nmanufacturers.\n  I will quickly go through what the bill does. I know others have and \nwill continue to speak to this, but I think it bears repeating because \nI do not think everybody supporting this bill really understands its \nfull ramifications.\n  Essentially, this bill prohibits any civil liability lawsuit from \nbeing filed against the gun industry for damages resulting from the \ncriminal or unlawful misuse of a gun, with a number of narrow \nexceptions.\n  In doing so, the bill effectively rewrites traditional principles of \nliability law, which generally hold that persons and companies may be \nliable for their negligence even if others are liable as well. This \nbill would essentially give the gun industry blanket immunity from \ncivil liability cases, an immunity no other industry in America has \ntoday.\n  The bill does allow certain cases to move forward, as its supporters \nhave pointed out, but these cases can proceed only on very narrow \ncircumstances. Countless experts have now said this bill would stop \nvirtually all of the suits against gun dealers and manufacturers filed \nto date, many of which are vital to changing industry practice and \ncompensating victims who have been horribly injured through the clear \nnegligence or even borderline criminal conduct of some gun dealers and \nmanufacturers.\n  The exemptions in the bill, even the new bill, set a very high burden \nof proof of negligence for plaintiffs, allow for a very slight number \nof cases against gun manufacturers to be filed, and only protect a \nlimited class of cases against sellers.\n  Under this bill, cases could only be filed in the following narrow \ncircumstances. First, if a gun dealer transfers a firearm knowing the \ngun will be used to commit a violent or drug trafficking crime. In \nother words, a suit could go forward if a dealer gives a gun to someone \nwho comes in and says, ``Give me a gun, I need to go kill someone.'' \nThis provision only applies in the highly unlikely event a gun buyer \nclearly indicates his or her criminal intentions to the gun seller. Fat \nchance of that happening.\n  I am not a gun dealer, but I imagine most criminals do not make a \nhabit of announcing their criminal intentions to gun dealers. So this \nexception to the immunity created by the bill is really no exception at \nall. It will apply to almost no cases.\n  Secondly, there is an exemption in the bill which applies if a dealer \nsells a gun to someone knowing the buyer will or is likely to misuse \nthe firearm and that the individual buyer does indeed misuse it to \ncommit a criminal offense. This provision is slightly more likely than \nthe first exemption, but it still requires a very high burden of proof. \nInstead of common negligence, which might only require that the dealer \ndid not take enough care in making sure that criminals did not obtain \nguns to commit crimes, what this provision requires is that the dealer \nactually know that the buyer is likely to use the gun to do harm.\n\n  How can this be proven? Mr. President, you are an attorney. How can \nthis be proven? The difficulty in proving such a claim might all but \nbar this exemption from ever coming into play. It would have no effect \non such practices as straw purchases and large volume sales--which, \nincidentally, are the two most common sources of crime guns--because in \na straw purchase, the dealer could always claim that he or she had no \nidea what the buyer would be doing with the guns.\n  Third, the bill would allow suits to proceed where a defendant has \nviolated a law or regulation in the sale of the specific gun that \ncaused the damage or injury. This sets a very high burden of proof for \nnegligence. Again, this would not affect dealers who conduct straw \npurchases or other dangerous distributing conduct because such conduct \ndoes not specifically violate any laws or regulations, although I must \nsay it should.\n  Because there are so few real laws or regulations governing how guns \nare sold or manufactured, this provision, too, is relatively \ninsignificant in terms of how it affects the underlying thrust of the \nbill.\n  Now I should point out that this provision is different than the \nprovision in the original bill as passed by the House. Under the \noriginal bill, only knowing and willful violations of the law could be \nsubject to suit, which is an even higher burden to reach. But even \nunder this revised legislation, this standard is far higher than \ncurrent law.\n  The simple truth is, negligence does not involve a violation of the \nlaw. Requiring a plaintiff to prove that a gun store, for example, was \nnot only negligent in letting a criminal obtain a dozen guns, but the \ngun store actually violated a law in doing so, of which there are few, \nmakes it very difficult to succeed.\n  So with any other business or product, in every other industry, a \nseller or manufacturer can be liable if it is negligent--but not here. \nSince money, rather than life or liberty is at stake in a civil case, \nthe standard of proof is lower. There need not be a criminal violation \nto recover damages, and in the overwhelming majority of civil cases \nthere is no criminal violation. So if, for instance, a crib \nmanufacturer designs and markets a crib that results in the death of \nchildren who use the crib, we allow that manufacturer to be sued as one \nmeans of deterring such conduct and of compensating the families of the \nchildren who died from the defectively designed crib. The manufacturer \nneed\n\n[[Page S1545]]\n\nnot have committed any crime. It is the negligence in making a \ndefective and dangerous crib that is enough. Here, contrary to general \nnegligence law covering almost every other product, this bill allows \nnegligent gun dealers and manufacturers to get off the hook unless they \nviolated a criminal law. That is just dreadful. You are creating a \nspecial area of law for gun manufacturers and saying unless they \nviolate a law they can manufacture a defective weapon.\n  The judge in Washington State presiding over the case brought against \nthe DC area snipers has twice ruled that the dealer, Bull's Eye \nShooters Supply, and the manufacturer, Bushmaster Firearms, may be \nliable in negligence for enabling the snipers to obtain their gun. But \neven with the new modifications, the sniper victims' case could very \nwell be thrown out of court under this bill. So know what you are \ndoing, Members who vote for it. The sniper victims' case could well be \nthrown out of court by this bill because there is no evidence that \neither the negligent dealer or manufacturer violated a criminal law.\n  Indeed, both Lloyd Cutler and David Boies, each prominent attorneys, \nrecently stated unequivocally that the sniper case would have to be \ndismissed under this bill, and countless professors have written a \nletter agreeing with this interpretation of the law.\n  This is the most notorious sniper case in America. You have \nnegligence on the part of the gun dealer who sold that gun, didn't \nreport it until way late, allowed the snipers to get that gun, and now \nwe are passing a law to prevent the victims from suing under civil \nliability. Nowhere else in the law does this exist.\n  In another case, a Massachusetts court has ruled that gun \nmanufacturer Kahr Arms may be liable for negligently hiring drug-\naddicted criminals and enabling them to stroll out the plant door with \nunmarked guns to be sold to criminals. But with the proposed changes, \nthe case against Kahr Arms would be dismissed. Its conduct, though \noutrageous, violated no law. Negligent? Yes. Criminal? No.\n  Members, know what you are doing when you vote for this bill.\n  The fourth exemption in the bill is when a dealer somehow violates a \nsales contract. An example of this would be the dealer failing to \nprovide the gun for which the purchaser paid. This, too, is clearly a \nlimited exception. Victims of defectively designed or negligently sold \nguns would not be allowed to file cases under this provision. \nFurthermore, the claims of gun purchasers would be limited to what they \nwere entitled to under the scope of the contract or warranty.\n  The fifth exemption in the original bill allowed suits to go forward \nif the gun manufacturer has caused ``physical injuries or property \ndamage resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of a \nproduct when used as intended.'' This provision altered generally \naccepted principles of products liability law which essentially state \nthat a manufacturer must implement feasible safety features that would \nprevent injury caused by foreseeable use or misuse, even if that use is \nnot ``intended.'' For instance, it might not be intended for a child to \ntry to eat a small toy, but it is clearly foreseeable.\n  This new modified gun immunity legislation does add language allowing \nsuits to go forward as long as the activity was ``reasonably \nforeseeable'' by the manufacturer or dealer, which appears to match \ncurrent law. However, the devil is in the details because the bill then \ntakes away any benefit that language might have by stating that the \nexemption will not apply to lawsuits that also involve criminal acts by \nthe defendant.\n  The best example of how this provision would affect the case is the \nBrandon Maxfield babysitter shooting I mentioned earlier, where a child \nwas accidentally shot by a babysitter because the chamber of the gun \ncould not be checked without clicking the safety to ``off.'' In that \ncase, the gun fired while the babysitter tried to check the chamber.\n  The problem is the bill prohibits suits involving even foreseeable \naccidents, if there are criminal charges. In the babysitter case, the \nbabysitter could easily be, and indeed was, charged with manslaughter--\nwhich is a crime. Thus, even this suit would still be barred by this \nrevised bill.\n  Contrary to current law which allows judges and juries to apportion \nblame and damages, this bill would bar any damages against a \nmanufacturer if another party was liable due to a criminal act.\n  Why should firearms get special treatment? In our society, we hold \nmanufacturers liable for the damage their products cause. This is the \ncase with automobiles. This is the case with cribs. It is the case with \nchildren's toys, and it should be the case with guns as well. Lawsuits \nfiled against the gun industry provide a way for those harmed to seek \njustice from the damages and destruction caused by firearms. Just as \nimportant, they create incentives to reform the practices proven to be \ndangerous.\n  After all, this is the most dangerous consumer item found in a home.\n  According to statistics, there is a gun in 43 percent of the \nhouseholds with children in America. There is a loaded gun in 1 of 10 \nhouseholds with children, and a gun that is left unlocked or improperly \nstored in 1 of every 8 family homes.\n  More children and adult family members are killed each year by having \na loaded gun at home than from incidents with criminal intruders. In \nfact, a gun in the home is 22 times more likely to lead to an \naccidental injury or death to family members than used against a \ncriminal intruder. These are senseless actions that can be prevented by \nsimply designing guns with technologically and economically feasible \nsafety devices.\n  Recent cases have produced evidence from law enforcement \ninvestigations, as well as industry insiders, that the gun industry may \nbe ignoring numerous patented safety devices for guns and intentionally \nflooding certain markets with guns knowingly, and also profiting from \nthe fact that the excess weapons would make their way into the hands of \ncriminals. We have seen gun dealers selling guns when they know these \nguns are being purchased to immediately resell to criminals--often to \ncriminals who wait right outside the door or even inside the very store \nwhile the guns are being bought by someone who can pass a background \ncheck.\n  Lawsuits filed against the gun industry provide a way for victims and \nmunicipalities to seek justice from the damages and destruction caused \nby firearms.\n  Additionally, lawsuits provide this largely unregulated industry with \nincentives to reform irresponsible manufacturing and distributing \npractices proven to be dangerous.\n  According to Tom Gresham, a writer for the magazine Guns & Ammo, \nlawsuits have, in fact, proven effective in encouraging manufacturers \nto design their guns with proper safety devices. Even though guns are \nnot required to be made with safety features, Gresham writes in the \nJune 2002 edition of the magazine that lawsuits have spurred \nmanufacturers to include them to avoid liability in future actions.\n  Don't we want this to take proven steps to improve the safety of \ntheir weapons?\n  Gresham claims, ``No matter what you think of them, you will find \nbuilt-in locks on more and more guns in the future. I predict that in \nten years, no firearm will be made without one.''\n  What does this bill do to that? It encourages the gun companies to do \nexactly the opposite--to not put better safety components on their \nweapons.\n  When this bill was introduced, its supporters spoke about the need to \nprotect the industry from frivolous lawsuits and the need to protect \nthe industry from the potential loss of jobs brought on by future \nlawsuits. These claims are unfounded. This bill is simply the latest \nattempt of the gun lobby to evade industry accountability. The suits \nagainst the gun industry come in varying forms, but they all have one \ngoal in common--forcing the firearm industry to become more \nresponsible.\n\n  In addition to ongoing cases filed by individual victims, there have \nbeen a handful of cases filed by private associations, such as the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the \nNational Spinal Cord Injury Association. These cases have been filed on \nbehalf of groups of individuals who claim to have been harmed by the \ngun industry's bad behavior.\n  And there are government cases--at least 24 cases--that have been \nfiled\n\n[[Page S1546]]\n\nagainst the gun industry on behalf of nearly three dozen cities and \ncounties and one State attorney general claiming that the reckless \nconduct of the gun industry has threatened public safety and hindered \nthe ability of municipalities to provide for the health and welfare of \ntheir citizens. A majority of these municipalities' lawsuits have \nsuccessfully defeated industry attempts to dismiss their cases. This \nbill would kill that.\n  Last year, Dennis Herrera, City Attorney of San Francisco, said that, \n``Cases being pursued by my office and some 30 other jurisdictions \nnationwide have already achieved important milestones in exposing gun \nindustry recklessness, with mounting evidence and an increasing number \nof high-level whistle blowers revealing gross misconduct by \nmanufacturers and dealers . . . I'm convinced that the City and its \nfellow plaintiffs have a compelling case against the gun industry.''\n  This legislation would prevent them from going ahead.\n  Let me describe a few representative cases that also could have been \nstopped by this bill.\n  The case of Cincinnati v. Beretta is one example of a legitimate and \nsuccessful case filed against the gun industry. In this case, officials \nfrom the city of Cincinnati, OH, contended that the gun industry's \nreckless marketing and distribution of guns enabled them to wind up in \nthe hands of criminals and children leading to murders, shootings, and \nsuicides that imperil public safety. The city also argued that gun \nmanufacturers were negligent in failing to design safer weapons and \nowed the city compensation for the cost of emergency responses to acts \nof gun violence.\n  The Supreme Court of Ohio agreed and ruled the issue deserved \nexploration at trial. The court found that under generally applicable \nprinciples of law, it is the duty of gun manufacturers to use \nreasonable care in their design and sales of guns, and they may be \nliable for damages arising from their negligent conduct and failure to \nequip their guns with practical safety features.\n  This is no different an analysis than would be used against the \nmanufacturer of any product used by a consumer--whether a child's crib, \na toothbrush, a chainsaw, or an automobile.\n  The Court also found that a manufacturer could be held liable for \ntheir role in creating and facilitating the criminal gun market through \ntheir failure to use reasonable care in their sale and distribution of \nguns. The Court specifically rejected the argument that those who \nirresponsibly sell guns cannot be liable if the damage foreseeably \nresulting from their negligence was ultimately caused by a criminal \nact.\n  Furthermore, the Court noted the socially beneficial role of lawsuits \nagainst gun sellers and manufacturers can play:\n\n       If as a result of both private and municipal lawsuits, \n     firearms are designed to be safer and new marketing practices \n     make it more difficult for criminals to obtain guns, some \n     firearm-related deaths and injuries may be prevented . . . \n     Such litigation may have an important role to play, \n     contemplating other interventions available to cities and \n     states.\n\n  This case could well be stopped in its tracks if this bill passes.\n  In another case, Hurst v. Glock, the New Jersey Court of Appeals also \nruled in favor of the plaintiff. This products liability case centers \non an incident in which a teenage boy, Tyrone Hurst, was seriously \ninjured when his friend picked up a gun she thought was unloaded and \nfired at Tyrone. The Hurst family argued that the shooting could have \nbeen prevented had the gun manufacturer included a safety feature known \nas a magazine disconnect safety.\n\n  Again, the Court agreed and found that the gun manufacturer could be \nliable for injuries caused by the failure to include a safety feature \non the firearm. Wiped out.\n  In 1994, Griffin and Lyn Dix from Berkeley, CA, lost their youngest \nson Kenzo after he was accidentally shot to death at the age of 15 by \nhis best friend, Michael. Michael was showing his father's gun to Kenzo \nand, believing the gun to be unloaded, pointed it at his friend and \nfired. Michael did not realize there was a bullet hidden in the chamber \nof the gun.\n  In an interview after the incident, Michael described the situation \nafter turning the gun on his friend:\n\n       I look down and I don't even aim. I heard a pop, my eyes \n     opened up and I was shocked. I look and saw Kenzo hunched \n     over, kind of moaning--a creepy moan you don't want to hear. \n     It just stays with you.\n\n  The bullet went straight into Kenzo's chest. Tragically, he was \npronounced dead within the hour.\n  Kenzo's parents sued Beretta, the manufacturer of the gun that killed \ntheir son. They argued that the gun lacked adequate safety features and \nwarnings and that is why it appeared unloaded despite the fact that a \nbullet lay in the chamber.\n  The case sent a necessary wake-up call through the industry that they \ncould rightly be held accountable in future wrongful-death cases. Faced \nwith the threat of litigation, a number of manufacturers have changed \ntheir design standards and designs to include proper and practical \nsafety features. That is a positive benefit all across this Nation.\n  I ask my colleagues, how can we justify giving blanket immunity to \nthe gun industry that manufactures and distributes products that kill \n30,000 Americans a year, yet fail to provide the proper and practical \nsafety features in their products?\n  Under the principles of common law, all individuals and industries \nhave a duty to act responsibly. How can we give total legal immunity to \nan industry that time and time again has failed to act in such a \nmanner?\n  This is not just about manufacturers and the design of products. It \nis also about gun dealers and distributors that know their guns are \nsold to be used in crime. This very bill was scheduled to come to the \nSenate for consideration during the 107th session of Congress. It was \nwithheld in light of the sniper attacks that terrorized the Washington, \nDC area. I guess enough time has now passed that the bill's supporters \nthink we will have forgotten those sniper victims. But we have not. We \nhave already heard today that the victims of those attacks have filed \none of the cases currently pending. The suit results from alleged \nnegligent conduct of a gun dealer that has been accuse of some \nincredibly negligent conduct.\n  Mildred Denise Muhammad filed three restraining orders against her \nhusband, John Allen Muhammad, one of the convicted snipers. Those \nrestraining orders should have prohibited John Allen Muhammad from \nowning a gun.\n  However, nothing stopped him from obtaining the handgun he allegedly \nused to commit murder in Alabama, nor the Bushmaster XM-15 assault \nrifle used in the sniper attacks, in all likelihood because the dealer \nthat had the Bushmaster assault rifle was either negligent or willful \nin allowing it to fall into Muhammad's hands.\n  The assault rifle used in the sniper attacks was one of 238 guns that \nhave been reported missing from the Bull's Eye Shooters Supply store in \nTacoma, WA. We learned about this dealer's dangerous inability to keep \ntrack of his guns not from the store itself but, rather, from audits \nperformed by the ATF. The store had no record of purchase for the \nassault rifle used in the attacks and failed to report it stolen until \nafter the ATF recovered the weapon from the snipers and traced it back \nto the store. Here is a store that has 238 guns that are missing and \ndoes not report them. That is class A evidence.\n  Even after this blatant display of negligent conduct, the rifles \nmanufacturer announced that the gun store remained a ``good customer'' \nand it would continue to sell guns to the store. The manufacturers \nshowed clear disregard for the victims, their families, and public \nsafety.\n  And the store itself, in either failing to adequately account for its \nguns, or even worse, illegally selling the gun to a prohibited person, \nmay well also be liable for its conduct. The alleged snipers were \nclearly aided and abetted by the irresponsible conduct of the owners of \nthis gun shop that managed to simply lose hundreds of deadly weapons \nand the manufacturer that supplied serious combat weapons to a dealer \nwith no questions asked.\n  If they are not liable, they will be found not liable by a jury; but \nif they are liable, should we not allow a court to decide? How can we, \nwith a clear conscience, pass a bill that would deny the right of these \nvictims of gun violence their day in court?\n  As I mentioned earlier, this case would almost certainly be dismissed \nif\n\n[[Page S1547]]\n\nthe bill now before the Senate becomes law. With no liability threat, \nfew ATF enforcement tools, and a blanket exemption from consumer laws, \nBull's Eye will have no incentive to clean up its act.\n  Such disregard for public safety is identified in another case filed \nagainst the gun industry, Lemongello and McGuire v. Will's Jewelry & \nLoan. In this case, the argument that those who irresponsibly sell guns \ncannot be held liable if the guns were later used in a criminal act was \nagain rejected, this time by West Virginia Circuit Court Judge Irene \nBerger.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, a felon, fugitive, or stalker cannot \nlegally buy guns. So sometimes the individuals will find someone also \nto help them evade the current gun laws and get their hands on a gun.\n  A straw purchase occurs when a buyer purchases guns on behalf of \ncriminals or other individuals who are prohibited from purchasing guns. \nFederal law enforcement agencies estimate 46 percent of crime guns \nnationwide come from this type of purchase. I repeat, 46 percent of the \nguns used in crimes in America come from these straw purchases with gun \ndealers.\n  The National Shooting Sports Federation is the gun industry's leading \ntrade association. It is fully aware of the reality that guns from \nstraw purchases are often ultimately found in the hands of criminals. \nThe Foundation also recognizes that these dangerous purchases can \neasily be prevented so long as dealers act responsibly.\n  To promote this policy, the Foundation provides training for gun \ndealers ``to help prevent and deter the illegal `strawman' purchase of \nfirearms.'' In the brochure of its training campaign entitled ``Don't \nLie for the Other Guy,'' the Foundation claims that it is the \nresponsibility of the gun dealer to prevent these purchases from taking \nplace by simply prohibiting any sale they suspect to be a straw \npurchase. Despite these warnings, a straw purchase is exactly what took \nplace at Will's Jewelry & Loan, a West Virginia pawnshop, in the fall \nof 2000. James Grey, a felon and gun trafficker, came into the store \naccompanied by Tammi Lea Songer, a woman who had a clean background and \nthousands of dollars in cash. James Grey methodically selected 12 guns \nhe wanted and Songer bought them, all in a single purchase, no \nquestions asked.\n  The shop's employees were suspicious of Grey and Songer's actions. \nThey contacted the ATF to notify them of the purchase.\n  The problem is that the call to the ATF was made after the guns were \npurchased, after the profits were made by the dealer and Sturm, Ruger. \nThe warning signs were so obvious, yet proper actions were not taken \nuntil it was too late.\n  Just months later, one of these guns, a 9 mm semiautomatic Ruger \nhandgun, was used by a convicted felon to shoot and seriously injure \ntwo New Jersey police officers in the line of duty.\n  Officers Dave Lemongello and Ken McGuire were shot with that handgun \nwhile responding to the scene of an attempted robbery. The shoot-out \nput an end to the careers of both men. The injuries they received were \nso debilitating they could no longer serve.\n  Those officers filed a lawsuit against the dealer and Sturm, Ruger, \nwho both profited from their irresponsible conduct. Their claims were \nrecently validated, and the West Virginia Circuit Court found the gun \ndealer could be liable under West Virginia law of negligence and public \nnuisance for failing to use reasonable care in its sales. As a result, \na jury could find the subsequent criminal shooting was a foreseeable \nresult caused by that negligent act.\n  The bill we are considering today would turn a blind eye to the \nreckless conduct shown by those in the industry that enabled this \ntragic incident to have taken place.\n  Last year, Officer Lemongello spoke before the House Judiciary \nCommittee to protest this bill. In his testimony he stated:\n\n       The next disturbing news I heard was that some people in \n     Congress wanted to take away my right to present my case in \n     court and wanted to give that irresponsible dealer special \n     protection from the legal rules that apply to all other \n     businesses in this country. Other businesses have to use \n     reasonable care and may be liable for the consequences if \n     they don't. Those who sell lethal weapons that are highly \n     valued by criminals should have at least the same duty to use \n     reasonable care as businesses who sell BB guns or any other \n     product . . . Gun sellers have to be more responsible when \n     they sell guns to prevent guns from getting into criminals' \n     hands before they do their damage. What happened to me and \n     Ken is an example of what happens when gun sellers are \n     irresponsible.\n\n  As if the valuable lessons learned from the cases I have detailed \nwere not convincing enough to prove that criminals are able to get guns \non the black market due to the complicity of gun manufacturers and \ndealers, simply listen to the words of gun industry insider Robert \nRicker.\n  Former Executive Director of the American Sport Shooting Council and \nformer Assistant General Counsel for the NRA, Robert Ricker has \ntestified in support of lawsuits against the gun industry--a brave man. \nIn a recent affidavit, Ricker claimed:\n\n       Instead of requiring dealers to be proactive and properly \n     trained in an effort to stop questionable sales, it has been \n     common practice of gun manufacturers and distributors to \n     adopt a ``see-no-evil, speak-no-evil'' approach. This type of \n     policy encourages a culture of evasion of firearms laws and \n     regulations.\n\n  In the same affidavit, Ricker also claimed lawsuits provide a \nvaluable tool for motivating the industry to reform and act \nresponsibly. He stated:\n\n       Until faced with a serious threat of civil liability for \n     past conduct, leaders in the industry have consistently \n     resisted taking constructive voluntary action to prevent \n     firearms from ending up in the illegal gun market and have \n     sought to silence others within the industry who have \n     advocated reform.\n\n  That says it all. They will not move to do the right thing, and they \nwill silence others. That is according to one of their own insiders, \nand we go along with it and are going to give them civil liability \nprotection. I cannot believe it.\n  Again, I do not support meritless lawsuits against any industry, \nincluding the gun industry. But the fact of the matter is, this bill's \ngoal of granting the gun industry blanket immunity would cause much \ngreater harm to the American public than it could ever possibly prevent \nfor an already under-regulated industry.\n  The right way for the gun industry to protect itself from liability \nfor irresponsible conduct is simply to act responsibly, by \nmanufacturing guns with safety devices and ensuring their products are \ngoing to reputable, law-abiding dealers.\n\n  Is that asking too much? Is it asking too much that dealers enforce \nthe rules on the books and prohibit straw purchases? Straw purchases, \nremember, are responsible for the sale of 43 percent of the guns in \nthis Nation that are used in crimes.\n  I think dealers should enforce the rules on the books and prohibit \nthese purchases. If litigation is the only way to keep the gun industry \nin check, we should not give the gun industry total immunity. As I have \npointed out, everything else is stretched thin.\n  This is an industry that is less accountable under law than any other \nin America. The only avenue of accountability left is the courtroom, \nand this bill attempts to slam the courtroom door in the face of those \nwho would hold the industry responsible for its actions.\n  We ought to hold this industry accountable for product standards so \nthat in the event a juvenile ends up with a gun, common sense safety \ndevices will prevent senseless accidents.\n  We ought to hold this industry responsible for taking the proper \nprecautions to ensure law-abiding citizens are able to obtain the guns \nthey choose while criminals and other prohibited individuals do not.\n  Mr. President, I beg, I plead with this body. It is incomprehensible \nto me that the Senate of the United States is going to provide this \nkind of liability protection to an industry that does what I just laid \nout in these remarks. It is incomprehensible.\n  I have watched the NRA win time after time--the latest being the \nFederal database of gun sales being obliterated after 24 hours. If this \nbill passes, there will be no stay on the gun industry for responsible \nconduct because they can get away without doing it.\n  I implore my colleagues, please take a second look at this bill. Talk \nto attorneys like Lloyd Cutler and David Boies. Ask them what this bill \nwill do to merit cases.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to discuss this matter on \nthe level I think it should be discussed;\n\n[[Page S1548]]\n\nand that is, is it good public policy, is it the right thing to do in \nlight of the litigation we are seeing against gun dealers and gun \nmanufacturers that is going on in America today?\n  I do not believe in any way this is a blanket immunity for wrongdoing \nor total immunity for wrongdoing. In fact, it is not that. What it says \nis, classical rules of law ought to be enforced. Some could ask why we \neven need this law. Because how can you sue the person who \nmanufacturers a can of Campbell's soup if somebody buys that can of \nCampbell's soup legally and kills somebody by hitting them on the head \nwith it? What if you buy an automobile, and you run somebody over on \nthe street, are we going to sue the automobile manufacturer for that?\n  What is happening in America is the classical concepts, the classical \nrules of litigation are being eroded. The courts are being politicized. \nThat is a very dangerous thing. As a result, lawsuits are occurring in \nways they should not occur and are impacting our daily lives.\n  I conducted a hearing in the Subcommittee on Courts of the Judiciary \nCommittee on the food industry. Should we sue the manufacturer of food, \nLittle Debbie's, because somebody bought too many of them and became \noverweight and obese?\n  Thirty, 40 years ago those lawsuits would have been laughed out of \ncourt. They don't meet the principle. A person is responsible for what \nthey eat and how much, not the person who provides the cakes and \ncookies and Cokes and those kinds of things, unless that product is \ninherently dangerous and harmful to a person and the consumer does not \nknow about it. We are getting away from that.\n  With regard to gun dealers and manufacturers, this is the worst of \nall. The Federal Government and State governments have taken over the \nsale of guns. Regulations are many. I was a Federal prosecutor for \nnearly 14 years. I prosecuted people for selling guns. If they file off \nthe serial number, that is a crime. If the gun dealer does not write \ndown the serial number, he can be prosecuted and put in jail. If he \ndoes not get an ID from a person who buys a gun, if he does not \nascertain and make that person sign a statement that they don't have a \ncriminal record or make them sign a statement they are not addicted to \ndrugs or mentally unstable, or if the dealer knows that and he sells \nthe gun anyway, then he is in violation of the law.\n  There are waiting lists in States and counties that dealers must \ncomply with. If they don't comply with those rules, they can be sued--\nnot only sued, they can be prosecuted and put in jail. I have \nprosecuted and put in jail people who sold guns illegally. That is a \nfact.\n  If we want more regulations on how guns ought to be sold, let's \ndebate it right here and see if it is justified. We have had all kinds \nof amendments to put rules and bans and restrictions on innocent, law-\nabiding people who choose to take advantage of the constitutional right \nto keep and bear arms. This is what we are talking about. Gun dealers \nhave to comply with these rules, just like the gun manufacturers. And \nif they don't comply with them, they can be sued.\n  This legislation would not keep them from being sued. What we are \ntalking about is manufacturers who comply with the laws of \nmanufacturing, and they sell the gun according to the rules, and a \ndealer takes it and sells it according to their rules, without any \nknowledge of the manufacturer in Massachusetts or wherever they make \nthem. The gun dealer in California or Alabama or South Carolina sells \nit according to the law.\n  Then some activist groups that believe we need to conduct guerilla \nwarfare against a lawful industry want to promote these lawsuits. One \nof our Members said earlier: If litigation is the only thing to keep \nthe gun industry in check, we ought to sue them.\n  That is not right. If there is not a cause of action, you should not \nsue them. They are being sued and are having to expend hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in their defense. They tend to win those cases at \nthe bottom line. But they bring them, frankly, in big cities a lot of \ntimes, where there is an anti-gun hostility, where mayors want to crack \ndown and eliminate gun ownership. We virtually have eliminated gun \nownership in Washington, DC.\n  They are not happy with what the legislation will do in passing the \nlaw. The elected representatives won't pass restrictions as tight as \nthey would like to have or to eliminate gun ownership anyway, so they \nwant to do it through the backdoor, through litigation. I don't like \ntheir idea: If they can't do it this way through law and regulations, \nwe ought to do it through litigation.\n  I remember Hodding Carter, who used to work for former President \nCarter. He was on ``Meet the Press'' one time. He said something to the \neffect that: We liberals have gotten to the point where we want the \ncourts to do for us that which we can no longer win at the ballot box.\n  If we need to tighten up on gun restrictions, let's put the rule out \nhere and debate that. But we don't need to be creating bogus lawsuits \nagainst people who are not doing wrong.\n  I know the Presiding Officer was a JAG officer and served in the \nmilitary. I defended a lawsuit against the United States Government \nbecause a veteran in a veterans hospital walked off the grounds and was \nmurdered. They sued the hospital. There is a classical rule I have not \nforgotten: A criminal act is not foreseeable. You are not normally \nexpected, anyone, to foresee someone will commit a criminal act.\n\n  I defended that lawsuit on the grounds that, well, maybe he had \ngotten lost and this or that, got hit in the accident, maybe. But the \nprinciple that the hospital is responsible for an intervening criminal \nact did not justify the lawsuit.\n  We won the lawsuit. That was a long time ago. I don't know if that \nwould happen today, liberalizing the old principle of law.\n  A gun manufacturer is not required and cannot be expected legally to \nforesee criminals will use the gun and who those criminals are. If we \nthink they should not have guns, we have to pass laws. We have to amend \nthe Constitution, frankly, to stop that. They are doing what is lawful.\n  It is a good effort today. It would be healthy for our entire legal \nsystem that we confront this issue and allow the classical rules of \nliability to be followed again and not allow the abuse of it.\n  We almost voted earlier on constraining liability of doctors who \ndeliver babies. They are getting sued in incredible numbers. That is a \ndifficult thing. How do you deal with it? We voted on it. Forty-eight \nMembers of this body voted for that. But to a much more significant \nprinciple, a violation of the established rule of law, is this idea you \ncan sue a manufacturer who produces a gun that does what it is supposed \nto do and gets in the hands of a criminal and they use it.\n  How should you normally think you would sue a gun manufacturer? If he \nbuys a gun and you fire it and it blows up and knocks out your eye. \nThat is what you are supposed to sue the manufacturer for. If a person \nbuys a gun from Smith & Wesson and he aims it and fires it and it hits \nthe target exactly where he aimed it, the gun dealer is not \nresponsible, if that was a lawful sale of the weapon. We set in this \nCongress and the cities and the States set additional restrictions on \nthe sale of guns. When they do that and when dealers comply with that, \nthey ought not to be sued.\n  If they violate those laws, don't comply with the laws, or if they \nhave absolute knowledge or actual knowledge a purchaser of a gun is \ngoing to use it for a bad purpose, then they have a responsibility. \nAbsent that, they don't. And they should not be sued.\n  This would be a good step in removing from our overburdened courts a \nhost of abusive lawsuits that have no basis in principle and indeed \nshould not be brought anyway. In fact, this legislation does not change \nany principle of American law, but basically clarifies it so these \ncases can be dismissed promptly rather than having to go through the \nlength of time and the great cost that is going on in some of the areas \nof this country where the lawsuits are being brought.\n  I know others want to speak on this issue. I see the Senator from \nOhio and others. I believe this is good public policy. It is time for \nus to work hard to establish a more clear understanding of litigation \nin America. It has become confused. Congress has always had the power \nto define litigation and the parameters of it when it is in confusion\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\nand not working according to good public policy. We ought to speak out. \nI am glad there is bipartisan support for this. I think we will pass \nthis bill and it will be a great step forward to improve the rule of \nlaw in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief. The Senator from Ohio has \nbeen on the floor a good long while and deserves to be heard.\n  As you know, we are in a postcloture environment on a motion to \nproceed. I would hope by early afternoon we can actually get on the \nbill and begin to consider some amendments on this critical piece of \nlegislation. It has been portrayed by many in many different ways. I \nwould ask the Senators to pick up this very small document, 1805. In \nfact, there are exactly 11 pages of big print so all of us can clearly \nread it.\n  I ask Senators to go to section 4 of the bill and read what we are \ndoing. In a very narrow way, we are denying a third party the ability \nto reach through the law and say to a law-abiding gun manufacturer and \na law-abiding firearms dealer: When you sold that weapon, it down the \nroad got misused in a criminal act and, therefore, you are responsible.\n  Shame on us for suggesting that as a basis of law today in our \ncountry. We have denied it. We have always held the individual \nresponsible. That is clearly where we ought to go. That is why I think \nthis ought to be a clean bill. There are some who want to offer \ndifferent amendments. We can deal with them on a different day in a \ndifferent way. Let's keep this bill clean. This is tort reform in the \nvery narrowest of margins, and I hope Senators can work with us to make \nsure that in final passage we have a clean bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for my colleague \nfrom Alabama who just spoke most eloquently, and I certainly have \nrespect for my friend from Idaho who has brought this bill to the \nfloor. I certainly have great respect for the many firearms dealers who \nare legitimate, honest, and hard working, and manufacturers around this \ncountry, but I must oppose this bill.\n  I oppose this bill because it denies certain victims in this country \ntheir day in court. It singles out one particular group of victims and \ntreats them differently than all other victims in this country. It sets \nthem apart. It sets them aside, and it treats them differently. It \ndenies them their access to court.\n  It does not put a limit on their lawsuit. It does not put on a cap. \nIt is not what we were talking about yesterday. Rather, it says they \nare barred from coming to court.\n  It is unprecedented what this Senate, if I can count the votes \ncorrectly, is about to do. This bill shields a certain group of \ndefendants. It establishes an immunity. This bill would overturn over \n200 years of civil law, 200 years of tort law, 200 years of common law. \nIt would overturn over 200 years of civil law in this country and \nfundamentally change our justice system. It would, in essence, turn the \ncivil justice system and our tort law on its head. It would do this by \ndenying one group of our citizens access to the court system.\n  Most fundamentally, the problem with this bill is it sets a \nprecedent. It will not affect that many victims, that is true, but the \nreal reason to oppose this bill is for the precedent it sets, because \nif we do it for these victims, what is to stop us from doing it for \nother victims? And if we don't care about these victims, will we care \nabout other victims in the future, and will we do it to other victims \nwho maybe some of us care about?\n\n  Civil liability law is about encouraging people and industries to \ntake responsibility for their actions, and it is also about protecting \nvictims. It is about deterring irresponsible behavior by making sure \nthere are incentives in place to encourage people to behave \nresponsibly. It is about preventing bad conduct and holding people \naccountable under our common law.\n  It is not and should not be about undercutting the ability of \ninnocent victims to hold irresponsible people accountable for wrongful \nand negligent actions. This bill, unfortunately, does just that. It \nundercuts the ability of innocent victims to hold irresponsible \nindividuals accountable for harmful and negligent actions.\n  The fact is, this bill cuts to the core of civil liability law and \nwould essentially gut it. As my colleagues know, right now under \ncurrent law throughout this country, to prove liability in a civil \nsuit, the plaintiff only needs to prove the defendant acted in an \nunreasonable manner, if the defendant failed to meet his duty to act in \na responsible fashion. That is basic common law, basic civil law, that \nhis or her failure led to harm to the victim. Nothing more than that is \nrequired.\n  We do not normally require a victim to prove that the defendant is \nguilty of a violation of the law, but this bill, however, provides that \na victim cannot sue a gun dealer for damages resulting from illegal \nactions of a third party without also showing that a dealer is guilty \nof a violation of the law. So that in this bill, in effect, for a \nplaintiff to prevail in lawsuit and recover damages, he or she would \nnot only need to prove that a gun dealer acted with negligence, that \nthe dealer was irresponsible, but would also have to prove that the gun \ndealer also broke the law. In other words, the plaintiff would have to \nprove the gun dealer violated a statute or was guilty of a crime.\n  There is one exception to this general rule built into this statute \nwe are debating, and that is the so-called negligent entrustment \nexception. For the most part, this bill requires a defendant violate a \nstatute before he is liable. We do not require this in any other place \nin our law. In civil law, sometimes it happens when you prove \nnegligence, the defendant did violate a statute, but that is not a \nrequirement. That is not something in a civil suit you have to prove.\n  When you study law, one of the first things you learn is the \ndifference between civil law and criminal law, and that someone can be \nliable in civil law to someone else and have to pay monetary damages \nand it not be a crime. That is a basic concept.\n  What we are saying in this statute is, under these circumstances, \nwith an irresponsible gun dealer, that the plaintiff would have to \nprove that the irresponsible gun dealer violated a criminal law. We \ndon't do that anywhere else in our law. Why do we want to do it in this \ncase? Why that special protection in this one case?\n  If those who support this bill think that is such a great idea that \nwe want to build this impediment into this law or the requirement into \nour civil law that you have to violate criminal law before you can sue \nsomeone, if that is such a great idea, let's just pass that law for \neverything. So in any civil suit in this country, you would have to \nfind a violation of criminal law. I don't think we want to do that.\n  If it is good for this victim, why is it not good for everything? \nObviously, it is not. Obviously, we are not going to do that. I do not \nsee anybody suggesting that.\n  Clearly, this bill would make a major change in traditional liability \nlaw and is something we should more thoroughly consider and debate \nbefore we move toward a vote. Why is there such a rush to pass this \nlegislation? This is legislation that I might point out never had a \nhearing. No witnesses were called. No one came in. Yet we are here on \nthe Senate floor today. No discussion about this. Why is there this \nrush to bring this bill to the Senate floor? Why the rush to judgment?\n  I have two thoughts. I guess the main reason we are here is because \nthere are the votes here to do it. There is the power to pass this \nbill. When there are the votes, it can be done, and I can count. I know \nwhich way this vote is going to come out. There are the votes to pass \nit. So when there are the votes, I guess the job can get done. But that \ndoes not make it right.\n  I ask my colleagues who have cosponsored this bill or are thinking \nabout voting for it to think one more time, to think about the \nprecedent that is being set. Yes, undoubtedly there are frivolous \nlawsuits that are being filed against this industry. There is no doubt \nabout that. But there are legitimate victims who when this legislation \nis passed will not be able to file their lawsuits.\n  Why not trust the good judges we trust in every other civil suit in \nthis country to make the decision to throw\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\nout those frivolous lawsuits? There are frivolous lawsuits filed in \nthis country every day in all kinds of cases, and we trust the good men \nand women, the judges who sit on our benches, to get rid of those \ncases.\n  By and large, they do a pretty good job kicking them out of court. \nWhy penalize the people who might have a legitimate case and kick them \nout and deny them, in fact, the opportunity to ever get to court at \nall?\n  The precedent is what I worry about. I worry about the victims in \nthis case, but I worry about the precedent because if we, who have the \nvotes to do this today to this group of victims, say we are going to do \nit because we have the votes to do it, we have the power, whether it is \nbecause this lobby is more powerful for whatever reason, what about \nwhen the next lobby comes along and they happen to have the votes? \nMaybe it is a set of victims you worry about or you care about who will \nbe blocked from coming to the courthouse and filing their case. What if \nit is your child, your mother, your father, your wife, or your husband, \nand they happen to be among a group of victims who some lobby has put \ntogether enough votes to convince Congress to deny them the access to \ncome to court? Their day may come. So, yes, I worry about the victims \nwe are going to disenfranchise and block from coming to the courthouse \nby this bill. But more than that I worry about the precedent we are \nsetting by this bill.\n  I worry about the day in the future when another lobby group, another \nCongress, has put together enough votes to come to this floor to deny \nanother set of victims the right to have access to the courthouse. I \nthink that is what should bother everybody else in this Senate.\n  Let me make a prediction about this group of victims. Yes, the \npassage of this bill will get rid of some frivolous lawsuits. There \nwill be lawsuits that will never be filed because of this bill, no \ndoubt about it. But let me make a prediction to everyone who is \nthinking about voting for this bill. Mark my words, if this bill \npasses, in the future there will be a case or cases that will be so \negregious and so bad that when they are read about and it is found out \nthat that victim could not file a lawsuit and could not file that \nlawsuit because this Senate voted not to allow that victim to file that \nlawsuit, it will be so bad, it will turn one's stomach. Mark my words, \nthat will happen if we pass this legislation.\n\n  A second reason which has not been stated or discussed as to why \nthere is such a rush to judgment and why some people are in such a big \nhurry to get this bill passed: We are having a great increase in crime \ntechnology. One of the great things that has happened in the last few \nyears is our ability to trace guns and ballistics. We are putting great \nsystems together in this country, and many of us in the Senate have \nworked hard to do that. We have the ability in law enforcement to trace \nthese guns better today.\n  I think some of the irresponsible--notice I say ``irresponsible''--\ngun dealers are worried about that because they know their days are \nnumbered. They know when they ship out all of these guns, put them out \non the market, guns that are just getting by today, they know they are \ngoing to be able to be better traced and they know they are going to be \nmore liable and we are going to have the ability to trace them.\n  I believe the passage of this legislation will be more damaging in \nthe future than it is even now. As ballistics technology improves, law \nenforcement will be better able to find the original source of crime \nguns, and that oftentimes would be back to a dealer who should not have \nsold the weapon in the first place. To the extent that we immunize \nthese negligent dealers now, we will be decreasing their incentive to \nact responsibly and therefore deny their victims their day in court.\n  There is another aspect about this bill that has not been talked \nabout a lot, and that is the fact that it is retroactive. How dare us \nin the Congress come to the Senate floor and wipe out every lawsuit \nthat has been filed in this country that would come within the \nparameters of this bill. How arrogant of us to do that. In this \nCongress, we have the arrogance to come to the floor and pass \nlegislation that wipes every case out in every State in the Union where \nthere is a lawsuit pending. Did we really get elected to the Senate to \ndo that? That is what this bill does. It will kick people out of court. \nIt would not just bar people from coming to the courthouse. That is not \nenough. No, what this bill does is kick people out who are already in \ncourt. It kicks out people on whom judges have already ruled summary \njudgments, motions to dismiss, and have already made decisions that the \ncase is at least valid enough to go forward and to go to trial. We are \nsaying, oh, no, judge, we are now going to kick that case out of court \nand take it away from you and throw that person out of court. To me, if \nwe do that, it would be the height of arrogance. I think that is wrong.\n\n  It is not my job to judge these cases. It is not my job to determine \nwhether one of these cases should proceed or should not, or determine \nwhether someone is negligent or not negligent. But I don't think, on \nthe other hand, it is my job to say someone should not have the right \nto go to court and present that to a judge and ultimately, in most \ncases, to present that to a jury. That is fundamentally the American \nway.\n  Let me talk about a couple of cases. We don't need to look too far to \nfind legitimate cases that would be dismissed if this bill were to \nbecome law. Everyone remembers all too well the tragedies of the DC \nsniper cases. Some of the victims of the DC snipers are suing the \nWashington State gun retailer known as Bull's Eye Shooter Supply for \nallowing John Malvo to walk off unnoticed with a 3-foot semiautomatic \nassault rifle. In fact, there were allegations that Bull's Eye not only \nfailed to report the missing assault rifle, this particular missing \nassault rifle, but also failed to report over 230 other missing \nfirearms because Bull's Eye was never aware that over 230 guns were \nmissing, in total. That is absolutely unbelievable.\n  It is, of course, totally unacceptable for a firearm dealer, a \nretailer, to so poorly monitor and protect its stock. If these \nallegations are proven true--again, I don't know if they are true--then \nBull's Eye should be held accountable for the negligent fashion in \nwhich it handled these weapons. Under the provisions of this bill, \nhowever, such behavior would be protected from private lawsuits. We \nwould in effect be saying it is OK to allow unknown people--without, of \ncourse, background checks--to walk off your premises with hundreds of \nguns, be they criminals, terrorists, or in this case an underage serial \nkiller.\n  There is another case in Worchester, MA. This bill would not only \nprevent recovery for the victims of the DC sniper, but the family of a \nyoung man killed in Worcester, MA, by the name of Danny Guzman would \nalso be barred from recovering for the negligence that caused his \ndeath. In that case, Danny Guzman was shot and killed with a gun taken \nfrom a gun maker by one of his own employees. The employee had a \nsignificant record of violence and drug abuse but was able to steal the \ngun because apparently the gun maker allowed this criminal free access \nto his guns without any legitimate check of his background and also \nfailed to implement effective security procedures that would have \nprevented the theft. Indeed, this gun maker could not account for at \nleast 50 of his firearms. If this bill were to pass, Danny's family \nwould be barred from continuing their suit against the gun maker for \nnegligence in completely failing to screen its employees or secure its \nfacilities to prevent repeated thefts of guns.\n  Let me talk about another pending case--again, I emphasize, this is a \npending case--that would be affected by this bill. In this case, a \ncouple entered a gun shop. This was referred to by my colleague from \nCalifornia a few minutes ago. A couple entered a gun shop. The man \nidentified several weapons he was interested in purchasing. The woman \nhe was with was not involved in the discussions between the man and gun \nshop owner and clearly didn't know much at all about guns. Then she \npurchased these guns and she paid cash. She paid cash for them.\n  The man in the gun shop, because he was a convicted felon, was \nprohibited, of course, from purchasing guns. The woman, however, was \nallowed to buy them on his behalf. The man then illegally sold the guns \non the black market. One of these guns was used to shoot at least one \npolice officer.\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\n  Clearly the gun shop owner should have known what was going on. The \nwoman, while technically the purchaser, obviously was merely carrying \nout the wishes of a convicted felon. Therefore, the owner should never \nhave sold her the guns in the first place. That would appear at least \nto be negligence. Obviously the criminal who shot the police officer \nshould go to jail. But the dealer who negligently supplied that gun to \nthe criminal should be civilly liable for his negligence as well. \nHowever, if this bill becomes law, it is likely the gun shop owner will \nbe immune from liability.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there is a possible exception written into \nthe law known as negligent entrustment, that might arguably, in this \ncase, allow the lawsuit to go forward. We don't know. But many courts \nhave construed that exception in the past narrowly under the common \nlaw, so it is a close call in a case such as this. Candidly, though, \nwhy in the world would we even want to take a chance this sort of \nirresponsible behavior might be immune from liability?\n  The point is, we can argue these cases. I know some of my colleagues \nmight come to the floor and say under our bill maybe these cases could \nproceed. Maybe they could proceed. The point is, Why take a chance? Why \ntake a chance? I would argue the three examples I have given. This bill \ncould stop these cases cold in their tracks, and in each one of the \ncases I have cited, we have lawyers we could bring in, if we could get \na hearing, who would swear under oath these cases, in their legal \nopinion, would be stopped by this bill. We could debate that. But the \npoint is, why take the chance? Why pass a bill that would create that \nkind of legal impediment to people proceeding?\n  Again, we get to the point I raised earlier, and that is the \ninequity, the inequality of creating two classes of victims in this \ncountry. Other industries face legal challenges. Other industries have \nhad lawsuits filed against them they don't like. Other industries face \nsuits that in their eyes many times are frivolous and they have cases \nthrown out of court. Other industries are involved in cases where many \npeople die. We understand that. But we don't grant this kind of \nimmunity from civil liability.\n  For example, the auto industry. There are 42,000 or 43,000 Americans \nwho die in car accidents every single year. We wouldn't think of coming \nto the floor and granting any kind of immunity like this for the auto \nindustry, would we? No, we wouldn't. We wouldn't think of that for the \nworld. We can each come up with our own example.\n  But here we are today picking one industry for no reason. We all know \nwhat the truth is, for no other reason than that they have simply put \ntogether the votes to do it. They are here and they have the votes. If \nI count correctly, they are probably going to get this passed. But that \ndoesn't make it right. Victims are going to suffer and there will be \nvictims in the future who will be denied their opportunity to go to \ncourt.\n  It is wrong. I support the second amendment. I support individuals' \nrights to own guns. I support gun manufacturers. I support legitimate \ngun dealers. But this is wrong; it is unfair. It is unfair to victims. \nBut more important than that, it is a horrible precedent.\n  If we do it this one time, what is to stop a future Congress, where \nthe votes are maybe configured differently, from saying, oh, there is \nanother group of victims and we are not going to protect them. We are \nnot going to protect them.\n  If we deny this group of victims their rights, what is to stop a \nfuture Congress from denying another group of victims their rights?\n  Let us think about that before we cast our vote. I thank the Chair. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to first commend my colleague from \nthe State of Ohio. I was listening to his presentation. It was a \nreasoned presentation which I think analyzes this bill in a fair \nmanner. I want to also salute his political courage. It is not easy on \nhis side of the aisle to stand up and oppose this bill. He has done \nthis time and again on many issues. I am happy to count him as a friend \nand as a colleague whose judgment I value very much. I thank the \nSenator from Ohio for his continuing leadership in this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, what is this bill? S. 1805 is a bill brought to the \nSenate floor by the National Rifle Association on behalf of firearms \nmanufacturers, dealers, and their own trade association. It is a bill \nthat has been introduced to insulate those manufacturers and dealers \nand the NRA itself from liability for wrongdoing. It is unimaginable \nthat we would name any other industry in America and say that you can \nsell your product and not worry about being held accountable, if you \ndid it in an irresponsible and negligent way. We wouldn't think of \ndoing it, but we are doing it with the gun industry.\n  I can count votes. I can count the cosponsors. A majority of my \ncolleagues support this bill. I can't explain it. I could never explain \nit. In a country where we value the right to own and use firearms \nlegally and responsibly, we have a bill which says we will protect \nthose who sell and use firearms illegally and irresponsibly. Why? Why \ndoes the Senate reach this low point--possibly one of the lowest points \nin its history when we are carving out an exception from liability for \ngun manufacturers and gun dealers? Maybe my colleagues who support this \ndon't watch the evening news in cities across America. Maybe they do \nnot see the blood and gore in the streets of cities from the misuse of \nfirearms used illegally and irresponsibly that have caused so much \nheartache and misery for families across America. Frankly, I think they \nare ignoring the obvious--that unless we ask those who own firearms to \nestablish a standard of use that keeps them away from those who misuse \nthem, that we, in fact, are inviting more restrictions on the legal use \nof firearms. This bill--this outrageous bill--is going to draw us again \ninto a national debate which is long overdue.\n  Since President Bush was elected and during his campaign, the NRA \nsaid once he is in the White House we don't have to worry about any \nrestrictive legislation. Since President Bush's election, we haven't \nhad an honest debate about a gun issue in Congress. That is a fact. Gun \ncrimes continue, gun deaths continue, and the proliferation of weapons \nin the hands of those who misuse them continues. We ignore it, but we \ncan't ignore this. This is not an effort to restrict gun ownership. \nThis is an effort to restrict the legal ranks of the victims of gun \ncrimes.\n  There is a crime victims' amendment which has been supported by both \nsides of the aisle--Senator Kyl, a Republican, and Senator Feinstein \nfrom California, a Democrat. They make an impassioned plea for a \nconstitutional amendment to make certain that crime victims and their \nfamilies will be present in important parts of criminal proceedings. It \nis a compelling argument. I had my personal questions as to whether it \nrises to the level of a constitutional amendment, but I would be happy \nto enthusiastically support a Federal statute that would establish that \nright.\n  I believe when it comes to victims, they need to be a part of the \nprocess of prosecution. They need it not only because they are \nimportant to the process but because it brings closure in their own \nlives.\n  The many Members of the Senate who rush to the side of crime victims \nfor this constitutional amendment are the same Members of the Senate--\nmany of them--who are supporting this legislation which will close the \ncourthouse doors to crime victims and their families across America \nwhen firearms are involved. Don't tell me your sympathies are with \ncrime victims. If your sympathy is with the victims of crime, you have \nto vote no on this.\n  Let me give you an illustration in my home State of Illinois.\n  Five years ago, in June of 1999, a man named Benjamin Smith went on a \nshooting rampage in my State. You may remember it. It was finally \ndiscovered that he was linked to a group known as the World Church of \nthe Creator. He was a follower of a white supremacist. And in his \nmania, this demented disciple went on a shooting spree across the \nMidwest. In June 1999, Benjamin Smith attempted to purchase guns from a \nlicensed gun dealer. He was denied because a background check\n\n[[Page S1552]]\n\nturned up a domestic violence restraining order which prohibited him \nfrom purchasing a gun. So he turned to someone he knew on the street \nwho could buy a gun--a gun trafficker named Donald Fiessinger. \nFiessinger routinely bought handguns--usually Saturday night specials, \ncheap little crime guns--from a place called the Old Prairie Trading \nPost in Pekin, IL. Mr. Fiessinger would then resell these guns through \nclassified ads in a local newspaper. Over a 2-year period, Fiessinger--\nthis gun trafficker--purchased 72 guns, three a month on average, from \nthe Old Prairie Trading Post in Pekin, IL, and then turned around and \nsold them.\n  The gun store never even asked at any time whether these guns were \ngoing to be used for Fiessinger's personal use.\n  I think it is pretty obvious. Buying three guns a month for 2 years--\nI don't care whether you are a target shooter or interested in self-\ndefense, I can't imagine a need for the 72 cheap Saturday night \nspecials which Fiessinger was buying from the dealer.\n  The manufacturer of these cheap crime guns, of course, didn't place \nany restrictions or conditions on dealers like the Old Prairie Trading \nPost. It didn't say you should prevent the large volume sale of guns to \npeople who are obviously turning around and reselling them to gun \ntraffickers.\n  As a result, this Benjamin Smith bought two guns from Fiessinger, and \nthen he went on a 3-day, hate-filled shooting spree across Illinois and \nIndiana. It was a shooting spree inspired by his hatred and his \nbigotry. He targeted racial and religious minorities. When it was all \nover, he killed two people and wounded nine others.\n  Five of those victims joined in a lawsuit against both the \nmanufacturer of these cheap Saturday night special weapons, as well as \nthe distributor. They included Sherialyn Byrdsong--we know that name in \nChicago and in the Midwest. It was her husband, Ricky, a former \nbasketball coach at Northwestern University, an African American, who \nwas shot in the back and killed as he walked with his children down \ntheir residential street in Skokie, IL; on behalf of the family of Won \nJoon Yoon, a 26-year-old South Korean graduate student at Indiana \nUniversity, who was shot twice in the back and killed on the steps of \nthe Korean United Methodist Church in Bloomington, IN, picked out of \nthe crowd because he had the appearance of an Asian; Rev. Stephen \nAnderson, a minister who was shot on his way to join his family at a \nFourth of July celebration; Hillel Goldstein--whom I met--one of six \nOrthodox Jews picked out by Benjamin Smith on his shooting spree when \nhe drove through a predominantly Jewish neighborhood in Chicago, \nhunting for Jewish families walking to the synagogue for temple \nservices; and, Steven Kuo, another graduate student at the University \nof Illinois.\n  These five survivors and families brought a lawsuit. The case is not \nbased on the fact that the gun was present and used in these crimes. \nThe case against the manufacturer, Bryco Arms, is based on the \nintentional and reckless sales and distribution practices because Bryco \ntook no reasonable steps to ensure that their guns were not diverted to \nprohibited customers.\n  Although Bryco asked the court to dismiss the case, the court ruled \nthat a claim of public nuisance should go forward against this \nmanufacturer.\n  In October 2000, the gun dealer, Robert Hayes of the Old Prairie \nTrading Post, was indicted on 13 counts of violating Federal firearms \nsale laws because he didn't get approval for the sales from the \nIllinois State Police before transferring guns to that trafficker, \nFiessinger. The seventh count of the indictment concerned the gun used \nin the Benjamin Smith shooting spree.\n  Robert Hayes pled guilty to one count of making an illegal sale of a \ngun and was sentenced to 2 years of probation. Fiessinger also pled \nguilty and was sentenced to 10 months in prison and 2 years of \nsupervised release.\n  Despite this acknowledgment of criminal activity by the dealer and \nthe gun trafficker regarding the sale of firearms, the lawsuit brought \nby the victims of Benjamin Smith would be terminated by this bill. The \nfamilies and the survivors from the shooting spree would have lost and \nwill lose their right to go to court because this bill says that even \nif the manufacturer is irresponsible in distributing the weapons and \nthe dealer is irresponsible in selling those weapons to a trafficker, \nthis bill says they cannot be held accountable despite the fact that \npeople died and were injured on this shooting spree. Although this gun \ndealer, Robert Hayes, pled guilty to making an illegal sale, the gun he \npled guilty to illegally transferring was not the gun used by Benjamin \nSmith. That is crucial. Smith's gun was under count 7, an indictment \nHayes did not plead to. Therefore, the criminal conduct of the dealer \ndid not cause the shooting. So the exception in this bill would not \nhelp.\n\n  As a result, Hayes, the gun dealer, the Old Prairie Trading Post, was \nfree to argue that the victim's case should be dismissed because he \ncould not be held liable for the lawful sale of a gun. The court ruled \nagainst his motion and held that it would allow a claim for public \nnuisance and negligence to continue. If this case were frivolous, the \ncourt would have dismissed it. It was not frivolous. People were dead, \ninjured, and someone should be held accountable for it.\n  Why, then, should we in Congress, in the Senate, step into this \nlawsuit, not only prospectively but retroactively, and say to the \nfamilies of the victims that they have no right to go to court, to hold \nthe manufacturer accountable for irresponsible distribution practices, \nthey have no right to go to court, as this bill says, and hold a dealer \nresponsible, a dealer that is literally feeding firearms and Saturday \nnight specials to gun traffickers? That is what this bill says.\n  I point out the exceptions in this bill are so narrowly drawn that \neven if this gun dealer pled guilty to count 7 for not seeking approval \nfrom the Illinois State Police before the sale, the victim's case would \nstill be terminated.\n  The third exception provided in the bill requires that the violation \nof law be a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought.\n  In this case, if Hayes, the dealer, had sought approval from the \nState police, the police would have granted it because Fiessinger was \nnot a prohibited purchaser. Therefore, regardless of whether Hayes \nviolated the law, Fiessinger would have been able to purchase the \nweapon and resell it to Smith. So there is no way around it.\n  This bill is designed to stop those families and those victims from \nholding an irresponsible gun dealer for peddling guns to a trafficker \nused in the commission of a crime.\n  The Senator from Ohio said it best a few minutes ago: It is an \noutrage that we would say, retroactively, we are going to throw these \nsuits out of court; that we would say to these families, these crime \nvictims, they will lose their day in court. Why? To protect a special \ninterest group--gun manufacturers, gun dealers, and trade associations \nsuch as the National Rifle Association.\n  Take a step back for a moment and look at the big picture. We have a \ncase that the court in Illinois has ruled is not frivolous, a gun \ndealer and trafficker who have already pled guilty to illegal firearms \nsales, and yet this legislation would close the courthouse doors for \nthe tragic victims of this shooting spree.\n  Let me give one other case that amply illustrates why this bill is so \nbad. Michael Ceriale, a 26-year-old Chicago police officer, was shot by \na 16-year-old member of the Gangster Disciples, one of the terrible \nstreet gangs that, unfortunately, wreak havoc on many neighborhoods of \nthe great city of Chicago. This police officer, 26 years old, was \nkilled conducting narcotics surveillance. Once again, the mere use of \nthe gun is not the underlying cause of action. In this case, his family \nsued the manufacturer, Smith & Wesson for shipping the gun used to kill \nthe officer to the distributor, Camfour. Smith & Wesson sold this \nweapon to Camfour, even though it knew or should have known that \nCamfour, the distributor, was part of a core group of irresponsible \ndistributors that act as the initial distributors for nearly 80 percent \nof the firearms traced to crimes in the city of Chicago.\n  There is ample evidence that when we trace back crime guns, we find \nthere are a handful of irresponsible gun dealers that are selling these \nguns on a\n\n[[Page S1553]]\n\nwholesale basis to gangs and to gun traffickers. It is outrageous that \nthis continues in this country.\n  For those irresponsible gun dealers, there is good news in S. 1805. \nYou are off the hook. S. 1805, brought to us thanks to the National \nRifle Association, says that if you are one of those irresponsible gun \ndealers selling to traffickers, selling to criminal gangs, shooting \ninnocent children on the street, killing police officers, you are off \nthe hook with S. 1805.\n\n  They argue it is part of your second amendment right to be able to \nsell guns on a wholesale basis to be used by criminal gangs across \nAmerica. Incredible.\n  This Camfour, the distributor, then shipped the gun to Strictly \nShooting, even though it knew Strictly Shooting was part of 24 gun \ndealers that were responsible for 27 percent of the crime guns \nrecovered in the city of Chicago.\n  On August 15, 1998, the gun found its way into the hands of a \nGangster Disciple gang member, who killed a 26-year-old Chicago police \nofficer, Michael Ceriale. Unfortunately, this case, even though it has \nbeen upheld by the court of appeals in Illinois, would be dismissed \nbecause its cause of action is based on the claim of public nuisance, \nwhich does not fall into one of the narrow exceptions written into this \nbill.\n  Now, all who stood with pride and admiration for the men and women in \nuniform, those policemen and those firefighters who rose to the \noccasion on September 11 and protect us every single day, all Members \nin the Senate who say to these men and women that when they put their \nbadges on in the morning as police officers and put their lives on the \nline that we can never thank them enough, all who give speeches back \nhome about the law enforcement officers who keep our communities safe, \nshould keep in mind that S. 1805 is a cop killer bill. S. 1805 says \nthat cop killers such as the Gangster Disciple gang members who killed \nMichael Ceriale in the city of Chicago, those cop killers are going to \nget a free ride because of S. 1805. The family of this 26-year-old \npolice officer, going to court to recover money for those irresponsible \nactivities by the manufacturers, distributors, and gun dealers, will \nhave the courthouse door slammed in their faces.\n  Cop killers will love this bill. Frankly, those that supply the guns \nto these cop killers should be ashamed of themselves and be held \naccountable. But they will not be.\n  So in those two illustrations from my home State, crime victims of a \nshooting spree will lose their right to go to court, to hold gun \ntraffickers responsible under this bill, and the family of a fallen \nChicago police officer who gave his life trying to stop the drug trade \nin that great city will have the courthouse doors slammed because the \nNational Rifle Association wants this bill and wants it desperately. \nThat is a sad commentary.\n  I remind my friends, do not stand before the Senate, saying how much \nyou care about crime victims, how much you care about the police who \nrisk their lives every day for us and then turn around and support this \nterrible legislation.\n  You cannot have it both ways. You cannot let guns flood America's \nstreets to be used with criminal intent on a day-to-day basis, guns \nthat are sold to criminal gangs, guns that are sold to deranged \nindividuals. You cannot stand by and watch that happen and then protect \nthose responsible for the sales with this legislation. That is exactly \nwhat is happening.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed. He has been a \nleader on this issue. We have talked about the DC sniper case, which I \nknow will be addressed time and again during the course of this debate. \nI make it clear that this was no isolated case in the District of \nColumbia when these two men went on a shooting spree killing innocent \npeople in every direction. Sadly, these things are being repeated over \nand over.\n  To my friends who are following this debate who are hunters, \nsportsmen, target shooters or own a gun for the self-defense of \nthemselves and their family, I plead, stop for a moment and think about \nthis. To protect your rights in America, to use guns legally and \nresponsibly, you must tell those like the National Rifle Association, \nthat their agenda on this issue is too extreme. What they are trying to \ndo is to protect those who use guns illegally and irresponsibly. In \ntheir passion to do that they are jeopardizing your rights. They are \nraising a question which ultimately will come back to you, the legal \nowner of a firearm, as to whether or not we have gone too far in \nAmerica.\n  We were told, of course, when President Bush was elected to expect \nthis. The National Rifle Association would have its day. We were told \nthey have a friend in the White House. It is abundantly clear that \nPresident Bush is going to sign this bill. But what is not clear to me \nis how my colleagues in good conscience can support this legislation. I \ncannot understand this. Day after weary day we come to the floor of the \nSenate and say that individuals across America are going to be denied \nthe right which we have considered part of our American birthright, the \nright to walk into a courtroom, rich or poor, to stand before a judge \nin a court of justice, and to ask for fair treatment, to ask that \nothers be held accountable, and to let that court, that judge, that \njury make that decision.\n\n  Clearly, we are seeing, day after day, an attempt to erode that right \nto go before the jury of your peers, your neighbors, and to let them \ndecide what is just and what is right. In this case, unlike the other \ncases, it is not just a matter of money, it is a matter of life and \ndeath--life and death for crime victims, life and death for police \nofficers.\n  That is why the Major Cities Chiefs Association opposes this \nlegislation. They know what this means. They know that police officers \nacross America will be targeted because of this bill. They know their \nfamilies, once they are killed in the line of duty, will have fewer \noptions to turn on those who have used guns and those who have \npurchased guns illegally. They know that.\n  The Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Brady Campaign To Prevent \nGun Violence--all of these organizations have made it clear this is a \nterrible bill. It is a bill that should be defeated. I sincerely hope \nmy colleagues will join in support of stopping and thinking twice \nbefore they vote for its passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues again that we \nare in a postcloture environment. We are hoping we can get on the bill \nand hoping we can look at some amendments. I do have to respond to try \nto keep this debate clear and honest and the Record representing what \nit ought to represent.\n  My colleague from Illinois says the reason we have this debate today \nis because of George W. Bush. He forgot that 10 Democrat cosponsors and \nhis own leadership are cosponsoring this bill and are openly advocating \nits passage. This is not about George W. Bush. This is about the rights \nof Americans under existing law, and also frivolous third-party \nlawsuits that we ought to block. That is what the essence of this \ndebate is about.\n  Now, certainly the Senator from Illinois can say what he wishes to \nsay on the floor. Will George W. Bush sign this bill if it gets to his \ndesk? He says he will. I would think any law-abiding American U.S. \nPresident would want to preserve law in this country, the kind of law \nthat would suggest that any President would want to reinforce centuries \nof legal precedents based on one premise, individual responsibility.\n  Are we suggesting that, as the Senator from Illinois suggests, a gun \nmanufacturer ought to be liable for a criminal act of a third party? \nWell, he used the word--let me see; I have written it down here--\n``establish a standard of use.'' I believe that was the term used.\n  How many automobile dealers establish this standard of use of their \nproduct when it is manufactured in his State and sold in the \nmarketplace, that it will be used safely and lawfully? Now, would any \nautomobile manufacturer intentionally sell a car knowing a drunk was \ngoing to get in it and wipe out a teenager or a teenager wipe out an \nadult?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Not at the moment. I want to be quick here so I can yield \nto one of your colleagues.\n  Of course they would not.\n  Does any manufacturer of a legal firearm make the clear assumption\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\nthat it is going to be used illegally? Of course they do not. They make \nthem under the guidelines of the law. They abide by the law. And we \nprotect those who do. We do not--we do not--protect those who do not \nabide by the law.\n  The Senator also went on to say that this would somehow protect trade \nassociations. Go to the bill. You have held it up. I wish you would \nread it in detail. It is not the intent of our bill to do so. In fact, \nthe Daschle amendment clarifies that we do not necessarily protect \ntrade associations. Well, then you better talk to Senator Daschle. He \nis the amender of the legislation that is before us to clarify that \npoint. We believe we have effectively clarified it, and the \nCongressional Research Service says we have done just that.\n  So if a trade association acts negligently, acts outside the letter \nof the law, then they are every bit as liable as they would be under \ncurrent law. So we do not reach out to do that.\n  Do we close the courthouse door? Absolutely not. The plaintiff makes \nit to the courthouse, with his or her attorney. They argue it before \nthe judge. The judge weighs it in light of the law--if this were to \nbecome law--and makes the decision as to whether that case can go \nforward. I think that is clearly an important argument that needs to be \nestablished.\n  As to the argument about lawsuits involving, what they describe as, \nhigh volume gun sales--I think he spoke to a tragic situation in \nIllinois--the regulations of the numbers of guns that can be sold in a \nsingle transaction, however, are not the job of the courts. They are \nthe job of the legislators. They are that Senator's job and this \nSenator's job, if you can gain a majority of the votes to establish a \ncertain number of gun sales per day. The job of the dealer is to check \nthe background, to check the legality, and to do so openly and \nknowingly.\n  Now, having said that, let's talk about the dealer. In S. 1805, we \nexclude from its protection actions brought against a transferer \nconvicted under section 924(h), title 18 of the United States Code, or \na comparable State felony law. 18 U.S.C., section 924(h), provides: \nwhoever knowingly transfers a firearm knowing that such firearm will be \nused to commit a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime shall be \nimprisoned not more than 10 years, fined in accordance with this title.\n  S. 1805 does not wipe out this provision of the United States Code. \nWe intentionally narrowed its focus so that would not happen.\n  The Senator from Illinois is rightfully concerned about the \ntrafficking of firearms, as am I. I certainly do not want that to \nhappen. But what I do not want to happen either is for hard-working men \nand women of this country--many of them union men and women--who are \nworking in firearms production in this country today for civilian use \nand for military use, to lose their jobs because their company has \nsimply been strangled to death by lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit. \nThat is what is happening.\n\n  We have lost thousands of legitimate jobs in this country because \nthis industry is a very small industry in total. Put it all together, \nand it is less than a Fortune 500 company. That is why it is extremely \ncautious about how it operates within the law, and it is why our judges \nhave recognized the frivolous character of these lawsuits and have \nthrown them all out.\n  The problem is simply this: It costs hundreds of millions of dollars \nto argue the law and to argue before the courts and to continue this \nlegal dance that certainly those who are now engaged in it put law-\nabiding manufacturers and dealers through. Well, that is going to be \npart of the argument we look at here.\n  But I do ask our colleagues to focus on the bill, to understand how \nnarrowly it has been designed. It is a product of a bipartisan effort, \nnot a single-interest effort but a bipartisan effort, to reform our \ntort process in a way to deny a very particular frivolous kind of \nlawsuit of the kind that is addressed in S. 1805.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wanted to ask a question of the Senator \nfrom Idaho but he did not have an opportunity to yield, so I will make \na statement and then yield the floor to the Senator from Washington who \nhas been waiting patiently.\n  I missed it. I am sorry, and I apologize. I thought this was a bill \nto protect a special interest group, and it turns out it is a jobs \nbill. If I had only known that. We have lost almost 3 million jobs \nunder this President, and this is being offered to create jobs. I have \nto take another look at this. Because, frankly, if protecting gun \ncarnage on the street is going to create jobs, where does that leave \nus? Where does that leave us? If we reduce gun violence on the street \nand the number of victims, it is going to cost us jobs. Well, I guess \nyou can argue that. It would be less work in the trauma centers, less \nwork in emergency rooms, less work in the rehabilitation centers from \nthe gun violence victims.\n  I guess we would lose some jobs. I guess the Senator from Idaho is \nright. What a price to pay--your money or your life.\n  The argument has been made we have to support this bill to protect \nAmerican jobs. Crime victims and their families who have had someone \nkilled or maimed with a weapon won't be able to go to court to hold the \nmanufacturer and dealer responsible because we need jobs in America. \nHas it come to this? Have we reached this point?\n  Let me say to my friend from Idaho, I don't understand what he said \nabout trade associations. I turn to page 11 of the bill, and it is all \nabout trade associations. As I read that, I can't help but believe that \nwritten between the lines are three letters: N-R-A. Isn't that what it \nis all about? So the trade association that is being protected by this \nbill is the National Rifle Association?\n  If it isn't about trade associations, strike the whole thing. Get rid \nof it. It is all over this bill, protecting trade associations.\n  I might say his reference about transfers to individuals knowing that \nthey will use it for a crime, the legal standard most of us learned in \nlaw school is ``knew or should have known.'' There is a world of \ndifference between knowing you are going to use a gun for a crime or \nthe fact I should have known it. Because Mr. Fiessinger was buying \nthree guns a month for 2 straight years, at some point I should have \nknown something is odd about his behavior. He was not buying guns for \npersonal use or for self-defense. He was a gun trafficker.\n  Did I know as a dealer that he went outside the door and sold it to \nsomeone who used it for a crime? There was no way I would know it. I \nwas inside the store. But should I have known? You don't include that \nstandard in your bill. You intentionally exclude it because it is the \nobvious and real life standard people are held to.\n  Now that I know this is a jobs bill, I will have to look at it long \nand hard. We need jobs so desperately in America that we are going to \nclose the courthouse doors to the widows and families of slain police \nofficers for fear if they recover from a gun dealer who is selling guns \nto criminal gangs, somehow or another that is going to cost us jobs. \nWhat a sad rejoinder that is the defense for this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am glad this debate has finally turned \ntoward jobs. For the last 2 days we have been having a debate about \nwhat groups to exempt from liability. One of the groups we need to be \ntalking about--because they have paid a heavy price for the liability \nof our economy--is the unemployed workers in America. Because we won't \nreinstate the federal unemployment benefits program, unemployed workers \nare being held liable for our economic recession.\n  I am glad my colleagues are finally talking about jobs. We need to be \nquestioning whether jobs are being created in this country. We need to \nask whether we believe in the President's economic forecast for this \nyear, in terms of the job growth he says is going to take place, or \nwhether we don't believe those numbers and we want to do something \nabout unemployment.\n  In the past few weeks, we have heard much about the number of jobs \nthat will be created this year. And we've also heard some backpedaling \nbased on economic modeling, statistics and rounding errors. In the end, \nthey say\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\nthat the economy is going to grow by X number by the end of this year, \nand we don't have to worry about the unemployed.\n  The bottom line, however, is that the economy isn't going to create \nenough jobs to put America back to work. And since this recession \nstarted in early 2001, millions of people have lost their jobs through \nno fault of their own, and millions are still out of work. After the \nrecession began in March of 2001, this country faced another blow: 9/\n11. In addition to the horrific personal losses resulting from that \ntragedy, our national economy and my own State's economy was gravely \nhit in a variety of sectors that caused huge job loss.\n  And here we are today, still with 2.3 million fewer jobs than in \nJanuary 2001. And yet, some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle would like to say the economy is recovering and we don't have to \ndo anything about helping unemployed workers.\n  Part of our job at the Federal level is to use the Temporary \nEmergency Unemployment Compensation program to help laid-off workers in \ntimes of economic decline. This program is funded by employer, and by \nextension employee contributions. They are paying into a Federal \nprogram that is supposed to help in downturns of our economy to keep \npeople--with mortgage payments, hospital payments, health insurance--\ngoing until they actually have an opportunity for jobs in the future. \nThis has been a essential program.\n  At the State level, a laid-off worker can get 26 weeks of help. But, \nduring recessions that's often not enough to get back to work. So the \nFederal Government has said that in times of high unemployment, we're \ngoing to step in. After a laid-off worker has exhausted their state \nbenefits, a Federal program will kick in that provides an additional 13 \nweeks of help. In some instances where States have really been hard hit \nby high unemployment, such as my state, which had for a time over 7.5 \npercent unemployment, there is an additional 13 weeks of help. But \nsomehow this body has decided, after much debate, that we were not \ngoing to continue that program.\n\n  In fact, in December of last year we tried numerous attempts to pass \nunemployment benefit extensions. We tried to get the other side of the \naisle to agree that this was a necessary step. We were rebuffed by \npeople saying the economy is going to get better, the economy is going \nto get better, so we don't need to do this.\n  I found it amazing that people on the other side of the aisle, when \nwe returned in January, were still asserting that in that debate: The \neconomy is going to get better.\n  Now the President and his Cabinet, who came to Washington State just \nthis past week, are saying their original predictions on the economy \naren't going to be as rosy as they predicted. The President's own \neconomic report, in which they cite on page 98 a chart talking about \ngrowth and real GDP and productivity over the long term, basically said \nthis year we were going to create 2.6 million jobs. That was a great \nforecast. Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said \nthat that is an indication that the economy is going to grow, and we \ndon't need to do unemployment benefit extensions. People will find \njobs.\n  The three Cabinet secretaries--the Secretaries of Treasury, Commerce, \nand Labor--who visited Washington State must have thought the picture \nwas so rosy that they didn't need to meet with unemployed workers who \nwanted to share their plight. And yet, when they were asked about the \nPresident's economic numbers and the President's economic plan, they \nall backed off of those numbers. They all said the economy is not going \nto grow at that fast a rate. Those were just numbers.\n  If they are just numbers and you don't really believe that is the \ngrowth rate, then let's go back to the business we are charged with--\nhelping out in times of high unemployment with Federal assistance. This \nprogram is paid for by employers and employees. Let's put back on the \ntable the 13 weeks of Federal assistance and, in high unemployment \nStates, an additional 13 weeks in Federal assistance.\n  Let's not make a mistake. There are hundreds of thousands--in fact \n760,000 people in America--who have exhausted all their state benefits \nand have no federal program to pick them up. And in addition to the 8.3 \nmillion people officially counted as unemployed, there are another 1.7 \nmillion who are actually no longer counted as in the ranks of the \nunemployed. If we count them, the national unemployment rate jumps from \n5.6 percent to 6.7 percent. These people are out of work just the same \nas those who are counted, but yet they are not in the numbers. Many are \ndiscouraged workers. Many have exhausted their benefits.\n  Let's take a look at the economic policies of the past two \nadministrations. Let's look at what the first Bush and the Clinton \nadministration decided to do when this country faced an economic \ndownturn in the early 1990s. They decided that we should create a \nfederal program for unemployment benefits to help people until they \ncould get back to work.\n  I have numbers of e-mails and letters from constituents in my State \nand other parts of the country. These constituents say that they have \nsent resumes to hundreds of companies and maybe only had two or three \ninterviews. When they go to those interviews, they are competing with \npeople who are three and four times more qualified for the job. These \noverly qualified people are willing to take that job because it is the \nonly job that is out there. Thereby those individuals who are \nthemselves qualified but not overqualified are left without employment.\n  Let's compare the number of jobs that were created in the last \nrecovery and this one. The bottom line is that in 1992 we started to \nsee a recovery in jobs. In April of that year the economy started to \ncreate about 150,000 jobs per month. But, even so, we kept the Federal \nprogram going for 22 more months. In February of 1993, we finally \nclosed the jobs deficit, and yet, we continued the program until 2.9 \nmillion new jobs had been created, above and beyond the jobs deficit.\n  In the current recovery, we are simply not seeing that kind of \ngrowth. Last month, just 112,000 jobs were created. And yet, everybody \nis ready to say that 112,000 jobs signals our great return. We need to \ntake a lesson from history: In the 1990s, when the economy started \ncreating about 150,000 jobs, we continued the program for almost 2 more \nyears. We certainly didn't cut it off as we did in December of 2003.\n  In April of 1992, that administration was not heartless as to the \nplight of Americans being out of work. That administration recognized \nthat even though the economy is starting to recover, it hadn't fully \nrecovered. Under that Republican administration, they said let's go \nahead and keep the Federal employment program going. So they extended \nit for another 22 months.\n  In February 1993, when we basically had broke even for the jobs that \nhad been lost, the Federal unemployment extension program was still \nextended another year.\n  The past recession provided good economic evidence that extending \nunemployment benefits at the Federal level not only helped bridge the \ngap between the end of State benefits and finding a new job.\n  It also provided economic stimulus. For every dollar spent on \nunemployment benefits, it generates $2 of stimulus to the economy. We \nfound out in the 1990s that was a good economic plan, and two \nadministrations, a Republican administration, the first George Bush, \nand a Democratic administration, Bill Clinton, found that this was \ngreat economic policy for our country.\n  Yet today, the administration is simply being heartless. Somehow, \neven though the President has backpedaled on his own economic plan for \nthe year and said he doesn't support the job growth projections--\nsomehow even though we have created only a minuscule number of jobs, \n112,000 in January, the administration doesn't want to continue this \nprogram.\n  I find that amazing. What else I find amazing is that even though we \nhave $17 billion in the UI trust fund--$17 billion that does not have \nto be found, that does not have to be taken from another program; $17 \nbillion that has been paid for by employers and employees, and is, in \nfact, designed to take care of employees during economic downturns--\nwe're not going to extend the program.\n  As the program has been designed, it says these people can be \neligible for\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\nFederal temporary assistance for 13 weeks and, if they are in a very \nhigh unemployment State, an additional 13 weeks. I want to point out \nthat in the 1990s, not only did they extend that program for 27 months, \nmuch longer than we did in the current program, the program was also a \nricher program. The program was richer in that you actually had twice \nas many weeks of benefits.\n  So the current program has fewer weeks of benefits, and it hasn't \nbeen in place for as long--it only lasted 22 months.\n  I think people across America are getting the message. I know they \nare in Washington State. They were so disappointed when the Cabinet \nSecretaries showed up in town and said they wanted to do something \nabout the hard economic times, and yet refused to meet with laid-off \nworkers. Then the Secretaries Snow and Evans refused to back the \nPresident's jobs projections. Laid-off workers in my state said: If you \nguys do not believe in the economic numbers, we can tell you firsthand \nwe do not believe in them because we have been on job interview after \njob interview and have sent resumes and the jobs are just not there.\n  As the Seattle P.I. wrote in an editorial, everything is not fine in \nthe job market. They clearly point out that we have a responsibility, \nand the one thing to do to alleviate the pain is to extend Federal \nunemployment benefits. I ask unanimous consent to print that editorial \nin the Record.\n\n                Everything Is Not Fine in the Job Market\n\n       Helping unemployed workers is the one thing the Bush \n     administration could still do about the lousy jobs \n     environment.\n       Three-fourths of the way through his term, President Bush \n     is pretending that everything is fine for workers. The \n     administration has shown no interest in extending federal \n     emergency unemployment assistance for workers whose benefits \n     are expiring.\n       The country has lost 2.3 million jobs. The recovery is \n     pushing up CEOs' pay, ironically, in part because they are \n     helping stock prices by holding down hiring. And the layoffs \n     continue.\n       Boeing said Friday it might cut 50 workers in Everett. The \n     sale of AT Wireless Services will spark thousands of \n     layoffs. Yesterday, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., visited \n     workers and managers of a Seattle warehouse where the staff \n     was laid off and the building put up for sale.\n       As Cantwell notes, there are far more unemployed workers \n     than new jobs. For good reason, the White House has \n     jettisoned its own prediction of 2.6 million new jobs this \n     year.\n       The fury over outsourcing of jobs is much overstated, but \n     it is fed by the weak economy. The export of some jobs \n     underscores the need for helping unemployed workers through a \n     transitional time until more jobs are created. The one way to \n     alleviate the pain quickly is to extend federal unemployment \n     benefits.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Minneapolis Star Tribune wrote:\n\n       At this sluggish pace, it will take the nation four years \n     to recover the jobs it lost in nine months during the \n     recession of 2001.\n\n  So there are people saying obviously it is going to take us a while \nto recover.\n  The L.A. Times recently wrote:\n\n       More than 2 million jobs have been lost in the last three \n     years. . . . Even in the best-case scenario, Bush will end \n     this term with a net job loss. That hasn't happened to a \n     president since Herbert Hoover at the beginning of the \n     Depression.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these articles printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Star Tribune, Minneapolis, MN, Feb. 10, 2004]\n\n                   Jobless; Benefits Are Running Out\n\n       To a casual reader, the government employment report \n     released on Friday shows an economic recovery finally taking \n     hold. Payrolls expanded for the fifth consecutive month, and \n     the unemployment rate fell slightly to 5.6 percent.\n       To Americans who are standing in the unemployment line, \n     however, the January data reveal a recovery that remains \n     woefully inadequate. If President Bush really cares about the \n     nation's unemployed, as he said Sunday, he will endorse \n     congressional efforts to enact a badly needed extension of \n     federal unemployment benefits.\n       The January jobs report was encouraged in the context of \n     the current recovery, but it was pathetic in the context of \n     history. Since the labor market hit bottom last summer, \n     employers have been adding about 73,000 jobs per month. That \n     compares with 216,000 jobs per month during the economic \n     expansion of the early 1990s, and much larger monthly gains \n     in recoveries before that. At this sluggish pace, it will \n     take the nation four years to recover the jobs it lost in \n     nine months during the recession 2001. There is simply no \n     modern precedent for a jobless recovery of this duration.\n       The slow pace of hiring is taking a terrible toll on those \n     in the unemployment line. Nearly one-fourth of the nation's \n     8.3 million jobless workers have now been out of work for six \n     months or longer. As of December, nearly 400,000 workers are \n     exhausting their unemployment benefits every month, according \n     to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, \n     D.C.\n       (A different Labor Department measure, known as the \n     household survey, has been showing much stronger job creation \n     in recent months. But the department said Friday, as it has \n     for years, that it considers the household survey less \n     accurate than the payroll survey that is showing tepid \n     growth. And even by the household survey, the current \n     expansion is much slower than its predecessors.)\n       Bush says that in light of the large budget deficit, he \n     wants to contain federal spending, and we sympathize. But the \n     modest cost of extending unemployment benefits would \n     disappear as soon as the job market truly recovers, unlike \n     the much larger tax cuts that the president continues to \n     propose.\n       Lawmakers dragged their feet on this question all last \n     fall, arguing that a jobs recovery was just around the \n     corner. Last week a majority in the House finally recognized \n     its error and voted to extend benefits. The Senate and the \n     White House should concur.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 29, 2003]\n\n                      Jobless Count Skips Millions\n\n                         (By David Streitfeld)\n\n       San Francisco.--Lisa Gluskin has had a tough three years. \n     She works almost as hard as she did during the dot-com boom, \n     for about 20% of the income.\n       When Gluskin's writing and editing business cratered in \n     2001, she slashed her rates, began studying for a graduate \n     degree and started teaching part time at a Lake Tahoe \n     community college for a meager wage.\n       It's been a fragmented, hand-to-mouth life, one that she \n     sees mirrored by friends and colleagues who are waiting \n     tables or delivering packages. In the late `90s, the 35-year-\n     old Gluskin says, ``we had careers. We had trajectories. Now \n     we have complicated lives. We're not unemployed, but we're \n     underemployed.''\n       The nation's official jobless rate is 5.9%, a relatively \n     benign level by historical standards. But economists say that \n     figure paints only a partial--and artificially rosy--picture \n     of the labor market.\n       To begin with, there are the 8.7 million unemployed, \n     defined as those without a job who are actively looking for \n     work. But lurking behind that group are 4.9 million part-time \n     workers such as Gluskin who say they would rather be working \n     full time--the highest number in a decade.\n       There are also the 1.5 million people who want a job but \n     didn't look for one in the last month. Nearly a third of this \n     group say they stopped the search because they were too \n     depressed about the prospect of finding anything. Officially \n     termed ``discouraged,'' their number has surged 20% in a \n     year.\n       Add these three groups together and the jobless total for \n     the U.S. hits 9.7%, up from 9.4% a year ago.\n       No wonder the Democratic Presidential candidates have \n     seized on jobs as a potentially powerful weapon.\n       Howard Dean criticized President Bush for ``the worst job \n     creation record in over 60 years.'' Richard Gephardt said \n     that ``I have three goals for my presidency: jobs, jobs, \n     jobs.'' John Kerry said ``the first thing'' he'd do as \n     president would be to fight his ``heart out'' to bring back \n     the jobs that have disappeared in recent years.\n       Bush, meanwhile, is quick to seize credit where he can. \n     When the unemployment rate for November fell one-tenth of a \n     point, he went out immediately to give a speech at a Home \n     Depot in Maryland.\n       ``More workers are going to work, over 380,000 have joined \n     the workforce in the last couple of months,'' Bush said. \n     ``We've overcome a lot.''\n       A number of economists say it's a mistake to evaluate the \n     job market solely by talking about the official unemployment \n     rate. It's a blunt instrument for assessing a condition that \n     is growing ever more vague.\n       ``There's certainly an arbitrariness to the official \n     rate,'' says Princeton University economics professor Alan \n     Krueger. ``It irks me that it's not put in proper \n     perspective.''\n       On Jan. 9, when the rate for December is announced, both \n     Republicans and Democrats will assuredly again maneuver for \n     advantage--precisely because the number isn't expected to \n     change much.\n       ``At this point, where we don't know which way it's going \n     but it isn't likely to be going far, both sides will try to \n     use it,'' says Michael Lewis-Beck, a political scientist at \n     the University of Iowa.\n       In every election since 1960, the party in the White House \n     lost when the unemployment rate deteriorated during the first \n     half of the year. If the rate improved, the party in the \n     White House won.\n       That's not a coincidence, says Lewis-Beck, who has edited \n     several volumes on how economic conditions determine \n     elections. ``People see the President as the chief executive \n     of the economy,'' he says. ``They punish him if things are \n     deteriorating and reward him if things are improving.''\n       By any normal standard, things should have been improving \n     on the employment front long before this point. More than 2 \n     million jobs have been lost in the last three\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\n     years, a period that encompassed a brief, nasty recession and \n     a recovery that was anemic until recently. Even in the best-\n     case scenario, Bush will end this term with a net job loss. \n     That hasn't happened to a president since Herbert Hoover at \n     the beginning of the Depression.\n       Many economists are mystified about why a suddenly booming \n     economy is producing so few jobs.\n       ``We're all sitting there and saying, `When are they going \n     to return?' '' says Richard B. Freeman, director of the labor \n     studies program at the National Bureau of Economic Research. \n     ``It's looking a little better, but we don't understand why \n     it isn't looking a lot better. Why shouldn't Bush be sitting \n     there saying, `Man, I'm sitting pretty. This is a great \n     boom'?''\n       One statistic proving particularly perplexing is the \n     percentage of the adult population that is employed. this \n     number rises during good times, as people are lured into the \n     workforce, and falls during recessions as companies falter.\n       True to from, the percentage of adult Americans with jobs \n     dropped from a high of 64.8% in April 2000, just as the stock \n     market was cresting, to 62% in September--the lowest level in \n     a decade. If past recessions are any guide, those 5 million \n     people who found themselves jobless should have driven the \n     unemployment rate up to about 8%.\n       Instead, the rate never went much above 6%\n       More than half of the additional people who would have \n     reported themselves as unemployed in a previous big \n     recessionary period . . . aren't,'' a puzzled UC Berkely \n     economist, Brad DeLong, wrote on his website. ``They're \n     reporting themselves as out of the labor force instead.''\n       ``Out of the labor force'' means you're not working for \n     even one hour a week and don't want to, either. It's the \n     traditional category for students, married women with young \n     children, flush retirees and idle millionaires.\n       A new way that people seem to be joining this category is \n     by getting themselves declared disabled. This designation \n     makes them eligible for government payments while removing \n     them from the unemployment rolls.\n       From 1983 to 2000, economists David Autor and Mark Duggan \n     wrote in a recent study, the number of non-elderly adults \n     receiving government disability payment doubled from 3.8 \n     million to 7.7 million.\n       The scholars present a case that the sharp increase isn't \n     because the workplace suddenly became more dangerous. \n     Instead, it has been prompted by liberalized screening \n     policies, which make it possible to claim disabled status \n     for, say, several small impairments as opposed to one big \n     injury. Government examinations also have been downplayed in \n     favor of the disabled's own medical records and the pain he \n     or she claims to be experiencing.\n       At the same time, benefits have been sweetened. As a \n     result, millions of individuals who lost jobs now have an \n     attractive--and permanent--alternative to searching for work.\n       Autor and Duggan concluded that if disability payments \n     weren't so appealing, many more people would be unemployed, \n     boosting the jobless rate two-thirds of a point.\n       Another way in which people forgo an appearance on the \n     unemployment rolls is if they decide to go into business for \n     themselves. There are 9.6 million people who say they are \n     self-employed full time, a number that rose 118,000 last \n     month. Without the recent increase in self-employed, the \n     jobless number would look much worse.\n       Many others may be working for themselves part time, \n     temporarily, as a way to get food on the table in the absence \n     of better options.\n       Take Steve Fahringer, who until recently was working for a \n     Bay Area marketing agency that cut 20% of its employees and \n     trimmed the wages of the remainder by 20%. Fahringer didn't \n     particularly like his job. Because the recession supposedly \n     was history, he thought he could find a new position. The 34-\n     year-old didn't think it would be easy, but he thought it \n     possible. So he quit.\n       ``I left July 1,'' he says. ``I haven't found a new job \n     yet.''\n       It's a common problem. The segment of the labor force that \n     has been jobless for more than 15 weeks has risen nearly 150% \n     since 2000. The current level is the highest since the \n     recession of the early 1990s. Nearly one-quarter of the \n     jobless have been unemployed for longer than six months.\n       In Fahringer's case, he spent some time aggressively \n     looking for a job, which made him part of the official July \n     unemployment rate of 6.2%. Then he stopped looking, which \n     meant that he was one small reason the rate started going \n     down.\n       Instead of unemployed, Fahringer was classified as \n     ``discouraged.'' A little more than 8% of the people who want \n     a job in the Bay Area are estimated by the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics to be discouraged, slightly higher than Los \n     Angeles/Long Beach but lower than the battered technology \n     center of San Jose.\n       Discouraged workers have never been included in \n     unemployment rates, although they came close the last time a \n     commission met to reform the system, a quarter of a century \n     ago. ``It was a very hot issue,'' remembers Glen Cain, a \n     retired economist who was a commission member. He says the \n     conservatives on the panel, who felt that anyone who really \n     wanted a job should be out there hustling no matter what, \n     prevailed.\n       Fahringer found an alternative way to earn a bit of money. \n     He did some acrylic paintings, which he sold for a total of \n     $1,000. He calls himself ``a hobbyist,'' which means for a \n     while he moved out of the labor force entirely.\n       Now he's a temp, assigned by his agency to a nonprofit \n     office. For the first time in six months, he's working 40 \n     hours a week. By the government's accounting, he has once \n     again joined the ranks of the employed. But from the \n     standpoint of his wallet, Fahringer is worse off: He's \n     earning less money, with no paid holidays, no sick leave, no \n     pension plan, no health insurance, no future.\n       The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning Washington \n     think tank, says Fahringer's situation is in many ways \n     typical. The industries that were expanding in the late '90s, \n     including computer and professional services, paid well.\n       Those industries are in retreat. So is manufacturing, a \n     traditional source of high wages. On the rise, meanwhile, are \n     lower-paying service jobs.\n       During the boom, it was easy to trade up. Now it's just as \n     easy to trade down.\n       Fahringer's solution: Opt out.\n       ``I'm thinking of going back to school,'' he says. ``I'd \n     take out a loan.'' That would put him out of the labor force \n     again.\n       In some eyes, a nation of burger flippers, temps and Wal-\n     Mart clerks isn't the worse scenario for the economy. The \n     worse is that companies continue to eliminate jobs faster \n     than they create them, setting up a game of musical chairs \n     for the labor force.\n       That prospect alarms Erica Groshen, an economist with the \n     Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ``If you plot job losses \n     versus gains on a chart, it's shocking,'' she says.\n       Losses are running at about the same rate they were in 1997 \n     and 1998, two good years for the economy. But job creation in \n     the first quarter of 2003--the most recent period available--\n     was only 7.4 million, the lowest since 1993.\n       ``If this goes on too long, you'd have to worry there's \n     something fundamentally wrong,'' Groshen says. Although the \n     economy has picked up since March, ``so far I haven't seen \n     anything that suggests job creation is picking up.''\n       That bodes poorly for Ian Golder. His last full-time job \n     was with a start-up publication that wrote about venture \n     capital.\n       Two years ago, Golder was laid off. It was the first time \n     since he graduated from UC Berkeley 14 years earlier that he \n     didn't have steady work.\n       Golder looked for a while, gave up for a while, then landed \n     a contracting gig with no benefits proofreading for a chip \n     maker. When that ran out, he worked 20 hours a month on a \n     financial services newsletter.\n       His wife, Heather, a recent graduate in English from UC \n     Davis, also was without a job. They thought about selling \n     their house in Sacramento and moving, but prospects didn't \n     look any better anywhere else. To make ends meet, they took \n     in two boarders.\n       At the beginning of December, things seemed to improve a \n     bit. Golder got a job in the document-control department of a \n     medical devices company. The department, he was told used to \n     have 20 full-time people. Now it has five, plus four temps.\n       The job will last two months. After that, who knows?\n       Optimists say things will be better then,'' Golder says. \n     ``But a full-time position with benefits seems pretty \n     remote.''\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the point is, this administration and \nthe other side of the aisle need to look at economic history when we \nhave faced similar downturns and discuss what is the best way to \nalleviate this pain as we see our economy barely start to chug along.\n  We have heard a lot about outsourcing in the last week or two. I am \nsure we have not heard the last of it. There are a lot of people who \nare concerned that we may never see that job growth that was even \ninitially predicted in the President's economic report of which it has \nnow backed off. So America has a very uncertain time ahead, but \nAmericans know they have a program at the Federal level to which they \nare being denied access.\n  What are the consequences? My colleagues need to read their e-mails. \nThey need to read letters from their constituents. I read mine. When \nyou know that money is there to help and assist them, when you know an \neconomic plan and responsibility for our fiscal policy is something we \nshould be concerned with every day, it just breaks your heart to \nunderstand the plight some of these people are going through.\n  One laid-off worker from Camano Island said he cashed out every dime \nof his 401(k) savings plan with significant penalty. He doesn't know \nhow he is going to make the mortgage payments, he is at such a \ndesperate point. He is trying to figure out any way he can just to keep \nthe lights on and keep food on the table.\n  Another constituent wrote to me from Bothell, WA:\n\n       I had to resort to selling my 20-year-old naval sword for \n     grocery money. As a naval veteran, I can tell you that hurt a \n     lot to do.\n\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\n\n  A constituent from Steilacoom, WA, who has been unemployed and his \nwife worked at $17 an hour for a phone company and she was laid off, \ntoo, writes that they had to borrow from friends just to keep their \nkids in the house and make their house payment.\n  Washingtonians are having a very hard time. I bet many Americans \nacross this country are having a hard time. That is because we are not \nliving up to our responsibility to pass this temporary unemployment \nbenefit extension. We had this debate in December of 2003, and a lot of \nrankling about it, and we came back in January and ultimately did the \nright thing.\n  In December of this year, when the program expired again, we came \nback and everybody wanted to sing how the economy was getting better. \nNow the administration will not stand by its own numbers of whether the \neconomy is really getting better or not.\n  The House of Representatives, albeit a difficult task, actually got \nan amendment on a different bill and actually passed an extension of \nunemployment benefits. They had the votes to, in a bipartisan way, pass \nthe unemployment benefit extension, but we have not had the courage to \ndo so.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to stand up and say \nthat unemployment benefits are a priority and that they are a good way \nto deal with this economic situation, and that while we have curtailed \nthis program at a much shorter time period when we have not had \npositive job growth--we are still in the negative numbers--this has \nbeen premature and that the smart thing to do now is, as the economy is \nbarely starting to respond, the most prudent thing to do to stimulate \nthe economy is not to take more money out of it. That is exactly what \nwe are doing. We are taking more money out when we do not help provide \nthe stimulus that unemployment benefits provide.\n  So I think this is the best investment we could be making. My \ncolleagues need to realize it is heartless to leave these Americans out \nin the cold without either a paycheck or an unemployment check.\n  In the 1990s recession, even when there had been the start of job \ngrowth, the program was extended for 22 months. And even when we had \nrecovered all the jobs that were lost and the economy had started to \npositive growth, this program was extended another year. So we are \nbeing very shortsighted. While we have lots of legislation to discuss, \nvarious issues about liability, we are saddling the American public \nwith the biggest liability yet, and that is a bad economy and no help \non unemployment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have today asked my colleagues to \nsupport the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. This important \nlegislation has strong support from both sides of the aisle with more \nthan 50 cosponsors on the original bill, S. 659. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of the bill. I thank my dear friend and colleague \nfrom Idaho, Senator Larry Craig, for his leadership. He has done \nyeoman's work on this bill in the drafting, introduction, and \nshepherding of this bill as it passes on the Senate floor.\n  The legislation in question will correct a significant injustice that \nthreatens the viability of a lawful United States industry, the \nfirearms industry. An increasing number of lawsuits are being filed \nagainst the firearms industry seeking damages for wrongs committed by \nnot them but by third persons who misuse the industry's products.\n  These lawsuits seek to impose liability on lawful businesses for the \nactions of people the industry has absolutely no control over. When one \nstops to think about it, it is really outrageous. Businesses that \ncomply with all applicable Federal and State laws and that produce a \nproduct fit for an intended lawful purpose, including elk and duck \nhunting, target shooting and personal protection, should not be subject \nto frivolous lawsuits that have only one goal; that is, to put them out \nof business. It is an outrage.\n  Montanans particularly are proud of their independence and their \noutdoor heritage. We are an outdoor people. People in our State, as in \nthe State of the occupant of the Chair, almost honor and cherish the \noutdoors. We spend so much of our time outdoors. Almost every Montanan \nregards himself or herself as an outdoorsperson. Hunting, fishing, \nhiking, even one's job, whether it is raising cattle, growing wheat, \ngrain, the mining industry, forest products--we are outdoors people. We \ncherish our right to hunt. We cherish our right to fish and enjoy the \noutdoors. Passing this bill will allow us to protect that right by \nensuring the firearms industry stays in business.\n\n  Gun owners and sportsmen are an important part of our Nation's \neconomy. Each year they spend nearly $21 billion in our national \neconomy. This in turn generates more than 366,000 jobs. Those jobs pay \nmore than $8.8 billion in wages and salaries. That is no small item, \nparticularly these days when we are trying to get as many jobs in our \ncountry, particularly good-paying jobs. The industry also provides \nabout $1.2 billion in State tax revenues.\n  In addition, excise taxes imposed on firearms in the Federal Aid to \nWildlife Restoration Act, otherwise known as the Pittman-Robertson Act, \ngenerate revenues for State fish and wildlife conservation efforts, and \nalso hunter safety programs. For example, the Pittman-Robertson Act \ngenerated more than $150 million in revenue in the year 2002 alone.\n  In short, the U.S. firearms industry serves America's gun owners and \nsportsmen well. It provides good-paying jobs. It provides revenues that \nbenefit all Americans. The industry should not be penalized for legally \nproducing or selling a product that functions as designed and intended, \nbut that is exactly what certain groups are trying to do--asking the \ncourts to step in and micromanage the firearms industry when the \nCongress and most State legislatures have refused to do so.\n  Let me now list some of the demands that have been made in these \nlawsuits so we can get a flavor and a picture of just how incredible \nthese lawsuits are. Some would require a one-gun-a-month purchase \nrestriction not required by a State law. That is a one-gun-a-month \nrestriction. Other of these suits would require firearm manufacturers \nand distributors to participate in a court-ordered study of lawful \ndemand for firearms and, get this, cease sales in excess of lawful \ndemand.\n  Another request is to require a prohibition on sales to dealers who \ndo not stock at least $250,000 in inventory. And here is still another: \nrequire systematic monitoring of dealers' practices by manufacturers \nand distributors.\n  These are just a few of the sweeping demands made in the lawsuits the \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act seeks to stop. As my \ncolleagues can tell, these suits are asking courts to step well outside \ntheir jurisdiction and legislate regulation of the firearms industry. \nThey also have nothing to do with holding accountable those who \nactually misuse firearms or commit crimes with firearms.\n  Most courts have dismissed such lawsuits. Some courts have expressed \nsentiments similar to those of a New York appellate court judge who \nstated:\n\n       The plain fact is that courts are the least suited, least \n     equipped and thus the least appropriate branch of government \n     to regulate and micromanage the manufacturing, marketing, \n     distribution and sale of handguns.\n\n  However, the time, expense, and effort that goes into defending those \nnuisance suits is a significant drain on the firearms industry costing \njobs and millions of dollars, increasing business and operating costs \nand threatening to put a good number of dealers and manufacturers out \nof business. That is why this bill is so necessary.\n\n  Let me be clear about a couple of points, though. This bill will not \nbar legitimate suits against the firearms industry. It preserves the \nright of Americans to have their day in court. For example, this bill \nwill not require dismissal of a lawsuit if a member of the industry \nbreaks the law; if a member of the industry acts negligently in \nsupplying a firearm to a person they should have known is likely to \nmisuse that firearm. In addition, it does not require dismissal of a \nlawsuit if a member of the industry supplies a firearm to someone they \nhad reason to know was barred by Federal law from owning a firearm or \ndesigned a defective firearm. So there are safeguards in this bill.\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\n  This bill is only intended to protect law-abiding members of the \nfirearm industry from nuisance suits that have no basis in current law, \nand again are only intended to regulate the industry, harass the \nindustry, or put it out of business, none of which are appropriate \npurposes of a lawsuit. That is what this legislation is intended to \ndeal with.\n  We can all agree when a firearm is used in a criminal or careless \nmanner that causes serious injury, such as the loss of life, this is a \nterrible tragedy. Those responsible for such tragedies should be held \naccountable, clearly, and held accountable to the fullest extent of the \nlaw in both civil and criminal actions.\n  This includes the firearms industry, obviously, when or if one of its \nmembers breaks the law or gives a firearm to a criminal or other person \nthey knew would use the firearm to hurt, kill, or threaten another \nperson.\n  The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act would do nothing to \nchange this or shield the firearms industry from liability or criminal \nor other wrongdoing. At the same time, it is not fair and it is not \nright to hold lawful members of the industry, who produce a legal \nproduct, accountable for the independent actions of third parties who \nuse a firearm in the manner the industry never intended.\n  This is a very simple bill. It has a simple purpose. It is also \ncritically important to a very vital industry and I ask my colleagues \nto give it their full support.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, again, I remind our colleagues that we are \nin a postcloture environment. What does that mean? It means we could \nactually debate the broad issue of the bill for upwards of 30 hours \nbefore we actually get to the bill, even though 75 of us have said \nlet's move on, let's get to this legislation, debate it, offer \namendments, and bring it to final passage.\n  My colleague from Montana is leaving. I thank him for his statement \nof the work he has done in behalf of gun owners and manufacturers and \nlaw-abiding gun dealers. I thank him for being an original cosponsor \nand working with me to get S. 1805 to the floor.\n  I thought what I might do for a few moments, while we are waiting for \nleadership on both sides of the aisle to see if we can't find an \nagreement on how to proceed to this legislation, is to deal with some \nfiner points that are involved in the legislation. My guess is, over \nthe course of this week and probably the next week, you are going to \nhear a great deal said about the bill--11 pages, a relatively small \nbill--and what it does or does not do.\n  S. 1805 has basically two substantive provisions. First, section 3(a) \nstates that:\n\n       A qualified civil liability action may not be brought in a \n     Federal or State court.\n\n  A qualified action may not be brought.\n  Second, section 3(b) orders the immediate dismissal of a qualified \ncivil liability action pending on the date of enactment of S. 1805. The \nkey to S. 1805, therefore, is the definition of ``qualified civil \nliability action.'' That is what most of our colleagues, I hope, would \nfocus on, even though the issue spirals around the use of a gun and \nthat brings about substantial heated debate and political decisions.\n  Key in S. 1805, again, is the definition of a civil liability action \nwhich is addressed in the definition section, then, in section 4(5). A \nqualified civil liability action is defined as a lawsuit:\n\n       . . . brought by any person against a manufacturer or \n     seller of a qualified product, or a trade association, for \n     damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a \n     qualified product by the person or a third party. . . .\n\n  Subsection (5), the definition, then excludes five categories of \nlawsuits from coverage under S. 1805:\n  First:\n\n       (i) an action brought against a transferor convicted under \n     section 924(h) of title 18, United States Code, or a \n     comparable or identical State felony law, by a party directly \n     harmed by the conduct of which the transferee is so \n     convicted.\n\n  In other words, we don't exempt that. We exclude these categories \nfrom that definition so you can still go to court, you can still gain \nredress from that.\n  The second one is:\n\n       (ii) an action brought against a seller for negligent \n     entrustment or negligence per se.\n\n  Negligent entrustment is defined:\n\n       . . . the supplying of a qualified product by a seller for \n     use by another person when the seller knows, or should know, \n     the person to whom the product supplied is likely to, or \n     does, use the product in a manner involving unreasonable \n     risk of physical injury to the person or others.\n\n  In other words, if the seller knows that this is going to be used for \ncriminal intent or for misuse, then of course that provision is exempt \nfrom the protection under 1806.\n  Third:\n\n       (iii) an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a \n     qualified product [knowingly and willfully] violated a State \n     or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the \n     product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm \n     for which the relief is sought. . . .\n\n  Again, the courthouse door is open to that.\n\n       (iv) an action for breach of contract or warranty in \n     connection with the purchase of the product.\n\n  That is available.\n\n       (v) an action for physical injuries or property damage \n     resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of \n     the product, when used as intended or in a manner that is \n     reasonably foreseeable.\n\n  Those are really the key points here that we do not in any way \nexempt. What we are doing in S. 1805 is very simple. We are trying to \nreinforce centuries of legal precedent, based on individual \nresponsibilities, not responsible for actions of third parties. In \nother words, once again the trial bar is trying to suggest that a \ncriminal act is the responsibility of the person who manufactured the \nproduct that the criminal may use in that act. We have never allowed \nthat to stand in our courts, and now we are trying to assure that a \nvery small industry in this country can be protected from the kinds of \nfrivolous lawsuits filed that are draining them of their very \nlivelihood.\n  Earlier this afternoon I talked about the hundreds of jobs that have \nbeen lost. Some scoffed and said, ``This is a jobs bill?''\n  You bet it is a jobs bill. If you destroy that industry, thousands of \nhigh-paying jobs will be lost across the United States in an industry \nthat is legal, that is law abiding, that one might argue is even \nenshrined in the Constitution under the second amendment. That is why \nwe are here today.\n  Is it important? You bet it is important. Is it a part of what our \nSenate ought to be debating? Absolutely.\n  If we are able to do this, we establish extremely important precedent \nthat other manufacturers of law-abiding products will look at, and \nshould look at. Why should the trial bar be allowed to suggest that the \nmaker of a Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, or Toyota pickup used by a drunk \ndriver that ended up killing someone be responsible for it? Because \nthey manufactured it? Since when is this country going to exempt the \nactions of the individual and say, Oh, no, it really wasn't his fault; \nit was the fault of the vehicle. It was the fault of an inanimate \nobject known as a gun.\n  That is the issue today and it really is fundamental. You hear a \ngreat many arguments. One of them is that we are locking the courthouse \ndoor. No, all those principles I talked about are exempt and can be \ntried and can be argued before the courts. Even in S. 1805, somebody \nwho by definition brings a junk lawsuit gets to argue the case before \nthe judge. They get through the courthouse door. The judge then \nlistens, applies the law, and makes a determination whether this is a \nlegitimate case that should go forward or it was an illegitimate case.\n  Will this bill affect several high profile cases such as the lawsuit \nagainst a gun dealer in Tacoma, WA, from whose store the DC snipers, \nJohn Muhammad and Lee Malvo, got their rifle? Does it exempt that \ndealer if he acted unlawfully? We don't know that yet. We know that \nBATF has investigated it and jerked his firearm license and the store \nis now closed. We are told that BATF has asked the Justice Department \nto file criminal charges against him.\n  But we do know one thing. We do know that Lee Malvo has admitted to\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\nstealing the gun from that dealer. Therefore, there is a principle in \ntort law that says that a manufacturer is not liable if the product \nused, being his, was stolen before it was used. That we do know. And \nnow we have an admission by the person who pulled the trigger that the \nBushman rifle used in those tragic incidents here that kept this city \nrivetted for a tremendous amount of time and took numerous lives was a \nstolen weapon.\n  Having said all of that, the case is yet to be investigated. The \nfacts are yet to be truly known. Allegedly, guns went \nmissing. Allegedly, they were not reported.\n\n  If all of that is true, then the owner of this particular gun shop in \nTacoma, WA could well be liable and could well come under the criminal \nlaws of today, and S. 1805 would do nothing about that and shouldn't do \nanything about that.\n  Once again, as I have already said numerous times today--and I am \nsure I will repeat it over the course of a good number of days--this is \na very narrow approach. It is an important one.\n  Senator Daschle, the minority leader, and I joined in his amendment \nembodied in S. 1805 to ensure that we refine it even more to make it \nvery clear exactly what and who might be exempt and for what reason. We \nthink we have so effectively narrowed it that it has met the broad \nacceptance of our colleagues in the Senate.\n  I hope the cloture vote today is reflective of some of that \nacceptance as we work and debate through this issue. I hope leadership \non both sides can get us to an agreement so we might proceed and get on \nthe bill and deal with some of the amendments at hand. I hope we can \ndefeat them. I would like a clean bill. The administration would like a \nclean bill. There is ample time to debate other issues. There is ample \ntime to debate extension of the assault ban. I strongly oppose that. \nThat was legislation I called a political placebo at a time when \neverybody wanted to try to do something, even though they knew it was \nimpossible to control the criminal element in this country unless you \ngot tough on crime. So we passed that legislation.\n  History shows the assault weapon ban did little to no good--except it \ndid one thing. It kept law-abiding citizens from buying certain types \nof firearms even though our second amendment would suggest they have \nthe right to own them.\n  That is why I hope the assault weapon ban as it expires can be left \nto its expiration. I hope we can defeat that.\n  The other issue, the gun show loophole: Is there a loophole in gun \nshows?\n  Let me set the stage for that. I would like to compare a gun show and \nan auto show. If you are a licensed car dealer or a licensed \nmanufacturer of automobiles--I don't know that you have to be licensed \nto manufacture automobiles--then you can put all kinds of auto shows \ntogether, and you can sell from those shows. You can demonstrate your \nproduct. You can sell all kinds of things with no prohibition. In \nIdaho, the only prohibition, if you sell more than five a year, is you \nhave to get a license to be an auto dealer. What we say in gun shows is \nif you are a licensed gun dealer at a show, then you must comply with \nall laws during that show in the sale of a firearm. But if you are an \nindividual who sells very few firearms but you might sell one to a \nfriend or someone else on occasion, and you sell at a gun show, or you \nmet a friend at a gun show and you tell him about a gun you have and \nthe transaction occurs, you don't have to comply with a background \ncheck; You are not a licensed dealer.\n  Someone would suggest that is a loophole. I don't see that as a \nloophole because outside of gun shows it is not considered one--only if \nit is inside.\n  What this is all about is establishing a Federal regulation to \ncontrol gun shows. This will be a new entity of Federal control over \nsomething that is clearly a free market process. Do we want Federal \nregulations over the control of auto shows? Do we want Federal \nregulations in control over new-clothing shows? No. That is the \nmarketplace at work. But if there are Federal laws that control these \ndifferent products and/or sale, then they comply. They comply inside \nthe show or outside the show. That is standard today.\n\n  What our colleagues are trying to do in suggesting there is a \nloophole, which I believe I have suggested by demonstration of facts \ndoes not exist, is to control the gun show, and to suggest if you are \nan individual and you make a sale at a gun show, you then must do \nbackground checks and all other due diligence you would not do if you \nwere outside the gun show, speaking neighbor to neighbor, friend to \nfriend, and were not viewed as a licensed dealer, or not a gun dealer \nin any way.\n  That is the reality of what we are talking about. Those are some of \nthe amendments we will have which we will be dealing with on the floor. \nI hope as we deal with those, we might deal with others such as \nconcealed carry. We might look at the gun ban of Washington, DC, where \nlaw-abiding citizens cannot legitimately own firearms, and a variety of \nother issues.\n  The President asked--and I would like to honor that because I believe \nstrongly in it, too--that we produce a clean bill just exactly like the \nHouse did on a better than 2-to-1 margin--285 to 140--that we produce a \nclean bill and get it to the President's desk; wipe out these frivolous \nlawsuits but still allow law-abiding citizens who might be injured by \nillegal action of a gun dealer or illegal action of a gun manufacturer \ntheir day in court without the kind of frivolous and/or junk lawsuits--\nthe kind that are costing the industry millions upon millions of \ndollars right now and slowly but surely diminishing them.\n  Lastly, if we are not successful and if the trial bar is at some day \nand at some point successful, my guess is this relatively small \nindustry in our country will not be here. What happens when we no \nlonger produce high-quality firearms in this country for our military \nor for our police? Do we rely on China or Yugoslavia or Hungary or some \nother foreign country to produce the firearms our men and women in Iraq \nuse to defend themselves and to enforce the law? Do we put them at \nrisk? Do we say to our good law enforcement officers, You are going to \nhave a foreign firearm on your hip and it will not be produced by a \nlegitimate company in this country as a part of our national protection \nand our freedoms and rights?\n  That is ultimately what could happen because already we have seen \nthese industries go out of business because of the risk of doing \nbusiness and the liability involved based on these types of lawsuits we \nare now trying to shape and limit. That is the essence of S. 1805.\n  I hope we can soon move to the bill and begin debating it in its \nentirety, and certainly any amendments that would then come forward, \ndebate those, get an up-or-down vote and move toward final passage.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent the call of the quorum be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this legislation before the Senate has been \ndescribed as necessary for the gun industry. It is nothing at all like \nthat. There is no crisis with respect to lawsuits aimed against the gun \nindustry.\n  This legislation, though, poses a very serious risk to the rights of \nan individual citizen who is a victim of gun violence to go to a court \nof law in the United States and to simply ask on the facts whether the \nconduct of the individual gun dealer and the manufacturer represents \nthe standard of care that is expected of every individual and \ncorporation in this country. That is very simply what we think is \ninherent in our rights as citizens. This law will strike at those \nrights on behalf of a powerful and influential industry, in this case \nthe gun industry.\n  There has been some suggestion we are trying to protect the courts \nfrom third party lawsuits when, in fact, the reality is these actions \nare based on the actions of the manufacturers and the dealers, not the \nactions of someone with a gun. This is based upon the standard of care \nof the manufacturer and the dealer, not what an individual may or may \nnot have done with a firearm. These are not third party lawsuits. These \nare lawsuits brought by victims, Americans who have suffered themselves \npersonally or suffered through the death or injury of their\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\nfamily members. They are going to court and they are simply saying \nthese manufacturers or these gun dealers have violated their duty to be \nreasonable, their duty to be prudent, the duty of every individual who \nlives in an organized society to behave in a way that does not \nunnecessarily bring harm to others. That is the essence of our law.\n  This legislation turns all of that on its head and says for a very \nspecial class, the gun lobby, the rules of the game do not apply. And \nif there is a citizen who seeks redress, then do not go to the courts \nof the United States.\n  They tried to make the point that this does not close the door on the \ncourthouses of America. No, this bill goes much further. It takes \nindividuals who already have cases in courts and throws them out the \ndoor. Page 5 of the bill:\n\n       DISMISSAL OF PENDING ACTIONS.--a qualified civil liability \n     action that is pending on the date of enactment of this Act \n     shall be immediately dismissed by the court in which the \n     action was brought.\n\n  Not shall be considered in light of this legislation and the judge \nmay make a determination that the suit can go forward, immediately \ndismissed.\n  That is not just shutting the court door; that is evicting the \nplaintiffs from the court, through the door. That is just one aspect of \nthe legislation.\n  There is a discussion, too, about exemptions, talk about knowing that \nif a gun dealer or manufacturer knowingly does something, of course, \nthey might be liable. That is a criminal element because in our \ncriminal law we do not choose to punish people who unwittingly or \nunknowingly do something. There has to be, in most cases, some intent, \nsome knowledge. Otherwise, the criminal law is absolutely arbitrary. It \ncaptures people simply for making a mistake. That is the criminal side.\n  What we are talking about here is civil jurisprudence, the ability of \nan individual to go to court to get damages for harm against that \nperson. That is not a criminal case; that is a civil case. That is not \nenforcing the criminal laws of the Nation which rest upon knowledge and \nintent; that is seeking redress based upon the standard of conduct, the \nobligation to care, to exercise an appropriate degree of care.\n\n  The opponents of this bill are bringing those two issues together, \nconfusing and mixing them up. But there is no confusion about this \nbill. It takes away the civil rights of an individual to go to court \nand a judge and jury to decide whether the individual, the defendant, \nhas harmed them through negligence, through their inability to actually \nconform to a recognized standard of care. It is an extraordinary \nassault on basic legal rights.\n  I find it amazing that at this time when there are so many problems \nfacing this country, we are looking at legislation that is not just so \noverwhelmingly slanted to a particular special interest but one that \ndisregards these basic rights that we all take for granted.\n  There is also a suggestion in this legislation that there is a crisis \nbecause of these suits that are driving the gun manufacturers out of \nbusiness. That is not what the gun manufacturers are telling their \nshareholders. That is not what they are telling the Securities and \nExchange Commission under the penalty of perjury. This is an excerpt \nfrom the April 30, 2001, report of Smith & Wesson:\n\n       In the opinion of management, after consultation with \n     special counsel, it is not probable and it is unlikely that \n     the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse \n     effect on the result of operations or the financial condition \n     of the company as management believes it has provided \n     adequate reserve.\n\n  Under the penalty of perjury, the industry is telling the SEC and the \nshareholders, do not worry; these are not material claims. This is \nnothing that is going to put us out of business. This is nothing that \nis going to bankrupt us. Buy our stock. We are a good deal.\n\n  But here people seem to be suggesting that they are on the verge of \ncollapse because these lawsuits are creating so much liability for the \ncompanies that they cannot bear it. I tend to believe their own \nstatements in their SEC filings. As a result, this is not a crisis with \nrespect to the gun industry in the United States. This is an industry \nthat is extremely well-heeled and very zealous in protecting their own \nrights and interests.\n  In 1999, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry group, \nand others created the Hunting and Shooting Sports Heritage Fund. By \nall accounts, this fund has raised as much as $100 million. They are \nengaged in lobbying activities. They are engaged in promoting this \nlegislation. They are also engaged in ensuring that their internal \ndocuments are protected from discovery by lodging them in a California \nattorney's office. They are guarding, in a secretive way, their \nactivities. This is not the case of a poor victim of a sniper or an \naberrant gunman who does not have $100 million, who does not have a \nlarge organization. They have one thing: Their right to go into court, \nas every American citizen can do, and make a simple claim. If they have \nbeen negligent, I have been harmed, they must compensate me for my \ndamages. This bill strikes that. It tears it out of our law.\n  Now, this is a situation where there is no financial threat of a \ngreat magnitude to the industry. In fact, some of these suits do not \neven talk about monetary damages. They are asking for injunctive \nrelief. I think it is interesting that in the other body they struck \nout the ability to get even injunctive relief to change the practices \nof these companies. So this is not about a financial crisis. This is \nsimply about providing remarkable, unprecedented protections for one \nindustry at the expense of the average person on the street.\n  Again, the suggestion that this is a situation that is required \nbecause we have to protect the whole industry from these suits that \npaint everyone the same way disregards the nature of our tort laws. You \nhave to allege specific facts against a specific individual or \npersonality or corporation--their actions. This is based upon their \nconduct, not some type of blanket attack on the gun industry.\n  But if this law passes, we will limit the rights of American \ncitizens. We will disrupt and overturn our system of tort law, which \nrests upon State action as well as Federal action. This will preempt \ncauses of action that are entirely recognized and permissible in many \nState courts throughout the country. We will be disregarding the \nStates, their legal systems, their knowledge of local conditions. That \nis another casualty of this legislation if it passes.\n  But this, ultimately, is not just about the niceties of tort law and \nfederalism and the financial impact on industries. This is about real \npeople.\n  I had occasion to meet one of these individuals when I met Denise \nJohnson. Denise was the wife of the late Conrad Johnson. Conrad was a \nbusdriver and was the final victim of the Washington area snipers. The \nsnipers' Bushmaster assault rifle was one of more than 230 weapons that \ndisappeared from Bull's Eye Shooter Supply gun store in Washington \nState.\n  Now, at a minimum, the gun store's very careless oversight of \nfirearms raises obvious questions of negligence and deserves to be \nexplored by the civil courts. The actions which the gun manufacturer \ntook in placing those weapons in the hands of Bulls Eye also are \nappropriate for scrutiny in the courts. Yet Mrs. Johnson's case would \nbe thrown out by S. 1805.\n\n  Now, consider also the case of David Lemongello and Ken McGuire. \nThese are two young police officers from New Jersey, the city of \nOrange. On January 12, 2001, they responded to a call, as police \nofficers do every day throughout our country. Every day they risk their \nlives. What they encountered in a backyard was a gunman armed with a \nweapon. They were both grievously wounded.\n  It turns out that this individual went into a store in West Virginia \nwith a straw purchaser--a woman without a criminal record--who \npurchased 12 guns at one time--he was a felon--and then took those guns \nand went off and became involved in these crimes, became involved in \nthe disposition of these weapons.\n  This individual seller in West Virginia failed to follow the \nguidelines that even the trade association, the National Shooting \nSports Foundation, has. So here is the seller, who is not at all averse \nto selling 12 firearms, in cash, to an individual, who walks in, who \nrefuses to buy them himself but has a younger person, a woman in this \ncase, make the purchase in name because of background checks, who \ndisregards the guidelines of the industry,\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\nand yet this legislation would say that those two police officers, who \nsuffered grievously, cannot seek to be compensated by that dealer. It \ndefies common sense as well as our legal tradition.\n  Now, the manufacturer of those guns, Sturm, Ruger is a member of the \nShooting Sports Federation. I would assume they take great pride in \ntheir advertisements and say: Look at the guidelines we have. Our sales \npeople have to be reasonable. They have to exercise great scrutiny, \ngood judgment, et cetera. Well, they do not really require that these \nguidelines be followed, even though their organization promulgated \nthem.\n  Now, this case is in the courts of West Virginia. Judge Irene Berger \nof Kanawha County, WV, looked at the case, looked at the law of West \nVirginia, looked at the specific allegations against the dealers, and \nsaid this case should go forward, there are no grounds for summary \ndismissal. Yet this legislation, if passed, would summarily dismiss \nthat case. It would fall, I think, squarely under section 3(b):\n\n       A qualified civil liability action that is pending on the \n     date of enactment of this Act shall be immediately dismissed. \n     . . .\n\n  Judge Berger will not have a chance to evaluate whether this \nlegislation and the exemptions comply, not in any real sense, because \nthe presumption, of course, is that all these suits would be barred. \nThere are exceptions which she may consider, but, again, those \nexceptions are so narrowly constructed that they provide little relief, \nno practical relief.\n  Now, there is not just one case. There are multiple cases but not the \nthousands that the industry would lead you to believe they would be \noverwhelmed by--but a few cases, inconsequential in monetary effect for \nthe industry, as they stated, but of immense consequences to the \nindividual who has suffered financially, emotionally, personally, and \nto that individual's family.\n  This is another case. This is Guzman v. Kahr Arms, in Worcester, MA. \nTwenty-six-year-old Danny Guzman was fatally wounded with a 9 mm gun. \nIt was stolen from the gun manufacturer's plant by a drug addicted \nemployee who had a criminal record.\n  Stop and ask yourself: Does a gun manufacturer have a responsibility \nto the community to ensure that its employees who have access to \nfirearms are not former felons or somehow at odds with the law or who \nis not currently addicted to drugs? Isn't that the expectation that \neveryone in that community and every community around the country has? \nWell, of course.\n  Any sensible employer would ensure that an employee who has access to \nfirearms would have some type of check to ensure they are not drug \naddicts or former felons.\n  They would be amazed if this legislation passed because, frankly, \nwhat we are telling the Kahr Arms company is, no, hire anybody you want \nbecause you will have no civil liability, none whatsoever.\n  Now, this company had rudimentary and ineffective controls for these \nweapons. They had no metal detectors, security mirrors, none of these \nthings. Is that something the citizens of Worcester, the citizens of \nMassachusetts, the citizens of America want?\n  That is common sense. These companies have to protect these weapons. \nThey have an arsenal. They manufacture weapons.\n  Apparently, that was not the case. It turns out the guns were taken \nfrom the factory by felons they hired without conducting background \nchecks.\n  The gun used to kill Danny Guzman was one of several stolen by Kahr \nArms employees. This is not just one bad actor. And maybe that is the \ndefense: We are really pretty good. We just made one mistake. And they \nwere stolen before the serial numbers were etched into the weapons. \nThey could not be traced. What kind of company is this?\n  But what we are telling them, if we pass this legislation, is go \nahead, it is fine, no liability for that, do that every day, just one \nof those things.\n  These guns were taken and resold to criminals in exchange for money \nand drugs. Again, common sense suggests there has to be a civil right \nto go in and challenge the negligence of this company. The loaded gun \nthat killed Mr. Guzman was found by a 4-year-old behind an apartment \nbuilding near the scene of the shooting, so the gun was apparently \ntossed away and a 4-year-old found it. Mercifully, the child was not \ninjured.\n  This company could have done a score of things to prevent the death \nof Danny Guzman: Screen their employees for felony convictions, screen \ntheir employees for drugs, install safety cameras. What we are telling \nthem, if we pass this legislation, is you don't have to do any of those \nthings, because you can do anything you want and you will never be \nliable in a court of law in the United States.\n  Will we tell that to the automobile manufacturers? Will we tell that \nto other industries? Absolutely not. It defies and insults common \nsense. But we are trying to do that today.\n  There is another suggestion that you are trying to punish a whole \nindustry because of a few bad apples. Like any industry, there are some \nscrupulous dealers, and we hope it is the majority. In fact, it does \nturn out to be the majority. But according to Federal data, 1.2 percent \nof gun dealers account for 57 percent of all guns recovered in criminal \ninvestigations. So obviously we have a problem with a small group of \ndealers.\n  What are we telling those dealers today if we pass the legislation? \nDon't worry; you can't be sued. Even if you represent the worst \npossible dealers in the industry, even if you don't barely measure up \nto the standards of every other dealer, you are OK, because the rules \nof negligence don't apply.\n  This is something that confounds common sense--forget the niceties of \ncorporate law, of consumer protection law, of the tort system.\n  Most people believe that if you are in the business of manufacturing \nand selling weapons, you have a very high standard of care, higher \nperhaps than other industries, because you are dealing with a weapon \nthat has the potential to kill people, much more obviously and \nexplicitly than perhaps any other product manufactured.\n  What are we telling the industry? Forget that high standard of care. \nNot only can you have a low standard of care, you can have no standard \nof care, because you can do the most outrageous things in the world and \nno one can sue you. There might be some criminal liability, but then \nagain, there might not. But the people you have harmed through your \nnegligence will remain harmed and uncompensated. Don't worry.\n  Most industries, manufacturers, are governed by the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, which regulates the safety of nearly 15,000 consumer \nproducts used in and around the home. Guns are not regulated by the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission because when it was created in 1972, \nthe gun lobby pressured Congress to specifically exempt guns and \nammunition from its jurisdiction. So there is no regulation by the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission.\n\n  Now there is no civil liability. Whatever standard of care exists in \nthis industry is going to further deteriorate. We are causing problems; \nwe are not solving problems with this legislation.\n  There is another aspect, too. It is not just the criminal on the \nstreet who comes into control of a handgun, be it through the poor \ninventory controls of a Bull's Eye Shooters Company or through the lack \nof any apparent security procedures of the Kahr Arms Company. There \nwere 9,485 people killed and another 127,000 wounded in unintentional \nshootings between 1993 and 2001. In about an 8-year period, 127,000 \npeople were unintentionally wounded by weapons; the firearm was \ndefective or the design was inappropriate and it contributed to their \ninjury. Don't we want to at least ensure in the design of weapons that \nthere is a higher standard of care?\n  For example, there is a case in California of a 15-year-old who was \nunintentionally shot and killed by a 14-year-old friend with a \ndefectively designed gun--Kenzo Dix. His friend Michael thought he had \nunloaded his father's gun. He replaced it with an unloaded magazine, he \nthought. But he failed to realize that in the chamber of the weapon \nthere was still one round, and when he fired the gun, it resulted in \nthe death of his playmate.\n  Sadly, we read these stories too often. We read these stories about \nthe individual who has a gun at home and\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\nthe kid find it. The kids don't realize it is loaded, and death or \ninjury results.\n  Now Beretta, the manufacturer, could have easily designed the gun to \nhave some type of indication whether there was a round in the chamber. \nThey could have had some type of active device to prevent firing. None \nof that was done, and, frankly, if we pass this legislation, it will \nnever be done because they don't have to worry about a parent coming \nand saying: If you had made these changes to that weapon, my son would \nbe alive.\n  They don't have anything to worry about. We have to worry about it. \nIf you are a parent and you have a firearm in your home, you have to \nworry about it especially. That is not right.\n  Again, this is not about sophisticated theories of liability, \nsophisticated theories of the history of tort law. It is about common \nsense, common decency, and common obligation. This bill violates all of \nthem.\n  There are lots of experts about firearms, but there is one group that \nI think probably is more expert than others. That is the law \nenforcement community. Where do they stand on this legislation? More \nthan 80 police chiefs, sheriffs, and State and national law enforcement \norganizations wrote to all of us on February 11 to express their \nopposition to this effort to strip away these legal rights. These are \nofficers from Maine to Texas to Washington State to Virginia to my home \nState of Rhode Island, chiefs, rank-and-file police men and women.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. REED. These law enforcement officers know a bit more about crime \nthan we do. It is their job. They do it very well. They know about the \ndamage to communities when guns fall into the hands of those who misuse \nthem. They see it up close and personal.\n  Earlier this year, we were in a situation where previous to this bill \nthere was an effort to destroy gun records, another effort launched on \nbehalf of the gun lobby. These records are maintained for a few days, \nbut they wanted to eliminate these records within 24 hours. Los Angeles \nChief of Police William Bratton said: I just can't understand how \nMembers of Congress can even consider this. Obviously, they haven't \nshown up to the scene of enough officer shootings.\n  This legislation is in a similar vein. It is not about destroying \nrecords of gun purchases. It is destroying the right of an individual \nto say: I have been harmed. I need redress.\n  Again, if you talk to the law enforcement community, they are opposed \nto this legislation. It is a free ride for the dealers, for the \nmanufacturers, and for others.\n  In this discussion, we have heard a great deal about Bull's Eye \nShooters Supply. There is some suggestion that we fixed that problem. \nThey have closed it and everyone is being punished.\n  Here are the facts: Bull's Eye Shooters Supply is still open for \nbusiness. The alcohol, tobacco, and firearms agency revoked the license \nof Bull's Eye prior owner, Mr. Brian Borgelt. Mr. Borgelt's friend, \nKris Kindschuh, then took over operation of the store.\n  Mr. Borgelt is appealing his license revocation to the Federal \ndistrict court, and that case is pending. Let me stop for a moment. \nThis is an individual who allegedly was so negligent that he could not \naccount for 238 weapons, a litany of problems in terms of following the \nlaw. His license is being revoked, but he has a right--and he should \nhave the right--to go into court and say this revocation is not based \nupon the law or the facts.\n  The irony here, of course, is we are telling victims--perhaps his \nvictims--that they do not have a right to go into court to seek \nredress. This, again, not only is unfortunate, it just defies a rough \nsense of justice and fairness.\n  I think Mr. Borgelt should have every opportunity to appeal this \nrevocation to prevent an arbitration action by the Government, but \ndon't the victims of gun violence have a right to claim they have lost \na great deal and they need redress in the courts? We will protect his \nrights, as we should, but we are undermining the rights of so many \nothers.\n  As far as we know, the ATF, the Department of Justice have not filed \nany criminal charges against Borgelt. So the idea that this situation \nhas been resolved, that this is fine, justice has been done, frankly, \nis not the case at all.\n  Indeed, what I am told is Mr. Borgelt runs the shooting range \nupstairs above Bull's Eye Shooter Supply. The shooting range is not \nregulated. So for all intents and purposes, particularly if you are a \nvictim of the sniper shootings in Washington, DC, it does not look as \nif much has changed out there at Bull's Eye Shooter Supply.\n  If the ATF had recommended to the Department of Justice that they \nfile charges, it has been almost a year. I would hope the Department of \nJustice, in a case such as this, could move more promptly. But we have \na situation, frankly, that even if the Justice Department acted, it \nstill would not compensate and make whole the victims of this series of \ncrimes in Washington.\n  Let me focus for a minute on some of the facts we know about Bull's \nEye Shooter Supply because one of the key issues here is whether or not \nthe Washington sniper victims will be able to go into court if this \nlegislation passes.\n  Here are some of the things that have been established so far about \nthis dealer in Washington State.\n  There are a large number of missing guns. Bull's Eye could not \naccount for 238 guns that were missing from its inventory when the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives inspected the gun \ndealer in 2000 and 2002. Bull's Eye's missing gun rate was greater than \nat least 99.73 percent of all Federal firearms licensees.\n  There was no accounting for 238 weapons. A large number of guns from \nBull's Eye appeared in crimes. Between 1997 and 2001, Bulls' Eye guns \nwere involved in at least 52 crimes, including homicides, kidnappings, \nand assaults, placing Bull's Eye in the top 1 percent of all dealers \nnationwide in the supply of guns used in crimes. This appears to be a \npretty good source of weapons for crime.\n  In addition, the time-to-crime ratio was less than 3 years for more \nthan 70 percent of Bull's Eye guns that were used in crimes from 1997 \nto 2001. Quick time-to-crime--the time the gun leaves the store and \nshows up at a crime--suggests this store may be a highway for guns into \nthe criminal system. And they have a high rate.\n  There were a large number of multiple firearm sales. Between 1997 and \n2000, Bull's Eye sold 663 guns to 265 individual buyers, as many as 10 \nguns at a time. This is not the record of a scrupulous, sincere dealer \nwho is looking to enforce the standards of the industry.\n\n  Then, of course, there were numerous ATF citations. ATF cited Bull's \nEye for violations at least 15 times between 1997 and 2001 and, \nfollowing the sniper attacks, revoked the license of Bull's Eye's \nformer owner.\n  Bull's Eye was cited 15 times between 1997 and 2001. That is not an \ninspiring record of scrupulous enforcement of the laws of the country.\n  Yet what we are saying in this legislation is: Go ahead, you are \nfine; you might have your license revoked, but then you are upstairs in \nthe shooting gallery. Or you might not. Maybe the Government will make \nan error. Maybe procedurally they have done something inappropriate, \nbut certainly you are not going to be able to face justice in the sense \nof facing the victims of this negligence.\n  There is something else this record says. It begs the question, What \nabout the manufacturer? Why did Bushmaster Firearms, the manufacturer \nof the sniper weapon used by the Washington area snipers, tolerate \nthis? Don't they have an obligation to ensure that the dealers they \nentrust with their weapons are not violating ATF regulations--cited 15 \ntimes--that they are not selling multiple guns to individuals, \nsometimes 10 at a time? Apparently not. After this legislation passes, \nthey won't have to worry at all.\n  Many people ask, Why would a manufacturer be involved in this issue? \nWhy should we be able to sue a manufacturer? If a manufacturer, such as \nBushmaster, not only keeps supplying weapons to dealers such as this, \nbut then turns a blind eye to all this evidence, it suggests to me they \nare not conforming to a reasonable standard of commercial conduct. You \nwould not exempt an automobile manufacturer\n\n[[Page S1564]]\n\nfrom potential liability if it was shown that they repeatedly sold cars \nto dealers that violated ATF--it would not be ATF regulations, but \nconsistently violated regulations, that persistently allowed underage \nsales, for example, even though you could make the argument that as \nlong as the 15-year-old does not drive the car, it is a legal sale. But \nI think they would be suspicious at least to what was happening.\n  As a result, there is not only a strong case but there is a necessary \ncase that manufacturers have to be subject to a standard of care also. \nThis legislation would strip that away.\n  My colleague from Idaho and my colleagues on this side who support \nthis bill say: Listen, this is narrowly crafted; this is not going to \nthrow any suits out of the courts. You cannot have it both ways. You \ncannot be claiming, on one hand, that we are protecting this industry \nfrom lawsuit and then, on the other hand, say everyone can still go to \ncourt after this legislation because they all qualify for the \nexemptions. It is nonsense. These exemptions have been made so they do \nnot exempt very much, if anything at all.\n  There is an analysis--and I made reference to it in my discussion \nsurrounding Bull's Eye Shooter Supply--by the law firm of Boies, \nSchiller & Flexner. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of \nmy remarks this analysis be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this law firm analyzed the legislation, and \ntheir conclusion is, particularly with regard to the Washington area \nsnipers, that their cases will be thrown out.\n  There are two sections of the law which provide an exemption from the \ncategorical dismissal of these cases. They are section (5)(A)(ii) and \n(5)(A)(iii). Mr. President, (5)(A)(ii) says:\n\n       . . . actions against a seller for ``negligent \n     entrustment'' or ``negligence per se''. . . .\n\n  And (5)(A)(iii) says:\n\n       . . . actions against a manufacturer or seller who violated \n     a statute in the sale or marketing of a firearm or \n     ammunition, where that statutory violation was a proximate \n     cause of the plaintiff's injuries. . . .\n\n  Their analysis concludes that neither of these exemptions would apply \nin the case of the Washington area snipers. Those cases are already \npending. They will be dismissed, thrown out.\n  It is interesting because we continue to talk about, well, these \nexemptions will take care of all these cases, but it turns out that \nthey will not, that the various nuances, the wording, the knowing \nviolation of a statute, for example, the arcane cases of negligence \nentrustment and negligence per se, which are constructs that only a \nlawyer could fully appreciate and enjoy, all of this is craftily \ndesigned to prevent people from going to court, not to give them a fair \nright in court.\n\n  Again, it goes down not to these nuances, to this legal terminology \nbut simple common sense. How can one stand up and say this legislation \nis designed to protect and insulate injury from the wanton acts of \nthese third party criminals and then also say but, by the way, all of \nthese cases will still go through?\n  I suspect there are things we could do right now to help these cases \ngo through. ``Dismissal of pending actions'' could be struck. Clearly, \nthat would suggest that the sniper cases would be in order because this \nlegislation is not retroactive.\n  The thrust is not to give people rights; it is to take them away. It \nis to protect this one industry at the expense of individual Americans. \nThe legislation is unusually preferential to a small interest group. It \ndefies my understanding of why we would try to protect this industry, \nwhich is not financially at risk by their own admissions, at the \nexpense of individual Americans who have been harmed.\n  I conclude by saying I never met Conrad Johnson, but like all of us \nin this Chamber, I woke up one morning and read about a bus driver \nreading his paper, waiting to go to work. I, frankly, thought of my \nfather, who was a school custodian who got up in the morning, read the \npaper, getting ready to go to work.\n  He was shot reading that paper, killed. He left a wife and small \nchildren. That wife and that family have gone to court to say: Where is \nour justice? Maybe somebody will be convicted for doing something \nwrong, but how are we going to live for the next 40 or 50 years? People \nhave been negligent--at least we think they have. There is a Bull's Eye \nShooters store that lost 238 weapons and was cited 15 times by the ATF. \nThey are not going to have a day in court to answer to Mrs. Johnson? I \ncannot understand this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                February 11, 2004.\n       Dear Senator: As active and retired law enforcement \n     officers, we are writing to urge your strong opposition to S. \n     659, the so-called ``Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \n     Act.'' This bill would strip away the legal rights of gun \n     violence victims, including law enforcement officers and \n     their families, to seek redress against irresponsible gun \n     dealers and manufacturers.\n       The impact of this bill on the law enforcement community is \n     well illustrated by the lawsuit brought by former Orange, New \n     Jersey police officers Ken McGuire and David Lemongello. On \n     January 12, 2001, officers McGuire and Lemongello were \n     seriously wounded in a shoot-out with a burglary suspect. The \n     Ruger pistol used by the suspect was one of twelve guns sold \n     by a West Virginia pawnshop, Will's Jewelry and Loan, to a \n     ``straw purchaser'' for a gun trafficker. The all-cash sale, \n     for thousands of dollars, was so obviously suspicious that \n     Will's reported it to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms, but only after the sale was consummated. The \n     pawnshop had every reason to believe that, as soon as the \n     guns left its premises, they would be sold into the \n     underground market, destined to threaten the lives of police \n     officers and ordinary citizens.\n       Officers McGuire and Lemongello are pursuing legal action \n     against Will's for negligent sales practices and against the \n     gun's manufacturer, Sturm, Ruger, for distributing guns \n     without requiring its dealers to adhere to a code of \n     responsible business practices that would prevent such \n     obvious sales to gun traffickers. A West Virginia judge \n     recently ruled that the officers' suit against Will's and \n     Sturm, Ruger is well-grounded in West Virginia law and should \n     be heard by a jury. If passed into law, S. 659 would override \n     this decision and deprive these brave officers of their day \n     in court.\n       Police officers like Ken McGuire and David Lemongello put \n     their lives on the line every day to protect the public. \n     Instead of honoring them for their service, S. 659 would \n     deprive them of their basic rights as American citizens to \n     prove their case in a court of law. We stand with officers \n     McGuire and Lemongello in urging you to oppose this bill.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP,\n\n                                    Armonk, NY, February 17, 2004.\n     Re opinion letter concerning proposed immunity legislation \n         for gun dealers and manufacturers.\n\n     Michael Barnes,\n     President, The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Barnes: At your request, this letter addresses the \n     legal implications of the proposed gun dealer and \n     manufacturer immunity legislation, focusing specifically on \n     the impact of the legislation on the pending civil lawsuit \n     brought by the victims of the Washington, DC area sniper \n     attacks in the fall of 2002. For the reasons discussed below, \n     it is our judgment that the passage of S. 1805--the current \n     version of the immunity bill, which incorporates the so-\n     called ``Daschle Amendments''--would require the immediate \n     dismissal of the sniper victims' claims against the parties \n     who supplied the assault rifle used in the attacks. We \n     further conclude that the legislation would effect far-\n     reaching, and unprecedented, changes in the law that would \n     insulate the gun industry from other important pending cases \n     as well as future accountability.\n       After providing a brief background concerning the sniper \n     victims' civil suit and the proposed legislation, we analyze \n     the impact of the legislation on the pending sniper case. We \n     then offer some more general observations about the proposed \n     legislation, including a discussion of its implications for \n     other significant cases against gun dealers and \n     manufacturers.\n\n\n                               background\n\nI. The sniper victims' legal claims against the dealer and manufacturer \n                    who supplied the snipers' weapon\n\n       For over a month in the fall of 2002, John Allen Muhammad \n     and Lee Boyd Malvo terrorized the nation's capital and its \n     surrounding states through a series of sniper attacks on \n     innocent men, women, and children. From the trunk of \n     Muhammad's car, the snipers used a deadly-accurate assault \n     rifle to kill thirteen people, and to seriously injure \n     another six, in Washington, DC, Maryland, Virginia, Alabama, \n     Louisiana and Georgia. Among the snipers' victims were a 47-\n     year-old FBI analyst who was loading a car with her husband \n     in a Home Depot parking lot, a 72-year-old retired carpenter \n     who was waiting on a street corner, and a 13-year-old boy who \n     had just been dropped off at school. Muhammad and Malvo were \n     apprehended on October 24, 2002, and have since been \n     convicted for their crimes.\n       The weapon that Muhammad and Malvo used in the sniper \n     attacks was a Bushmaster\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\n     XM-15 E2S .223 semi-automatic rifle equipped with a bipod and \n     telescopic sight. The snipers obtained the ``one shot, one \n     kill'' assault weapon they used in the shootings from Bull's \n     Eye Shooter Supply in Tacoma, Washington, even though the law \n     prohibited either of them from purchasing any firearm. \n     Muhammad was under a domestic violence protective order, and \n     Malvo was both a juvenile and an illegal alien. Bull's Eye \n     representatives claim not to have any record of sale for the \n     weapon and cannot account for how the snipers obtained the \n     assault rifle.\n       The publicly-available evidence reveals that in addition to \n     permitting the snipers' weapon to disappear from its shop, \n     Bull's Eye Shooter Supply engaged in numerous irresponsible \n     business practices:\n       Large Number of Missing Guns. Bull's Eye could not account \n     for a total of 238 guns that were missing from its inventory \n     when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \n     (``AFT'') inspected the gun dealer in 2000 and 2002. Bull's \n     Eye's missing gun rate was greater than at least 99.73% of \n     all federal firearms licensees; 80% of dealers who sell at \n     least 50 firearms per year can provide records to account for \n     every one of their gun sales.\n       Large Number of Crime Guns. Between 1997 and 2001, Bull's \n     Eye guns were involved in at least 52 crimes, including \n     homicides, kidnappings, and assaults, placing Bull's Eye in \n     the top 1% of all dealers nationwide in the supply of guns \n     used in crimes. That same 1% of gun stores supplies the \n     weapons traced to 57% of all gun crimes.\n       Quick Time-to-Crime. The ``time-to-crime'' was less than 3 \n     years for more than 70% of Bull's Eye guns that were used in \n     crimes between 1997 and 2001. Quick time-to-crime is \n     considered a ``red flag'' for problem gun dealers because it \n     indicates that such dealers' guns are quickly getting into \n     criminal hands through illegal trafficking. In 2000, the \n     nationwide median time-to-crime was 6\\1/2\\ years, and the \n     time-to-crime was under 3 years for only 31% of traced crime \n     guns. The time-to-crime for the snipers' weapon--which was \n     received by Bull's Eye in July 2002--was under 3 months.\n       Large Number of Multiple Firearm Sales. Between 1997 and \n     2000, Bull's Eye sold 663 guns to 265 individual buyers, as \n     many as 10 guns at a time. Such ``multiple firearms sales'' \n     are considered to be another indicator that a gun dealer may \n     be selling to gun traffickers.\n       Numerous ATF Citations. ATF cited Bull's Eye for violations \n     at least 15 times between 1997 and 2001, and, following the \n     sniper attacks, revoked the license of Bull's Eye's former \n     owner.\n       Following ATF's revocation of his license, Bull's Eye's \n     former owner transferred ownership of the store to a close \n     friend. Bull's Eye continues to operate today, and the \n     store's former owner retains ownership of the property and \n     operates a shooting range in the same building.\n       The manufacturer of the snipers' murder weapon of choice, \n     Bushmaster Firearms, Inc. of Maine, not only modeled its XM-\n     15 rifle after military-style assault weapons that Congress \n     outlawed with the Assault Weapons Ban in 1994, but also \n     marketed the rifle as an assault weapon designed for sniper \n     activity. At the time, Bushmaster selected and used Bull's \n     Eye as one of its sixty distributors nationwide despite \n     numerous ``warning signs'' concerning Bull's Eye's handling \n     of its firearms inventory. Bushmaster also allegedly failed \n     to take certain basic precautions concerning the guns it \n     shipped to Bull's Eye and others, including, among other \n     things, declining the Justice Department's offer to assist \n     Bushmaster in tracing guns that had been used in crimes in \n     order to determine which of its dealers were supplying such \n     guns; neglecting to require Bull's Eye to adopt any of ATF's \n     suggested measures for preventing gun thefts; and failing to \n     require Bull's Eye to notify it of gun trace requests \n     initiated by law enforcement agencies or to certify its \n     compliance with firearms laws and regulations. Even after the \n     sniper attacks, Bushmaster, through its vice president of \n     administration, referred to Bull's Eye as ``a good customer'' \n     to whom Bushmaster would continue to sell guns.\n       Victims of the sniper attacks and the families of victims \n     who were killed have filed a civil lawsuit in Washington \n     State Court against Bull's Eye Shooter Supply and Bushmaster \n     Firearms for their roles in permitting the snipers to access \n     their murder weapon. According to the complaint: ``In \n     addition to the intentional acts of Muhammad and Malvo, the \n     gross negligence of the gun industry defendants caused the \n     injuries and deaths that resulted from the sniper shootings \n     by enabling prohibited purchasers Muhammad and Malvo to \n     obtain the Bushmaster assault rifle to wreak havoc on \n     innocent persons.'' Specifically with respect to Bull's Eye, \n     the plaintiffs claim that the gun dealer's grossly \n     irresponsible business practices routinely permitted guns, \n     including the snipers' weapon, to disappear from its store. \n     They further claim that ``Bushmaster deliberately continued \n     to utilize Bull's Eye as a Bushmaster gun dealer and supplied \n     it with as many guns as Bull's Eye wanted, despite years of \n     audits by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \n     Explosives showing that Bull's Eye had scores of \n     missing guns.'' At the heart of plaintiffs' Complaint is \n     their allegation that if Bull's Eye and Bushmaster had \n     ``acted responsibly in the sale of their guns, Muhammad \n     and Malvo would not have been able to obtain the assault \n     rifle they needed to carry out the shootings.''\n       On June 27, 2003, Washington Superior Court Judge Frank E. \n     Cuthbertson upheld the sniper victims' claims against the \n     defendants' motion to dismiss, concluding that the \n     plaintiffs' negligence and public nuisance claims were \n     actionable against both Bull's Eye and Bushmaster. Johnson v. \n     Bulls Eye Shooter Supply,  No. 03-2-03932-8, 2003 WL 21639244 \n     (Wash. Super. Ct. June 27, 2003). The court found that the \n     plaintiffs' claims against Bull's Eye could stand based on \n     ``a common law duty in Washington to use reasonable care in \n     the sale and distribution of firearms''; that the ``facts in \n     the present case indicate that a high degree of risk of harm \n     to plaintiffs was created by Bull's Eye Shooter Supply's \n     allegedly reckless or incompetent conduct in distributing \n     firearms''; and that the facts alleged ``demonstrate an \n     arguably unbroken nexus between the loss of the assault rifle \n     and the injuries of the plaintiffs.'' The Court further \n     concluded that the plaintiffs' claims against Bushmaster \n     should be permitted to reach a jury based on Bushmaster's \n     entrusting firearms to Bull's Eye even though Bushmaster \n     allegedly ``knew or should have known that Bull's Eye Shooter \n     Supply was operating its store in a reckless or incompetent \n     manner, creating an unreasonable risk of harm.'' Trial in the \n     case against Bull's Eye and Bushmaster has been set for \n     November 2004.\n\nII. The proposed immunity legislation for gun dealers and manufacturers\n\n       On April 9, 2003, the House of Representatives passed a \n     bill (H.R. 1036) to provide sweeping immunity from pending \n     and future lawsuits to distributors, dealers, manufacturers, \n     and importers of firearms and ammunition. Senator Larry Craig \n     (R-ID) introduced companion legislation in the Senate (S. \n     659), which, last October, was modified to incorporate \n     certain amendments that had been proposed by Minority Leader \n     Tom Daschle (D-SD). The current version of the immunity bill \n     (S. 1805), which incorporates the so-called ``Daschle \n     Amendments,'' is expected to be considered by the Senate in \n     the first week of March 2004.\n       According to its terms, S. 1805 would foreclose--and \n     require the immediate dismissal of--any state or federal \n     ``qualified civil liability action,'' Sec. 3(a), which the \n     statute defines to include any ``civil action brought by any \n     person against any manufacturer or seller'' of firearms or \n     ammunition ``for damages resulting from the criminal or \n     unlawful misuse'' of such products. Sec. 4(5)(A). From this \n     blanket prohibition on such civil actions, section 4(5)(A) of \n     the proposed bill carves out the following exclusive list of \n     circumscribed exceptions:\n       (i) actions against a manufacturer or seller who has been \n     criminally convicted of transferring a firearm with the \n     knowledge that it would be used to commit a violent or drug-\n     trafficking crime, if the plaintiff was directly harmed by \n     the conduct of which the recipient of the firearm has also \n     been criminally convicted;\n       (ii) actions against a seller for ``negligent entrustment'' \n     or ``negligence per se'';\n       (iii) actions against a manufacturer or seller who violated \n     a statute in the sale or marketing of a firearm or \n     ammunition, where that statutory violation was a proximate \n     cause of the plaintiff's injuries;\n       (iv) actions for breach of contract or warranty in \n     connection with the purchase of a firearm or ammunition; and\n       (v) actions for physical injuries or property damages \n     resulting directly from a design or manufacturing defect in a \n     firearm or ammunition, when such items have been used as \n     intended or in a ``reasonably foreseeable'' manner (as that \n     term is defined in the bill).\n       Because S. 1805 expressly disclaims any intention to create \n     causes of actions or remedies, see Sec. 4(5)(D), the above-\n     described exceptions would only preserve civil claims brought \n     under otherwise applicable state or federal law. Other than \n     as specifically preserved by these exceptions, however, the \n     proposed legislation would preempt, as a matter of federal \n     law, any state or federal lawsuits against irresponsible \n     sellers or manufacturers of firearms or ammunition.\n\n\n                                analysis\n\nI. The proposed immunity legislation would likely require the immediate \n                dismissal of the sniper victims' claims\n\n       Close examination of the exceptions enumerated in section 4 \n     of the proposed immunity legislation reveals that none would \n     appear to preserve the claims brought by the victims of the \n     sniper attacks and their families against the parties \n     responsible for permitting the snipers to obtain their murder \n     weapon. In fact, the passage of S. 1805 would likely compel \n     the judge in the sniper case immediately to dismiss those \n     claims. The following analysis focuses on paragraphs \n     (5)(A)(ii) and (5)(A)(iii) of the proposed legislation \n     because those provisions contain the only exceptions that \n     could even conceivably apply to the sniper case.\n\n A. The Statutory Violation Exception Embodied in Paragraph (5)(A)(ii) \n                Will Not Save the Sniper Victims' Claims\n\n       Section 4, paragraph (5)(A)(ii) of the proposed legislation \n     preserves an ``action in which a manufacturer or seller of a \n     qualified product violated a State or Federal statute \n     applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the \n     violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief \n     is sought. . . .'' According to well-settled tort law \n     principles, proximate cause requires that a defendant's \n     conduct was ``a substantial factor\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\n     in bringing about the harm'' suffered by the plaintiff. See \n     Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 431 (2003); accord \n     Derdiarian v. Felix Contracting Corp., 414 N.E.2d 666, (N.Y. \n     1980); Anderson v. Duncan, 968 P.2d 440, 442 (Wyo. 1998). \n     Where a defendant's statutory violation was not a requirement \n     to reject claims based on that violation. See, e.g., Fox v. \n     Bartholf, 374 So. 2d 294, 296 (Ala. 1979) (affirming summary \n     judgment for defendants where there was no evidence that \n     truck driver's alleged violation of statute, which prescribed \n     lawful speed in approaching highway intersections when \n     driver's view is obstructed, proximately caused plaintiff's \n     injury); Yates v. Shackelford, 784 N.E.2d 330, 336-37 (Ill. \n     App. Ct. 2002) (affirming summary judgment for defendants \n     where defendant driver's violation of left-shoulder parking \n     ban did not proximately cause collision); Travelers Indem. \n     Co. of Ill. v. 28 East 70th St. Constr. Co., No. 01 Civ. 3001 \n     (JGK), 2003 WL 23018604 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2003) (granting \n     defendant's motion for summary judgment where alleged failure \n     to stamp pipe with manufacturer's identification number in \n     violation of building code ``clearly did not proximately \n     cause the pipe to freeze and burst'').\n       The plain language of paragraph (5)(A)(ii) would appear to \n     dictate the same result in the sniper case. Despite the \n     above-discussed evidence of Bull's Eye numerous failings as a \n     gun dealer, there is no reason to believe that the plaintiffs \n     in the sniper case will be able to show that Bull's Eye \n     violated any state or federal statute with respect to the \n     particular gun that was used by the snipers or that any such \n     statutory violation was a proximate cause of the sniper \n     attacks. The evidence concerning the acquisition of the \n     snipers' weapon supports Bull's Eye's claim that Lee Boyd \n     Malvo shoplifted the gun. Indeed, after this arrest, Malvo \n     admitted that he shoplifted the weapon from Bull's Eye in the \n     summer of 2002. Although the plaintiffs claim that Bull's \n     Eye's lax security practices permitted Malvo to acquire the \n     weapon, such proof would not establish a violation of any \n     state of federal statute.\n       Of course, the plaintiffs in the sniper case could attempt \n     to shoehorn Bull's Eye's failure to report the theft of the \n     snipers' weapon into the illustration provided in \n     subparagraph (A)(iii)(I), which covers ``any case in which \n     the manufacturer or seller knowingly made any false entry in, \n     or failed to make appropriate entry in, any record required \n     to be kept under Federal or State law.'' Federal law requires \n     licensed gun dealers to report the loss or theft of a firearm \n     ``within 48 hours after the theft or loss is discovered.'' 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 923(g)(6). The difficulty with this argument, \n     however, is that Bull's Eye has denied that it knew the gun \n     was missing until the sniper suspects were apprehended and \n     authorities had traced the gun to the shop, and there is no \n     known evidence to refute that claim. (Bull's Eye in fact \n     reported the missing gun to authorities on November 5, 2002.) \n     Given Bull's Eye's claim, and the fact that the sniper \n     shootings were over by the time Bull's Eye's federal \n     reporting requirement would have been triggered by its \n     discovery that the weapon was missing, it appears unlikely \n     that the plaintiffs will be able to avoid dismissal based on \n     subparagraph (A)(iii)(I).\n\n B. The Negligent Entrustment/Negligence Per Se Exceptions Embodied in \n     Paragraph (5)(A)(ii) Will Not Save the Sniper Victims' Claims\n\n       Nor is it likely that the exceptions embodied in paragraph \n     (5)(A)(ii) of section 4--which covers actions ``brought \n     against a seller for negligent entrustment or negligence per \n     se''--would save the plaintiffs' civil claims against Bull's \n     Eye and Bushmaster in the sniper case. As an initial matter, \n     because the subparagraph (A)(ii) exceptions are specifically \n     limited to a ``seller'' and, as defined in paragraph (6), \n     seller does not include firearm manufacturers, the exceptions \n     would not even apply to the claims against Bushmaster. \n     Moreover, as explained below, the plaintiffs' claims against \n     Bull's Eye would not appear to fall within the narrow \n     ``negligent entrustment'' and ``negligence per se'' \n     exceptions of S. 1805.\n\n                        1. Negligent entrustment\n\n       For purposes of applying paragraph (5)(A)(ii), the proposed \n     legislation provides the following definitions of ``negligent \n     entrustment'': ``the supplying of a qualified product by a \n     seller for use by another person when the seller knows, or \n     should know, the person to whom the product is supplied is \n     likely to, and does, use the product in a manner involving \n     unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or \n     others.'' Sec. 4(5)(B). In light of the evidence that Malvo \n     shoplifted the snipers' weapon from Bull's Eye, the \n     plaintiffs in the sniper case will face significant obstacles \n     qualifying for that statutory exception.\n       Courts have repeatedly rejected negligent entrustment \n     claims absent evidence that the defendant acted affirmatively \n     in entrusting--or, in the words of paragraph (5)(A)(ii), \n     ``supplying''--the dangerous instrumentality in question. See \n     Butler v. Warren, 582 S.E.2d 530, 532-33 (Ga. Ct. App. 2003) \n     (affirming summary judgment against plaintiff's negligent \n     entrustment claim where evidence did not permit finding that \n     defendants had allowed their truck to be driven off their \n     property); Mackey v. Dorsey, 655 A.2d 1333, 1338 (Md. Ct. \n     Spec. App. 1995) (affirming trial court's finding that \n     defendant was ``not liable for negligent entrustment''; ``We \n     find it axiomatic that when a vehicle is stolen, as it was \n     here, the owner cannot be said to have supplied, entrusted, \n     or `made available' his or her vehicle. The `making \n     available' of the chattel requires that the supplier do so \n     knowingly or with the intent to supply the chattel to that \n     person.''); Kingrey v. Hill, 425 S.E.2d 798, 799 (Va. 1993) \n     (reversing trial court and entering judgment for defendant on \n     plaintiff's negligent entrustment claim, which was based on \n     defendant's failure to prevent access to rifle; court \n     analogized to car cases, in which finding of ``entrustment'' \n     requires ``evidence of express permission, evidence of a \n     pattern of conduct supporting implied permission, or evidence \n     of knowledge that an automobile would be used notwithstanding \n     explicit instructions to the contrary''); Todd v. Dow, 19 \n     Cal. App. 4th 253, 260-61, 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d 490, 494-95 (Cal. \n     Ct. App. 1993) (affirming summary judgment for parents in \n     negligent entrustment claim arising from their storage of \n     adult child's rifle in their house; ``Liability for negligent \n     entrustment arises from the act of entrustment . . . . \n     Parents did not sell, loan, furnish, or supply the rifle.''); \n     ``Commercial Carrier Corp. v. S.J.G. Corp., 409 So. 2d 50, 52 \n     (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981) (affirming dismissal of negligent \n     entrustment claim for injuries sustained in car accident \n     after defendant left keys in unattended car and car was \n     stolen; absent proof of knowledge and consent of car owner, \n     liability for negligent entrustment will not lie); Cutler v. \n     Travelers Ins. Co., 412 A.2d 284, 285 (Vt. 1980) (affirming \n     dismissal of plaintiffs' claims arising out of collision, \n     which resulted from car theft; fact that defendant left keys \n     in car ignition or truck lock could not establish entrustment \n     of car, by express or implied consent, to car thief); Reicher \n     v. Melzer, 158 N.E.2d 191, 193 (Ohio 1959) (affirming \n     directed verdict for defendant on plaintiff's negligent \n     entrustment claim where record showed that employee involved \n     in accident ``was operating the truck solely for his own \n     convenience in going from his place of employment, at the end \n     of his day's work, to his home on a rainy day; and that he \n     had taken the truck without anyone's permission or direction \n     and without defendant's knowledge'').\n       Although courts throughout the country have recognized \n     separate claims for the negligent storage or security of \n     firearms, see, e.g., Heck v. Stoffer, 786 N.E.2d 265, 268-70 \n     (Ind. 2003); Gallara v. Koskovich, 836 A.2d 840, 851 (N.J. \n     Super. Ct. Law Div. 2003); Long v. Turk, 962 P.2d 1093, 1097 \n     (Kan. 1998); Pavlides v. Niles Gun Show, Inc., 637 N.E.2d \n     404, 408-10 (Ohio Ct. App. 1994); Kimbler v. Stillwell, 734 \n     P.2d 1344, 1346-48 (Or. 1987) (en bank); Cathey v. Bernard, \n     467 So. 2d 9, 11 (La. Ct. App. 1985), such claims would be \n     foreclosed by the proposed immunity legislation.\n       Furthermore, the narrow definition of ``negligent \n     entrustment'' in the proposed statute would likely prevent \n     the plaintiffs from relying on that exception for yet another \n     reason. The evidence that the snipers' weapon was shoplifted \n     from Bull's Eye would appear to preclude the plaintiffs from \n     making the requisite showing under the statute that the gun \n     shop knew or should have known that the recipient of the gun \n     (i.e., Malvo) was likely to use the product in a criminal or \n     otherwise unreasonably dangerous manner.\n\n                          2. Negligence per se\n\n       The proposed immunity bill does not define ``negligence per \n     se,'' but to the extent that the negligent per se exception \n     in paragraph (5)(A)(ii) would permit the survival of state \n     causes of action, it will not assist the plaintiffs in the \n     sniper case: the negligence per se doctrine has been \n     abrogated by statute in Washington State. See RCWA 5.40.050; \n     Morse v. Antonellis, 70 P.3d 125, 126 (Wash. 2003); see also \n     Pettit v. Dwoskin, 68 P.3d 1088, 1091-92 (Wash. Ct. App. \n     2003) (``But the doctrine of negligence per se is no longer \n     viable in Washington. Rather, violation of a legal \n     requirement is evidence of negligence.'').\n       In any event, the negligence per se exception would not \n     preserve the sniper case because even where that doctrine is \n     recognized, it requires a violation of a statute or \n     regulation that is the proximate cause of the plaintiff's \n     injury. See 57A. Am. Jur. 2d Negligence Sec. 728 (2003); \n     O'Guin v. Bingham County, 72 P.3d 849, 856 (Idaho 2003); \n     Elder v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Co., 479 So. 2d 1243, 1248 \n     (Ala. 1985). As discussed above, however, it is doubtful that \n     the plaintiffs in the sniper case will be able to establish \n     that any such violation was a substantial factor in causing \n     their injuries.\n\nII. The proposed immunity legislation would overturn well-settled legal \n          principles and jeopardize other important gun cases\n\n       The proposed immunity legislation would have far-reaching \n     implications beyond its likely direct and immediate effect on \n     the pending civil case brought by the snipers' victims. The \n     statute would accord gun dealers and manufacturers an \n     unprecedented immunity. Indeed, under the statute, dealers \n     and manufacturers of lethal weapons would receive insulation \n     from lawsuits to which the sellers and makers of virtually \n     every other product (including even toy guns) would be \n     subject. As discussed herein, the legislation would close \n     courtroom doors nationwide to any claims arising out of, \n     among other things, the negligent security or storage \n     practices of any gun dealer or manufacturer, the negligent \n     sale of guns by and dealer to so-called ``straw purchasers'' \n     for illegal gun traffickers, and the negligent failure of any \n     gun manufacturer to include basic safety devices that would \n     have prevented tortious or criminal shootings.\n       The implications of the sweeping immunity proposed for the \n     gun industry are further compounded by the fact that the \n     industry is already largely exempt from federal\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\n     regulations that apply to the manufacture and distribution of \n     other products. Guns were specifically exempted from the \n     jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which \n     Congress created in 1972 to protect the public from consumer \n     product injuries. Even ATF--which licenses and oversees gun \n     dealers--lacks any authority to establish manufacturing or \n     distribution standards for firearms.\n       Focusing exclusively on criminal and other statutory \n     prohibitions, supporters of the proposed immunity legislation \n     have argued that the bill would simply eliminate lawsuits \n     against gun dealers and manufacturers who ``have not broken \n     the law.'' But this oversimplified view ignores the pivotal \n     role that state and federal common law plays in promoting \n     public safety and accountability, in addition to ensuring \n     compensation for the victims of dangerous and irresponsible \n     conduct. Beyond criminal and other statutory proscriptions on \n     such conduct, civil common law has long protected the public \n     by holding businesses and individuals alike to a standard of \n     reasonable care in all their activities. The broad insulation \n     from suit promised by the immunity legislation would largely \n     free the makers and sellers of deadly weapons from such \n     generally applicable common law standards.\n       Nor does the fact that gun injuries often result from \n     criminal acts provide a legal justification for the immunity \n     legislation. It has long been a settled principle of tort law \n     that an intervening act of a third party, even if criminal \n     (e.g., a sniper shooting), will not break the causal chain \n     from a party's negligence (e.g., the negligent distribution \n     of the murder weapon) to a plaintiff's injury so long as the \n     intervening act was reasonably foreseeable. See, e.g., Largo \n     Corp. v. Crespin, 727 P.2d 1098, 1103 (Colo. 1986) (en banc); \n     Vining v. Avis Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc., 354 So.2d 54, 55-56 \n     (Fla. 1977); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 302B \n     (2003) (``An act or an omission may be negligent if the actor \n     realizes or should realize that it involves an unreasonable \n     risk of harm to another through the conduct of the other or a \n     third person which is intended to cause harm, even though \n     such conduct is criminal.''). As Judge Cuthbertson correctly \n     recognized in the sniper case, where a defendant handles a \n     lethal weapon in an irresponsible manner, through which \n     criminals and other prohibited persons may access it and \n     use it to commit dangerous crimes, the question of whether \n     there is an adequate causal link between the tortfeasor's \n     conduct and the resulting injuries is for a jury to \n     decide. Johnson, 2003 WL 21639244, at *3-4.\n       In addition to the sniper case, the proposed immunity would \n     likely require the dismissal of several other important cases \n     that seek to hold allegedly reckless gun dealers and \n     manufacturers responsible for their conduct, including:\n       Hernandez ex rel. Guzman v. Kahr Arms, Civ. Act. No. \n     WOCV2002-01747 (Mass Super. Ct. 2003). Danny Guzman was shot \n     and killed with a nine millimeter handgun, one of several \n     guns that had been stolen and resold by employees of the Kahr \n     Arms factory. According to the lawsuit filed by the \n     decedent's family, defendant Kahr Arms employed a number of \n     convicted criminals and drug addicts because it did not \n     conduct general or criminal background checks on its \n     employees and did not test prospective or existing employees \n     for drugs. To make matters worse, the plaintiffs allege that \n     Kahr Arms did nothing to prevent employees from leaving its \n     plant with guns--which Kahr touted as ``the smallest, \n     flattest, most reliable full power compact handguns made''--\n     even before they had been stamped with serial numbers, \n     rendering them virtually untraceable. Among the plaintiffs' \n     other claims, Kahr Arms had no metal detectors, x-ray \n     machines, security cameras, or security guards; did not check \n     employees at the end of their shifts; did not use any \n     inventory-tracking system to determine when weapons or parts \n     were missing; and could not account for approximately 16 \n     outgoing shipments of weapons that never arrived at their \n     intended destinations between February 1998 and February \n     1999. On April 7, 2003, the Massachusetts Superior Court \n     upheld the plaintiffs' negligence and public nuisance claims \n     against Kahr Arms' motion to dismiss. The Guzman's family's \n     right to sue Kahr Arms would be immediately revoked if the \n     proposed immunity legislation were to pass. As in the sniper \n     case, the claims against Kahr Arms involve irresponsible \n     security for deadly weapons, claims that would be foreclosed \n     by the proposed immunity legislation. First, the plaintiffs' \n     claims of negligent security against Kahr Arms do not involve \n     any statutory violation. Moreover, the negligent entrustment \n     exception would not apply to Kahr Arms for the dual reasons \n     that it is a firearm manufacturer and that it did not entrust \n     any weapon to Danny Guzman's shooter.\n       Lemongello v. Will Company, No. Civ.A. 02-C-2952, 2003 WL \n     21488208 (W. Va. Cir. Ct. Mar. 19, 2003). New Jersey Policy \n     Detective David Lemongello and Officer Kenneth McGuire were \n     seriously injured in January 2001 when they were shot by a \n     career criminal while performing undercover police work. Even \n     though the shooter was a person prohibited by law from \n     purchasing a firearm, he obtained his weapon, a nine \n     millimeter semi-automatic Ruger handgun, illegally from a gun \n     trafficker. The trafficker, in turn, was also prohibited from \n     buying weapons due to a prior felony, so he used an \n     accomplice (a so-called ``straw purchaser'') to make multiple \n     gun purchases from defendant Will Jewelry & Loan, in West \n     Virginia. In their lawsuit against Will Jewelry & Loan and \n     others, the officers allege that the gun dealer acted \n     negligently in selling the straw purchaser twelve guns \n     (including the Ruger used in the shooting of the \n     two officers) that had been selected in person by the gun \n     trafficker and paid for in a single cash transaction. The \n     circumstances of that sale were so suspect that the \n     defendant dealer reported it to the ATF--but only after \n     the purchase price had been collected and the guns had \n     left the store. The officers' suit further charges gun \n     manufacturer Sturm Ruger & Company with negligently \n     failing to monitor and train its distributors and dealers \n     and negligently failing to prevent them from engaging in \n     straw and multiple firearm sales. Although a West Virginia \n     trial court has held that the plaintiffs have stated valid \n     negligence and public nuisance claims under state law, the \n     proposed immunity legislation would require the immediate \n     dismissal of those claims. Notwithstanding the plaintiffs' \n     claims that the defendants failed to exercise reasonable \n     care in their sales of firearms, neither the dealer nor \n     the manufacturer violated any statutory prohibition in \n     selling the guns. Nor could the plaintiffs contend that \n     their case falls within the ``negligent entrustment'' \n     exception to the proposed immunity legislation because the \n     gun dealer supplied the firearm to a straw purchaser--not \n     to someone whom the seller knew or should have known was \n     likely to, and did, use the product in a manner involving \n     unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or \n     others.\n       Smith v. Bryco Arms, 33 P.3d 638 (N.M. Ct. App.), cert. \n     denied, 34 P.3d 610 (N.M. 2001). Fourteen-year-old Sean Smith \n     was seriously injured when a friend accidentally shot him in \n     the mouth with a .22 caliber handgun, the Bryco J-22. The \n     shooter believed the gun was unloaded because the ammunition \n     magazine had been removed; the gun failed to reveal the \n     hidden bullet in its chamber. Sean Smith's parents sued the \n     manufacturer (Bryco Arms) and the distributor (Jennings \n     Firearms) of the J-22 alleging negligence and products \n     liability claims based on the defendants' failure to \n     incorporate any of the various available safety features that \n     would have prevented the accidental shooting, including an \n     internal ``magazine-out safety'' lock, a ``chamber load \n     indicators,'' or a written warning on the gun alerting users \n     that the J-22 could fire even with its magazine removed. \n     Reversing a lower court decision, the New Mexico Court of \n     Appeals has held that the defendants could be held liable for \n     their failure to incorporate long-known, available, and \n     economically feasible safety devices in the J-22. The \n     proposed immunity legislation, however, would require the \n     immediate dismissal of these claims because the shooting of \n     Sean Smith, even if accidental, constituted an ``unlawful \n     misuse'' of the J-22, thereby removing the case from the \n     statutory exception ostensibly intended for cases involving \n     gun design or manufacturing defects. See Sec. Sec. 4(5)(A)(v) \n     (preserving ``an action for physical injuries or property \n     damage resulting directly from a defect in design or \n     manufacture of the product, when used as intended or in a \n     manner that is reasonably foreseeable'') & 4(5)(C) (defining \n     '`reasonably foreseeable'' for purposes of paragraph 5(A)(v) \n     to exclude ``any criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified \n     product, other than possessory offenses''). Indeed, given the \n     fact that virtually any shooting of a person would constitute \n     a ``criminal or unlawful misuse'' of a firearm, the immunity \n     legislation would effectively eliminate most claims arising \n     out of the defective design or manufacture of a firearm.\n       By preventing these cases, and future cases like them, from \n     proceeding against irresponsible gun dealers and \n     manufacturers, the proposed immunity legislation would \n     undermine the incentives that encourage reasonable business \n     practices in the gun industry, thereby inevitably failing to \n     deter avoidable gun injuries and fatalities.\n       In sum, the proposed legislation would insulate gun dealers \n     and manufacturers from the obligations to act reasonably and \n     in good faith that every other business has. If the \n     legislation were to pass, sellers of products that are among \n     the most dangerous products would have the least obligation \n     to act reasonably.\n       For all of the above reasons, it is our judgment that the \n     passage of S. 1805 would require the immediate dismissal of \n     the pending civil case against the gun dealer and \n     manufacturer who supplied the snipers' murder weapon as well \n     as other significant cases against gun dealers and \n     manufacturers. Furthermore, by providing the gun industry \n     with unprecedented immunity from common law claims directed \n     at those who engage in irresponsible and dangerous business \n     practices, the proposed legislation would further insulate \n     the sellers and manufacturers of deadly weapons from public \n     accountability for such conduct.\n           Sincerely,\n\n     David Boies.\n     Sean Eskovitz.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise today in support of S. 1805, the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act. This critically important bipartisan \nlegislation will block baseless lawsuits initiated by individuals who \nwish to drive out of business a lawful and legitimate business, the \nAmerican firearms industry.\n  This bill will halt lawsuits that are nothing more than shameless \nattempts\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\nto advance a stalled anti-gun legislative agenda and a flagrant abuse \nof the judicial system. I commend my colleague, Senator Larry Craig, \nand other cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, over 50 of them, for \ntheir hard work to get this bill to the Senate floor.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I have long been a proponent of \nlegislation that addresses the growing problem of lawsuit abuse. The \nissues addressed by this legislation will remedy one such class of \nshameless and abusive lawsuits. I am hopeful this will be the first of \nmany other reform measures that the Senate will take up before the end \nof the 108th Congress. This includes asbestos reform that would save \nthis country, save jobs, provide jobs, for hundreds of thousands of \npeople; bankruptcy, which also would save jobs that our friends on the \nother side seem to be stopping; and class action reform, which in the \nend would save jobs.\n  As I mentioned, this legislation has broad bipartisan support, \nincluding from the minority leader. I agreed with my colleague, Senator \nDaschle, when he quite accurately stated:\n\n       It is wrong, and it is a misuse of the civil justice \n     system, to try to punish honest, law-abiding people for \n     illegal acts committed by others without their knowledge or \n     involvement. That's not the way we do things in America. We \n     do not hold innocent people responsible for acts they are not \n     involved in and over which they have no control.\n\n  I commend Senator Daschle. He could not have said it better. I call \nthese lawsuits shameless because the trial lawyers who bring them--and \nthey are really personal injury lawyers, by and large, who bring them--\ndislike and attack a product that is produced and marketed legally. \nWhat is going on is simply outrageous. It is as absurd as suing a car \nmanufacturer for drunken driving accidents or suing a fast food company \nbecause a hamburger has more calories than it should. We must put a \nstop to these senseless lawsuits before our legal system grinds to a \nhalt.\n  The need for legislation of this type is imperative. This legislation \nwill prohibit civil liability actions against the firearms industry for \ndamages resulting from the misuse of its products by others; that is, \nmeritless lawsuits based on lawful products that are intentionally \nmisused are prohibited by this bill. Now, anybody who thinks ought to \nagree with that.\n  In product liability cases, plaintiffs traditionally have been able \nto sue for compensation for injuries because, No. 1, a product was \ndefective; No. 2, the defect posed an unreasonable danger to the user; \nand No. 3, the defect caused the injury. A ``defective product'' is one \nthat does not operate as a reasonable manufacturer would design and \nmake it, as a reasonable consumer would expect, or as other products of \nits type.\n\n  Courts uniformly have held that a defect must exist in the product at \nthe time it was sold and that a plaintiff's injury must have been the \nresult of that defect. However, in the firearms context, gun \nmanufacturers and dealers are potentially liable for injuries that \noccur because their properly operating product is criminally or \nnegligently misused. Now, this is unacceptable.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to make clear that this \nlegislation does not relieve from liability gunmakers who create \ndefective products or gun dealers who negligently sell weapons when \nthey know or should have known that such a weapon would be used in a \ncrime.\n  Additionally, this legislation contains the following significant \nsafeguards: One, an action brought against a transferor convicted for \ntransferring a firearm knowing it would be used in a crime of violence \nor drug trafficking crime by a party directly harmed by the conduct of \nwhich the transferee is so convicted; No. 2, an action brought against \na seller for supplying a firearm or ammunition to another person when \none knows or should know that person is likely to and does use the \nproduct in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical injury to \nthe person and others for negligence per se; No. 3, an action in which \na manufacturer or seller violated a State or Federal statute applicable \nto the sale or marketing of the product and the violation was the \nproximate cause of the harm for which relief was sought; No. 4, an \naction for breach of contract or warranty in connection with the \npurchase of a product; or No. 5, an action for physical injuries or \nproperty damage resulting directly from a defect in design or \nmanufacture of the product when used as intended or in a manner that is \nreasonably foreseeable.\n  Now, because this bill strikes the right balance between protecting \nthe general public and those who manufacture a lawful product, I \nstrongly support the legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  We all know what is involved. We know the personal injury lawyers are \ngoing to sue just about anybody against whom they are able to conjure \nup a theory of liability, and hope that some of the irresponsible \njudges in this country will allow those cases to go to the jury. Then \non appeal, they hope irresponsible appellate lawyers and activist \njudges, will ignore the law, ignore every basic instinct of the law, \nand allow those lawsuits to go forward. And they hope their friends on \nthe Supreme Court will ignore the law as well and through activism do \nwhatever they believe is right, as many of the judges on the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals do every day. They ignore the law completely, \ndo whatever their gut tells them ought to be done, even though most of \nthe time their gut is filled with legalistic ulcers.\n  The fact is, that is not the way the law should run. That is not the \nway it should operate. Lawyers should be ashamed to bring these type of \ncases. In this particular bill, we protect the consuming public and \nothers from irresponsible misuse of firearms. We protect them from \nirresponsibility on the part of any gun manufacturer. That needs to be \nsaid, and it needs to be said over and over.\n  The fact is, what we have is a lot of very liberal thinkers who think \nthat guns should not be owned by anybody, or they should be owned only \nby a few--I guess those who have been to some sort of anti-gun college.\n  The fact is, most Americans own guns, most Americans value guns, most \nAmericans believe in protecting themselves and their families. Where we \nhave the most guns, that is where we have the lowest amount of crime.\n  Everybody knows I have brought a bill to the Senate to allow guns to \nbe kept in the home in the District of Columbia, which many refer to as \nMurder Capital USA. I don't want to bring that up as an amendment on \nthis. I might have to, if some of these irresponsible amendments filed \npass. We know the only way this bill is going to make it to the \nPresident's signature is if it doesn't have any other amendments on it. \nBut if any others pass, I think we ought to vote on that one as well. \nBecause, to be honest with you, I have had hundreds of DC residents \ncall me and say thank God somebody is acting in our interests, where we \ncan at least protect our homes.\n  That is how bad it is. We have people who just don't believe in guns, \ndon't believe in sportsmanship, don't believe in the right to collect \nguns, who are going to be against them for political reasons because \nthey think there are political advantages for them. Frankly, I think \nthey are going to find there are not any political advantages for them \nbecause most people in our country believe in the right to have their \nown arms. Most people hunt and fish. Most people are proud of the fact \nthey can take their young boys or girls out and have target practice \nand shoot guns.\n  The fact is, the vast majority, the highest percentile in the world, \nuse guns responsibly in this country. For those who do not, I am for \ncoming down very hard against them. For those who misuse guns in the \ncommission of crimes, you can't get any tougher on crimes than Orrin \nHatch is. Frankly, we passed legislation around here, anti-crime \nlegislation, Senator Biden and myself and others, that literally goes \nhard on those who use and misuse weapons and use them in criminal \nactivity. That is what we should be doing. But we certainly ought not \nto allow spurious, frivolous lawsuits brought against gun manufacturers \nwho have done nothing wrong other than make guns the American people \nwould like to own.\n  With that, I don't mean to demean anybody on the floor. All I can say \nis that for the life of me, I can't understand why anybody would be \nagainst this bill who understands the law and\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\nunderstands the way the law should be applied. Frankly, I am amazed \nthat some are. There were 22 who voted against cloture this morning. \nThat was unbelievable. The fact of the matter is, cloture should have \nbeen invoked 100 to zip, but that is how far this issue has denigrated, \nto the point where it is just a political issue in the eyes of some.\n  It is time to get rid of the politics and understand the American \npeople are not going to put up with that kind of stuff, and they should \nnot. The law should not be used in the frivolous fashion some of these \npersonal injury lawyers use it. There are a lot of great personal \ninjury lawyers out there and there are a lot of great trial lawyers who \ndo what is right and who would not think for a minute of bringing these \nfrivolous lawsuits against gun manufacturers who are not responsible \nfor the misuse of their weapons. When they are irresponsibly brought, \nthis bill takes care of them. It says you are going to pay for it.\n  But when they are not responsible for the misuse of their weapons, \nwhy in the world would we allow litigation to be brought, just because \nthe trial lawyers might support us? There is a certain point where any \ngood thinking person has to say: Look, the law is more important than \njust emotion. Unfortunately, most of the arguments used against this \nbill are emotional arguments that really have no place in the area of \nlaw. Frankly, they should not be paid very much attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nminority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the legislation we consider today \nattempts to strike a careful balance between the safety of Americans \nand the rights of gun manufacturers and dealers. As I have said on many \noccasions, the vast majority of gun owners, manufacturers, and sellers \nare honest and certainly obey the law. Moreover, the firearm industry \nis an important source of jobs and tax revenue for our country. It is \nwrong, and it is a misuse of the civil justice system, to punish \nhonest, law-abiding people for the illegal acts of others.\n  At the same time, Americans who are injured due to defective products \nhave a right to seek justice in the courts. In our efforts to protect \nthe gun industry from meritless lawsuits, we should take care not to \ninvalidate legitimate claims from being heard in court. There are \nseveral ongoing cases that involve product defects or cases where \nmanufacturers or gun dealers may actually have broken the law, and \nthose victims have a right to be heard.\n  As this bill was being written, many individuals raised concerns that \nthe bill failed to consider the many important claims of victims of \ndefective products or illegal actions. Because of these concerns, I \nhave worked with my colleagues, Senator Craig in particular, Senator \nBaucus, and others to draft a commonsense, bipartisan amendment that \nimproves this legislation by providing stronger protections for \nmeritorious cases. This amendment is not perfect, but it goes a long \nway toward balancing both the rights of victims and the needs of the \ngun industry.\n  Our amendment makes several important changes. First, the language in \nthe original bill forced plaintiffs to prove defendants knowingly and \nwillfully broke the law before a suit could proceed. This is a high \nstandard that would deny many victims the right to pursue legitimate \nclaims. The amendment we now offer removes this language, to ensure \ncases in which Federal or State firearms laws have been broken can move \nforward without meeting an artificially high threshold of proof.\n  Second, as originally drafted, the bill created a few exceptions, \nwhere gun manufacturers' and dealers' immunity would not apply. These \nexceptions were tailored too narrowly. In fact, one of the exceptions \ncould have invalidated cases in which an individual had sold a firearm \nto someone who committed a drug offense or violent crime simply because \nthe individual had not yet been convicted of that offense. This \namendment, our amendment, modifies this language to ensure these bad \nactors would not be protected from accountability merely because they \nwere not successfully prosecuted.\n  Third, when a gun is defective, the manufacturer should be held \nresponsible. However, as originally drafted, the bill limited product \nliability to such degree that it would be virtually impossible to bring \ncases against manufacturers. Our amendment provides greater protection \nfor product liability cases, so, in particular, if a child is injured \nby a defective gun, the victim's loved ones can hold those responsible \naccountable.\n  Fourth, the original legislation did not specifically address \nbusinesses that sell to the straw purchasers; that is, people who buy \nguns only to resell them in the black market to criminals or children. \nWith this amendment, the bill would include a provision to remove \nimmunity from those dealers who sell to so-called straw purchasers.\n  Fifth, the amendment Senator Craig and I will offer addresses \nconcerns about this bill's definition of trade associations. Many \nadvocates indicated that, as drafted, even extremist organizations \ncould have obtained immunity. Obviously, this is not the intent of the \nbill's sponsors, nor is it the intent of the gun industry. Therefore, \nwe modified the definition to ensure that only trade associations \nconnected to the business of manufacturing and selling firearms would \nbe covered.\n\n  The Protection of Law Commerce in Arms Act, as amended by the \nDaschle-Craig amendment, strikes a meaningful balance between the \nrights of legitimate business owners and the rights of individuals who \nhave been injured by gun violence. The Senate achieves the goal of \nprotecting manufacturers from illegitimate lawsuits, while maintaining \nthe rights of victims to hold those responsible for their injuries \naccountable.\n  With the inclusion of our amendment, immunity will not cover a number \nof cases including those where a dealer sells a gun to someone who is \nprohibited from owning a gun, whether not they have been convicted of a \ncrime; a dealer sells a gun to a juvenile or to an undocumented alien; \na manufacturer develops a defective gun that injuries a child; or where \na dealer fails to report the theft of a gun as required by law.\n  In each of these cases, a business loses its immunity only as a \nresult of its own actions, not the actions of a third party.\n  The cosponsors of this amendment have worked hard to ensure that the \ngun immunity bill does not inadvertently harm important cases.\n  The principle of equality before the law demands that everyone--\nindividuals and businesses alike--can be held accountable for their \nactions.\n  This legislation should not provide blanket immunity that protects \n``bad actors.'' By striking a more sensible balance, my amendment \nstrives to preserve the long-term vitality of an important American \nindustry, while protecting the rights and the safety of the American \npublic.\n  I hope my colleagues, when the legislation is offered later, will \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle, our minority \nleader, the Senator from South Dakota, for the cooperative way in which \nhe has worked with us to, in his own words, improve, narrow, clean up \nthis piece of legislation.\n  As I have already said on the floor today, a good number of times, \nthe Daschle amendment--the effort that S. 1805 seeks to accomplish--is \na very narrow way of protecting law-abiding, legitimate firearm \nmanufacturers and dealers, but not to stand in the way of access to the \ncourts as a result of somebody being harmed by somebody who has acted \nillegally as a licensed dealer or a firearms manufacturer.\n  I truly appreciate the Senator's efforts in behalf of this very small \ncommunity of folks in the industry of manufacturing quality firearms. \nIt is critical for our Nation, for law-abiding citizens, and for our \nnational security. The Senator has seen that and understood it, and we \nwill work now to hopefully get this bill before us soon this afternoon \nso amendments can be offered. I think the Senator has been\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\nready to do that. That will move us down the road toward hopefully \nfinal debate and a vote on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words of the \nSenator from Idaho. I also share his view that it is important we move \nto the bill so we can begin entertaining amendments. I think there are \na number of thoughtful amendments which deserve our consideration. The \nsooner we move to the bill, the sooner we can begin the amendment \nprocess. Some will pass and some will be defeated, but I think it is \ncritical we get on with that debate and offering amendments today. It \nis 4 o'clock. We have had a good debate about the motion to proceed, \nand certainly about the bill itself. It is my hope that not in the too \ndistant future--sometime perhaps within the hour--we might move to \nallow floor amendments. I would certainly be prepared to offer mine at \nthat time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the leadership of both sides of the aisle, \nat the moment, is working to try to see if we can gain a unanimous \nconsent request that would bring us to the bill hopefully within the \nhour and possibly deal with one or two amendments, and at least one \namendment voted up or down; and then the laying down of another \namendment at least this evening and starting debate on that.\n  So I thought for a few moments I would give a little background as to \nwhat has brought us to this point in time and S. 1805.\n  Senator Daschle was in the Chamber a few moments ago to visit with \nthe Senate about his amendments and what we effectively incorporated in \nthe bill. He has some fine-tuning he may offer as one of the first \namendments this evening.\n  But when Senator Baucus and I introduced S. 695 back in the spring, \nmore than half of the Senate--Republicans and Democrats--became \noriginal cosponsors. Today we have 55 cosponsors, including the \nleadership on both sides. A similar bill, H.R. 1036, was passed in the \nHouse of Representatives by a 2-to-1 margin over a year ago.\n  Now we have before us S. 1805, again, very similar to what we did in \n1995, but with some adjustments made with the Senator from South \nDakota. This is an extraordinary showing of support for a bill. I \nbelieve it is a testament to the gravity of the threat addressed by \nthis legislation: The abuse of our courts through lawsuits filed to \nforce law-abiding businesses to pay for criminal acts by individuals \nbeyond their control.\n  The businesses I am talking about are collectively known as the U.S. \nfirearms industry. The lawsuits I am talking about claim that even \nthough these businesses complied with all of the laws and sell a \nlegitimate product, they should be responsible for the misuse or the \nillegal use of the firearm they produce, misused by a criminal. These \nactions are pursued with the intent of driving this industry out of \nbusiness--regardless of the thousands of jobs that would be lost in the \nprocess and the impact on citizens across the Nation who would never \ncontemplate committing a crime with a gun.\n  Let's be very clear about this. These lawsuits are not brought by \nindividuals seeking relief for injuries done to them by anyone in the \nindustry. Instead, this is a politically inspired initiative trying to \nforce social goals through an end run around the Congress and the State \nlegislatures.\n  I believe that is worth repeating because it is the essence of the \nlegislation. Instead, I believe these lawsuits are politically inspired \ninitiatives trying to force social goals, or public policy, if you \nwill, through an end run around the Congress and the State \nlegislatures.\n  The theory on which these lawsuits are based would be laughable if it \nwere not so dangerous: To pin the responsibility for a criminal act on \nan innocent party who was not there and had nothing to do with the act. \nThey argue that merely by virtue of the fact that a gun was present, \nthose who were part of the commercial distribution chain should be held \nresponsible for the gun's misuse.\n  Earlier today, I talked about all kinds of chains in commerce--\nautomobiles, and other vehicles, and other tools that are used \ntragically enough sometimes or misused in a way that they take a human \nlife. What about a baseball bat? We hear, every so often, of a baseball \nbat used in the commission of a crime in which the baseball bat or the \nuse of it struck a person and killed them. Should we make a person who \nmanufactured that baseball bat liable or should we do that which we \nhave always done in this country: made the individual responsible for \nhis or her action?\n  This is not a legal theory. It is just the latest twist in the gun \ncontroller's notion that it is the gun, and not the criminal, that \ncauses the crime; it is the car, and not the drunk driver, that kills \nthe child it runs over.\n  The truth is, there are millions of firearms in this country today. \nYet only a very tiny fraction of them are ever used in the commission \nof a crime. The truth is, again and again law-abiding firearms owners \nare using their guns, often without ever firing a shot, to defend their \nlife or the lives of their family and their property. That is what the \nsecond amendment is all about. That is why this right is ingrained \nwithin the character and the culture of this country. The truth is, the \nintent of the user, not the gun, is what determines whether that gun \nwill be used in a crime. A gun can be nothing but a piece of metal \nuntil it is used carefully and wisely by an individual in defense of \nthemselves or in hunting by the expertise of the shooter, or it can \nbecome a very lethal weapon in the hands of a criminal in the taking of \na life.\n  The trend of abusive litigation targeting the firearms industry not \nonly defies common sense and concepts of fundamental fairness, but it \nwould do nothing to curb criminal gun violence.\n  Let me repeat that. Does it stop gun violence in this country? No, it \ndoes not. The only way you do that is to sweep our country clean of the \nmillions of firearms that are owned out there, and certainly take them \nout of the hands of criminals. But we know that is a near impossible \ntask, too. Furthermore, the trend jeopardizes America's \nconstitutionally protected access to firearms for defense and other \nlawful uses.\n  The bill that more than half of the Senate has already endorsed is a \nmeasured response that would put a stop to this abusive trend without \nendangering legitimate claims of relief. Let me emphasize that it does \nnot insulate the firearms industry from lawsuits or deprive legitimate \nvictims of their day in court, as some critics have already charged.\n  Nowhere in S. 1805 is there a padlock on the courthouse door. Quite \nthe opposite. If this becomes law, this is the law that will be argued \nin court by some as to why a given lawsuit ought to be thrown out. And \nwe trust the judge, wise and learned, will listen to all of those \narguments and make a decision as to whether the lawsuit goes forward \nbecause it is legitimate within the law or it is simply just that, \nfrivolous, it is not legitimate within the law, and it ought to be \ndenied or cast aside.\n  Again, let me emphasize, it does not insulate the firearms industry \nfrom all lawsuits or deprive legitimate victims of their day in court, \nas some critics would, in fact, argue, and has been already argued \nseveral times on the floor today. In fact, it specifically provides \nthat some actions can be brought against those in the business of \nmanufacturing and selling firearms when they violate the law or act \nwrongfully themselves.\n  Earlier today, I went through those five areas that we have clearly \nidentified in the law where action can be taken. Senator Daschle has \neven refined that a little more to make sure all is clear in this given \narea. Actions based on breaches of contract, defects in firearms, \nnegligent entrustment, criminal behavior--these actions would not be \naffected by this legislation. The laws there are already clear. People \nare\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\nbeing tried today in the courts based on those laws, and S. 1805 in no \nway would wipe them aside or cause a different action.\n  S. 1805 is solely directed at stopping frivolous politically driven \nlegislation against law-abiding individuals for the misbehavior of \ncriminals over whom they have no control. The courts of our Nation are \nsupposed to be forums for resolving controversies between citizens and \nproviding relief where warranted, not a mechanism for achieving \npolitical ends that are rejected by the people's representatives--the \nCongress or the State legislatures.\n  I believe that is the fundamental essence of 1805. It is direct. It \nis clearly to the point. It ought to be. I am pleased that 75 Members \nof the Senate earlier today said let's move this legislation to the \nfloor. Let's begin the process. Let's vote up or down. Let's keep the \nbill clean and deal with this critical issue.\n  Once again, let me talk for a few moments about those exceptions we \nhave carved out or defined within the law in the bill to make sure \nthere is no question. The key to S. 1805 is the definition of qualified \ncivil liability action which is addressed in the definitions section, \nsection 4. I ask all of my colleagues to go there and read it. It is a \nsimple bill, an easy bill to read, of 11 pages. But we made sure that \nwe clearly spelled out a qualified civil liability action, which is \ndefined as a lawsuit brought by any person against a manufacturer or a \nseller of a qualified product or a trade association for damages \nresulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product \nby a person or a third party.\n  Section 4, subsection 5, the definition then excludes five categories \nof lawsuits from coverage under 1805. In other words, we make very \nclear these following areas:\n  No. 1, an action brought against a transfer convicted under section \n924(h) of title 18 United States Code, or a comparable or identical \nState felony law, by a party directly harmed by the transferee's \nconduct. In other words, illegal movement of the weapon itself.\n  An action brought against a seller--this is the second one--for \nnegligent entrustment of negligence per se. Negligent entrustment is \ndefined in section 4, subsection 5(a), as the supplying of a qualified \nproduct by a seller for use by another person when the seller knows, or \nshould know, the person to whom the product supplied is likely to, and \ndoes, use the product in a manner involving unreasonable risk of \nphysical injury to the person and others. Misuse of the firearm, \nknowing that is going to happen. That is what Senator Daschle spoke to \nso clearly today in his clarifying amendment.\n  The third item, an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a \nqualified product knowingly and willfully violated a State and Federal \nstatute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product and the \nviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought.\n  No. 4, the action for breach of contract or warranty in connection \nwith the purchase of the product.\n  No. 5, an action for physical injury or property damage resulting \ndirectly from a defect in the design or manufacturing of the product--\nin other words, product liability--when used as intended or in a manner \nthat is reasonable and foreseeable.\n  And then, as I mentioned, the Daschle language amends the text to \npermit suits against manufacturers or dealers engaging in straw \npurchase transactions. That is, when one individual purchases a firearm \non behalf of a third party.\n  Why did we spell these out? We wanted the Senate and the citizens of \nour country to understand that this was not broad, nor was it sweeping. \nAt the same time we wanted everyone to understand that what we were \nsaying very clearly is something that has been said time and time again \nas it relates to the value of this legislation; that is, the \nreenforcement of centuries of legal precedent based on individual \nresponsibility, not responsibility for actions of third parties. In \nother words, if you manufacture a product legally in our economy and it \nsells and someone misuses it and a life is taken with the misuse of \nthat product, should we be able to come back through the court to the \nperson who produced it when they abided by the law and in no way knew \nthat the product would be used with the intent of harming someone?\n  That is the basis of individual responsibility in our country and, as \nI said, of centuries of legal precedent based on individual \nresponsibility and not the responsibility of the actions of third \nparties. Many judges have already rejected these suits that have been \nbrought. Antigun activists are trying to distort tort law by creating \ntotally new and expansive theories of liability to win restrictions \nthat have been rejected in the legislative process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded Senator Nickles' \nhour under rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Nickles for generously \nyielding me his hour. In a postcloture environment, the sponsors of the \nlegislation are allowed 2, individual Senators are allowed 1. I didn't \nrealize I had already spoken that much today.\n  Having said what I have just said, I hope I have laid a clear and \nunambiguous basis to why we are here today and why this legislation is \nsponsored and supported by so many groups across the United States: the \nUnited States Chamber of Commerce; the United Mine Workers of America; \nNational Association of Wholesaler Distributors--and the list goes on--\nthe National Association of Manufacturers; the Boone and Crockett Club; \nthe Buckmasters American Deer Foundation; the Campfire Clubs of \nAmerica; Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation; Council of Wildlife \nManagement and Education; Dallas Safari Club; Foundation for North \nAmerican Wild Sheep; Hunting and Shooting Sports Heritage Foundation; \nInternational Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies; International \nHunter Education Association; Izaak Walton League of America; Mule Deer \nFoundation; National Rifle Association; National Shooting Sports \nFoundation; National Trappers Association; National Wild Turkey \nFederation; Pheasants Forever; Pope and Young Club; Quail Unlimited, \nRocky Mountain Elk Foundation; Ruffed Grouse Society; Safari Club \nInternational; Texas Wildlife Association; the Wildlife Society; U.S. \nSportsmen's Alliance; White Tail Unlimited; Wildlife Forever; Wildlife \nManagement Institute; the Sports Fishing Association of America; \nAmerica Tort Reform Association; National Association of Independent \nInsurers; National Alliance of American Insurers.\n  Here is something I found most interesting. We began to debate it on \nthe floor today. Representatives from the International Association of \nMachinists and Aerospace Workers of East Alton, IL. Why? Because many \nof their members are employed in the Savage Arms Company in Westfield, \nMA, where they have already lost some 340 jobs over the last few years \nbecause that arms company has been so weakened by some of these \nlawsuits. They have had to pay out since 1999 over $425,000 as the cost \nof being at court with some of these lawsuits.\n  They are obviously concerned about their jobs. Somebody scoffed a bit \nthis afternoon that I am standing here talking about jobs, that this is \nsome kind of a jobs bill. It is just that. These industries are at risk \ntoday. They are not huge, deep-pocket industries. If we put every gun \nmanufacturer in this country all together, they would make up, in total \nassets, less than a Fortune 500 company. So they are extremely \nconcerned.\n  The aerospace workers in Waltham, MA, in Chicopee, MA, along with \nWestfield, MA, the United Mine Workers, again the United Steelworkers \nfrom Gainseville, FL--all of them have spoken to it. The United Auto \nWorkers have employees at the Colt plant in Newington, CT. Today they \nsay, and I read from their letter:\n\n       We have 383 members from the Colt workforce. By comparison, \n     about 5 years ago, we had over 600 Colt workers who were \n     members of our local. Our members built the finest small arms \n     in the world, including M-4 carbines, M-16 rifles, and M-203 \n     grenade launchers.\n\n  Obviously, those are not civilian weapons, they are military weapons. \nThose are the kinds of tools that our men and women use in Iraq today \nin defense of themselves and in defense of our freedoms. Many of them \nprovide\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\nthe U.S. military and law enforcement. Our law enforcement people \ncarry, in most instances, American firearms at their side.\n  Do we really want, by forcing these industries out of business, \nChinese or Yugoslavian or Hungarian firearms to be packed by our \nmilitary? Some would say: Senator Craig, you are just exaggerating. No, \nI am not. If ever one of these frivolous lawsuits would find root and \ngrow, the kinds of millions of dollars in potential settlement for an \nargument that a criminal act caused by a third party was ultimately the \nresult of an individual manufacturer who operated in a legal way could \neasily put them out of business because they simply do not have the \nkind of depth that, for example, the tobacco industry had years ago \nwhen these kinds of lawsuits began to be won against that industry.\n  Others have been tried in a variety of industries, but there is a \nreality, and that is why unions are now stepping forward as strong \nsupporters of this legislation saying: Wait a moment, enough is enough. \nAs long as our companies are legal and responsible and producing \nquality products, leave us alone, unless we act in a criminal fashion \nor in violation of Federal law in this country.\n  I cannot blame them for asking it. I believe they should ask it, and \nI believe we ought to grant that right. That is what S. 1805 does.\n  There are a good many issues we will be discussing over the course of \nthis debate. My guess is there will be a variety of amendments offered. \nI find it interesting that this debate gets us to where we are today.\n  Let me cite something that is interesting, and I will bring some \ncharts to the Chamber probably within the next day. Here is a question \nasked by the political studies at Southern Methodist University and the \nZogby poll people in examining the differences in thinking between \npeople who lived in the States who voted for George Bush in 2000, the \nred States, and those who voted for Al Gore, the blue States. Think red \nand blue here for a moment. We all saw those maps after the election, \nso we begin to think in reds and blues.\n  Here was the question asked by the Zogby poll people. I don't think \nyou would call Zogby a conservative pollster. He is either center left \nor is certainly viewed by most as not being conservative. Let me stop \nthere.\n\n  Here is a question asked by the Zogby pollster:\n\n       Do you agree or disagree that American firearm \n     manufacturers who sell a legal product that is not defective \n     should be allowed to be sued if a criminal uses their product \n     in a crime?\n\n  The answer came back showing a phenomenal result. Opposition in the \nStates that voted for President Bush, the red States, was 74 percent. \nIn other words, 74 percent said that gun manufacturers that operate in \nlegal ways ought to be protected. And in Al Gore States, 72 percent, a \n2-percent difference. One could almost say that a vast majority of \nAmericans agree with the essence and the principles of S. 1805. I found \nthat very interesting.\n  Interestingly, across the board, those most strongly opposed to these \nlawsuits against the firearms industry are currently members of the \nmilitary and their families.\n  There has been a lot of talk about our military these days because we \nhave phenomenally brave men and women standing in harm's way in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and other parts of the world. Our military said: We oppose \nfrivolous lawsuits of our gun manufacturers by 83 percent. That was a \nZogby poll taken earlier this year of 1,200 voters nationwide. So I \nfind it interesting that opposition occurs to the very narrow approach \nwe have taken when all of these large numbers begin to appear.\n  Zogby also asked this question:\n\n       Which of the following two statements regarding gun control \n     comes closer to your opinion? Statement 1: There needs to be \n     new and tougher gun law legislation to help in the fight \n     against gun crime. Statement No. 2: There are enough laws on \n     the books. What is needed is better enforcement of current \n     laws regarding gun control.\n\n  By a better than 2-to-1 margin, 66 to 31, voters nationwide agreed on \nstatement 2; that is, there are enough laws on the books. What is \nneeded is better enforcement of current laws regarding gun control.\n  Overwhelmingly, Americans are now speaking out very clearly on gun \nissues. They are also overwhelmingly speaking out against frivolous \nlawsuits of the kind that we have seen now launched against this \nindustry. Some 30-plus have been filed. Some are still pending. Some \nare on appeal. Some have already been thrown out by judges.\n  That is why we are here today. It is time that Congress stands up and \nspeaks to clarify and disallow the gaming of the system, if you will, \nby some who want to line their pockets first and, oh, if there is a \nlittle bit left, maybe the victim or at least the person in the name \nthe suit was brought would gain some benefit, but large compensation to \nthose who have a license to argue before the courts of the land. That \nis the reality of what we are dealing with.\n  I close by saying that we do not block lawsuits that are responsible, \nthat are within the law as we see it today and that we understand have \na legitimacy because some manufacturer or some dealer acted beyond and \noutside the law in a criminal fashion that causes us to suggest that \ntheir misaction means they ought to pay the price for that misaction \nbecause someone else paid dearly by the use of that firearm.\n  Those are the fundamental issues before us in this debate, and I \nthink it is important we have these votes. I hope within the next few \nminutes or within the hour we will have an agreement that allows us to \nmove forward and possibly go to an amendment tonight, and then we will \nbe back tomorrow for the balance of at least Thursday dealing with \nother critical votes on this issue.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, under rule XXII, \nthat Senator Sarbanes' hour be yielded to me as manager on the \nDemocratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining overall?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that there are \n24\\1/2\\ hours remaining.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, how much time is reserved for the \nDemocratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 82 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REED. I yield the floor, retaining my time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                      Advanced Technology Program\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, right before the last recess I came to \nthe floor to address the need for a revitalized science and technology \npolicy in the country. One example that I gave of the current \nadministration's inattention to science and technology and high-wage \njob creation was the proposal in the budget that we received a couple \nweeks ago to eliminate the Advanced Technology Program, or ATP, in the \nDepartment of Commerce. This is in the President's fiscal year 2005 \nbudget request.\n  In my view--as I stated it then; and I want to repeat it now--\neliminating the Advanced Technology Program makes no sense. Even the \nadministration's own budget justification, which clearly praises the \nprogram, makes clear that the program is valuable.\n  The Advanced Technology Program has been a constant target over the\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\nyears of those who would like to kill the program for philosophical \nreasons. But I believe those of us in Congress need to make decisions \nabout Federal programs on a logical basis and on the basis of the good \nthat those programs are doing for the people we represent.\n  So I believe we should examine the Advanced Technology Program by \nasking two fundamental questions. First, should our Government be \nsponsoring an Advanced Technology Program at all? And second, is the \nAdvanced Technology Program we are talking about an effective program \nfor advancing technology development in our country?\n  In discussing the need for a Government role, a basic principle with \nwhich nearly everyone would agree is that a Government role makes sense \nwhen there is a market failure of some sort. When it comes to advanced \ntechnology, there is ample empirical evidence of a critical gap between \nthe point at which Federal support for basic research ends and the \npoint at which private capital market support of product development \nbegins.\n\n  Now, let me try to illustrate that by referencing this chart. This \nchart is called the ``Valley of Death'' just to try to wake up my \ncolleagues to the fact that this is an important issue. Here, looking \nat this vertical axis, we are showing the invested money. Along the \nhorizontal axis, we are showing the various stages of developing a \ntechnology-based product for use.\n  The Government does invest a fair amount of money in basic research. \nThat is shown over here at the left, in the beginning stages of \ndeveloping a product or developing a technology. Here we show labs and \nuniversities. Our Federal Government does invest a substantial amount \nin that area, and that is certainly commendable. Of course, many of my \ncolleagues would argue that we do not invest enough there, and I would \nagree with that, but that is a subject for another day.\n  Industry invests most of its research and development dollars at the \nother end of this development continuum and invests those funds on \ncommercializing short-term, low-risk, reliably profitable products, and \nthen making incremental improvements on those products which they are \nfairly confident they can make a return on in the market.\n  In between these two stages of the research and development process, \nwe have what many in the industry call the ``Valley of Death.'' That is \nthe gap where our private capital markets fail to invest applied \nresearch dollars to create preproduct, so-called platform technologies. \nThis market failure occurs because such generic technologies are too \nexpensive or they are too risky for industry to develop on its own.\n  At the same time, it is precisely these generic, platform \ntechnologies that are the seed corn for new products, and in many cases \nnew market categories. The benefits to industry generally and to our \nnational economy far outweigh the costs of developing such \ntechnologies.\n  In the case of defense technologies, the Federal Government is the \nultimate customer, and programs such as the Defense Advanced Research \nProjects Agency--the work that they fund in DARPA in the Defense \nDepartment--plays an important partnering role with defense contractors \nand high-technology firms.\n  But for technologies with predominantly civilian applications, the \nFederal Government does not have the strong customer stake in \ndeveloping specific technologies. So filling in this funding gap in the \n``Valley of Death'' is precisely the role that the Advanced Technology \nProgram plays for civilian technology.\n  That brings me to the second question that I outlined earlier. That \nis, is this advanced technology program an effective program for \npromoting these new platform technologies? Some in the Congress have \nreacted over the years to the ATP as if it were some sort of Federal \nprogram to help Gillette make a five-bladed razor or to help Microsoft \nwrite Windows 2006. This is not an accurate description of the ATP by \nany stretch.\n\n  Let me give a few examples of actual ways in which the Advanced \nTechnology Program has succeeded in bridging the ``Valley of Death'' \nfor U.S. industries with a resulting positive impact on our economy and \nour global competitiveness.\n  In 1991, the Council on Competitiveness characterized the U.S. \nprinted wiring board industry as losing badly or lost. That was their \ndescription. By this they meant the U.S. was not likely to have a \npresence in that industry within 5 years. It attracted little private \nventure funding. Only a handful of the 700 firms in the industry had \nthe capability to undertake advanced research. Through the ATP, a new \njoint venture between the printed wiring board industry as a whole and \nthe Government was formed that would not have occurred otherwise. The \nnew manufacturing technologies that were developed in the joint venture \nyielded an estimated cost savings for industry in excess of $35 \nmillion.\n  Another example: In the past, U.S. car makers tolerated dimensional \nvariations of up to 5 or 6 millimeters. That is a level that often \ncomplicated the assembly process. It required custom manual reworking, \nand compromised vehicle fit and finish, as it was referred to in the \nindustry. An advanced technology project was put together with the U.S. \nauto industry, reducing this variation to less than 2.5 millimeters by \ninventing an array of new technologies. This one project is credited \nwith increasing the U.S. gross domestic product by over $200 million \nand creating 1,400 jobs. In short, empirical research demonstrates this \nproject helped increase the demand for domestically produced vehicles \nand helped domestic producers stem the loss of market share to offshore \nmanufacturers.\n  The Advanced Technology Program has also been called the godfather of \nthe DNA diagnostic tool industry. That is another example which clearly \nmy colleagues should look into before they follow the administration's \nrecommendation and try to terminate this program.\n  The Advanced Technology Program was making investments in \nnanotechnology long before it became a household word, along with \ninvestments in homeland security and bringing fuel cells and solar \ncells and microturbines to the marketplace. In 2003, the White House \nsponsored a fuel cell demonstration and the President tested a long-\nlife mobile phone. Let me put another chart up here. You might \nrecognize this photo. The President was testing a long-life mobile \nphone powered by advanced fuel cell technology. Without the Advanced \nTechnology Program, MTI microfuel cells would not have been able to \ndevelop this breakthrough technology to power this very phone. So that \nis another example.\n  As I have tried to make amply clear, there are many examples of ATP \nsuccesses. There are certainly also other examples where ATP projects \nhave not been successful. That is the nature of a high-risk, high-\npayoff research program. But let's put the successes and the failures \nin the overall context.\n  The total cost of ATP funding to date has been about $2.1 billion. \nThat is over the life of that program. All told, the preliminary \nresults of a 2003 ATP survey of over 350 companies indicates the actual \neconomic value resulting from ATP joint ventures exceeds $7.5 billion. \nThe benefits from just a few projects analyzed to date are projected to \nexceed $17 billion, when those platform technologies are fully \nexploited by the industries involved.\n\n  ATP has also been the subject of a recent overall assessment by the \nNational Academies of Science and Engineering, and the core conclusions \nof this 2001 study speak strongly both to the success of the program \nand to the generic focus of the program. The national academies \nconcluded the ATP was an effective partnership program at the generic \ntechnology level. The academies specifically found the selection \ncriteria applied by the ATP enabled it to meet broad national needs and \nto help ensure the benefits of successful awards extend across firms \nand industries. The national academies have also found the ATP peer \nreview of applicants for both technical feasibility and commercial \npotential was effective in targeting promising new technologies that \nwere unlikely to have been funded through the normal operation of the \ncapital markets.\n  I could go on and on about the conclusions of the national academies \nstudy. Let me just say the reality is industry will not fill the void \nthe President would create if his budget proposal to kill this Advanced \nTechnology\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\nProgram were agreed to. Given industry's increased emphasis on short-\nterm applied R and consequently reduced emphasis on early phase \ntechnology research, the elimination of the Advanced Technology Program \nwould simply trigger the further erosion of U.S. technology leadership \nand lead to even greater loss of high-technology, high-wage jobs in the \nfuture.\n  I would like to end with a quote from David Morgenthaler, former \npresident of the National Venture Capital Association. The members of \nthe National Venture Capital Association account for around 80 percent \nof the venture investment taking place in the United States today. \nDavid Morgenthaler says:\n\n       It does seem that early stage help by the government in \n     developing platform technologies and financing scientific \n     discoveries is directed exactly at the areas where \n     institutional venture capitalists cannot and will not go.\n\n  When experts in venture capital and leaders in industry and our \nNational Academies of Science and Engineering all agree the Advanced \nTechnology Program plays a unique and valuable role in supporting our \nhigh technology competitiveness, we ought to pay attention.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join me in resisting the unwise \nproposal which we have been given by the President to terminate the \nAdvanced Technology Program. ATP has demonstrably contributed to \nmaintaining our manufacturing strength. A strong and well-funded \nAdvanced Technology Program will help the United States remain \ncompetitive in high tech manufacturing in the future. Instead of ending \nthis program, we should look for ways to duplicate its strengths in \nother civilian technology areas such as energy and environment and \nhomeland defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, returning to the gun immunity bill \nthat is being presented, this is legislation that is being bullied \nthrough the Congress.\n  I have been here a long time, now going into my 20th year. This is \none of the most outrageous pieces of legislation I have ever seen. We \nhave never seen such a complete sellout. This is like a fire sale to a \nspecial interest lobby.\n  The bill is absolutely a free pass. It says to the gun industry: Do \nanything you want, and you have no one who can punish you by going to \nour court system, established effectively by our Constitution. They can \ndo whatever they want, no matter how negligent, reckless, or \nirresponsible.\n  Of all the people in society to provide special protections to, why \nin the world would we give immunity from redress to this industry?\n  This immunity bill says even reckless behavior--forget about \nnegligence. Negligence says I didn't mean to do it, but I didn't check \non the process. Reckless behavior could be deliberate. There could be \nreckless behavior in the manufacture, sale, or distribution of guns. No \nmatter how destructive the result is to life and limb of innocent \npeople, the victims of that conduct cannot hold you accountable. It \njust does not make sense.\n  We hear this claim from our friends on the other side about \n``frivolous lawsuits'' is how they describe it. Frivolous lawsuits--\nlawsuits that, frankly, are far from frivolous because the damage is \nbeyond description when a family loses a child, a father, a brother, a \nmother, or a sister, or some child is permanently injured and cannot \nfunction normally. Frivolous? I don't call that frivolous. These are \nvalid claims of wrongdoing by an industry that puts profit ahead of \nhuman life, and we can't let them go without consequence.\n  Let us ask the gun victims if their lawsuits are frivolous. Ask those \nwho have lost loved ones at the hands of the DC area snipers just over \na year ago. And talking about the DC snipers, they were prohibited by \nlaw from buying guns. Under law, they could not sell guns to Lee Malvo. \nHe walked into a gun shop and walked out with a sniper rifle. A sniper \nrifle is a pretty big piece of equipment.\n  I invite my colleagues to look at this image. This chart says they \nlost 237 guns; 237 guns for which they have no responsibility to \naccount. They said: Gee whiz, how do you like that, we lost all these \nlethal weapons that may have just kind of walked out or fallen down a \ncrack in the floor someplace. It is outrageous--including one of those \nweapons that wound up in the hands of those who committed these \natrocities, Lee Malvo and John Muhammad.\n  This is a picture of a gun shop that has become all too familiar. It \nis called the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply. They lost the guns.\n  In the wake of the sniper case, we now know that in addition to \nlosing hundreds of guns from their inventory, this gun shop cannot \nlocate the firearms sales records they are required by law to keep to \nhelp police solve crimes. Those records that were recovered showed that \nBull's Eye frequently sold numerous guns to individual buyers, a sure \nsign of phony straw purchases. But obviously this rogue gun store \nlooked the other way.\n  According to ATF records, between 1997 and 2001, guns sold by Bull's \nEye were involved in at least 52 crimes, including homicides, \nkidnappings, and assaults. Guns in 52 crimes were traced back to this \none gunshop.\n  Under this gun immunity bill, Bull's Eye gets a free pass. They would \nnot be accountable to victims of their negligence, and it is a \ndespicable proposal.\n  DC sniper Lee Malvo could not have legally purchased a Bushmaster \nassault weapon from Bull's Eye. He was too young. But he walked into \nthe Bull's Eye store in broad daylight and walked out in a short time \nwith a Bushmaster XM-15. That is the weapon he and John Muhammad used \nto murder and injure their victims.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to take a look. How could he get behind the \ncounter, walk out with a weapon, and not be noticed? It was captured on \nfilm, but they didn't see it. What an odd coincidence that is.\n  It is outrageous. It is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who \nlooks at this picture to know this weapon could not have disappeared \nwithout being noticed. Look at the size of it. It tells the story. But \nthen I guess what is being asked for is sympathy for this gun shop, \nthis place that let the murder weapon out of its sight and into the \nhands of these madmen who shot people at random.\n  Let them get away with that, with no repercussion, no lawsuits: You \ninjured my child, you injured my husband, you injured my wife? People \nwere shot sitting alongside their mates, and we want to protect them? \nWhat do we have to protect them for? I don't understand it.\n  To me there is an element of curiosity here that just does not \nregister. I don't understand the wailing and weeping about how to \nprotect these guys, these dispensers of murder. It is awful. Yet we \nhear the case: Gee whiz, if you had an automobile and a drunk driver \ndrove it and killed somebody, why should the automobile company be \nresponsible? We saw that once.\n  Ford Motor Company made the Pinto. When it was struck from the rear, \nit would catch fire. We had people testify. They were so disfigured, it \nwas painful to look at them. Imagine what it felt like to be one of \nthem--so disfigured.\n  They went to the Ford Motor Company and said: Change the design. Ford \nhad a board meeting supposedly in which they said: Change the design? \nDo you know what that is going to cost us? The heck with it. Let's pay \nthe damages that come from lawsuits. That is the way it goes sometimes.\n  The automobile is not intended to be a lethal weapon, and we lose a \nlot more from fewer of these gun manufacturers every year than we do \nmanufacturers of cars. We lose over 28,000 people a year, 11,000 of \nthem homicides, the rest suicides, accidents. That is what happens. We \nhave millions of cars on the road, and we do not have much more of a \nmortality rate with those cars than we have with these weapons. But we \ndo not try to protect the automobile industry.\n  We do not try to protect the aviation industry if there is negligence \nin an air crash. You can bet people have a right and do take advantage \nof the right to get some redress. They don't want the money, for gosh \nsakes. They do not want any other families to have to suffer the same \nhumiliating loss they experienced.\n  If anyone proposed that we go ahead and say to the airlines: Look, \ntell you what, for reckless behavior and one of\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\nthose planes goes down with 200, 400 people on it, we know you really \ndidn't intend to do that, so, therefore, you ought to be excused. We \nare not going to excuse them, and we should not excuse the gun \nindustry, the people who manufacture these weapons in any form, any \nshape, disguises for assault weapons that say this really isn't an \nassault weapon. It passes the specifications test, except if you make \nan adjustment here in the cartridge carrier or there, it becomes, \neffectively, an assault weapon. No, we are saying, no, we are not going \nto punish you for that. Go ahead, be careful because people may not \nlike you, but we are not going to punish you for it.\n  That is the situation in which we find ourselves.\n  Do we really believe that in this situation these weapons were lost \nor stolen from this store? It is ludicrous. So we should not pretend we \ndo not know what really happened. What we are doing is closing our eyes \nto responsible behavior throughout our Nation. It is obvious they sold \nthe Bushmaster to Malvo under the table, or however he got it. It is a \npathetic and irresponsible recognition we are giving these people.\n  Should Bull's Eye be held accountable for their outrageous actions \nthat resulted in the death of innocent people? The sponsors of this \nbill say, no, they should not pay for approximately a dozen deaths. The \nsponsors of this bill say, no, this outlet should not be punished for \nmurder; that, after all, they are okay. They sell things that kill \npeople or close their eyes to the distribution of weapons.\n  The sponsors of this bill say, no, if one is negligent, they cannot \nbe held accountable. It says if they are reckless, they cannot be held \naccountable.\n  The bottom line is there are many victims with valid legal claims who \nwill have their lawsuits wiped out. It is outrageous.\n  Today we were visited by a policeman from my home State, the town of \nOrange, NJ. He was shot in an exchange of fire with an assailant. He \nhas a lawsuit in place. He can no longer work at his job. We are \nsaying, too bad. Why were you standing in the way of that bullet when \nit came? Essentially that is what we are saying: Why did you get in the \nway of the guy who was going to pull the trigger? You should not have \ndone that. They should not be punished for their complicity by getting \na gun for this would-be murderer.\n  This bill before us tells Bull's Eye and their cronies in the \nbusiness, keep up the good work; do not worry about it; in the Senate, \nwe are going to take care of you. We are going to immunize them from \nwrongdoing.\n  Why on God's Earth do they want to immunize these people? I do not \nunderstand it. I have seen pretenses at logic that said, well, we will \nhave no gun industry to supply our Army. Baloney. Everybody knows that \nis a phony argument. They will get their weapons made. We can protect \nthose who make arms for the military and we can make sure they are \nunder better care than we see now.\n  The snipers who did the killing wreaked havoc on our society and now \nwe want to reward the gun dealer responsible for illegally giving them \ntheir killing weapon with immunity from civil lawsuits. This is absurd.\n  This Senate is about to make these sniper victims and their families \nvictims a second time. After all they have gone through and that they \nare going through, we are going to pass a bill to take away their \nfundamental legal rights. It is reprehensible. There are so many other \npeople who are going to be denied justice by this bill.\n  I want to take a moment to tell the Senate about two brave police \nofficers, one of whom I mentioned earlier, who are going to be \nvictimized by this bill, Ken McGuire and David Lemongello. They are two \npolice officers from Orange, NJ, who were shot and seriously wounded by \na criminal who obtained his gun through the negligence of a gun \nmanufacturer and gun dealer in the State of West Virginia. The criminal \nwho shot them was barred from legally buying guns, but he was able to \nobtain these weapons from a straw purchaser who was sold 12 guns by a \nWest Virginia gun dealer in a single transaction.\n  This gun dealer completed the sales in spite of the obvious signs \nthat the purchaser was not buying the guns for himself. The gun dealer \nadmitted he was suspicious of the transaction but turned the other way. \nThen less than 6 months later, Officers McGuire and Lemongello were \nshot by one of those weapons.\n  Is the police officers' lawsuit against the gun dealer frivolous? A \nWest Virginia judge ruled the officers' claims are supported by West \nVirginia negligence and public nuisance law and that the officers' case \nshould proceed against the dealer as well as the manufacturer of the \ngun who imposed no requirements on its dealers to cut large volume \nsales.\n  If this gun immunity bill is passed, the rights of these two brave \npolice officers are abolished. To make matters worse, it will allow \nother gun dealers to look the other way and complete suspicious sales \nbecause, well, there are not any consequences; we cannot be sued for \nour negligence.\n  I want my colleagues to know Officer Ken McGuire is in the Capitol \ntoday. He is here to ask Senators not to take his rights away, and I \nask my colleagues to give him a moment of their time if he approaches \nyou.\n  These lawsuits are the only real way to hold these rogue dealers \naccountable because current laws regulating dealers are a joke. The ATF \nis restricted to only one announced inspection per year.\n  In reference to Bull's Eye, I heard the Senator from Idaho say the \nshop is shut down now. He is very careful with the things he said, but \nI think he made a mistake. It just is not true. Bull's Eye took \nadvantage of the weak gun dealer laws and merely transferred its \nlicense. They are very much in business. My staff called Bull's Eye \ntoday and they said they are open until 7 p.m. It does not sound to me \nas though they are closed. So if someone from the Senate wants to make \na quick trip over there today to pick up an assault weapon, they have \nuntil 7 Pacific time to do so.\n  There are a host of other cases that would be affected if this bill \nis passed. Supporters of this bill will be trampling the rights of \ninnocent victims who only want their day in court, to which I think \nthey are entitled.\n  The supporters of this bill claim the lawsuits against the gun \nindustry are frivolous. Frivolous? Ask Denise Johnson whether her \nlawsuit is frivolous. She lost her husband at the hands of the DC area \nsnipers. On the morning of October 22, 2002, Denise Johnson said \ngoodbye to her husband Conrad with her usual ``be careful.'' Neither he \nnor her children had any idea this would be their last words to their \nhusband and father.\n  This 35-year-old bus driver was shot on October 22 in Silver Spring, \nMD. He was standing at the top step of his empty bus when he was hit. \nHe was killed instantly by the Bushmaster portrayed here that Bull's \nEye ``lost'' to Lee Malvo.\n  Some have the impression it is only the DC sniper victims and \nOfficers McGuire and Lemongello from New Jersey who would have lawsuits \nblocked by this bill. Unfortunately, there are many other victims of \ngun violence with valid cases who would have their suits dismissed. I \nask the sponsors why do they want to do that? Why? Loss of a family \nmember? Perhaps it is the principal breadwinner in the family. Should \nwe have the family suffer from now newly found poverty and doing \nwithout the capacity to pay the rent, perhaps be evicted from their \nhomes? Why do we want to punish them a second time? Was it not enough \nthey suffered like that the first time? We want to cut away from them \ntheir right to have redress for what took place.\n  There is Tenille Jefferson. Her 7-year-old son was killed by another \nchild with a .44 caliber rifle. This tragic shooting occurred because \nthe gun ended up in the streets after being negligently sold through a \ngun dealer to an illegal drug user and gun trafficker.\n  Then there is Sherilyn Byrdsong who lost her husband, former college \nbasketball coach Rick Byrdsong, when he was shot and killed as he \nwalked with their children in Evanston, IL. The crime was committed by \na white supremacist, Benjamin Smith, who targeted minorities in a \nshooting spree through Illinois and Indiana. Even though Smith was \nprohibited from buying guns, he was able to obtain a gun because of the \nactions of a reckless gun dealer.\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\n  This reckless dealer sold one gun trafficker over 70 handguns in less \nthan 2 years, almost all of them Saturday night specials, commonly used \nby criminals. Mrs. Byrdsong's lawsuit is pending in a State court in \nChicago. Other victims of this same shooter have joined the lawsuit. If \nthis bill passes, their lawsuits are wiped out. I cannot understand why \nwe would want to do that in this, the Capitol of this Government of our \ngreat country. I can't understand why we are bent on taking away \npeople's rights and making them suffer because of a special interest \ngroup that has a special reach to those in this Senate and the House \nwho say: We have to take care of this industry. This is an essential \nindustry. We want this. Maybe we can build this into a major industry, \nmake it bigger than it is, sell more guns.\n  That is hardly a way to see a productive existence in a society that \nessentially has respect for the law.\n  The Reverend Stephen Anderson, a minister shot during this spree I \nwas talking about, on his way to join his family in a Fourth of July \ncelebration, would have his lawsuit dismissed. Steven Kuo, a graduate \nstudent at the University of Illinois, would have his rights taken \naway. Hillel Goldstein, one of several Orthodox Jews shot when walking \nhome from temple services, would have his family's lawsuit terminated.\n  There are other cases that would be dismissed--the parents of 15-\nyear-old Kenzo Dix, who was shot and killed unintentionally by a 14-\nyear-old friend because the gun lacked well-known safety features. The \nboy thought his father's pistol was unloaded as he had emptied the \nmagazine. Had the gun included an indicator that alerted him that a \nround was in the chamber, or an integral lock that would have prevented \nhim from firing, Kenzo would not have been killed. But Kenzo's parents' \ncase would be terminated by this bill.\n  The family of Joan Moore, who was shot and killed by a mentally \nderanged man in the town of Belle, WV, would have their suit dismissed. \nHer family brought suit for negligence against the gun dealer who sold \na 9 mm rifle to Moore's killer, 18-year-old Robert Copen. Mr. Copen \nstood in the gun shop's parking lot all day in plain sight, smoking \nmarijuana before he entered the store. He apparently acted so oddly \nwhile in the store that an employee asked his supervisor if Copen \nshould be trusted with a gun. Management told the employee to go ahead \nand make the sale anyway.\n  This gun dealer was clearly negligent. But Mrs. Moore's family would \nlose their rights under this bill.\n  This Senate looks as if it wants to administer a second punishment \nbecause the first punishment was not severe enough. It is shocking to \nbelieve this could take place.\n  Since when is Congress in the business of rewarding the worst in our \nsociety? Why would we want to send a message that says: Circumvent the \nlaw, put our families in danger, and we are going to protect you?\n  The reality is that the gun industry engages frequently in improper \nconduct with deadly consequences. We have seen many examples of this. \nCorrupt dealers who frequently sell to criminals would be immune. Straw \npurchasers who work with rogue gun dealers to obtain guns for people \nwho are not eligible to buy guns would be immune. Dealers who engage in \nlarge volume sales, such as the Illinois dealer who sold 60 Saturday \nnight special handguns to one customer, would be immune.\n  And, of course, there is the problem of gun shows, where criminals \nand terrorists can buy guns without background checks.\n\n  As many here know, the Senate passed my gun show amendment with the \nhelp of Vice President Gore, a 50-50 tie in 1999. But the House \nRepublicans killed the provision in conference. They were not willing \nto shut down dealers who are not required to get any data about a \npurchaser--no names, no addresses, no pictures, nothing, not even a \nfingerprint.\n  If the NRA immunity bill is signed into law--and I call it the NRA \nimmunity bill deliberately because that is who we are servicing today. \nWe are not servicing this list of people who had the punishment we have \nseen, punishment that should never be permitted to be put upon a \nfamily, a loss of a child, a loss of a husband, a loss of a wife or \nmother. We should not do that. But if the NRA immunity bill is signed \ninto law, victims of industry recklessness will be denied their day in \ncourt.\n  It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense to me, and I am sure it \ndoesn't make sense to people across the country. And I hope they are \nlistening. People across the country have to understand what we are \ndoing. We are protecting an industry that provided the murder weapon to \nkill lots of people. Why in the world do we want to protect those \npeople? If your behavior is bad, no matter what the product is, if it \nis a toy, if it is a crib or otherwise, and it is made improperly, you \npay a price for it. I come from a State where pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers are a giant industry. Let a pharmaceutical manufacturer \nput the wrong ingredient in the capsule which hurts somebody's health, \nthey go to court. They are very conscious of that. They are very much \nafraid of the repercussions of a lawsuit. That is what makes people pay \nattention. It does it in that industry. It does it in all other \nindustries.\n  But we want to exempt this one industry for their noble behavior, for \ntheir concern for human life, for their concern for jobs, I heard \nearlier. The Senator from Illinois scoffed at it and said: Oh, I didn't \nknow we were talking about a jobs bill.\n  Why don't we make hand grenades and distribute them freely? You could \nget people to do that.\n  This is ridiculous. Unfortunately, it is not about common sense but, \nrather, it is about dollars and cents. It is about political support on \nthe outside. It is about nasty mail campaigns. It is about the \ndeterioration of common sense and collegiality. It says: Look, I don't \nowe my constituents all that. What I do owe is I owe some special \ninterest friends of mine who helped author the legislation in the House \nthat applies to this. We know the role that the NRA plays in financing \npolitical campaigns. It seems as if it is paying off for them right \nnow.\n  Thankfully, there are still people here who see their responsibility \ndifferently, who will stand up for principle, who will do all they can \nto prevent this unconscionable piece of legislation from passing. We \nhave friends on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans. \nThis isn't the special property, the unique property of Republicans. It \nis people who are not looking clearly at the problem, who are not \nwilling to say: Hey, I can catch a little abuse from the NRA and its \nmembership and its friends.\n  I took a lot of it in my previous term in the Senate. But we did take \ngun permits away from spousal abusers. Some 40-plus thousand were \ndenied gun permits because of a piece of legislation we passed. Does \nanybody regret that fact? I wonder, if we asked the question, do you, \nsir/ma'am, regret the fact that we have taken away those permits from \nthose spousal abusers, permission to buy guns, permits.\n  I wonder if you feel badly about that, and about other things that \ntry to curb gun violence.\n  This bill takes away a critical tool in the fight to eliminate gun \nviolence. It is comparable, in my view, to taking away medication from \ndoctors trying to treat a deadly disease, perhaps to prevent death, or \nimmobility, or mental fatigue in a person without proper medication. \nWhy do we not want to prevent the possibility that someone can be \npermanently injured or incapacitated?\n  What are the symptoms of this disease? In the year 2000, there were \nmore than 28,000 firearm-related deaths in the United States. About \n11,000 were homicides. These deaths and injuries cost an estimated $2.3 \nbillion a year in lifetime medical expenses alone, much of which is \nborne by the U.S. taxpayer. The total societal cost of firearms is much \nhigher--an estimated $100 billion a year--and the cost to families \ncannot be measured.\n  But we know this: The bill on the floor today is a direct attack on \npeople who have already suffered a tragedy. This bill is an \nembarrassment to the Senate, to our Government, and our Nation, and it \nought not to be permitted to go forward.\n  I ask my colleagues one thing. Before you cast your vote on this \nbill, spend a second thinking about a child's face who learns that \ndaddy is dead, or about a father's face when he learns that his\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\nchild is dead--killed not by nature or something that perhaps could not \nbe prevented. Much of this can be prevented. Think about these victims. \nGive them their fair consideration before you victimize them once \nagain.\n  I hate to think that this wonderful body in which I am privileged to \nserve would want to inflict punishment on those who have already \nsuffered so deeply, or who will suffer so deeply by protecting those \nscoundrels who break the rules with reckless behavior. Imagine what is \nbeing said--that even if you are reckless, you are going to be \nimmunized by this legislation. Negligence is bad; reckless is \nunacceptable under any condition.\n  I hope I am talking for the majority of those so we can get a vote \nagainst this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are hoping in a few moments that we \nmight have a unanimous consent request to allow us to get to this bill.\n  I will respond only briefly to the Senator from New Jersey and his \ncomments because he did suggest that I had implied something that is \nnot fact on the floor of the Senate today. I want to make sure the \nrecord is clear because I don't want in any way to mislead any of my \ncolleagues.\n  I said that the Bull's Eye gun store was closed. It, in fact, did \nclose. The license of the dealer at the time the weapon was stolen was \njerked. He could no longer conduct the business. He sold the business \nto a new licensed dealer. What the Senator from New Jersey failed to \nrecognize is that licenses aren't given to locations; they are given to \nindividuals, and those individuals must qualify. A condition of the new \nlicense also was all new personnel in the gunshop.\n  The Senator is accurate in suggesting that he might have called today \nand the gunshop is open under new management and new license and new \npeople. The person who I said this morning had lost his license because \nBATF had jerked it and he had to close his business is, in fact, a \nlegitimate and valid statement. That did happen. It is also my \nunderstanding that the criminal investigation is now underway, and that \nBATF is recommending to Justice that they file felony charges against \nthis particular dealer. I do not know anything more about the facts. \nBut I do know one thing.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me complete this thought, and I would be happy to \nyield.\n  I do know one thing. Lee Malvo himself said: I stole the weapon. That \nis very important. But the Senator suggested--and his words were: Well, \nmaybe an under-the-table deal. I do not know that stealing is under the \ntable, and the man who pulled the trigger admitted he had stolen the \nweapon. You can imply anything you want. I can't. I have to use factual \nstatements given by, in this case, a man who has been apprehended and \nwe now believe by all evidence committed that tremendously tragic crime \nand was one of the District of Columbia snipers. That is the reality. I \nbelieve those are the facts. I believe them to be honest and \nstraightforward facts.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  One thing I know is that we often disagree, but I would never accuse \nhim of these statements. He is an honorable man. We have our \ndifferences on things that we ought to be putting into law. But I would \nlike, if I may, to correct my friend's impression because not only was \nthere a phone which was answered but the now owner of the license is a \ngood friend of the former owner.\n  If one looks at the pictures that we displayed, the weapon used was a \npretty sizable piece of equipment. As I remember from what I saw on the \nfilm shown on television, there was evidence that this Lee Malvo was \ncarrying a weapon out of that store. The camera saw it. Certainly it \ncould have been negligence. It could have been reckless or maybe the \ngun was paid for by a friend, and with the wink of the eye, out it \nwent. But to give this criminal credit for telling the truth is \nsomething that I--\n  Mr. CRAIG. I did yield for the sake of a question and not a comment. \nI would like to reclaim the floor.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator is absolutely right. My question was, Did \nthe Senator know that the new owner of the license was the friend of \nthe former owner?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I didn't inquire about friendships or relationships. I \ninquired about the legality of the license that operates the store, and \nwhether the store is still in business, and whether the owner who is \nalleged to have mishandled records owns it today; does he operate it. \nThe answer is no.\n  Let me also add that I appreciate the Senator's logic about the \nstealing of a weapon. Automobiles are stolen from automobile lots and \nthe thieves are caught on camera. The last I checked, an automobile is \nsubstantially larger than a rifle. Is it possible that Lee Malvo picked \nup a gun and walked out of the store? He says he did. He says he did. \nHe stole the weapon.\n  I am not going to in any way attempt to defend the man who once owned \nthe Bull's Eye gunshop. He may be indefensible. He may have violated \nthe law. If he did--and he is being investigated for it--S. 1805 does \nnot immune him from any of those actions. That is what is important to \nunderstand as we debate the bill. His acts were criminal. If he is in \nviolation of the Federal firearm license, if he has mishandled his \nrecords, and if he had, in fact, seen a robbery and failed to report \nit, then this man is in trouble because that is the law. We would not \nprotect him nor does this bill protect him from that law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we have heard a lot today about the \nexceptions contained in that bill which, arguably, might result in \nliability to someone such as the dealer in the Bull's Eye Shooting \nGallery store but legal analysis by eminent attorneys suggests they \nwould not apply to that particular case.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wonder if I could ask the \ndistinguished Senator a question.\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I believe the Senator has examined the opinion \noffered by Mr. Lloyd Cutler and others. Is it not their opinion that \nthese lawsuits would be obstructed from proceeding as a result of this \nlaw being put in place?\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is accurate. The analysis by eminent attorneys \nlooking at this legislation, looking at the exemptions, suggests in the \ncase of Bull's Eye that this dealer would not be subject to liability; \nhe would be immunized from liability because of this particular bill.\n  This is a situation that has to be made very clear to people. We are \nessentially giving this individual an opportunity to walk away from \nserious negligence. I don't think it is appropriate. In fact, I think \nit is unconscionable.\n  There is a factual discussion about the status of the Bull's Eye \nShooting Gallery. My understanding is--and it is close, I think, to \nthat of the Senator from Idaho with additional detail--as I understand \nit, the individual who was in fact the owner-operator, Brian Borgelt, \nhad his license revoked. He is appealing that revocation in court. That \nis his right. He somehow transferred ownership of the store to someone \nwe have been informed is a friend, a colleague, which is also \npermissible under the law. It appears, though, that Mr. Borgelt is \noperating a shooting gallery in the same building, but it does look as \nif this might be an entirely legal transaction.\n  The point was raised earlier, and Senator Lautenberg and I have tried \nto clarify, at least there was an impression this store was closed, out \nof business, and not operating. The agreement and the factual accuracy \nas of this point that we both share is the store is operating. The \nindividual who owned it is no longer operating it because his license \nhas been revoked and he is challenging the revocation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield, I think that is a valid \nanalysis and I certainly did not intend to misportray that.\n  Again, let's go back to the law. Are you suing the store if there are \nlawsuits, or are you suing the individual who had the Federal firearms \nlicense? Is it the physical structure that is liable or is it the \nindividual who owned the structure who is liable? We know\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\nwhat the law is. It is the individual and not the store.\n  I cannot, nor do I, know the details of the relationship. What I do \nknow is that he cannot sell firearms today. His license has been \npulled. That is what the law requires, and a criminal investigation \nproceeds at this moment. I believe that is the essence of the argument.\n  Mr. REED. That is an accurate description of the situation but, \nagain, the imprecision was whether the store is operating, not who is \noperating it. The individual is not able to operate because he lost his \nlicense.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will further yield, I did use the phrase \n``store closed.'' I meant the ownership, as it was; he closed. It \nreopened. Whether it was 24 hours or 48 hours, he could no longer \noperate it when his license was revoked. We understood he sold it to a \nnew operator who is licensed.\n  Mr. REED. I think it is important to clarify that because it has been \na matter of factual dispute.\n  The other issue which has to be clarified is the applicability of \nthis legislation to that original owner-operator who had been accused \nof a laundry list of inappropriate actions. I had the opportunity to \nreview some of them today.\n  With respect to the owner of the Bull's Eye Shooting Gallery at the \ntime the Malvo gun was obtained, under his ownership and under his \nlicense, 238 guns were missing. Many guns between 1997 and 2001 found \ntheir way into crime scenes. A remarkable record of guns found their \nway from a licensed dealer to crime scenes. Many found themselves to \ncrime scenes in a rapid period of time. The nomenclature is ``time to \ncrime.'' Time to crime was remarkably narrow. The time to crime was \nless than 3 years in more than 70 percent of Bull's Eye cases between \n1997 and 2001, suggesting this organization was a conduit for obtaining \nweapons for crimes.\n  There were large numbers of multiple firearms sales. Sometimes he \nwould sell as many as 10 guns at a time. There were numerous ATF \ncitations, at least 15 times between 1997 and 2001. That is the record \nof the individual whose license was suspended, finally, by the ATF.\n  But the issue is, with respect to this individual, if we pass this \nlegislation, will he be immunized after this record of negligence, \nrecklessness, irrational responsibility? Most people would say that is \nthe record. The exemption provided by paragraph (5)(A)(iii) says, in \neffect, the action would be preserved in which a manufacturer or seller \nof a qualified product violated a State or Federal statute applicable \nto the sale or marketing of the product and the violation was a \nproximate cause of harm for which relief is sought.\n  Two elements: You have to violate Federal and State statutes; and \nthat violation was the proximate cause of the damage to the individual. \nAccording to the well-settled tort law principle, proximate cause \nrequires that the defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in \nbringing about the harm suffered by the plaintiff.\n  Remember, two elements: State and Federal statutes violated, and that \nviolation being a proximate cause.\n  Here is the difficulty with respect to the situation at the Bull's \nEye Shooting Gallery. Despite the evidence we have that there were \ncertain violations, many of them record keeping, it is going to be \nvirtually impossible that the plaintiffs in the sniper case will be \nable to show that Bull's Eye violated any State or Federal statute with \nrespect to the particular gun that was used by the snipers or that any \nsuch statutory violation was a proximate cause of the sniper attacks.\n  The evidence concerning the acquisition of the snipers' weapon \nsupports Bull's Eye's claim that Lee Boyd Malvo shoplifted the gun. \nThat is not in dispute. Indeed, after his arrest, I believe Malvo \nadmitted he shoplifted the gun from Bull's Eye. Although the plaintiffs \nor the family of the plaintiffs claim that Bull's Eye's lax security \npractice permitted Malvo to get the weapon, that would not establish a \nviolation of any Federal or State statute.\n  Again, a reading of this exception would say that you have to show, \nfirst, a Federal or State statute was violated, and the violation of \nthat statute was the proximate cause was reading to injury. It is \nvirtually impossible in this case.\n  What is happening in all of these exceptions that are built into the \nbill is, this is a trapdoor, if you will. We have a general prohibition \nagainst any type of suit against these individuals, these dealers, \nthese manufacturers, or trade associations; and then we have \nexceptions. And they point out within the exceptions, artfully \nconstructed by very good lawyers, provisions for an escape clause for \nthe potential defendants. Here it is, the combination of proximate \ncause and violation of Federal-State statute.\n  Again, close analysis of the evidence--and I don't think any of this \nevidence is in dispute; Malvo admitted he shoplifted the weapon--\nsuggests strongly this exception would not apply in the case of the \nBull's Eye shooter. These sniper victims will be without relief. That \nis not just my view but the view of attorneys who have looked at it \nvery carefully.\n  Now, this is a very detailed legal analysis. But, again, we so \noften--all of us--appeal to rather common, homely--in a literal sense--\nillustrations, something with which we are comfortable. I was struck \nwhen the Senator from Idaho talked about, Goodness gracious, if someone \nstole a car off a lot and drove into another car and caused damage, \nthat you could not hold that dealer responsible.\n  Well, I can conceive of a situation. For example, if a dealer \nordinarily left the keys in all of the cars on his lot, and they were \ncited 15 or 20 times before for doing that, and people knew that the \ndealer's cars were available, and young kids came in and jumped into a \ncar and drove off at 60 miles an hour careening into another car and \nkilling someone, I will tell you what I think. You have a pretty good \nsuit against that automobile dealer for negligence, for abandoning the \ncare that any other dealer in the country would adopt. They would not \nbe protected from a suit as we propose to protect the gun industry.\n  Again, this legislation is very troubling to me. I do not think it \nprovides adequate protections for people who have legitimate claims, \nthe most graphic example of which is the sniper victims in the \nWashington, DC, area. But they are not alone. Danny Guzman was killed \nin Worcester, MA, as a result of what I think is gross negligence. A \ngun manufacturer employed, without background checks, ex-convicts, drug \naddicts, allowing them to steal weapons from the production inventory \nof the company, and to sell them to criminals in exchange for cash and \ndrugs. This involved a multiple of weapons. They got the weapons out of \nthe factory before they could stamp the serial numbers on them. Again, \ncommon sense would say: My goodness gracious, somebody has to be able \nto go in and require that employer to be conscious of their weapons, \ntheir security procedures.\n  I also understand--and again it is an understanding that is not \nshaped by a footnote at the moment--there are really no effective State \nor Federal laws about the security of weapons. I do not think there is \nany requirement specifying you have to have triple locks or double \nlocks, et cetera. I think that is left to the reasonable business \nstandards of an individual dealer. Again, if we do not have those rules \nand regulations or they are not effective, how do we then insist we \ncannot have a negligence action, as this legislation proposes?\n  For these reasons and many others I reiterate my opposition to the \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Hope springs eternal that we might, sometime in the late \nof the afternoon--I guess it is now described as early evening--see a \nunanimous consent agreement that would take us into tomorrow and the \nremainder of the week as to how we are able to move to and deal with S. \n1805 and its amendments.\n  I am going to respond only briefly to what my colleague has just said \nbecause I am not an attorney and I am not going to attempt to outlawyer \nthe lawyers. Mr. Cutler is a fine lawyer. There are many other fine \nlawyers who disagree with Mr. Cutler. It is not our job to outlawyer \nthe lawyers, but it is our job to write law as clearly as we can and \nthen allow judges, listening to\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\nthe arguments of lawyers as they relate to how a given situation might \nfit in a suit, to make the determination as to the applicability of the \nlaw.\n  Now, having said that, I would like to refer to another lawyer. Is he \nas recognized as is Mr. Cutler? No, probably not. But this does come \nfrom the Congressional Research Service, and it is one of those \nservices that we utilize. The Senator has, I think, the same work \nproduct I have. We are talking about the Daschle-Craig-Baucus amendment \nthat Senator Daschle came to the floor to speak to a few moments ago.\n\n       The Daschle-Craig-Baucus Amendment would strike ``knowingly \n     and willfully'' in the preceding sentence--\n\n  That we are talking about--\n\n       potentially increasing the likelihood that [certain \n     exceptions] to the general immunity afforded under the [law] \n     would be applicable in any given case.\n\n  They looked at it in relationship to the Bull's Eye case to which the \nSenator was referring.\n  Now, these are not my words. I am not this good. I am not an \nattorney. But I do listen to them, and I seek out their advice when it \ncomes to writing law and making sure that it is clear and unambiguous.\n  They cite two examples and they say:\n\n       Applying these changes to the scenario at issue--\n\n  We are talking about Bull's Eye--\n\n       it would appear that the Amendment could have the effect of \n     making it more likely that this exception to immunity would \n     be applicable, if certain facts are established.\n\n  ``If certain facts are established.'' Those facts have not yet been \nestablished. They were not established for Attorney Cutler. He is \nsimply looking at the broad presence of the law, or application of it, \nas are we.\n  If certain facts are established in an investigation and charges are \nbrought against an owner, then we believe our amendment clarifies and \ndoes not provide the immunity, if those facts are established.\n  Now, the changes we are talking about are twofold:\n\n       (I) any case in which the manufacturer or seller knowingly \n     made any false entry in, or failed to make appropriate entry \n     in, any record which he is required to keep pursuant to State \n     or Federal law--\n\n  If weapons are stolen and they fail to note it, fail to report it to \nthe police, that fits that area--\n\n       or aided, abetted or conspired with any person in making \n     any false or fictitious oral or written statement with \n     respect to any fact material to the lawfulness or the sale or \n     other disposition of a qualified product.\n  ``Other disposition''--theft. At least this is my interpretation now. \nI am not a lawyer. Secondly:\n\n       [A]ny case in which the manufacturer or seller aided, \n     abetted or conspired with any other person to sell or \n     otherwise dispose of a qualified product, knowing or having \n     reasonable cause to believe that the actual buyer of the \n     qualified product was prohibited from possessing or receiving \n     a firearm or ammunition under section 922(g) or (n) of title \n     18, United States Code. . . .\n\n  That is what the Congressional Research Service says. Then it draws \nthat conclusion I gave earlier:\n\n       Applying these changes to the scenario at issue--\n\n  That is what the Daschle-Craig-Baucus amendment does. ``The scenario \nat issue,'' the arguments put forth, the concern about somehow, if the \nfacts are established, this firearms dealer being immune by S. 1805--\n\n     it would appear that the Amendment could have the effect--\n\n  The amendment is in large part incorporated in S. 1805 now, and \nSenator Daschle is going to offer another amendment that we know will \nbe accepted and will clarify it even more--\n\n     of making it more likely that this exception to immunity \n     would be applicable, [again] if certain facts are \n     established.\n\n  That is the argument at hand. We can trade arguments of attorneys. We \nwill place all these kinds of things in the Record so our colleagues \ncan understand them and hopefully sort them out, but it is my opinion \nthat we are not exempting this formerly licensed gun dealer who has now \nhad his license revoked. Because if an investigation goes forward, and \ncharges are filed against him, I believe we have clearly not granted \nhim immunity under S. 1805 if it, in fact, becomes law. I do believe \nthat is the strength of our argument, and one that certainly is \nbelieved to be what we represent here. It is certainly from the \nCongressional Research Service, which has very active attorneys who \ndeal constantly with the law as we shape it and form it and look at \narguments that are placed out there in the public arena in relation to \nthe legislation that we bring before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I recognize there are different legal \ninterpretations. I recognize also the Senator from Idaho has introduced \nan interpretation of the Congressional Research Service. I have one, \ntoo. Theirs is dated November 3, 2003. Mine is dated October 20, 2003. \nWe made a request. They looked at the amendment, the perfecting \namendment offered by Senators Craig, Daschle, and Baucus. In the \ncontext of that correcting amendment, they opined in October:\n\n       Again, you have specifically inquired as to whether the \n     Amendment would alter the bill to such a degree as to allow \n     the pursuit of a civil action against the gun dealer from \n     whom the weapon used in the D.C.-area sniper shootings was \n     stolen. A review of federal and Washington State law \n     indicates that there are no statutory requirements regarding \n     the storage and security of firearms by licensed firearm \n     dealers. Accordingly, it seems evident that there would be no \n     basis for the application for this exception in the case at \n     hand, irrespective of the presence of the ``knowing and \n     willfully'' requirement, given that there appears to be no \n     violation of a relevant underlying federal or state statute.\n\n  That is an October CRS.\n  Obviously a second opinion was sought. That is the nature of legal \nopinions many times. This opinion was premised on certain facts that \nare not yet obvious and perhaps never to be obvious.\n  In fact, in reference in the report Senator Craig referred to:\n\n       Thus, in the event that it is established that Bull's Eye \n     was aware that the firearm was missing from its inventory \n     more than 48 hours prior to November 5, 2002, the Amendment \n     would appear to lend further support to the application of \n     the exception to immunity . . . of the bill.\n\n  Essentially what was done in this latest CRS was to say: We will \nassume hypothetically that in fact they violated the Federal statute, \ni.e., the requirement to report a weapon within 48 hours of its \ndisappearance. Well, if you assume a violation of the statute, you have \ngotten way over the curve, because once again, Federal statute or State \nstatute has to be violated, proximate cause.\n  The problem is this assumption does not have much of an evidentiary \nbase. The footnote to the report Senator Craig referred to suggests:\n\n       These examples are pertinent to the extent--\n\nexamples of potential violations--\n\n     they could be implicated in any hypothetical sale or transfer \n     to the D.C.-area sniper suspects. It should be noted, \n     however, that it does not appear that any evidence has been \n     produced of actual violations of these provisions by Bull's \n     Eye in the case at hand.\n\n  The answer to qualifying this exemption is not to assume a violation \nof Federal law. There has to be some evidence. But there does not \nappear to be any evidence of violations of Federal statutes. There are \nno Federal/State statutes with respect to security of firearms, the \nphysical security. The slender reed--no pun intended--they might hang \nit upon is they somehow knew the weapon was missing a long time before \nNovember 5, 2002, and they failed to report it. No evidence from Malvo \nsuggests that. I don't know if there is, frankly. The stories we have \nall heard from the operator were he didn't know the weapons were \nmissing until the day they showed up, the ATF showed up and said the \nweapons were missing. The practical effect of this is a judge might \nhave the opportunity for a few minutes to look at this record, but \nwhere is the evidence?\n\n  The practical effect of this legislation is these claims will be \nbarred. That would be a great misfortune, not only for the families \ninvolved but a misfortune in terms of setting up a very bad precedent \nin terms of undermining the common law sense of responsibility for your \nactions. Senator Craig is a very articulate advocate for his position \nand has referred to that several times; this is just about maintaining \ncenturies of legal precedent about individual responsibility. I \ndisagree. I think it is about overturning centuries of legal precedent, \nthe precedent that an individual is responsible\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\nfor their actions, that an individual, such as the licensee at Bull's \nEye, is responsible for not securing the weapons, is responsible for \nnot knowing he has lost weapons--according to his view at this point--\nfor days and weeks and weeks. If we immunize the individual, we will \nundercut that basic principle of individual responsibility.\n  One of the things I find amazing in this whole discussion of the \nsecurity of weapons is, I commanded a paratrooper company at Fort \nBragg. I worried every day about the weapons in my outfit. We had \ndouble locks on the doors, locks on the racks, individual accounting \nevery day of weapons. One of the things that as a young airborne \ncaptain you are worried about was showing up one day and discovering a \nweapon or part of a weapon or even equipment associated with a weapon \nwas missing. That was a big deal. That is a standard of the United \nStates Army.\n  We are telling people who maintain large arsenals in commercial \nvenues that the standard for them is nothing. Miss a few weapons, don't \neven pay attention because, frankly, knowledge will hurt you.\n  This goes also to the principle of why we have laws of negligence, \ntort laws. It is not just for individual compensation. That is an \nimportant part of giving an individual the right to make themselves \nwhole after they have been harmed. It is something else. It is about \nhaving a system of standards that are self-enforcing, not because there \nare ATF agents walking around, but because in addition to that, an \nowner of one of these stores will simply say: You know, I better make \nsure all these weapons are accounted for at least every week. I better \nmake sure they are secure. I better make sure if people walk in who \nmight not be eligible to purchase a weapon I at least ask them what \nthey are doing. None of that appears to be done.\n  In response to the specific question of the application of the \nexemption, I think the proponents have tried all they can to dress it \nup. It just doesn't work. There is a huge trapdoor when you put \ntogether violation of State or Federal statute and that violation \ncauses proximate cause.\n  Someone could go in and show they didn't file the records properly. \nThat is a violation of Federal and State regulation. They could show \nperhaps they were lax in some other capacity. Then you have to make the \nfurther showing that violation was directly connected. So literally in \nthis case you are going to have to show that particular weapon that \nfound its way into Malvo's hands was the subject or involved with a \nspecific violation of Federal/State law. That is why this CRS report \nhas to assume that particular weapon, of all the 248, was noted as \nmissing more than 48 hours before November 5, 2002. That is an extra \nburden of proof. That is, again, why I don't think this will work for \nthe victims of these crimes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we hope we are narrowing down to a time \nwhen we will have a unanimous consent request which then--and I can't \njudge this yet--might conclude our efforts today. We will be back early \ntomorrow morning to resume. I thank my colleague for his arguments. We \nare not going to try this case here on the floor of the Senate because \nwe don't have a judge. I am not a lawyer. He is; I am not. But I would \nalso ask him to look at another provision we have in the bill as he \nargues the case. That is that a lawsuit could also be allowed under the \nbill's exception allowing actions for negligence per se or for \nnegligent entrustment, depending on, of course, the condition of the \ndealer and the dealer's knowledge, if any, of the suspects.\n  Having said that, let's remember to address these issues, the victim \nwould need to get his day in court. The case will be filed. The \ndefendant would file a motion to dismiss based on provisions of 1805. \nAnd if the judge--remember there is going to be the impartial judge \nweighing all the law and the findings--decides this case did not fall \nunder those exceptions, then the litigation would proceed. That is the \nessence. We are not going to argue the case effectively here because, \nfrankly, we don't know all of the facts. We are not a part of ATF's \ninvestigation, and all of those facts are not yet public. They will not \nbe public until charges are filed, a suit is brought, and that day in \ncourt I just spoke of is at hand.\n  Obviously, the Senator and I can disagree on what the meanings are, \nbut I do believe the arguments we put forth are extremely valid. \nCertainly, the minority leader, myself, and others, in a very \nbipartisan fashion, have worked tremendously hard to craft this bill in \na way that is as narrow as I expressed it to be earlier in the day to \ndeal only in the protection of law-abiding dealers, law-abiding \nmanufacturers who make a legitimate product, and to deny the kind of \nlawsuits we have seen that are more intent on bankrupting the \nmanufacturer than they are in bringing resolution to or, if you will, \ndealing with the victims and rewarding them in any fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my colleague from Idaho has invited me to \nlook at the theory of negligent entrustment and negligence per se. I \nwill try to do that.\n  Again, this is not an attempt to dispose of a case before a court. \nBut we all have an obligation to understand what we are voting on, what \nthese provisions will do based on the plain language of the provisions \nand based upon the facts as we know them in certain cases. That is why \nI think this is a positive exercise. It is insufficient to say that we \npass laws, but we do not have to know what they mean because some judge \nwill figure out what they mean. No, no, I think we have to know what \nthey mean because that should drive our decision about whether this \nlegislation will pass or fail.\n  Let me turn for a moment to these two theories of negligent \nentrustment/negligence per se.\n  Negligent entrustment is generally understood as ``the supplying of a \nqualified product by a seller for use by another person when the seller \nknows, or should know, the person to whom the product is supplied is \nlikely to, and does, use the product in a manner involving unreasonable \nrisk of physical injury to the person or others.''\n  Again, the seller has to know, or is likely to know, that the person \nthey transfer the weapon to or supplied it to is likely to harm himself \nor harm someone else.\n  The problem we have with respect to the sniper case is that the \nevidence the snipers' weapon was shoplifted from Bull's Eye would \nappear to preclude the plaintiffs from making the requisite showing \nunder the statute that the gunshop knew or should have known that the \nrecipient of the gun, Malvo, was likely to use the product in a \ncriminal or otherwise unreasonably dangerous manner.\n\n  Malvo indicated he shoplifted the weapon. The owner said he must have \ntaken it. He didn't know it was missing until ATF showed up.\n  The theory of negligent entrustment is fancy-sounding terminology, \nbut it is another trapdoor from which the exception falls out.\n  Negligence per se, under most--I am a lawyer, but I am hesitant to \nsay I am a lawyer who is familiar in every detail with Federal \npractice, but my assumption is since we are talking about Federal and \nState laws, this negligence per se is a State common law concept that \nwould apply to the laws of Washington State because that is where the \nBull's Eye shooting gallery is located.\n  In any event, with respect to negligence per se, it would not \npreserve the sniper case because even where that doctrine is \nrecognized, it requires a violation of statute that is a proximate \ncause of the plaintiff's injury. Once again, you have to show not only \nthe violation but that violation of that particular law was a proximate \ncause of injury. As discussed above--again I am borrowing from one of \nthese legal analyses--that would be very difficult to show. In fact, \nalso I think there is another problem in Washington State about the \ndoctrine of negligence per se.\n  The negligence per se doctrine has been abrogated by statute in \nWashington State. It doesn't apply.\n  Once again, I think we have an exception that does not provide relief \nfor these individuals.\n  I conclude by joining my colleague in hoping we have some resolution \nsoon on the procedural process for this evening and tomorrow. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, after consultation, we have reached a \nunanimous consent agreement which I will now propound.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow morning the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1805; that Senator Daschle then be \nrecognized to offer his perfecting amendment; that there be 30 minutes \nequally divided for debate on his amendment; that at the conclusion or \nyielding back of time the Senate, without any intervening action or \ndebate, vote on the Daschle amendment; that upon the disposition of \nthat amendment Senator Boxer be recognized to offer a gun lock \namendment; further, that following 30 minutes of debate equally divided \nin the usual form Senator DeWine be recognized to offer a relevant \nsecond degree under the same conditions; further, that following the \nuse of time the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the second \ndegree to be followed by a vote in relation to the underlying \namendment.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that following those votes Senator \nCampbell be recognized in order to offer an amendment regarding \nconceal-carry and that there be 60 minutes equally divided in the usual \nform with no second degrees in order; provided that following that time \nthe amendment be set aside and Senator Kennedy be recognized to offer \nan amendment on ``cop-killer'' bullets with 60 minutes equally decided, \nand that there be no second degrees in order, and that following that \ntime the amendment be set aside.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that Senator Cantwell then be \nrecognized to offer her unemployment extension amendment; that there be \n60 minutes for debate equally divided on her amendment and it then be \nlaid aside; that no second-degree amendments be in order to her \namendment; further, that Senator Frist or his designee then be \nrecognized in order to offer an amendment relating to voting rights and \nthat there then be 60 minutes of debate equally divided with no \namendments to the amendment; provided further that the Senate then \nproceed to vote in relation to the Cantwell and Frist amendments in \nthat order, and that if either amendment fails to receive 60 votes, the \namendment be withdrawn or fall due to a pending point of order.\n\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Mikulski then be recognized \nto offer her amendment on snipers with 40 minutes equally divided in \nthe usual form, to be followed by a vote in relation to the amendment, \nto be followed by an amendment offered by Senator Corzine on law \nenforcement officers for 30 minutes equally divided in the usual form, \nto be followed by a vote in relation to the amendment, to be followed \nby an amendment by Senator Bingaman on definition, with 30 minutes \nequally divided in the usual form, to be followed by a vote in relation \nto the amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following each of the Boxer, \nKennedy, Mikulski, Bingaman, Corzine amendments it be in order for \nSenator Frist or his designee to offer a first-degree amendment that \nwould be relevant to the mentioned amendments and limited under the \nsame time constraints; and that the possible Frist amendment on ``cop-\nkiller'' bullets be set aside after time has expired or yielded on the \namendment; and that the possible Frist amendments would be voted on \nprior to the respective Democratic amendments; that on Tuesday morning \nat 9:30 a.m. the pending amendments be withdrawn with the exception of \nthe Campbell amendment, the Kennedy amendment, and a possible amendment \nby Senator Frist regarding ``cop-killer'' bullets, if there are any \npending at the time; that Senator Reed then be recognized to offer a \ngun show amendment; that it then be immediately laid aside and Senator \nFeinstein be recognized to offer her assault weapons ban amendment, \nthat it then be set aside, and that Senator Frist or his designee be \nrecognized to offer a DC gun ban amendment; that the time prior to \n11:35 a.m. that day be equally divided for debate on all amendments \nconcurrently; that no second-degree amendments be in order to any \namendment; that at 11:35 a.m. the Senate vote on the Feinstein \namendment, followed immediately by a vote on Senator Reed's amendment, \nto be followed by a vote on the Campbell amendment, to be followed by a \nvote on the Kennedy amendment, to be followed by a vote on the District \nof Columbia ban amendment; further, that following the disposition of \nthe above amendments the bill be read the third time and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on final passage of the bill with no intervening \naction prior to those votes; that where this agreement provides for two \nor more votes in sequence there be 2 minutes for debate equally divided \nin the usual form prior to each vote; that all time for debate be \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it has obviously taken a good deal of \ntime to reach this agreement due to the complexity that is apparent as \nSenator McConnell has read it.\n  There are two matters that ought to be recognized. First, this does \nnot preclude Senators who are not listed in this unanimous consent \nagreement from offering an amendment sometime either this week or early \nnext week. Senators who have additional amendments are certainly \nwelcome to do so.\n  Second, this does not preclude those who have amendments on Tuesday \nfrom discussing and speaking to those amendments at any time between \nnow and when those amendments are raised. There was some question about \nwhether 2 hours on Tuesday for three very important amendments is \nadequate. My answer is that it is more than 2 hours if people want to \ndevote more than that time between now and the time they are offered. I \nencourage Senators who wish to speak longer to come to the floor over \nthe course of the next week to do so.\n  This is a very fair agreement. It is one that takes into account a \nlot of concerns and interests on the part of many Senators. I am \nsupportive of the agreement and hope that we can have a good debate as \na result of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I echo the comments of the Democratic leader. This \nagreement, which is quite complex, allows us to accommodate various \ninterests on both sides of the aisle but then move to final passage on \nthe underlying bill, which, of course, was the goal of the majority \nleader in bringing it up at this time. I particularly commend Senator \nCraig, who has done a marvelous job of managing this issue on our side, \nand I thank him for his important contribution in reaching this \nagreement that will allow the Senate to achieve final passage on a bill \nthat he is the principal sponsor of and that we believe a substantial \nmajority of Senators on a bipartisan basis would like to see ultimately \nbecome law.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank both the leadership on our side of the aisle \nand certainly the minority leader and the minority whip for the work \nthey have done in trying to bring this together.\n  Is this something that I wholeheartedly support? Well, let me put it \nthis way: It is something I support because it gets us to a final vote, \nwhich is very important, in a timely way.\n  But something is absent from this unanimous consent agreement that is \nvery important: to allow the underlying bill, however it is changed, to \nbecome law. That is why we are here on the floor. Not that this is how \nwe get to conference, which oftentimes is agreed to. When we craft a \nbill and arrive at a time of final passage, we almost always include in \nit the procedure by which we will get to conference.\n  I hope that our minority leader, in good faith, would work to help us \nget to that point so we can work out the differences between the House \nand the Senate. There will be differences; that is quite obvious now. \nSome of these amendments could pass. It is important we work that out.\n  We saw the underlying bill gain a substantial bipartisan majority \nsupport in the Senate, and therefore it is\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\nincumbent upon all of us, I trust, to get this bill to a conference \nbetween the House and the Senate, work out our differences so we can \nvote on a conference report and allow this underlying bill now changed \nto get to our President's desk.\n\n  Having said that, let me thank everyone for the work they have done. \nThis is a very busy schedule. But let me also echo what the minority \nleader said. It does not stop other Members who feel they must offer \namendments from bringing those to the floor. I said early on today we \nwanted an open process, amendments voted on, but at the end of the day \nwe wanted to vote on final passage. We helped facilitate that by this \nagreement, and I appreciate the work done by our leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was just reminded by floor staff that the Reed \namendment is, in fact, the McCain-Reed amendment. I ask consent that \nthe agreement we just reached be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I feel constrained to say that we have been \nin a quorum call now for 4 hours 10 minutes, but that does not take \naway from the fact that people have been working very hard during this \nentire period of time, plus earlier this day. I personally extend my \nappreciation to the two leaders, the Republican leader and the \nDemocratic leader, for working with us. Senator Frist is not on the \nfloor tonight. We have been in constant contact with him during the \nevening.\n  I also want to say that Senator Reed, my counterpart from Rhode \nIsland, has been representing those people who are extremely concerned \nabout this issue, probably 12, 15 Senators. He has been extremely \nhelpful, as he always is. He has represented his cause in the most \nefficient way. Without his cooperation and work, Senator Daschle and I \ncould not be at the point where we are today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/25/senate-section/article/S1582-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Ted Stevens,\n     President pro tempore of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Increasing armed rebellion in Haiti, \n     the limited effectiveness of the Haitian National Police, and \n     insecurity in Port-au-Prince brought on by increased armed \n     pro-government gang activity have contributed to a climate of \n     insecurity for the U.S. Embassy and its supporting facilities \n     in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. These circumstances and the \n     potential for further deterioration of the security \n     environment in Haiti render the safety of the U.S. Embassy, \n     its facilities, and U.S. personnel uncertain.\n       On February 23, 2004, a security force of approximately 55 \n     U.S. military personnel from the U.S. Joint Forces Command \n     deployed to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to augment the Embassy \n     security forces.\n       Although the U.S. forces are equipped for combat, this \n     movement was undertaken solely for the purpose of protecting \n     American citizens and property. It is anticipated that U.S. \n     forces will provide this support until such time as it is \n     determined that the security situation has stabilized and the \n     threat to the Embassy, its facilities, and U.S. personnel has \n     ended.\n       I have taken this action pursuant to my constitutional \n     authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander \n     in Chief and Chief Executive. I am providing this report as \n     part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed, consistent \n     with the War Powers Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n     George W.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to congratulate \nVirginia Schuyler, a woman from my hometown of Aberdeen, SD, who has \ndedicated her life to helping those in need. Virginia is the recipient \nof South Dakota's 2003 Outstanding Older Worker Award, an honor \nbestowed by Experience Works, an organization committed to improving \nthe lives of seniors in South Dakota through quality job training and \nemployment programs.\n  Virginia decided early on that she wanted to be a nurse. From a very \nyoung age, Virginia knew she wanted to travel. When her mother told her \nthat nurses travel on boats and planes, her mind was made up. For 60 \nyears she has been a registered nurse, and she has traveled all over \nthe world. For the past 5 years, Virginia, 81, has cared for residents \nat the Bethesda Towne Square, an assisted living facility. The \nresidents there deeply appreciate her dedication--she insists on \nworking every weekend--as well as everything she does for them, \nactivities that range from bringing them hot tea at night to painting \nstained-glass windows for the residents in her spare time.\n  Virginia earned an RN degree in 1943. She joined the U.S. Army, \nserving in England, France, and Germany, and recalls treating as many \nas 500 patients daily from the Normandy invasion in France. After her \ndischarge from the Army, she stayed in Germany, where her volunteer \nwork at an orphanage led her to adopt two children who were on the \nbrink of starvation. In 1954, she earned an RN in Pathology degree, the \nequivalent of a master's degree, from St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank, \nCA.\n  After she earned her pathology degree, Virginia worked in pathology \nfor 7 years at St. Joseph's Hospital, and at St. Luke's Hospital in \nAberdeen for 25 years. She also spent 5 years working with Alzheimer's \npatients at Arcadia in Aberdeen. Today, in addition to her work at \nBethesda Towne Square, Virginia works between 30 and 50 hours a week on \nher stained-glass window business, and acts as her church secretary.\n  I join Virginia's many admirers in congratulating her on receiving \nthis prestigious and well-deserved award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/25/senate-section/article/S1582-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1582-S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, over recent months, aggressive rhetoric \nhas escalated across the Taiwan Strait. In response to Taiwanese \nPresident Chen Shui-bian's pledge to hold a nationwide referendum ``to \ndemand that the Taiwan Strait issue be resolved through peaceful \nmeans,'' Chinese officials have threatened the use of force. Prime \nMinister Wen Jiabao of the People's Republic of China has stated that \nChina will ``crush'' any attempts by Taiwan to seek independence and \nthat it will ``pay any price to safeguard the unity of the \nmotherland.'' In addition on November 20, 2003, PRC Major General Wang \nZaixi was quoted saying that ``the use of force may become \nunavoidable'' in dealing with Taiwan. On February 11, 2004, Chinese \nofficials stated the referendum would ``provoke confrontation.''\n  Threats of violence by the People's Republic of China only undermine \nefforts to resolve longstanding China-Taiwan tensions. Intimidation and \nwarnings of bloodshed have taken the place of constructive dialogue. I \nfear that these threats will only intensify as Taiwan's presidential \nelections on March 20, 2004, draw nearer.\n  In the midst of this bellicose rhetoric, I express my support for the \npeople of Taiwan and to compliment the Taiwanese people and their \nleadership for the great strides they have made in strengthening their \ndemocracy. Since 2000, with the first peaceful transfer of power from \none political party to another in Taiwan's history, Taiwan's democracy \nhas thrived. The U.S. State Department's annual Human Rights Reports \nfor 2002 reported that the government of Taiwan largely respected the \nindependence of both the judiciary and press in practice and stated, \n``Taiwan's strides were also notable, with consolidation and \nimprovement of civil liberties catching up to its free and open \nelectoral system.'' Transparency International has ranked Taiwan's\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\neconomy as one of the five least corrupt in Asia; and Freedom House \nlabeled Taiwan ``free'' in 2003 with an improvement in political rights \nsince 2002. President Chen Shui-bian has also demonstrated a commitment \nto human rights and is credited with solidifying a place for human \nrights within Taiwanese society during his presidency. The Human Rights \nAdvisory Committee, established by Chen in 2000, is currently in the \nprocess of creating a National Human Rights Commission that will serve \nas the highest institution in Taiwan for the protection and promotion \nof human rights.\n  I remain committed to protecting the civil and political rights of \nthe people of Taiwan, and I support Taiwan's inclusion in international \norganizations, such as in the World Health Organization, WHO. The \nrecent SARS and avian flu outbreaks highlight the importance of giving \nthe people of Taiwan a voice in these organizations. I agree with \nclaims by Taiwanese authorities that it is inhumane for the \ninternational community to deny the people of Taiwan access to WHO's \nmedical data and assistance. Unfortunately, despite congressional \nefforts, Taiwan has still not been granted observer status. This should \nchange in the coming year.\n  I fear that provocative statements will have dangerous repercussions \nin this region of the world. Rather than warn and provoke, I hope that \nthe governments of China and Taiwan will engage in a more constructive \ndialogue and encourage increased cross-strait people to people \nlinkages. I support a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan-China \nsituation, and I will continue to support policies that keep cross-\nstrait tensions in check.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/25/senate-section/article/S1583-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable to our society.\n  Last fall in Portland, ME, Joshua Nisbet pulled up in a car near a \nbar that caters to the gay community. Nisbet and a friend yelled an \nantigay slur at two men walking nearby and assaulted them.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/25/senate-section/article/S1583-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PETER VLCKO, HUMANITARIAN\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I note with sadness the passing of Peter \nVlcko, a hero for all of humanity. When immense love and bravery \ncoalesce in one person, as they did in Mr. Vlcko, amazing things are \nbound to happen.\n  And they did.\n  Mr. Vlcko's love for humankind manifested itself in his brave fight \nagainst evils such as totalitarianism, fascism, and anti-Semitism. \nDuring the dark days of World War II, at huge and constant risk to his \nown life, he fought against the pro-German Slovak Government and \nrescued over 20 Jews from deportation and death by the Nazis.\n  His heroic efforts have not gone unnoticed. Among other awards and \nrecognitions, in 1981, Mr. Vlcko received the Silver Medal for \nRighteous Gentiles from Israel. With descendants of the Jews he saved \nlooking on, he stood witness as a tree was planted in his honor at the \ntop of a hill in Jerusalem. His name has also been forever memorialized \nin a large granite relief in the Garden of the Righteous at the \nHolocaust Memorial center in West Bloomfield.\n  Born in a Slovak village in 1912, Mr. Vlcko volunteered for military \nservice immediately upon completion of his secondary education. He rose \nquickly through the ranks until the invasion and occupation of \nCzechoslovakia by the German military in 1939 forced him to be disarmed \nand reassigned to a war college in Bratislava. He took a break from his \nstudies to serve a tour of duty on the Russian front, but his service \nwas cut short when he sustained shrapnel wounds and an injury to his \nleft leg from the heavy mortar fire. Returning to his studies, he met \nhis future wife, Georgina Reichsfeld.\n  The strict anti-Semitic laws could not deter his love for Georgina, \nwho was of Jewish ancestry. At a risk to Mr. Vlcko's life, the two \nentered into wedlock.\n  As the danger to his young bride and her family mounted, he hid them \nuntil he could obtain false identification papers. His perilous efforts \ndid not stop with his bride's family. He continued on, obtaining false \npapers for twenty other Jews, which identified them as ``essential \npersonnel,'' preventing certain deportation and death.\n  Summoning more courage still, Mr. Vlcko offered his assistance to an \nattempt to overthrow the Nazi-friendly regime in Slovakia. Through a \nvariety of disguises, such as a shoemaker and a woman, Mr. Vlcko \nmanaged to evade German forces and twice to escape capture. Forced into \nhiding for the remainder of the war, he was separated from his family \nfor a year when he escaped into Bavaria.\n  Once reunited, Mr. Vlcko and his family immigrated to the United \nStates, where they began a new life in Michigan. After attending a \ncommunity college, he went to work for Ford Motor Company.\n  His new surroundings, however, could not make him forget his violent \npast. Through his narrative, he tried to educate people on the horrors \nof fascism and anti-Semitism. To do so, he both lectured throughout the \nUnited States and Canada and published an 860-page autobiography. \nPeople needed to know and, thanks to him, we do.\n  In 1991, Mr. Vlcko was granted honorary Israeli citizenship, and both \nhe and his wife regained their Czechoslovakia citizenship, which was \ntaken from them when they fled Czechoslovakia after the Communists \nseized power in the 1948 coup. In fact, he had been living under a \ndeath sentence issued by the Czech government until 1989. He has been \nhonored by the Czech President and Czech Minister of Defense and has \noften been the guest of honor of the Czech and Slovak Ambassadors to \nthe United States.\n  Mr. Vlcko is survived by his wife, Georgina, and their four children. \nDespite what severe images a background as a soldier might evoke, his \nwife affectionately describes the full picture: ``He loved his family \nvery much and worked his whole life to keep them safe.''\n  Mr. Vlcko left behind more than a family, however; he left behind a \nlegacy of love and hope embodied in the children of the Jews he saved \nand an outstanding example of courage and decency in the face of \ndarkness and tyranny.\n  It is that legacy that I am sure will surround him as he rests in \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/25/senate-section/article/S1583-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  HONORING THE SERVICE OF BRENDA COWAN\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I would like to take the \nopportunity to honor the service of Ms. Brenda Cowan, originally of \nSturgis, KY. Her death while performing her duty as a firefighter is a \ngreat loss to us all.\n  On February 13, 2004 Brenda was responding to a domestic violence \ncall. Tragically, Brenda and the person she was trying to help were \nshot and killed while waiting for police to arrive on the scene.\n  Her service with the Lexington, KY fire department was exemplary and \nduly appreciated. Brenda was also a pioneer. She was the first African \nAmerican woman to become a firefighter in Lexington. As one of the U.S. \nSenators from Kentucky, I know that Brenda served as a fine example of \nwhat it means to serve one's community.\n  We are humbled and honored by the sacrifice Brenda has made. Without \nmen and women such as Brenda, America would not be as great as it is \nnow. Lexington and Kentucky are truly lucky to have benefited from her \nfine service. She is an example to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/25/senate-section/article/S1583-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1583-S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING SY AND ESTELLE OPPER\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Sy and Estelle's \nextraordinary dedication to helping others is worthy of this special \nrecognition.\n  The Oppers have an exceptional history of humanitarian work. They \nprovided goods and services to their community as owners of five \nplumbing supply stores and shared their success and time with deserving \ncauses close to their hearts.\n  In addition to traveling to Israel for several missions, the Oppers \nare long-time members of American Israel Public Affairs Committee, \nAIPAC. Sy and Estelle are major donors and participants and helped the \nJewish Federation purchase the property and building where Shalom \nSchool, Sacramento's only Jewish Day School, is located. Sy Opper has \nserved as president of the board for several Jewish organizations, \nincluding the Jewish Federation and B'nei Israel Congregation, and is \ncurrently serving on the board of the Trust Fund for the Jewish Elderly \nand the Jewish Family Service Board. Estelle Opper has also been active \nin many Jewish organizations such as Hadassah, TDX, Sisterhood, Jewish \nFamily Service and the Grandparents Club at Shalom School.\n  Children's and health causes have also been a priority for the \nOppers. Sy has personally contributed and organized fund raising for \nthe Washington Neighborhood Center of Sacramento. This center provides \nafter-school programs that include performing arts classes and tutoring \nto at-risk children and teens. Estelle has supported and helped raise \nfunds for the Breast Cancer Fund of San Francisco and the River Oaks \nCenter for Children, a multi-service behavioral healthcare agency for \nabused children and their families.

Mr. President, I want to speak about a great \nveteran of the U.S. Army, Mr. Lynn Austin Monroe. Mr. Monroe is a World \nWar II veteran who honorably and proudly served his country in the \nEuropean Theater as a mess sergeant in the Sixth Field Hospital. Prior \nto his overseas duty, he was an instructor in the Bakers and Cooks \nschool at Camp Pickett, VA. Major Reiber said Sergeant Monroe was the \nbest instructor he ever had. From there he was sent to be the first \nmess sergeant to open the Finney General Hospital, Thomasville, GA. His \nnext assignment was the transfer to England to serve as mess sergeant \nfor the Sixth Field Hospital. He remained in that capacity until the \nwar's end.\n  Oftentimes he had to prepare meals without notice to feed a company \nof soldiers instead of a squadron. On one occasion, a hungry soldier \ncame to Sergeant Monroe, who asked for a second helping of meat, which \nwas chicken that day. The soldier said, ``The chicken is so good, it \nain't nothing but a Georgia bird, anyway.'' Wish granted. That was one \nhappy soldier. In emergency situations, the Sixth Field Hospital \nkitchen staff would help unload patients who were flown in from the \ncombat zone. Sergeant Monroe's joy as a serviceman in ``The Greatest \nGeneration'' was feeding the Army of our great country as they fought \nto save freedom and democracy for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/25/senate-section/article/S1584-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING FREDERICK AND MARY ANN LIPPITT OF PROVIDENCE, RI\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

A bill to prohibit racial profiling by Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement agencies; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today, Senator Breaux and I introduced \na bill entitled the ``Uniting Neighborhoods and Individuals to \nEliminate Racial Profiling Act of 2004'' (UNITE) that I believe will \nput us on the road to preventing problems caused by racial profiling \nand help begin reconciliation in communities torn apart by racial \nunrest.\n  Rooted in the belief that education and dialogue are the most \neffective tools for bridging racial divides, our bill bans racial \nprofiling by Federal, State and local law enforcement officers. Our \nbill also provides important new tools to help law enforcement leaders \ntrain their officers in eliminating the practice, including the \ncreation of a National Task Force on Racial Profiling within the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, a Racial Profiling Education and Awareness \nProgram, a nondiscriminatory State-based administrative complaint \nprocedure that allows individuals to file complaints with the State, \nand a grant program to assist State and local law enforcement agencies \nin developing programs to eliminate racial profiling.\n  I am personally aware of this issue because of the time I spent as \nMayor of Cleveland. I worked for 10 years to promote understanding and \npositive race relations, and my work there has spurred me to continue \non this path at the national level. We've heard all too often of \nsituations in cities and towns across the country in which poor race \nrelations are creating serious divisions between communities and law \nenforcement agencies. Despite the shared interest we all have in \nfighting crime and making neighborhoods safer, mistrust and wariness \noften stands in the way of cooperation.\n  To name just a few examples: A January 21, 2004 state study of racial \nprofiling in Massachusetts has found that minority drivers are \ndisproportionately ticketed and searched by police officers in dozens \nof communities, including Boston. According to a joint study completed \nby the Council on Crime and Justice (CCJ) and the Institute on Race & \nPoverty (IRP) at the University of Minnesota Law School and released on \nSeptember 24, 2003, African-American, Latino and to a lesser extent \nAmerican-Indian motorists are stopped and their cars searched at rates \nsignificantly greater than white motorists. The study found that racial \nprofiling is widespread throughout Minnesota and cuts across urban, \nsuburban and rural police boundaries. In February, 2004, a study was \nreleased by the Steward Research Group analyzing data from 413 Texas \nlaw enforcement agencies. The study found that based on racial \ndisparities in stop and search rates, there is a pattern of racial \nprofiling by law enforcement agencies across Texas.\n  While studies such as these are not widespread among the States, I do \nbelieve these results, along with many other cases clearly indicate \nthat we have a nationwide problem. And while the overwhelming number of \npolice officers discharge their duties professionally and without bias, \nI think we need to address those that do not.\n  As I mentioned before, my experience as Mayor of Cleveland and \nGovernor of Ohio has taught me that reaching the hearts and minds of \npeople is the most effective means of dealing with intolerance and the \nproblems that result.\n  As mayor of Cleveland I established the city's first urban coalition, \nthe Cleveland Roundtable, to bring together representatives of the \nCity's various racial, religious and economic groups to create a common \nagenda. When we found that members of the police department weren't \nreceiving proper diversity training, we completely revised the police \nacademy program, establishing sensitivity training for all Cleveland \npolice officers and creating six police district community relations \ncommittees to open lines of communication between police officers and \ncommunity members. We eventually put all City employees through this \ndiversity training, and you know what? It worked.\n  As governor, in my first State of the State Address I said, ``We must \nnever forget that the infrastructure of good race relations and human \nunderstanding is more important than any roads or bridges we might \nbuild.'' We launched efforts to increase community outreach by law \nenforcement in order to foster a cooperative, rather than adversarial, \nrelationship between citizens and law enforcement. Through our biannual \n``Governor's Challenge,'' conferences I worked to bring members of \nlocal communities together with law enforcement officials and members \nof the business community in order to educate and break down barriers \nthat lead to intolerance. We recognized and shared ``best practices'' \nprocedures so that communities could benefit from the success of \nothers--all with an emphasis on rewarding those that are doing a good \njob. We made wonderful progress and outstanding communities were \nrecognized for their efforts.\n  As I said earlier, the overwhelming majority of state and local law \nenforcement agents throughout the nation discharge their duties \nprofessionally and justly. I salute them for their dedication efforts \nin what is one of America's toughest jobs. It is unfortunate that the \nmisdeeds of a minute few have such a corrosive effect on the police-\ncommunity relationship. Based on my experiences in Ohio--10 years as \nMayor of Cleveland and 8 years as Governor of Ohio, I know what works. \nThrough education and dialogue we can help turn situations around so \nthat groups who\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\nonce thought they had little in common can realize how much they \nactually have to gain by working together to make our communities safer \nplaces to live.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nVoinovich, to introduce the Uniting Neighborhoods and Individuals to \nEnd Racial Profiling Act, also known as the UNITE Act.\n  In the fall of 2002, there was a meeting in my office with a number \nof African-American leaders from Louisiana. They told me that the \nsingle most important issue they want to resolve is racial profiling.\n  I turned to Senator Voinovich, who has been a leader on this in Ohio \nand in the Senate, to come up with the first, truly bipartisan racial \nprofiling bill to be introduced in the Senate. After more than a year \nof hard work, we have finally come up with a bill that meaningfully \nresponds to the issue of racial profiling while striking the right \nbalance between the concerns of law enforcement and the minority \ncommunity. Most importantly, our UNITE Act will begin to end racial \nprofiling in this country.\n  This bill strives to fix the real incidents of racial profiling \nthrough education, public outreach and oversight. It also combats the \nperception that law enforcement is engaging in racial biased policing. \nBy banning racial profiling, putting safeguards in place and providing \nthe public with a meaningful complaint procedure, this bill responds to \nthe concerns of minority communities and hopefully helps rebuild their \ntrust in law enforcement agencies.\n  I believe we have crafted the first, reasonable and passable solution \nto the issue of racial profiling.\n  I hope as we unveil this legislation publically for the first time \ntoday, that both the civil rights and law enforcement communities will \nsee this bill as a good starting point to find a solution to this \nserious problem. I look forward to working with my colleagues, law \nenforcement and the civil rights community to get this legislation \npassed and signed by the President this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 2113. A bill to amend part C of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to prohibit the comparative cost adjustment (CCA) program from \noperating in the State of Michigan; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with \nmy distinguished colleague, Senator Carl Levin, that would protect my \nState of Michigan from being forced to participate in an experiment \nthat could lead to the unraveling of Medicare as we know it.\n  This project, mandated under the Medicare reform bill approved in \nlate 2003, effectively replaces Medicare in the designated \ndemonstration area with private voucher coverage in six sites in 2010. \nI have strongly opposed the portion of the Medicare bill that \nauthorizes this project, and I particularly oppose Michigan seniors \nbeing forced to participate in this ill-advised experiment.\n  If Michigan is included in one of these areas, then older and sicker \nseniors who want to stay in traditional Medicare will be forced to pay \nhigher premiums. This is wrong, and my bill will stop this from \nhappening to my constituents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2114. A bill to amend part C of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to prohibit the comparative cost adjustment (CCA) program from \noperating in the State of New Mexico; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would prohibit the comparative cost adjustment (CCA) or premium \nsupport demonstration that was included in the Medicare prescription \ndrug bill last year from operating in the State of New Mexico.\n  There are many problems with the demonstration that I will describe \nwhich will have the result of fundamentally undermining the traditional \nMedicare program and directly conflicts with the President's commitment \nin his State of the Union address in 2003 when he said, ``Seniors happy \nwith the current Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage \njust the way it is.'' That would not be the case in what is being \nreferred to as the comparative cost adjustment program.\n  What is the comparative cost adjustment program? Starting in 2010, \nthe Medicare prescription drug bill provided for a six-year \ndemonstration in selected demonstration sites where private health \nplans and traditional Medicare would supposedly compete on the basis of \nprice. The demonstration will be conducted in up to six metropolitan \nareas in which at least 25 percent of eligible beneficiaries are \nenrolled in some type of managed care plan.\n  Albuquerque, NM, already has an enrollment in private plans that \nexceeds 25 percent and so would obviously be a targeted community for \nthe demonstration. Santa Fe, NM, could also be on the demonstration \nlist by 2010 as its current reported managed care enrollment is at 17 \npercent and that is why Congressman Tom Udall is joining us here today \nin introducing the companion bill in the House of Representatives.\n  Congressman Udall and I oppose our Medicare beneficiaries being \nsubjected to a grand experiment, just as similarly proposed premium \nsupport demonstrations have been blocked in recent years in Baltimore, \nDenver, Phoenix, and Kansas City, Missouri.\n  Just as members of Congress blocked those proposed demonstrations, \nthe legislation I am introducing today would protect the entire State \nof New Mexico from being subjected to such an experiment. I understand \nthat other Senators and Congressmen are introducing similar legislation \ntoday to protect the citizens of their respective states as well.\n  I am opposed to the comparative cost adjustment or premium support \ndemonstration being imposed upon the Medicare beneficiaries in New \nMexico because the demonstration: 1. fails to truly provide for a level \nplaying field of competition between traditional Medicare and private \nhealth plans; 2. leads to much higher volatility and uncertainty in the \nMedicare program as beneficiaries would have their premiums vary \ndramatically according to the plan chosen during the demonstration from \nyear to year and from region to region; 3. directly contradicts \nPresident Bush's guarantee and the promise of the current multi-million \nadvertising campaign by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nthat people can keep their traditional Medicare as is; and, 4. pushes \ntraditional Medicare in such regions into what health economists refer \nto as a ``death spiral.''\n  Proponents of the premium support demonstration argue that the intent \nof the experiment is, according to the conference report, ``to test \nwhether competition between private plans and the original Medicare FFS \nprogram will enhance competition in Medicare, improve health care \ndelivery for all Medicare beneficiaries, and provide for greater \nbeneficiary savings and reduction in government costs. . . . ''\n  The conference report adds that the demonstration ``will level the \nplaying field between all options available to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.''\n  Unfortunately, the demonstration will not focus competition or choice \non either price or quality precisely because it fails to provide for a \nlevel playing field. Under the guise of making Medicare more efficient, \nthe legislation dramatically overpays private health plans in \ncomparison to traditional Medicare.\n  In fact, during testimony before the Senate Finance Committee a few \nweeks ago, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson \nacknowledged that both the Congressional budget Office and the Office \nof Management and Budget believe the prescription drug bill creates a \nsituation whereby every percentage increase of enrollment by Medicare \nbeneficiaries will cost the Medicare program and American taxpayers \nbillions of dollars. How is this possible?\n  The bill creates this situation by intentionally paying private \nhealth plans, on average, an estimated 107 percent of the cost of \ntraditional Medicare. Health plans are receiving disproportionate share \nhospital payments, graduate medical education funding, and other \ncomplicated formula adjustments that ensure payments well in excess of \nthe Medicare fee-for-service program.\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\n  In addition, health plans, by enrolling healthier patients than \ntraditional Medicare, receive an additional estimated benefit of about \neight percent over fee-for-service Medicare. Numerous studies, \nincluding those by the General Accounting Office, find that high-cost \nbeneficiaries--including the functionally disabled, the mentally \nimpaired, and the chronically ill--were less likely to join a Medicare \nHMO.\n\n  When you combine all the factors, health plans will be paid at least \n115 percent of the cost of traditional Medicare.\n  This makes absolutely no sense, particularly when you consider that \nthe bill provides for this despite the fact that studies by Marilyn \nMoon, Karen Davis, and other respected health care analysts have \nconsistently shown that traditional Medicare provides Medicare \nbeneficiaries a less expensive product with greater patient \nsatisfaction and greater access to providers than private health plans.\n  Although the demonstration would strip out graduate medical education \npayments to HMOs, it fails to fully eliminate excessive payments to \nhealth plans caused by risk selection and includes disproportionate \nshare hospital payments in the FFS benchmark--inevitably raising FFS \npremiums in comparison to private health plans.\n  Furthermore, there is no level playing field if HMOs enroll healthier \nand lower cost patients than traditional Medicare and do not have to \nmake the billions of dollars in disproportionate share hospital \npayments that traditional Medicare must make.\n  Second, a hallmark of the Medicare program has been its beneficiary \nsatisfaction ratings despite the lack of prescription drugs or \npreventive health benefits. Medicare beneficiaries strongly prefer the \nguarantee and predictability of coverage and the greater level of \naccess to providers than is provided by private health plans.\n  The demonstration undermines this because it would lead to \ndifferential premiums among Medicare beneficiaries in different regions \nof the country based on rapidly changing health plans options offered \nand chosen annually.\n  In fact, premiums will fluctuate under the demonstration on an annual \nbasis because the government contribution will be based on the bids of \nall plans during a particular year. As a result, even if a plan's costs \ndoes not increase from one year to the next, the amount paid by a \nbeneficiary can change due to changes in other health plans in the \nregion and changes in the region's benchmark.\n  This makes absolutely no sense and is the second reason why I oppose \nthe premium support demonstration.\n  Third, as noted before, in the President's 2003 State of the Union \naddress, he committed that Medicare beneficiaries would be able to keep \ntheir Medicare coverage as is. Moreover, the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, or CMS, is currently spending millions of dollars in \nan advertising campaign with the assertion that ``you can always keep \nyour same Medicare coverage.''\n  The comparative cost adjustment program or premium support \ndemonstration completely undermines traditional Medicare and should, as \na result, be repealed. Neither the President nor the Federal Government \nshould be telling our Nation's Medicare beneficiaries one thing when \nthe reality is clearly something different, particularly under the \ndemonstration program.\n  This occurs due to the ``death spiral'' that health care economists \nnote will likely occur under the demonstration. If, as numerous studies \nindicate, private health plans continue to enroll healthier and less \ncostly Medicare beneficiaries than fee-for-service Medicare, then fee-\nfor-service Medicare would be more likely to have higher premiums. Over \ntime, if sicker individuals stay with traditional Medicare and \nhealthier ones move away as premiums rise, traditional Medicare is \nlikely to enter in what is known as a ``death spiral.'' Despite the \nPresident's guarantee that ``[s]eniors happy with the current Medicare \nsystem should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is . . \n.,'' that would clearly not be the case in these comparative cost \nadjustment program demonstrations.\n  If the administration and Congress wants real competition, private \nplans should be required to compete with traditional Medicare in a \nmanner where both traditional Medicare and private plans are paid the \nsame amount on a risk adjusted basis for the same services. If that \nwere the case, Medicare beneficiaries could select whether they would \nlike to enroll in traditional Medicare or in a competing private health \nplan based on factors such as quality, access, and cost.\n  Unfortunately, the administration and proponents of premium support \nknow that private plans cannot successfully compete with traditional \nMedicare. Ironically, in the name of reforming Medicare through \ncompetition, they have purposely tilted the playing field toward \nprivate health plans. Taxpayers should not have to bear the billions of \ndollars in additional Medicare spending that overpayment to private \nplans will cost them over the next 10 years and Medicare beneficiaries \nshould not be subjected to a grand premium support experiment in 2010 \nwhere the winner has already been pre-determined.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na document from Families USA be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2114\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This proposal, embedded in the House \n     Medicare prescription drug bill, may sound reasonable, but \n     let's look at how it would really work.\n       We start with five Medicare beneficiaries, with the \n     following yearly medical expenses: Bill--$1,000; Jane--\n     $4,000; Joan--$5,000; James--$6,000; and Sam--$10,000. \n     Amongst them, they have total medical expenses of $26,000, or \n     an average of $5,200 each.\n       Now imagine that Congress has enacted the House Medicare \n     drug bill, which requires the traditional Medicare fee-for-\n     service program to enter into competitive bidding with \n     private insurance plans.\n       So traditional Medicare would bid $5,200 per person for \n     Bill, Jane, Joan, James, and Sam, since that's been the \n     average cost of caring for these five folks.\n       But a private plan, DollarCare, knowing roughly what the \n     traditional Medicare bid is, bids $5,000 per member. Since \n     they are clever about their marketing (they advertise at \n     athletic clubs and recreational facilities), DollarCare \n     enrolls healthy beneficiaries (like Bill) who only cost \n     $1,000 each. This ensures that they have a high profit \n     ($5,000 bid -$1,000 expenses = $4,000 profit per enrollee). \n     The existing Medicare law requires DollarCare to give Bill \n     some extra benefits; these extra benefits make the plan more \n     attractive to other people when they hear about the \n     ``extras.'' (Jane, Joan, James, and Sam decide to stick with \n     traditional Medicare so they can keep their long-time family \n     doctors.)\n       And there's another wrinkle. The new House bill rewards \n     beneficiaries who choose ``cheaper'' plans. Here's how it \n     works: Each year, the government will compute a new \n     ``benchmark'' by calculating the average payment for each \n     Medicare beneficiary. In the beginning, the benchmark is \n     $5,200 (that's what Medicare has been paying, on average, for \n     the five people). Because the DollarCare bid of $5,000 is \n     $200 under the ``benchmark'' of $5,200, Bill and the \n     government get to split the difference: Bill gets to pocket \n     75 percent of the savings ($150), and the government/Medicare \n     saves the other 25 percent ($50).\n       So a year passes, and it's time for a second round of \n     competitive bids. What happens to the bids in the second \n     year? The four people left (Jane, Joan, James, and Sam) had \n     combined expenses of $25,000, so traditional Medicare submits \n     a bid of $6,250 per person, the average cost for caring for \n     these four people. DollarCare has a good thing going, so they \n     bid $5,000 again.\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n\n       Then the benchmark is adjusted to reflect the average per-\n     person cost of everyone in Medicare--those in traditional \n     Medicare and those in private plans. The new benchmark is \n     $6,000 (Bill in DollarCare at $5,000 and the four others \n     still in traditional Medicare at $6,250).\n       Now all the people in traditional Medicare have to pay an \n     extra $250 in premiums because their ``plan'' (that is, the \n     traditional Medicare program) has submitted a bid $250 higher \n     than the benchmark plan ($6,000). Meanwhile, lucky Bill gets \n     75 percent of the $1,000 ``savings,'' the difference between \n     DollarCare's $5,000 bid and the $6,000 benchmark.\n       DollarCare keeps advertising at gyms and other recreational \n     facilities and attracts fairly healthy Jane.\n       Obviously, traditional Medicare's premiums will spiral \n     upward as this process repeats itself each year. Traditional \n     Medicare will become a plan of the very sick, very frail, \n     very elderly--those who need lots of services, want to keep \n     their long-time doctors, etc.\n       This is the beginning of an insurance death spiral that \n     will ultimately destroy the traditional Medicare fee-for-\n     service program. The older, chronically ill people who need \n     the types of services offered by traditional Medicare will \n     face ever-spiraling costs. As the premiums for traditional \n     Medicare rise, the price tag will drive them into private \n     plans like DollarCare, even though studies have shown that \n     private plans are not good for the very old, chronically ill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2115.

A bill to amend part C of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to prohibit the comparative cost adjustment (CCA) program from \noperating in the State of California; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in accordance with the Medicare \nlegislation that Congress passed and the President signed into law last \nyear included, beginning in 2010, a ``premium support'' demonstration \nproject in up to 6 areas of the country. If included in this project, \nseniors will face increased premiums if they choose to stay in \ntraditional ``fee-for-service'' Medicare instead of joining an HMO. \nThey call it a ``demonstration project'' but it ought to be called a \n``demolition project'' because this plan will demolish Medicare for \nmillions of seniors.\n  CBO estimates that 1 to 1.5 million Medicare beneficiaries are likely \nto be involved in the demolition project. In reality, the numbers could \nbe much higher--one in six Medicare beneficiaries could be forced to \nparticipate in this experiment. In California, 12 of its metropolitan \nstatistical areas (MSAs) now qualify for the demonstration project. If \nthe two largest MSAs are chosen for this demonstration project, 1.4 \nmillion Californians will be forced into this experiment and will be \nfaced with a Hobson's choice. They will be required to join an HMO or \npay higher premiums.\n  We know what happens in these situations. Healthy people will choose \nthe HMO, leaving sicker seniors in fee-for-service plans. As costs in \ntraditional Medicare spiral even higher due to its pool of sicker \nseniors, the costs of Medicare will rise. Medicare will be weaker.\n  That brings us to the real question: Why is this necessary? Is it \nbecause seniors can't choose HMOs under the current system? No. Seniors \ncan choose to join an HMO right now if they wish. I'll tell you why: It \nis a backdoor attempt to achieve Newt Gingrich's vision for a Medicare \nthat will ``whither on the vine.''\n  Twenty-two of my colleagues are introducing bills to exempt their \nStates from this demolition project. Along with them, I am introducing \na bill that will exempt California as well. I do not want California \nseniors to be forced to swallow the bitter choice between high costs or \nlower quality HMO service.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2117. A bill to amend part C of title XVII of the Social Security \nAct to prohibit the comparative cost adjustment (CCA) program from \noperating in the State of New Jersey; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues from New \nJersey, Senator Frank Lautenberg, and Congressmen Frank Pallone and Rob \nAndrews, who are introducing comparable legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives today, to introduce a bill to protect from \nprivatization the Medicare program that more than 1 million New Jersey \nseniors rely on.\n  As a result of a provision in the new Medicare law, more than 1 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, including 186,000 New Jersey \nMedicare beneficiaries who live in Camden, Salem, Burlington and \nGloucester counties, will be subject to a risky Medicare privatization \nscheme beginning in 2010. This scheme, which is called premium support, \nwill give seniors a set Medicare premium payment--similar to a \nvoucher--that would be based on a combination of the prices that \nprivate plans in their area charge and the cost of Medicare fee-for-\nservice in their area. Seniors choosing to enroll in a plan that costs \nmore than the amount of that voucher would have to pay the difference.\n  While it may seem like an easy and straightforward choice to seniors \nwho currently enjoy and thrive on traditional Medicare to choose to \nremain in the fee-for-service program, under this privatization scheme, \nthose seniors who make that choice will end up paying significantly \nhigher premiums than their counterparts in private plans. Because the \nprivate plans will be able to cherry pick the healthiest seniors to \nenroll in their plans and will receive huge subsidies from the federal \ngovernment, they will be able to provide lower cost health care than \nthe traditional Medicare program. That means that sicker, older \nbeneficiaries will remain in the traditional Medicare, thereby \nincreasing costs in that program, while younger, healthier \nbeneficiaries will choose to enroll in private plans where they will \npay lower premiums.\n  That's right, Under this privatization scheme, seniors who choose to \nremain in the Medicare program they know and trust will pay more--\nsignificantly more than they pay now--for their coverage.\n  Not only will these seniors pay significantly higher premiums than \nthey do now for fee-for-service Medicare, and much more than they would \nif they enrolled in a private plan, but also depending on where a \nsenior lives they will pay a different price for the same Medicare \ncoverage that a senior in a neighboring community might pay. So, for \nthe first time in history, seniors in some areas will pay higher \npremiums for their Medicare coverage than seniors in other areas.\n  How much more will seniors who want to stay in the traditional \nMedicare program pay? According to documents released by the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Office of the Actuary on August 9, 2003, \nseniors living in Gloucester and Hudson counties in New Jersey could \npay as much as $1,700 more than they pay now for traditional Medicare. \nYet, seniors in these counties could, depending on the plan they \nselect, join an HMO for a premium that is $2,000 less. Why is that? \nThis is because private plans will select healthier seniors will offer \nfewer choices than traditional Medicare and, at the same time will \nreceive grossly inflated payments from the government.\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\n  In fact, the new Medicare law overpays private plans by $1,920 per \nbeneficiary--at a total cost of $14 billion to taxpayers--so that these \nplans may compete with Medicare. This sounds like socialized \nprivatization to me. Indeed, in the last 6 months I have struggled to \nunderstand the logic behind paying private plans more than we pay \nMedicare. The only logical reason I've come up with is that this is the \nperfect plan to make the Medicare program fail--to give my Republican \ncolleagues the read meat they need to raid and privatize Medicare.\n  This is not competition. It is a plan to force seniors into private \nplans and out of the Medicare program they trust. There is no real \nchoice here. Very few seniors will have the luxury of choosing to pay \n$2,000 more a year for traditional Medicare. Most seniors will be \nforced into managed care plans.\n  Seniors in my State want no part of this privatization scheme. Baby \nboomers in my State want no part of this. New Jerseyans want to know \nthat the Medicare program, as we know it, will be there for them when \nthey need it. My legislation provides that assurance. Under my bill, no \nNew Jersey county and no New Jersey senior will be subject to this \ndisastrous privatization scheme.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and the many other \nbills that Democratic members are introducing today to exempt their \nStates from this program and to protect and preserve the Medicare \nprogram for our seniors today and our seniors tomorrow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2121. A bill to amend part C of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to prohibit the comparative cost adjustment (CCA) program from \noperating in the State of Nevada; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is nothing more important we could do \nfor our senior citizens than help them with the soaring cost of health \ncare, especially the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  Unfortunately the Medicare bill passed by this Congress and signed \ninto law by President Bush doesn't do this. In fact, for many seniors \nthis law will do more harm than good.\n  One provision of this new and overly complicated law establishes \n``comparative cost adjustment'' demonstration programs that will take \nplace in six metropolitan areas. ``Comparative cost adjustment'' is \njust a fancy term that really means: How much you pay for your Medicare \npremiums depends on where you live.\n  In other words, some Medicare recipients will pay more than others \nfor the exact same coverage, simply because of where they live.\n  Medicare premiums for seniors living in the six regions selected to \nparticipate in the pilot program would be based on a set payment--like \na voucher--from the government. This payment would be based on a \ncombination of the prices charged by private plans and the cost of \nMedicare fee-for-service in their area.\n  Seniors would enroll in either a private plan or in fee-for-service \nMedicare. But those who chose a plan that cost more than the defined \ncontribution would have to pay the difference out of their own pockets.\n  And since senior citizens in the fee-for-service program tend to be \nolder and sicker than those who enroll in Medicare HMOs, costs for that \ngroup would probably be higher, and the defined contribution likely \nwould not cover the entire cost of the fee-for-service premium.\n  So over time, seniors who want to remain in the traditional Medicare \nprogram, because they want to keep choosing their own doctor or for any \nother reason, would have to pay more and more out of their own pockets.\n  Under this experimental program, I fear that traditional Medicare \nwould become too expensive for many patients simply because of where \nthey happen to live. We have a large population of retirees in north \nand south Nevada, and I am told there is a good chance one or both of \nthese areas will be selected for this experimental pilot program.

A bill to amend part C of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to prohibit the comparative cost adjustment (CCA) program from \noperating in the State of Hawaii; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprohibit the comparative cost adjustment program, which is commonly \nknown as premium support, from operating in Hawaii.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of \n2003 included the creation of premium support demonstration programs in \nselect metropolitan statistical areas starting in 2010. In these \ndemonstration programs, seniors would be provided with a defined \ncontribution payment for Medicare Part B rather than a defined benefit. \nSeniors would receive a set minimum payment to be used towards \nenrolling in either traditional fee-for-service Medicare or a managed \ncare plan. Seniors that choose options that are more expensive than the \ndefined premium would have to pay the difference themselves.\n  Many of the older and less healthier seniors stay in the traditional \nfee-for-service Medicare rather than enrolling in Medicare managed care \nprograms. The defined contribution premium will likely not be able to \ncover the entire cost of their fee-for-service premium. So, they may \nnot be able to afford to stay in the traditional Medicare program and \nwill be forced to enroll in lowest-cost health maintenance \norganization, HMO, or preferred provider organization, PPO, in their \ncommunity. Seniors deserve to have their right to choose whether to \nremain in traditional Medicare or enroll in a managed care program \nbased on their health care needs and not be forced into managed care \nprograms because they are not able to pay the increased premium \nrequired for traditional Medicare.\n  Now, seniors across the country pay the same premium for Medicare \nPart B services. After the implementation of the premium support \ndemonstration programs, this will not be the case. Not only are there \nlikely to be wide variations in Medicare Part B premium rates for \nbeneficiaries across the country, but there will even be differences \namong seniors within the same State. This is unjust. Seniors that \nreceive the same benefits should be paying the same premium in an \nentitlement program such as Medicare.\n  Proponents of the premium support plan believe that this will help \ncontrol Medicare costs and save money. However, this proposal will only \nwork if more of the costs are shifted to seniors who will have to pay \nhigher premiums or have their benefits reduced.\n  It is my hope that these demonstration projects are never implemented \nin any state. My legislation would ensure that the residents of Hawaii \nare protected from having this demonstration program impair their \nMedicare Part B choices. I am pleased that several of my colleagues \nhave also introduced\n\n[[Page S1593]]\n\nlegislation to protect seniors in their states from the premium support \ndemonstration projects.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2122\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to build operational readiness in civilian agencies, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Stabilization \nand Reconstruction Civilian Management Act. Senator Biden  is an \noriginal co-sponsor and his involvement in the Committee's work on this \nissue and the resulting legislation is deeply appreciated.\n  Over the past decade the United States has undertaken a series of \npost-conflict stabilization and reconstruction operations that have \nbeen critical to U.S. national security. In the Balkans, Afghanistan, \nand now in Iraq, the U.S. government has cobbled together plans, people \nand resources in an ad hoc fashion with the Defense Department in the \nlead.\n  The efforts of those engaged have been valiant, but these emergencies \nhave been complex and time sensitive. Our ad hoc approach has been \ninadequate to deliver the necessary capabilities to deal speedily and \nefficiently with complex emergencies. The purpose of this bill is to \nestablish a more robust civilian capability to respond quickly and \neffectively to post-conflict situations or other complex emergencies.\n  The prevailing inclination to deal with these problems through ad hoc \nmethods has stemmed, in part, from our bipartisan hope that post-\nconflict stabilization efforts will not be required of us on a frequent \nbasis. But we should not engage in wishful thinking. Crises are \ninevitable, and in most cases, U.S. national security interests will be \nthreatened by sustained instability. The war on terrorism necessitates \nthat we not leave nations crumbling and ungoverned. Our tolerance for \nfailed states has been reduced by a global war against terrorists. We \nhave already seen how terrorists can exploit nations afflicted by \nlawlessness and desperate circumstances. They seek out such places to \nestablish training camps, recruit new members, and tap into a black \nmarket where all kinds of weapons are for sale.\n\n  In this international atmosphere, the United States must have the \nright structures, personnel, and resources in place when an emergency \noccurs. A delay of a few weeks, or even days, in our response can mean \nthe difference between success and failure. As a Nation, we have \naccepted stabilization and reconstruction challenges in the Balkans, \nIraq and Afghanistan, but we need to go a step further and create \nstructures that can plan and execute strategies to deal with future \nemergencies.\n  While recognizing the critical challenges that our military has \nundertaken with skill and courage, we must acknowledge that certain \nnon-security missions would have been better served by a civilian \nresponse. Our post-conflict efforts frequently have had a higher than \nnecessary military profile. This is not the result of a Pentagon power \ngrab or institutional fights. Rather, the military has led post-\nconflict operations primarily because it is the only agency capable of \nmobilizing large amounts of people and resources for these tasks. As a \nconsequence, the resources of the Armed Services have been stretched \nand deployments of military personnel have had to be extended beyond \nexpectations. If we can improve the surge capacity and capabilities of \nthe civilian agencies, they can take over many of the non-security \nmissions that have burdened the military.\n  The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations embarked on a bipartisan \nexperiment beginning in late 2003, assembling an impressive array of \nexperts from inside and outside of government to provide advice on how \nbest to achieve this goal. This Policy Advisory Group held a series of \ndiscussions in which Senators, group members, and invited experts spoke \nfrankly about their ideas to improve the U.S. response to post-conflict \nreconstruction problems and complex emergencies. The bill that Senator \nBiden and I are introducing draws on these discussions and the comments \nof participants. I believe that we need structural change, accomplished \nthrough legislation, to guarantee improvements in our capabilities.\n  Serving as members of the Policy Advisory Group were Ambassador James \nDobbins, Director of International Security and Defense Policy at the \nRAND Corporation; Dr. John Hamre, President and CEO of CSIS; Gen. \nGeorge Joulwan, former Supreme Allied Commander Europe; Gen. William \nNash, Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for Preventive Action of \nthe Council on Foreign Relations; Mr. Walter Slocombe, former Senior \nAdvisor for National Security to the Coalition Provisional Authority; \nand Dr. Arnold Kanter of the Scowcroft Group. Other participants \nincluded Mr. Marc Grossman, Undersecretary of State for \nPolitical Affairs; Mr. Andrew Natsios, Administrator of USAID; Dr. \nJoseph Collins, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Stability \nOperations; Mr. James Kunder, Deputy Assistant Administrator of USAID; \nMr. J. Clint Williamson, Director of Transnational Crime Issues on the \nNSC; Dr. Hans Binnendijk of the National Defense University; Ms. Sheba \nCrocker of CSIS; Mr. Frank Kramer of Shea and Gardner; Mr. Bernd \nMcConnell, formerly with USAID and now with the Department of Defense; \nMr. Larry Nowels of the Congressional Research Service; Ambassador \nRobert Oakley of the Institute for National Security Studies at the \nNational Defense University; Mr. Robert Perito of the U.S. Institute of \nPeace; and Ms. Julia Taft of the UNDP.\n\n  Although I have tried to incorporate as many of the insights of the \ngroup as possible, not every participant will agree with every \nprovision in the bill. This is not surprising given that one of our \ngoals in constructing the group was guaranteeing a diverse set of \nperspectives. Nevertheless, there were several themes developed that \nachieved, or at least approached, a consensus: The civilian foreign \naffairs agencies should be better organized for overseas crisis \nresponse and the Secretary of State should play a lead role in this \neffort. There should be improved standing capacity within the civilian \nagencies to respond to complex emergencies and to work in potentially \nhostile environments. The agencies must be capable and flexible enough \nto provide a robust partner to the military when necessary or to lead a \ncrisis response effort when appropriate. The rapid mobilization of \nresources must be shared by the civilian agencies and the military. \nWhile the need to ensure security will continue to fall on the \nshoulders of the military, the post-conflict demands on the military \nfor stabilization and reconstruction would be lessened by tapping into \nthe expertise of civilian forces.\n  During this process, the Bush Administration was extremely helpful \nand forthcoming. Officials from the State Department, the Defense \nDepartment, the NSC, and USAID attended as guests of the group and \nparticipated in their private capacities. The participation of these \nofficials does not constitute an official endorsement of this \nlegislation by their employing agencies, but the final product was \ngreatly improved by their collective experience and wisdom. We are \nextremely grateful to the Administration for its willingness to engage \nthe Foreign Relations Committee during this process.\n\n  This bill urges the President to create a Stabilization and \nReconstruction\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\nCoordinating Committee to be chaired by the National Security Advisor. \nThis Coordinating Committee would have policy oversight responsibility \nfor ensuring appropriate interagency coordination in the planning and \nexecution of stabilization and reconstruction efforts. The Coordinating \nCommittee would have representation from the Department of State, \nUSAID, and the Departments of Commerce, Justice, Treasury, Agriculture, \nand Defense and other agencies as appropriate.\n  This bill would authorize the creation of an office within the State \nDepartment to be the focal point for coordinating the civilian \ncomponent of stabilization and reconstruction missions. The Office \nwould be headed by a Coordinator who is appointed by the President and \nreports directly to the Secretary of State. The Coordinator would also \nwork to ensure that civilian components of the United States Government \nare prepared for joint civilian/military operations if they become \nnecessary.\n  The bill would authorize the Secretary of State to establish a \nResponse Readiness Corps with both active duty and reserve components \navailable to be called upon at a moments notice to respond to emerging \ninternational crises. In the reserves would be both federal government \nofficials from the non-foreign affairs agencies who have volunteered to \nparticipate and members recruited from the private sector based on the \napplicable skills each could contribute to the mission.\n  The bill urges the Foreign Service Institute to work with both the \nNational Defense University and the United States Army War College to \nestablish an educational and training curriculum to bring together \ncivilian and military personnel to enhance their stabilization and \nreconstruction skills and increase their ability to work together in \nthe field.\n  I introduce this bill today to set in motion legislative efforts to \nstrengthen the capacity of our civilian agencies to handle complex \nemergencies overseas, including post-conflict stabilization and \nreconstruction efforts. I am hopeful that this legislation will garner \nfurther bipartisan support. Its intent is not to critique past \npractices, but rather to improve our stabilization and reconstruction \ncapacity for the future. We recognize that the bill does not address \nmany facets of this issue that fall under the jurisdiction of the \nmilitary and the Armed Services Committee. I know that my colleagues on \nthat committee have thought about many of these issues, and they may \nrecommend additional steps.\n  The inevitable post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction demands \nof future crises will require a formidable capacity to respond to \nchallenges--both military and diplomatic. It is crucial to our success \nthat the necessary resources and plans be put in place now. Let us give \nthe President the tools he needs to carry out these most demanding \nforeign policy missions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 7127\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nStabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004, a \nbill that will increase the ability of our civilian agencies to \neffectively respond to complex emergencies and stabilize countries in \nthe wake of war or crisis.\n  I commend and express my gratitude to Chairman Lugar for his \nleadership on this issue. Since December of last year, the chairman and \nI have been engaged in discussions with experts from\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\nin and outside government on whether the United States is adequately \norganized and equipped, and its personnel trained, to deal with post-\nconflict reconstruction. Our premise was this: in the last decade, the \nUnited States has taken on post-conflict stabilization missions in \ncountries such as Bosnia, East Timor, Haiti, Somalia, and now \nAfghanistan and Iraq. In the decade to come, whether we like it or not, \nnation building will remain vital to our national security.\n  We have learned a lot from our efforts. And we have made a lot of \nmistakes in the process. One lesson that I think is clear is that we \nhave not done a very good job of turning our experience into tools for \nthe future. So the chairman and I put together a group of outside \nadvisers who had held senior positions in the last two administrations; \nwe also invited officials from this administration to give their ideas. \nThe bill we are introducing today is the product of those \nconsultations. I wish to thank all of the participants of the group for \ntheir invaluable input to this bipartisan initiative.\n  Addressing the needs present in post-conflict reconstruction--and in \nparticular, in countries that are on the verge of becoming failed \nstates--is one of the greatest challenges we face today. It matters to \nthe people living in those nations, and it matters to the American \npeople. A bipartisan commission organized by the Center for Strategic \nand International Studies and the Association of the U.S. Army found, \nto no one's surprise, that ``failed states matter--for national \nsecurity as well as for humanitarian reasons. If left to their own \ndevices, such states can become sanctuaries for terrorist networks, \norganized crime and drug traffickers, as well as pose grave \nhumanitarian challenges and threats to regional stability.''\n  We should not have to reinvent the wheel every time we are faced with \na stabilization crisis--it's inefficient and ineffective. Rather than \naddress crises on an ad hoc basis--cobbling together plans, procedures, \nand personnel--as we have been doing, we need to be forward-thinking, \ncomprehensive, and strategic.\n  The thrust of this legislation is to do precisely that. The bill \nauthorizes the creation of an office within the State Department that \nwill be the focal point for creating plans and procedures to respond to \ncrises, and it establishes a corps of active duty and reserve personnel \nwho will be able to deploy rapidly when and where critical needs arise.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not a cure-all. But I believe it is a \ngood start to addressing a critical need: that of strengthening our \ncivilian capacity to handle complex emergencies overseas. Again, I \nthank Chairman Lugar and the members of our policy advisory group for \ntheir work on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 2128. A bill to define the term ``natural born Citizen'' as used \nin the Constitution of the United States to establish eligibility for \nthe Office of President; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, as we take time to celebrate President's \nDay and remember the contributions of two of our greatest leaders \nGeorge Washington and Abraham Lincoln, I rise along with my colleagues \nSenator Landrieu and Senator Inhofe to introduce legislation that will \nguarantee children born to and adopted by American citizens the \nopportunity to become this country's next great president. The purpose \nof this bill is to define the term ``natural born Citizen'' as used in \nArticle II of the Constitution to include any person born in the United \nStates, any person born outside the United States to citizen parents, \nand any foreign-born child adopted by citizen parents.\n  For many decades legal scholars have debated the meaning of the term \n``natural born Citizen.'' There are many law review articles that \nexamine the issue from every angle and come to several different \nconclusions. Some scholars, such as Pinkney G. McElwee in his article \nentitled Natural Born Citizen and Isidor Blum's article published in \nthe New York Law School Journal, conclude that the term ``natural \nborn'' is synonymous with ``native born.'' Others, such as Charles \nGordon in the Maryland Law Review and Warren Freedman in the Cornell \nLaw Quarterly, decide that the definition of ``natural born'' includes \nall people who are citizens at birth. And these scholars disagree as to \nwho is a citizen at birth.\n  The issue came to the public's attention when George Romney was \nseeking the Republican nomination for President in 1968. He was born of \nAmerican missionary parents in Mexico. Some questioned his eligibility \nto be President under the Constitutional requirement that a President \nbe a ``natural born citizen.'' The issue was never decided since Mr. \nRomney did not become the Republican nominee. Although at least two \nFederal court decisions have suggested what the term ``natural born \ncitizen'' means, the issue has never been squarely resolved by a court.\n  Today the question remains unanswered. This bill presents us with an \nhistoric opportunity. In this bill, we have the opportunity to end the \nuncertainty surrounding the qualifications for the presidency, and \nprovide a fair and equal chance to children of American citizens to \npursue their dreams.\n  There is obviously a need for clarification. In the absence of a \njudicial interpretation, Congress can express a legislative \ninterpretation of Constitutional terms. We should not wait for an \nelection to be challenged and the courts to decide what ``natural \nborn'' means. This bill answers the need for clarification and gives \ncertainty to our citizens whose children may be born abroad such as \narmed service members, foreign service members, expatriate families, \nand certainty to families that have adopted foreign born children, that \ntheir children, too, are eligible to seek the office of President of \nthe United States.\n  Part of the American dream is that any child of an American can grow \nup to be anything he or she wants to be including President of the \nUnited States. That it does not matter what your last name is, or how \nmuch property you own, or how wealthy you are. That the son or daughter \nof the humblest upbringing could one day lead this great country. This \nis why America is truly the land of opportunity. It should not matter \nif you are born to American parents in a foreign country or adopted by \nAmerican parents from a foreign country. In either case, you are a \nchild of America.\n  This bill makes clear that a child born to American citizens abroad \nis eligible to hold the office of the presidency. The term ``natural \nborn'' was used by the framers of the Constitution to reinforce their \nwish that the president would feel loyalty and allegiance to the United \nStates. That the president would have a ``native feeling.'' Children \nborn to American citizens abroad, especially those born to members of \nthe American armed forces and foreign service, certainly have that \n``native feeling.'' They are as patriotic as any American. Statutorily, \nthey are citizens from birth, raised by Americans with American values. \nAnd they should have the same opportunities as children born on \nAmerican soil. They should not be denied the chance to seek the highest \noffice in our land because they happened to be born while their parents \nwere stationed or working abroad.\n  The Constitution also requires that the president have resided in the \nUnited States for fourteen years. This provision shows us that the \nframers believed that the president need not spend his whole life in \nthe United States. It is possible for a person to reside in another \ncountry for a time and still be eligible to be President of the United \nStates. So it follows that an American child born abroad should be just \nas eligible to be president just as any child born in the United States \nthat happens to reside abroad for a time. This bill makes it clear that \nsuch a child is eligible to be president.\n\n  This bill also makes clear that foreign born children adopted by \nAmerican families will have the same opportunities as biological \nchildren of American citizens. All of the same arguments apply for \nforeign adopted children that apply for children born biologically to \ncitizen parents abroad. These children are no less loyal to the United \nStates. They are raised by Americans in America. They are not any less \nof a citizen than any other American. And they should be no less\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\neligible to be president than any other American child.\n  Furthermore, adoption law says that once a child is fully and finally \nadopted, they are entitled to the same rights, duties and \nresponsibilities as biological children. They are to be treated as \n``natural issue'' of their adoptive parents. All blood ties are severed \nfrom their biological families. As such, foreign adopted children \nliving in America are treated as if born to their adoptive American \nparents. But there is one remaining difference. Without this bill, they \nwill be unable to pursue the opportunity to run for President. Removal \nof this inequality is the last step needed to truly provide equality to \nthe foreign adopted children of American citizens.\n  In 1990, Americans adopted more than 7,000 children from abroad. By \n2002, that number grew to more than 20,000 children. These children are \nmembers of American families, and should be treated as such. They \nshould be allowed to have the same dreams as any other American child, \nincluding the dream that they, too, could grow up to be President of \nthe United States. This bill makes sure they can.\n  Foreign adopted children and children born to American citizens \nabroad are as invested in the well-being of this country as the rest of \nus. These children grow up with the benefits of being an American \ncitizen, and they contribute back to this country. They grow up to work \nhere, pay their taxes here, and raise their children here. These \nchildren could grow up to be America's next great writers, actors, \nscientists, lawyers or doctors. They could be ministers or mill \nworkers, farmers or Senators. They should also be allowed to grow up to \nbe the President.\n  This bill ensures that children born to or adopted by American \nparents have claim to the full meaning of the American dream. That not \nonly can they have the freedom to speak, the freedom to worship in any \nstyle they wish, the freedom to own a home and pursue happiness, but \nthat they can also have the freedom to choose to run for president.\n  Over my years as a Senator, my office has received letters and \ninquiries from many foreign adopted children and their families seeking \na change in the law to allow them to pursue the office of President of \nthe United States. I ask my colleagues today to join with us in support \nof this bill to make America truly the land of opportunity for all its \ncitizens' children whether born here, born abroad or adopted abroad.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2128\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Natural Born Citizen Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF ``NATURAL BORN CITIZEN''.\n\n       (a) In General.--Congress finds and declares that the term \n     ``natural born Citizen'' in Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 \n     of the Constitution of the United States means--\n       (1) any person born in the United States and subject to the \n     jurisdiction thereof; and\n       (2) any person born outside the United States--\n       (A) who derives citizenship at birth from a United States \n     citizen parent or parents pursuant to an Act of Congress; or\n       (B) who is adopted by 18 years of age by a United States \n     citizen parent or parents who are otherwise eligible to \n     transmit citizenship to a biological child pursuant to an Act \n     of Congress.\n       (b) United States.--In this section, the term ``United \n     States'', when used in a geographic sense, means the several \n     States of the United States and the District of Columbia.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Nickles and Landrieu, in introducing this bill, which will \nprofoundly impact generations to come. It will clarify who is eligible \nto become President of the United States of America. The term ``natural \nborn citizen'' as used in the Constitution, would be defined as any \nperson born in the United States, any person born outside the United \nStates to citizen parents, and any foreign-born child adopted by \ncitizen parents.\n  In the absence of a judicial interpretation of constitutional \nlanguage, Congress can express a legislative interpretation of \nconstitutional terms. In the Naturalization Act of 1790, Congress used \nthis ability to define ``natural born'' to include children born abroad \nto citizen parents. Although this language was not kept in the \nnaturalization laws, the ability of Congress to define this term was \nnot challenged.\n  This bill is intended to further describe the term ``natural born \ncitizen'' as it relates to Presidential qualification. The Framers used \nthis phrase to support the criteria that the President be loyal and \nfaithful to the United States. Children born to military, or State \nDepartment parents living abroad have exceeding loyalty to the United \nStates. They should not be punished for their parents' willingness to \nserve their country abroad.\n  Furthermore, internationally adopted children should not bear this \npenalty either. In recent years, the number of children adopted by \nAmericans from overseas has grown to more than 20,000. They are \nconsidered ``natural issue'' of their adoptive parents and share a \nsimilar loyalty to the United States. These children should have the \nsame rights, duties, responsibilities, and privileges as biological \nchildren. They should be able to pursue their dreams.\n  About two and a half years ago, my daughter adopted a little girl \nfrom Ethiopia. While my granddaughter shares most freedoms granted by \nthe Constitution with her biologically born brothers, including the \nfreedom of speech, the freedom to worship, and the freedom to pursue \nhappiness, she does not have the freedom to pursue any job she wants. \nWithout this interpretation she does not have the freedom to run for \nPresident of the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in support of this bill to allow all \nAmerican citizens, no matter where they are born, an equal opportunity \nto pursue their dreams, including to run for President of the United \nStates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2129. A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto require the provision of a child safety device in connection with \nthe transfer of a handgun and to provide safety standards for child \nsafety devices; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we would all agree that we need to protect \nour children from violence. However, too many of our children continue \nto be injured or killed by guns. That is why I am introducing the Child \nSafety Device Act.\n  This is a very simple measure. Every handgun sold must come with a \nchild safety device. This can be a lock using a key or combination, a \ndevice that locks electronically, a lock box, or technology that is \nbuilt into the gun itself. With this safety measure in place, we can \nreduce the number of accidental gun deaths among our children.\n  More than 22 million children live in homes with guns. And more than \n3.3 million of them live in homes where the guns are always or \nsometimes kept loaded and unlocked. The result is the accidental deaths \nof 182 young people each year--that's one every 48 hours.\n  We ``childproof'' our medicine bottles; we put gates up near stairs; \nwe make sure that toys are not toxic. But we don't require that guns \ncome with safety devices. We should.\n  And to ensure that those devices are effective, my bill requires that \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission establish standards for their \ndesign, manufacture, and performance. When parents use a child safety \ndevice, they should have confidence that it works as intended.\n  The Child Safety Device Act will improve the safety of our children--\nand it will help save lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Levin, Mr. Miller, Mr. Biden, Mr. Breaux, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Collins, Ms. Stabenow, \n        Mr. Burns, Mr. Smith, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Frist, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Specter, Mr. Fitzgerald, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Allard, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n        Sessions, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Johnson):\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\n  S.J.

Eisenhower called a ``Crusade in Europe'' to end \n     Nazi tyranny and restore freedom and human dignity to \n     millions of people;\n       Whereas that great assault by sea and air marked the \n     beginning of the end of Hitler's ambition for world \n     domination;\n       Whereas American troops suffered over 6,500 casualties on \n     D-Day; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States should honor the \n     valor and sacrifices of their fellow countrymen, both living \n     and dead, who fought that day for liberty and the cause of \n     freedom in Europe: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 60th anniversary of the Allied landing \n     at Normandy during World War II; and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe the anniversary \n     with appropriate ceremonies and programs to honor the \n     sacrifices of their fellow countrymen to liberate Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/25/senate-section/article/S1599-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 91--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF APRIL 2005 AS \n                  ``AMERICAN RELIGIOUS HISTORY MONTH''\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution, which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 91\n\n       Whereas religion has made a unique contribution in shaping \n     the United States as a distinctive and blessed Nation and \n     people;\n       Whereas deeply held religious convictions led to the early \n     settlement of our nation;\n       Whereas religious teachings from the Bible inspired \n     concepts of civil government that are contained in our \n     Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the history of our Nation clearly illustrates the \n     value of voluntarily applying religious teaching in the lives \n     of individuals, families, and society;\n       Whereas the profoundly held religious belief that all \n     people are created in the image of God and are therefore \n     equal in the eyes of God ultimately led to the abolition of \n     the deeply entrenched institution of slavery;\n       Whereas many of our great national leaders acknowledged \n     that religion is the basis of national morality, as evidenced \n     by President Washington who said that ``reason and experience \n     both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail \n     in exclusion of religious principle'';\n       Whereas the Nation now faces great challenges that will \n     test this Nation as it has never been tested before; and\n       Whereas renewing our knowledge of a faith in the God of our \n     Founding Fathers can strengthen us as a Nation and a people: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) designates the month of April 2005 as ``American \n     Religious History Month'' in recognition of both the \n     formative influence that religion has been on our Nation, and \n     our national need to study and apply the religious teachings \n     embraced by our Founding Fathers; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     year with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/25/senate-section/article/S1599-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1599-S1600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 92--CONGRATULATING AND SALUTING FOCUS: \n  HOPE ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 35TH ANNIVERSARY AND FOR ITS REMARKABLE \nCOMMITMENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO DETROIT, THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND FOR \n                           THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 92\n\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE began as a civil and human rights \n     organization in 1968 in the wake of the devastating Detroit \n     riots, and was co-founded by the late Father William T. \n     Cunningham, a Roman Catholic priest, and Eleanor M. Josaitis, \n     a suburban housewife, who were inspired to establish Focus: \n     HOPE by the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE is committed to bringing together \n     people of all races, faiths, and economic backgrounds to \n     overcome injustice and build racial harmony, and it has grown \n     to one of the largest nonprofit organizations in Michigan;\n       Whereas the Focus: HOPE mission statement states: \n     ``Recognizing the dignity and beauty of every person, we \n     pledge intelligent and practical action to overcome racism, \n     poverty and injustice. And to build a metropolitan community \n     where all people may live in freedom, harmony, trust and \n     affection. Black and white, yellow, brown and red from \n     Detroit and its suburbs of every economic status, national \n     origin and religious persuasion we join in this covenant.'';\n       Whereas one of Focus: HOPE's early efforts was to support \n     African American and female employees in a seminal class \n     action suit against AAA, resulting in one of the finest \n     affirmative action commitments made by any corporation up to \n     that time;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE helped to conceive of and develop the \n     Department of Agriculture's Commodity Supplemental Food \n     Program which has been replicated in 32 states, and through \n     this program Focus: HOPE helps to feed 43,000 people per \n     month throughout Southeast Michigan;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has revitalized several city blocks in \n     central Detroit by redeveloping obsolete industrial \n     buildings, beautifying and landscaping Oakman Boulevard, \n     creating pocket parks, and rehabilitating homes in the \n     surrounding areas;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's Machinist Training Institute has been \n     training individuals from Detroit and beyond for careers in \n     advanced manufacturing and precision machining since 1981, \n     and has sent forth nearly 2,500 certified graduates, \n     providing an opportunity for primarily under-represented \n     minority youth, women, and others to gain access to the \n     financial mainstream and learn in-demand skills;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE, with assistance from Michigan, the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, and other \n     generous private and public partners, has within the last two \n     years invested over $10 million to complete the renovation of \n     the industrial building housing its Machinist Training \n     Institute;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has recognized that manufacturing and \n     information technologies are key to the economic growth and \n     security of Michigan and the United States, and is committed \n     to designing programs that would contribute to the \n     participation of under-represented urban individuals in these \n     critical sectors;\n       Whereas, in 1982, Focus: HOPE began a for-profit subsidiary \n     that was initiated for community economic development \n     purposes and is now designated with Federal HUBZone status;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE created two pioneering programs--FAST \n     TRACK and First Step--designed to help individuals improve \n     their reading and math competencies by a minimum of two grade \n     levels in 4-7 weeks;\n       Whereas these programs have graduated over 7,000 \n     individuals since their inception, a new offsite training \n     facility in Detroit's Empowerment Zone in southwest Detroit \n     has been established to reach out to individuals in other \n     parts of the city, and the success of the programs has \n     inspired Michigan (in its State-wide FAST BREAK program) and \n     other States to replicate the efforts of Focus: HOPE;\n       Whereas, in 1987, Focus: HOPE reclaimed and renovated an \n     abandoned building and opened it as a Center for Children, \n     which has now served over 5,000 children of colleagues, \n     students, and neighbors with quality child care, including \n     latchkey, early childhood education, and other educational \n     services;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE, through an unprecedented co-operative \n     agreement between the Departments of Defense, Commerce, \n     Education, and Labor, established a National demonstration \n     project--the Center for Advanced Technologies--in which \n     candidates earn associates and bachelors degrees in either \n     manufacturing engineering or technology, and engage in hands-\n     on manufacturing within-real world conditions, producing \n     parts for DaimlerChrysler, Detroit Diesel, Ford Motor \n     Company, General Motors Corporation, the Department of \n     Defense, and others;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has caused over $22 million to be \n     invested in renovating a previously obsolete building to \n     house the Center for Advanced Technologies, transforming the \n     building into a model facility for 21st century advanced \n     manufacturing, education, and research;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has made outstanding contributions \n     toward increasing diversity within the traditional \n     homogeneous science, math, engineering, and technology \n     fields, and 95 percent of currently enrolled\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\n     degree candidates are African American, representing perhaps \n     the United States' largest producer of bachelor-degreed \n     minority graduates in manufacturing engineering;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's unique research and development \n     partnership with the Department of Defense has resulted in a \n     nationally recognized demonstration project, the Mobile Parts \n     Hospital, whose Rapid Manufacturing System has recently been \n     deployed to Kuwait in support of the Armed Forces' current \n     operations in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE began a community arts program in 1995, \n     presenting multicultural arts programming and gallery \n     exhibitions designed to educate and encourage area residents, \n     while fostering integration in a culturally diverse \n     metropolitan community, and over 43,000 people have viewed \n     sponsored exhibits or participated in this program;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE established an Information Technologies \n     Center in 1999, providing Detroit students with industry-\n     certified training programs in network administration, \n     network installation, and desktop and server administration, \n     and has graduated nearly 475 students to date, and has \n     initiated, in collaboration with industry and academia, the \n     design of a new bachelors degree program to educate \n     information management systems engineers;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's initiatives and programs have been \n     nationally recognized for excellence and leadership by such \n     organizations as the Government Accounting Office, the \n     Department of Labor, the International Standards \n     Organization, the National Science Foundation, the Cisco \n     Networking Academy Program, Fortune Magazine, Forbes \n     Magazine, the Aspen Institute, and many others, and former \n     Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton have visited \n     Focus: HOPE's campus;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE is currently led by Eleanor M. \n     Josaitis, its co-founder and chief executive officer, and she \n     has received honorary degrees from 11 outstanding \n     universities and colleges, was named one of the 100 Most \n     Influential Women in 2002 by Crain's Detroit Business, has \n     been inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, has \n     received the Detroit NAACP Presidential Award, the Arab \n     American Institute Foundation's Kahlil Gibran Spirit of \n     Humanity Award, as well as many other awards;\n       Whereas through the generous partnerships and support of \n     individuals from all walks of life, Federal, State, and local \n     government, and foundations and corporations across the \n     United States, the vision of Focus: HOPE will continue to \n     grow and inspire;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has been blessed with an active board \n     of directors and advisory board from the senior most levels \n     of corporate and public America, and has benefited from an \n     annual average of 25,000 volunteers and countless colleagues;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has been a tremendous force for good in \n     the City of Detroit, the State of Michigan, and the United \n     States for the past 35 years;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE continues to strive to eliminate \n     racism, poverty, and injustice through the use of passion, \n     persistence, and partnerships, and continues to seek \n     improvement in its quality of service and program operations; \n     and\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE and its colleagues will continue to \n     identify ways in which it can lead Detroit, the State of \n     Michigan, and the United States into the future with creative \n     urban leadership initiatives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) congratulates and salutes Focus: HOPE for its \n     remarkable commitment and contributions to Detroit, the State \n     of Michigan, and the United States; and\n       (2) directs the Secretary of the Senate to make available \n     enrolled copies of this resolution to Focus: HOPE and Ms. \n     Eleanor M.

Res. 92) congratulating \n     and saluting Focus: HOPE on the occasion of its 35th \n     anniversary and for its remarkable commitment and \n     contributions to Detroit, the State of Michigan, and the \n     United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure to speak \nin commemoration of the 35th anniversary of Focus: HOPE and to support \nthis concurrent resolution commemorating its many achievements. Focus: \nHOPE has served as an invaluable, multifaced resource for the people of \nDetroit and Michigan and is a model of success for the entire Nation. \nFrom its inception, Focus: HOPE has been committed to taking \n``intelligent and practical action to overcome racism, poverty, and \ninjustice.'' For three and a half decades, Focus: HOPE has worked \ntoward that goal.\n  In 1968, Father William T. Cunningham, a Roman Catholic priest, and \nEleanor Josaitis, a housewife, joined to form Focus: HOPE as a positive \nreaction to the devastating Detroit riots the previous year. While \nhaving few material resources at their disposal, Father Cunningham and \nMs. Josaitis possessed a singular and indefatigable desire to help \nresidents of Detroit take control of their lives. Their faith has been \nmatched by a love for all of humanity, irrespective of religion or \nrace. That love has helped Focus: HOPE flourish as it seeks to assist \nmany in metro-Detroit.\n  Focus: HOPE has been involved with myriad activities that address \nboth the immediate and long-term needs of our people. In the 1970s, \nFocus: HOPE began several innovative programs to provide nutritious \nfood to young children, their mothers and senior citizens. Through its \nUSDA Commodity Supplemental Food Program, the largest of its kind, \nmonthly supplemental food is provided to 43,000 low-income pregnant and \npostpartum mothers, infants, preschool children and seniors throughout \nSoutheast Michigan. The Commodity Supplemental Food Program can now be \nfound in 32 States.\n  While caring for the basic needs of individuals, Focus: HOPE also \nseeks to lift the dreams and spirits of all who study, work at, or \nvisit its 40-acre Detroit campus. Father Cunningham was a firm believer \nin the ability of education and technology to inspire people and bring \nout the best in them. By helping people to harness their dreams and \nimagine what is possible, he sought to develop a series of training and \neducational programs that challenged students to fulfill their dreams \nwhile learning marketable career skills.\n  To achieve this end, Focus: HOPE developed a four-part educational \nand training system that requires that students meet rigorous \ncompetency standards before they are able to proceed to the next \nacademic program. The first two parts, fast track and the Machinist \nTraining Institute, opened in the 1980s during a time of radical \nevolution for Focus: HOPE. Fast rack, is a computer assisted course \nwhich improves the reading and math skills of high school graduates or \nGED holders to prepare them for advanced study in the Machinist \nTraining Institute where individuals prepare for careers in advanced \nmachining and precision manufacturing. Fast track ensures that all \nthose who enter the MTI program have the skills needed to succeed in \nthis program and industry. The MTI uses a unique combination of \nclassroom instruction and hands-on manufacturing experience producing \nhigh quality products in industry.\n\n  By maintaining clear and rigorous standards, MTI is able to train \nindividuals that industry wants to hire. Since its foundation, nearly \n2,500 graduates have learned high-demand skills and gain access to the \nfinancial mainstream. One indication of the success of this program is \nthat industry often seeks to hire the students ever before they have \ncompleted their training.\n  In 1993, Focus: HOPE expanded its educational programs by adding a \nthird education and training program--the Center for Advanced \nTechnologies, CAT. At the center, ``candidates,'' as all students are \ncalled at Focus: HOPE, are able to continue their education by working \ntoward an associate's or bachelor's degree in manufacturing \nengineering. Through a unique partnership with several universities, \nCAT students are awarded their degrees in a rigorous process that \ncombines hands-on manufacturing experience and academic instruction \nwithin a leading edge technology environment while working and studying \nat Focus: HOPE. These candidates produce the highest quality and \nprecision parts for the auto industry--a very demanding challenge. This \ninnovative Focus: HOPE program has been cited as enrolling the largest \nnumber of African Americans studying manufacturing engineering in the \nNation.\n  In 1999, Focus: HOPE was able to further diversify its training \nresources through the establishment of the Information Technologies \nCenter, which provides industry-certified training in network \nadministration, network installation, and desktop server administration \nenabling students to gain employment in the growing Information \nTechnology sector of our economy.\n  These innovative and successful programs have caused Focus: HOPE to \nreceive considerable national attention for its efforts. As a result of \nits many successes, Focus: HOPE has been visited by many national, \nState and local officials who wanted to examine this remarkable place \nin person. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton have visited \nFocus: HOPE as well as Energy Secretary Spence Abraham, Army Secretary \nThomas White, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, Secretary of Agriculture \nDan Glickman, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, the Honorable Colin \nPowell when he served as Joint Chiefs of Staff, and many others. These \nquests quickly learned as I have on many visits there, that the \nachievements of Focus: HOPE can hardly be described in just a few \nminutes or digested in even several visits.\n  Focus: HOPE has provided practical and compassionate assistance to \npeople of all ages, from young children who receive quality child care \nat their Center for Children, to young adults who receive vital \ntraining through hands-on manufacturing projects, seniors who are fed \nby the Commodity Supplemental Food Program as well as those who are \nstill young at heart who continue to persevere in the never-ending \nfight against racism, poverty, and injustice.\n  I have been privileged to witness and support Focus: HOPE's \nextraordinary achievements throughout the years. Like thousands of \nothers, I have also been inspired by its positive energy and tireless \ncommitment to providing opportunity for all people. For 35 years, \nFocus: HOPE has repeatedly amazed me with its spirit, grace, and \nvision.\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\n  Although Focus: HOPE lost a great mentor in 1997 with the passing of \nFather William Cunningham, Eleanor Josaitis continues to inspire and \nlead Focus: HOPE as its co-founder and chief executive officer. Today, \nI am pleased to offer my congratulations to Ms. Josaitis and her \ncolleagues on the 35th anniversary of Focus: HOPE. I am sure that my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives will join \nSenator Stabenow and me in commemorating this invaluable resource by \nsupporting the passage of this concurrent resolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements relating to this measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 92) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 92\n\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE began as a civil and human rights \n     organization in 1968 in the wake of the devastating Detroit \n     riots, and was co-founded by the late Father William T. \n     Cunningham, a Roman Catholic priest, and Eleanor M. Josaitis, \n     a suburban housewife, who were inspired to establish Focus: \n     HOPE by the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE is committed to bringing together \n     people of all races, faiths, and economic backgrounds to \n     overcome injustice and build racial harmony, and it has grown \n     to one of the largest nonprofit organizations in Michigan.\n       Whereas the Focus: HOPE mission statement states: \n     ``Recognizing the dignity and beauty of every person, we \n     pledge intelligent and practical action to overcome racism, \n     poverty and injustice. And to build a metropolitan community \n     where all people may live in freedom, harmony, trust and \n     affection. Black and white, yellow, brown and red from \n     Detroit and its suburbs of every economic status, national \n     origin and religious persuasion we join in this covenant.'';\n       Whereas one of Focus: HOPE's early efforts was to support \n     African American and female employees in a seminal class \n     action suit against AAA, resulting in one of the finest \n     affirmative action commitments made by any corporation up to \n     that time;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE helped to conceive of and develop the \n     Department of Agriculture's Commodity Supplemental Food \n     Program which has been replicated in 32 states, and through \n     this program Focus: HOPE helps to feed 43,000 people per \n     month throughout Southeast Michigan;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has revitalized several city blocks in \n     central Detroit by redeveloping obsolete industrial \n     buildings, beautifying and landscaping Oakman Boulevard, \n     creating pocket parks, and rehabilitating homes in the \n     surrounding areas;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's Machinist Training Institute has been \n     training individuals from Detroit and beyond for careers in \n     advanced manufacturing and precision machining since 1981, \n     and has sent forth nearly 2,500 certified graduates, \n     providing an opportunity for primarily under-represented \n     minority youth, women, and others to gain access to the \n     financial mainstream and learn in-demand skills;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE, with assistance from Michigan, the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, and other \n     generous private and public partners, has within the last two \n     years invested over $10 million to complete the renovation of \n     the industrial building housing its Machinist Training \n     Institute;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has recognized that manufacturing and \n     information technologies are key to the economic growth and \n     security of Michigan and the United States, and is committed \n     to designing programs that would contribute to the \n     participation of under-represented urban individuals in these \n     critical sectors;\n       Whereas, in 1982, Focus: HOPE began a for-profit subsidiary \n     that was initiated for community economic development \n     purposes and is now designated with Federal HUBZone status;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE created two pioneering programs--FAST \n     TRACK and First Step--designed to help individuals improve \n     their reading and math competencies by a minimum of two grade \n     levels in 4-7 weeks;\n       Whereas these programs have graduated over 7,000 \n     individuals since their inception, a new offsite training \n     facility in Detroit's Empowerment Zone in southwest Detroit \n     has been established to reach out to individuals in other \n     parts of the city, and the success of the programs has \n     inspired Michigan (in its State-wide FAST BREAK program) and \n     other States to replicate the efforts of Focus: HOPE;\n       Whereas, in 1987, Focus: HOPE reclaimed and renovated an \n     abandoned building and opened it as a Center for Children, \n     which has now served over 5,000 children of colleagues, \n     students, and neighbors with quality child care, including \n     latchkey, early childhood education, and other educational \n     services;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE, through an unprecedented co-operative \n     agreement between the Departments of Defense, Commerce, \n     Education, and Labor, established a National demonstration \n     project--the Center for Advanced Technologies--in which \n     candidates earn associates and bachelors degrees in either \n     manufacturing engineering or technology, and engage in hands-\n     on manufacturing with-in-real world conditions, producing \n     parts for DaimlerChrysler, Detroit Diesel, Ford Motor \n     Company, General Motors Corporation, the Department of \n     Defense, and others;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has caused over $22 million to be \n     invested in renovating a previously obsolete building to \n     house the Center for Advanced Technologies, transforming the \n     building into a model facility for 21st century advanced \n     manufacturing, education, and research;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has made outstanding contributions \n     toward increasing diversity within the traditional \n     homogeneous science, math, engineering, and technology \n     fields, and 95 percent of currently enrolled degree \n     candidates are African American, representing perhaps the \n     United States' largest producer of bachelor-degreed minority \n     graduates in manufacturing engineering;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's unique research and development \n     partnership with the Department of Defense has resulted in a \n     nationally recognized demonstration project, the Mobile Parts \n     Hospital, whose Rapid Manufacturing System has recently been \n     deployed to Kuwait in support of the Armed Forces' current \n     operations in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE began a community arts program in 1995, \n     presenting multicultural arts programming and gallery \n     exhibitions designed to educate and encourage area residents, \n     while fostering integration in a culturally diverse \n     metropolitan community, and over 43,000 people have viewed \n     sponsored exhibits or participated in this program;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE established an Information Technologies \n     Center in 1999, providing Detroit students with industry-\n     certified training programs in network administration, \n     network installation, and desktop and server administration, \n     and has graduated nearly 475 students to date, and has \n     initiated, in collaboration with industry and academia, the \n     design of a new bachelors degree program to educate \n     information management systems engineers;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's initiatives and programs have been \n     nationally recognized for excellence and leadership by such \n     organizations as the Government Accounting Office, the \n     Department of Labor, the International Standards \n     Organization, the National Science Foundation, the Cisco \n     Networking Academy Program, Fortune Magazine, Forbes \n     Magazine, the Aspen Institute, and many others, and former \n     Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton have visited \n     Focus: HOPE's campus;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE is currently led by Eleanor M. \n     Josaitis, its co-founder and chief executive officer, and she \n     has received honorary degrees from 11 outstanding \n     universities and colleges, was named one of the 100 \n     Most Influential Women in 2002 by Crain's Detroit \n     Business, has been inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall \n     of Fame, has received the Detroit NAACP Presidential \n     Award, the Arab American Institute Foundation's Kahlil \n     Gibran Spirit of Humanity Award, as well as many other \n     awards;\n       Whereas through the generous partnerships and support of \n     individuals from all walks of life, Federal, State, and local \n     government, and foundations and corporations across the \n     United States, the vision of Focus: HOPE will continue to \n     grow and inspire;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has been blessed with an active board \n     of directors and advisory board from the senior most levels \n     of corporate and public America, and has benefited from an \n     annual average of 25,000 volunteers and countless colleagues;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has been a tremendous force for good in \n     the City of Detroit, the State of Michigan, and the United \n     States for the past 35 years;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE continues to strive to eliminate \n     racism, poverty, and injustice through the use of passion, \n     persistence, and partnerships, and continues to seek \n     improvement in its quality of service and program operations; \n     and\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE and its colleagues will continue to \n     identify ways in which it can lead Detroit, the State of \n     Michigan, and the United States into the future with creative \n     urban leadership initiatives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) congratulates and salutes Focus: HOPE for its \n     remarkable commitment and contributions to Detroit, the State \n     of Michigan, and the United States; and\n       (2) directs the Secretary of the Senate to make available \n     enrolled copies of this resolution to Focus: HOPE and Ms. \n     Eleanor M.
