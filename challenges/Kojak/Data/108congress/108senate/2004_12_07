Mr. President, this morning we return for what I \npersonally hope--and we all hope--is a very short and productive \nsession. We are currently waiting on House action on the intelligence \nreform conference report, and that should occur today. We will consider \nthat measure whenever it arrives from the House. After consultations \nwith the Democratic leadership,\nNOTICE\n\nIf the 108th Congress, 2d Session, adjourns sine die on or before \nDecember 10, 2004, a final issue of the Congressional Record for \nthe 108th Congress, 2d Session, will be published on Monday, \nDecember 20, 2004, in order to permit Members to revise and extend \ntheir remarks.\nAll material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \ndelivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \nDebates (Room HT-60 or S-123 of the Capitol), Monday through \nFriday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through \nMonday, December 20. The final issue will be dated Monday, December \n20, 2004, and will be delivered on Tuesday, December 21, 2004.\nNone of the material printed in the final issue of the \nCongressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any \nevent that occurred after the sine die date.\nSenators' statements should also be submitted electronically, \neither on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to \nthe Official Reporters of Debates at ``Record@Sec.Senate.gov''.\nMembers of the House of Representatives' statements may also be \nsubmitted electronically by e-mail, to accompany the signed \nstatement, and formatted according to the instructions for the \nExtensions of Remarks template at http://clerk.house.gov/forms. The \nOfficial Reporters will transmit to GPO the template formatted \nelectronic file only after receipt of, and authentication with, the \nhard copy, and signed manuscript. Deliver statements to the \nOfficial Reporters in Room HT-60.\nMembers of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material \nsubmitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by \ncontacting the Office of Congressional Publishing Services, at the \nGovernment Printing Office, on 512-0224, between the hours of 8:00 \na.m. and 4:00 p.m. daily.\nBy order of the Joint Committee on Printing.\n                                                                \nROBERT W. NEY, Chairman.\n\n[[Page S11858]]\n\nwe announced yesterday that there will be no rollcall votes today. We \nrecognize people's schedules are complex and people are coming back but \nthat people\nare literally all over the country right now and waiting on House \naction. Therefore, we felt it would be next to impossible to have a \nrollcall vote today and so we let people know yesterday.\n  Further, we are in discussions and it is still possible for us to \nconsider the intelligence reform conference report without the need for \na rollcall vote. That is under discussion, and we are talking to all \nour Members. I did want to mention that publicly early on so we can \ncontinue that discussion over the course of today.\n  With regard to the schedule, because there is some uncertainty, by \nnecessity, given the fact we must wait on House action before bringing \nit to a vote, I encourage all Members who wish to speak on this \nlegislation to come to the floor today and speak. Earlier is \npreferable, in the event that when a vote is scheduled, we would like \nto move to that vote in a relatively expeditious way.\n  If we are able to complete or able to clear the conference report, \nthen it is my hope we could pass the measure in short order, and it \nwould be my preference to deal with it on a voice vote, without a \nrollcall vote, if that is possible and if our colleagues agree to that.\n  If a vote becomes necessary, then we would, in all likelihood, \nschedule that vote for sometime tomorrow, and in discussions with the \nDemocratic leadership, we would pick an appropriate time to do that. \nAgain, we will do our best to accommodate all our Members' schedules, \nand we are working on that right now.\n  In the interim, there are a few remaining legislative and executive \nmatters we may be able to clear. We have been working on that over the \ncourse of yesterday and today, and we will continue to do that. We will \nprocess many of those cleared items before we finish our business. We \nwill not be taking up new business. We will be stressing the importance \nof finishing business for this Congress, and, in all likelihood, we \nwill be doing that by the end of the day tomorrow. We could even finish \nby the end of the day today. It depends on the House activity.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11858-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, while the distinguished Republican leader is \non the floor, I wish to make a couple of statements. It is good we \nfinished, finally, the bill on which the Presiding Officer worked so \nhard, the Omnibus spending bill. It will now be sent to the President. \nIt is a few weeks overdue, but at least it is done right.\n  The provision dealing with the Internal Revenue Service is out of \nthat bill. We learned how it was put in the bill. I am confident and \nhopeful that will not happen in the future.\n  I extend my appreciation to the Democratic leader of the House of \nRepresentatives, Representative Pelosi, for making sure there was a \nvote on this measure. It sends a good message to the people of America.\n  I also extend my congratulations to Senators Lieberman and Collins \nfor their brilliant work on this 9/11 bill. We had a true conference on \nthat bill. No one can dispute there was anything done in the darkness \nof night. The people appointed to that conference committee worked long \nand hard to come up with what we will vote on either tonight or \ntomorrow.\n  There have been times when, on this side, we have complained how the \nconferences have worked. On that bill, it worked the way it is supposed \nto work. Senators Lieberman and Collins have worked well together. This \nlegislation, while imperfect, is still in keeping with the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and the American people are \ngoing to be safer as soon as this legislation is signed by the \nPresident.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague, the Republican leader, on our \nside the only two requests for speeches I have on the 9/11 bill are \nSenator Leahy, who wants to speak for a relatively short period of \ntime, and Senator Byrd, who will want to speak for a fairly long period \nof time.\n  In addition, I have had requests from Senator Dorgan and Senator \nGraham of Florida that they want to be able to speak sometime during \nthe day as in morning business.\n  Those are the only indications we have today on this side of the \naisle. As I indicated, Senator Byrd may want to speak for an extended \nperiod of time. I do not know if that means an hour, 2 hours, or 3 \nhours, whatever it is. We will check with him and find out when he will \nbe able to speak.\n  It is my understanding we could get the bill from the House sometime \nas early as this afternoon. If that is the case, then I hope there is a \ndecision made by those who, in the past, have said they want a vote on \nthis measure whether they are going to require a vote. If they do, as I \nindicated to the Democrats, some people have to fly a long way to get \nback here for a vote tomorrow. We will keep the Republican leader \nadvised during the day as to what we have on our side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as you have just heard from both leaders, \nrequests have been made for people to come to the floor today. Although \nI know people's schedules are so complicated, we will do our best to \nkeep people posted over the course of the day and come to the floor and \nmake periodic announcements as to progress being made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11858-3", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11858-S11860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INTELLIGENCE REFORM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to make a statement with regard to \nwhat I regard as a truly historic point for our Nation's security as we \ncomplete action on the National Security Intelligence Reform Act of \n2004.\n  Those people who have not been directly involved in the negotiations \nhave followed it from afar and are aware that an agreement--some people \nwould say a tentative agreement but an agreement--has been reached on \nthis National Security Intelligence Reform Act.\n  As just mentioned, it is our understanding that the conference report \nin all likelihood will be introduced and passed in the House today. The \nSenate will then address the bill and send it to the President for his \nsignature.\n  I extend my deep thanks and appreciation to Senators Susan Collins \nand Joseph Lieberman. Their steady leadership, their continued \ncommitment, and their constant focus on passage of this bill kept the \nwhole process moving forward from day one, and I will review that \nhistory shortly. I thank them on behalf of leadership, and America \nthanks them.\n  The 9/11 intelligence bill constitutes the most comprehensive and \nsweeping reform of the intelligence community since the National \nSecurity Act of 1947. This bill sets into motion a variety of reforms \nthat over time will greatly improve our Nation's ability to fight the \nwar on terror. I thank Governor Thomas Kean and Representative Lee \nHamilton for their dedicated leadership of the 9/11 Commission. They \nhave done a truly outstanding job. Their hard work and thorough \nanalysis forms the basis of the 9/11 bill.\n  The 9/11 Commission's main recommendations that are addressed in this \nbill include the following: establishment of a new director of national \nintelligence who will oversee the intelligence community with enhanced \nbudgetary and personnel authorities; creation of a national \ncounterterrorism center that will coordinate and unify our \ncounterterrorism efforts; ensure effective information sharing and \nconduct strategic operation planning; initiation of a wide range of \nother measures to improve information sharing, cooperation and \ncoordination and team work between agencies in the intelligence \ncommunity, such as the CIA and the FBI; establishment of a civil \nliberties board and authority to designate an IG; and a provision that \nwill ensure that the chain of command is preserved and that statutory \nresponsibilities on the heads of departments are not abrogated.\n  The legislation will also improve the functioning of the FBI, enhance \nour\n\n[[Page S11859]]\n\nNation's transportation security, including aviation and maritime \nsecurity; improve border and immigration enforcement; and strengthen \nterrorism prevention by tackling issues ranging from lone wolf \nterrorists and money laundering to terrorist hoaxes and people \nproviding material support to the terrorists.\n  The conference report also covers the role of diplomacy, foreign aid, \nand the military in the war on terrorism and addresses a variety of \nmatters dealing with national preparedness such as infrastructure \nprotection and communications capabilities.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention this bill also includes a \nprovision I introduced on the Senate floor, the establishment of a \nnational counterproliferation center. While the national \ncounterterrorism center focuses on the customers and the users of these \ndangerous technologies and materials, the counterproliferation center \nwill focus on shutting down the supply network and the brokers such as \nPakistani nuclear scientist AQ Khan.\n  We know our enemy is ruthless and is seeking ways to maximize harm \nagainst the American people. In order to stop them, we and our allies \nmust detect, deter, halt, and roll back the trafficking of weapons of \nmass destruction and their delivery systems and related materials. We \ncannot allow the terrorists to get their hands on these materials. We \nknow that if they do, they will endeavor to use them. \nCounterproliferation is critical to fighting and winning the war on \nterror.\n\n  My provision gives the President time and flexibility to establish \nthe center based on the findings of a commission he has looking into \nthe issue of weapons of mass destruction proliferation and to make sure \nit is well integrated with this proliferation security initiative, the \nPSI.\n  Just as we must take the offensive in the global war on terrorism, we \nmust similarly take the offensive in stopping the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. Our current nonproliferation efforts are a \ngood defense but they are not sufficient. We need a strong offense. A \nnew national center aggressively pursuing and coordinating \ncounterproliferation is crucial. It is in the bill and will be a part \nof this legislation.\n  I am gratified by the bipartisan efforts that have brought this \nreform, along with the rest of the 9/11 bill, to fruition. We will see \nthat bipartisan support play out in the vote later on this floor and on \nthe floor of the House most likely later today. I thank my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle and in both Houses of Congress for their \nunflagging dedication and commitment to America's best interests.\n  In July, as the Congress was preparing to recess for the summer, the \n9/11 Commission released its final report outlining the events leading \nup to the 9/11 attacks. This report identified a number of serious \nfailings that required immediate action. It included an extensive \nsection on recommendations to improve our Nation's security. That same \nday I discussed with the Democratic leader the urgent need for the \nSenate to act and to act responsibly and begin that action immediately.\n  Senator Daschle and I immediately set the process in motion for the \nSenate to respond legislatively, and in a bipartisan manner, to the 9/\n11 Commission's report, and we did just that. Given its central role in \nmonitoring the organization and operations of the Federal Government, \nwe asked the Governmental Affairs Committee to take the lead on this \nissue.\n  Beyond the jurisdictional rationale behind this decision, the \nDemocratic leader and I both had great confidence in the ability of its \nchair, Senator Susan Collins, and the ranking member, Senator Joe \nLieberman, to forge that strong bipartisan partnership to closely \nconsult with the other key committees and to deliver a bill to the \nSenate floor in a deliberate, timely, and bipartisan manner.\n  To the Nation's great benefit, they succeeded. Over the August \nrecess, the Congress held two dozen committee hearings. We went \nnonstop. There was no rest. There has been no break in consideration of \nthis legislation since the 9/11 Commission report, even during every \nrecess. Over this August recess, four committees heard testimony from a \nmultiple of witnesses. We had hearings in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, the Intelligence Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the \nArmed Services Committee. Each committee carefully examined the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 report. Some prepared their own bills. \nOthers had their own legislative priorities. Senators Collins and \nLieberman then pulled all of this information and all of these \nrecommendations and proposals together and brought a bill to the Senate \nfloor in early October. Major sections of the bill were improved by \nadding titles taken from a separate bill drafted by Senators McCain and \nLieberman.\n  The McCain-Lieberman comprehensive bill included titles ranging from \ntransportation and aviation security to foreign policy and diplomacy \nbased on the recommendations proposed by the 9/11 Commission. Senator \nMcCain deserves great credit for being a driving force behind the \nestablishment of this Commission and for making sure the Commission's \nrecommendations were considered by the Senate.\n  The Collins-Lieberman bill was further improved by amendments offered \nby Senator John Warner to ensure the intelligence community's support \nfor and link to the warfighter were sustained, by Senator Pat Robert to \nensure the maximum efficiency and effectiveness of the new \norganization, and by other Members, such as Senator Jon Kyl, Senator \nLevin, and numerous others from both parties, to ensure that the Senate \ngot this right.\n  After 2 weeks of negotiation, debate, and amendments, the Senate \nvoted 96 to 2 on October 6 to overhaul the Nation's intelligence \ncommunity. Just after that, the Senate passed another important measure \nthat, as the 9/11 Commission urged, made critical reforms in the \nSenate, this institution's oversight of the intelligence community and \nhomeland security. This effort was successfully led by Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Reid, and we give our appreciation and thanks to \nthem.\n  Today, after nearly 2 months of tough and rigorous negotiation with \nthe House, long hours and long weekends poring over the legislative \ntext, we stand on the verge of one of the most significant legislative \naccomplishments of this Congress. Senators Collins and Lieberman and \ntheir staffs have, again, served the Senate well. They made tough \nconcessions, but they did so by keeping our national security front and \ncenter at every moment. They labored tirelessly to get this bill done. \nI appreciate their sacrifice of many hours and weekends in service to \nour country.\n  Likewise, Speaker Denny Hastert has been constantly engaged in ever \npushing Members and staff to reach a solution and to further improve \nthe legislation. He has worked constantly on this bill since early \nOctober. Because of his leadership, Speaker Hastert has earned wide \nrespect for bringing this improved bill to the House floor, and because \nof his hard work it will easily enjoy majority support.\n  I must also underscore that none of this would be possible were it \nnot for the superb and unflagging leadership of President Bush. His \nleadership was bold. His leadership called for meeting the greatest \nchallenge of our time: fighting the war on terror. He has stressed to \nme personally, again and again, the importance of passing this piece of \nlegislation. I commend the President on his steady commitment to make \nAmerica safer. On the day of the attacks, President Bush recognized \nimmediately that we were at war. Since then, he has made tough \ndecisions. He has made good decisions. Every day, the President is \nfollowing through to use the full range of our resources to combat the \nenemy.\n  In the 3 years since the 9/11 attacks, we have learned much about our \nNation's vulnerabilities, our strengths, and the steps we must take to \nprotect ourselves. During this time, the President and his Cabinet have \ninstituted a number of reforms, changes, and initiatives that, as the \n9/11 Commission reported, have made our Nation safer. The President \nmade further refinements and reforms based on the findings of the 9/11 \nCommission. Many of these, such as making the Terrorist Threat \nIntegration Center more capable and enhancing the powers of the DCI, \nwere undertaken by Executive order in August of this year.\n\n[[Page S11860]]\n\n  Finally, I wish to thank the real heroes behind this bill, the 9/11 \nfamilies who pushed and persevered to get this bill done. They turned \ntheir personal tragedy into public action so we all could be safer. As \npublic servant and fellow citizen, I salute these outstanding \nAmericans.\n\n  Strengthening America at home and abroad, moving America forward in \npursuit of freedom and prosperity, and protecting the American people \nand our homeland--these have been the driving motivations of the 108th \nCongress. I am very proud to have been a part of this effort. I am \nproud to have had that opportunity to lead the Senate during this \nmomentous time.\n  There is more to do. There is much more to do. This is an ongoing \nprocess, and we will not rest until our enemy is vanquished. But in \nthese final days, my fellow Americans can take note of and comfort in \nthis historic achievement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 483\n\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State and \n     international human rights organizations, the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China continues to commit widespread \n     and well-documented human rights abuses in Tibet;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China has yet to \n     demonstrate its willingness to abide by internationally \n     accepted standards of freedom of belief, expression, and \n     association by repealing or amending laws and decrees that \n     restrict those freedoms;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has detained hundreds of Tibetan nuns, monks, and lay persons \n     as political prisoners for speaking out against China's \n     occupation of Tibet and for their efforts to preserve Tibet's \n     distinct national identity;\n       Whereas Phuntsog Nyidron was arrested on October 14, 1989, \n     together with 5 other nuns, for participating in a peaceful \n     protest against China's occupation of Tibet;\n       Whereas, on February 26, 2004, following a sustained \n     international campaign on her behalf, the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China released Phuntsog Nyidron from \n     detention after she served more than 14 years of her 16-year \n     sentence;\n       Whereas Tenzin Delek, a prominent Tibetan religious leader, \n     and 3 other monks were arrested on April 7, 2002, during a \n     nighttime raid on Jamyang Choekhorling monastery in Nyagchu \n     County, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture;\n       Whereas, following a closed trial and more than 8 months of \n     incommunicado detention, Tenzin Delek and another Tibetan, \n     Lobsang Dhondup, were convicted of inciting separatism and \n     for their alleged involvement in a series of bombings on \n     December 2, 2002;\n       Whereas Lobsang Dhondup was sentenced to death and Tenzin \n     Delek was sentenced to death with a 2-year suspension;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     told senior officials of the United States and other \n     governments that the cases of Lobsang Dhondup and Tenzin \n     Delek would be subjected to a ``lengthy review'' by the \n     Supreme People's Court prior to the death sentences being \n     carried out;\n       Whereas the Supreme People's Court never carried out this \n     review, and Lobsang Dhondup was executed on January 26, 2003;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has failed to produce any evidence that either Lobsang \n     Dhondup or Tenzin Delek were involved in the crimes for which \n     they were convicted, despite repeated requests from officials \n     of the United States and other governments;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to imprison Tibetans for engaging in peaceful \n     efforts to protest China's repression of Tibetans and \n     preserve the Tibetan identity;\n       Whereas Tibetan political prisoners are routinely subjected \n     to beatings, electric shock, solitary confinement, and other \n     forms of torture and inhumane treatment while in Chinese \n     custody;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to exert control over religious and cultural \n     institutions in Tibet, abusing human rights through the \n     torture, arbitrary arrest, and detention without fair or \n     public trial of Tibetans who peacefully express their \n     political or religious views or attempt to preserve the \n     unique Tibetan identity; and\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has paroled individual political prisoners for good behavior \n     or for medical reasons in the face of strong international \n     pressure, but has failed to make the systemic changes \n     necessary to provide minimum standards of due process or \n     protections for basic civil and political rights: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China is in \n     violation of international human rights standards by \n     detaining and mistreating Tibetans who engage in peaceful \n     activities to protest China's repression of Tibetans or \n     promote the preservation of a distinct Tibetan identity;\n       (2) sustained international pressure on the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China is essential to improve the \n     human rights situation in Tibet and secure the release of \n     Tibetan political prisoners;\n       (3) the Government of the United States should--\n\n[[Page S11861]]\n\n       (A) raise the cases of Tenzin Delek and other political \n     prisoners at every opportunity with officials from the \n     People's Republic of China; and\n       (B) work with other governments concerned about human \n     rights in China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region and \n     other Tibetan areas, to encourage the release of political \n     prisoners and promote systemic improvement of human rights in \n     China; and\n       (4) the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     should, as a gesture of goodwill and in order to promote \n     human rights, immediately release all political prisoners, \n     including Tenzin Delek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11861-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTO AUTHORIZE GRANTS TO ESTABLISH ACADEMIES FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS OF \n                      AMERICAN HISTORY AND CIVICS\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Peace in Sudan \n     Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Government of sudan.--The term ``Government of Sudan'' \n     means the National Congress Party, formerly known as the \n     National Islamic Front, government in Khartoum, Sudan, or any \n     successor government formed on or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act (other than the coalition government \n     agreed upon in the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of \n     Peace in the Sudan signed on June 5, 2004).\n       (3) JEM.--The term ``JEM'' means the Justice and Equality \n     Movement.\n       (4) SLA.--The term ``SLA'' means the Sudan Liberation Army.\n       (5) SPLM.--The term ``SPLM'' means the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan, as \n     envisioned in the Sudan Peace Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) and \n     the Machakos Protocol of 2002, could be in jeopardy if the \n     parties do not implement and honor the agreements they have \n     signed.\n       (2) Since seizing power through a military coup in 1989, \n     the Government of Sudan repeatedly has attacked and \n     dislocated civilian populations in southern Sudan in a \n     coordinated policy of ethnic cleansing and genocide that has \n     cost the lives of more than 2,000,000 people and displaced \n     more than 4,000,000 people.\n       (3) In response to two decades of civil conflict in Sudan, \n     the United States has helped to establish an internationally \n     supported peace process to promote a negotiated settlement to \n     the war that has resulted in a framework peace agreement, the \n     Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan, \n     signed on June 5, 2004.\n       (4) At the same time that the Government of Sudan was \n     negotiating for a comprehensive and all inclusive peace \n     agreement, enumerated in the Nairobi Declaration on the Final \n     Phase of Peace in the Sudan, it refused to engage in any \n     meaningful discussion with regard to its ongoing campaign of \n     ethnic cleansing and genocide in the Darfur region of western \n     Sudan.\n       (5) The Government of Sudan reluctantly agreed to attend \n     talks to bring peace to the Darfur region only after \n     considerable international pressure and outrage was expressed \n     through high level visits by Secretary of State Colin Powell \n     and others, and through United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1556 (July 30, 2004).\n       (6) The Government of the United States, in both the \n     executive branch and Congress, has concluded that genocide \n     has been committed and may still be occurring in the Darfur \n     region, and that the Government of Sudan and militias \n     supported by the Government of Sudan, known as the Janjaweed, \n     bear responsibility for the genocide.\n       (7) Evidence collected by international observers in the \n     Darfur region between February 2003 and November 2004 \n     indicate a coordinated effort to target African Sudanese \n     civilians in a scorched earth policy, similar to that which \n     was employed in southern Sudan, that has destroyed African \n     Sudanese villages, killing and driving away their people, \n     while Arab Sudanese villages have been left unscathed.\n       (8) As a result of this genocidal policy in the Darfur \n     region, an estimated 70,000 people have died, more than \n     1,600,000 people have been internally displaced, and more \n     than 200,000 people have been forced to flee to neighboring \n     Chad.\n       (9) Reports further indicate the systematic rape of \n     thousands of women and girls, the abduction of women and \n     children, and the destruction of hundreds of ethnically \n     African villages, including the poisoning of their wells and \n     the plunder of their crops and cattle upon which the people \n     of such villages sustain themselves.\n       (10) Despite the threat of international action expressed \n     through United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 \n     (July 30, 2004) and 1564 (September 18, 2004), the Government \n     of Sudan continues to obstruct and prevent efforts to reverse \n     the catastrophic consequences that loom over the Darfur \n     region.\n       (11) In addition to the thousands of violent deaths \n     directly caused by ongoing Sudanese military and government-\n     sponsored Janjaweed attacks in the Darfur region, the \n     Government of Sudan has restricted access by humanitarian and \n     human rights workers to the Darfur area through intimidation \n     by military and security forces, and through bureaucratic and \n     administrative obstruction, in an attempt to inflict the most \n     devastating harm on those individuals displaced from their \n     villages and homes without any means of sustenance or \n     shelter.\n       (12) The Government of Sudan's continued support for the \n     Janjaweed and their obstruction of the delivery of food, \n     shelter, and medical care to the Darfur region is estimated \n     by the World Health Organization to be causing up to 10,000 \n     deaths per month and, should current conditions persist, is \n     projected to escalate to thousands of deaths each day by \n     December 2004.\n       (13) The Government of Chad served an important role in \n     facilitating the humanitarian cease-fire (the N'Djamena \n     Agreement dated April 8, 2004) for the Darfur region between \n     the Government of Sudan and the two opposition rebel groups \n     in the Darfur region (the JEM and the SLA), although both \n     sides have violated the cease-fire agreement repeatedly.\n       (14) The people of Chad have responded courageously to the \n     plight of over 200,000 Darfur refugees by providing \n     assistance to them even though such assistance has adversely \n     affected their own means of livelihood.\n       (15) On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin Powell \n     stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate: ``When we reviewed the evidence compiled by our team, \n     along with other information available to the State \n     Department, we concluded that genocide has been committed in \n     Darfur and that the Government of Sudan and the [Janjaweed] \n     bear responsibility--and genocide may still be occurring.''.\n       (16) The African Union has demonstrated renewed vigor in \n     regional affairs through its willingness to respond to the \n     crisis in the Darfur region, by convening talks between the \n     parties and deploying several hundred monitors and security \n     forces to the region, as well as by recognizing the need for \n     a far larger force with a broader mandate.\n       (17) The Government of Sudan's complicity in the atrocities \n     and genocide in the Darfur region raises fundamental \n     questions about the Government of Sudan's commitment to peace \n     and stability in Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE CONFLICT IN DARFUR, \n                   SUDAN.\n\n       (a) Sudan Peace Act.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     Sudan Peace Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) remains relevant and \n     should be extended to include the Darfur region of Sudan.\n       (b) Actions To Address the Conflict.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) a legitimate countrywide peace in Sudan will only be \n     possible if those principles enumerated in the 1948 Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, that are affirmed in the \n     Machakos Protocol of 2002 and the Nairobi Declaration on the \n     Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan signed on June 5, 2004, are \n     applied to all of Sudan, including the Darfur region;\n       (2) the parties to the N'Djamena Agreement (the Government \n     of Sudan, the JEM, and the SLA) must meet their obligations \n     under that Agreement to allow safe and immediate delivery of \n     all humanitarian assistance throughout the Darfur region and \n     must expedite the conclusion of a political agreement to end \n     the genocide and conflict in the Darfur region;\n       (3) the United States should continue to provide \n     humanitarian assistance to the areas of Sudan to which the \n     United States has access and, at the same time, implement a \n     plan to provide assistance to the areas of Sudan to which \n     access has been obstructed or denied;\n       (4) the international community, including African, Arab, \n     and Muslim nations, should immediately provide resources \n     necessary to save\n\n[[Page S11862]]\n\n     the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals at risk as \n     a result of the crisis in the Darfur region;\n       (5) the United States and the international community \n     should--\n       (A) provide all necessary assistance to deploy and sustain \n     an African Union Force to the Darfur region; and\n       (B) work to increase the authorized level and expand the \n     mandate of such forces commensurate with the gravity and \n     scope of the problem in a region the size of France;\n       (6) the President, acting through the Secretary of State \n     and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the \n     United Nations, should--\n       (A) condemn any failure on the part of the Government of \n     Sudan to fulfill its obligations under United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions 1556 (July 30, 2004) and 1564 \n     (September 18, 2004), and press the United Nations Security \n     Council to respond to such failure by immediately imposing \n     the penalties suggested in paragraph (14) of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1564;\n       (B) press the United Nations Security Council to pursue \n     accountability for those individuals who are found \n     responsible for orchestrating and carrying out the atrocities \n     in the Darfur region, consistent with relevant United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions; and\n       (C) encourage member states of the United Nations to--\n       (i) cease to import Sudanese oil; and\n       (ii) take the following actions against Sudanese Government \n     and military officials and other individuals, who are \n     planning, carrying out, or otherwise involved in the policy \n     of genocide in the Darfur region, as well as their families, \n     and businesses controlled by the Government of Sudan and the \n     National Congress Party:\n\n       (I) freeze the assets held by such individuals or \n     businesses in each such member state; and\n       (II) restrict the entry or transit of such officials \n     through each such member state;\n\n       (7) the President should impose targeted sanctions, \n     including a ban on travel and the freezing of assets, on \n     those officials of the Government of Sudan, including \n     military officials, and other individuals who have planned or \n     carried out, or otherwise been involved in the policy of \n     genocide in the Darfur region, and should also freeze the \n     assets of businesses controlled by the Government of Sudan or \n     the National Congress Party;\n       (8) the Government of the United States should not \n     normalize relations with Sudan, including through the lifting \n     of any sanctions, until the Government of Sudan agrees to, \n     and takes demonstrable steps to implement, peace agreements \n     for all areas of Sudan, including the Darfur region;\n       (9) those individuals found to be involved in the planning \n     or carrying out of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against \n     humanity should not hold leadership positions in the \n     Government of Sudan or the coalition government established \n     pursuant to the agreements reached in the Nairobi Declaration \n     on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan; and\n       (10) the Government of Sudan has a primary responsibility \n     to guarantee the safety and welfare of its citizens, which \n     includes allowing them access to humanitarian assistance and \n     providing them protection from violence.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I support H.R. 5365, a bill designed to \nensure that the thousands of pension plan participants and retirees for \nthe YMCA continue to be able to count on their benefits, ensuring the \npension plan may continue to operate as it has for over 80 years. The \nSenate passed my bill, S. 2589, by unanimous consent on July 14 of this \nyear, and I am pleased that the House has recently passed H.R. 5365, \nwhich closely follows the direction of the Senate legislation. I worked \ntogether with fellow Senators, including Senator Graham of Florida, to \nmove this process toward today's hopeful conclusion. I want to stress \nthat this effort has been a very bipartisan effort, in both the House \nand Senate, to produce a consensus solution and legislation.\n  I also thank Finance Committee Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member \nBaucus for their assistance in bringing this bill to the floor today.\n  This is a bill about protecting the retirement security for thousands \nof YMCA employees and retirees. I have heard from Kentucky YMCA leaders \nand employees--leaders such as R. Stephen Tarver of YMCA of Greater \nLouisville, Dean Ehrenheim of the Owensboro YMCA, and Kenneth Barnes, \nwho runs the Chestnut Street YMCA in Louisville, and countless YMCA \nemployees--about the importance of protecting retirement security. This \nlegislation addresses a concern about the technical status of the YMCA \npension plan as a church plan, a type of pension plan offered by \nchurches or associations of churches. This legislation will ensures \nthat the YMCA pension plan will be able to provide a secure retirement \nto the more than 80,000 plan participants.\n  I also thank the Treasury Department and IRS for their patience while \nthe Congress worked through finding a solution to ensure the YMCA \npension plan could continue to offer the benefits to its participants \nand retirees.\n  As I have stated, the YMCA pension plan is a very significant part of \neach YMCA employee's compensation package, most of whom are modestly \npaid. I have heard from many of the Kentucky YMCAs, and their \nemployees, about the importance of this pension plan to their future. \nIn Kentucky alone, there are 19 YMCAs with over 485,000 members, and \n918 pension plan participants, retirees or past employees who have \nvested benefits. Today's legislation is vitally important to the each \nand every plan participant in Kentucky and their families, and more \nthan 80,000 participants and retirees in the YMCA pension plan, \noffering them financial and retirement security for their long service \non behalf of our Nation's YMCA.\n  In closing, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill, \nand I am pleased that we are moving forward with this legislation today \nand look forward to its enactment soon.\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, where were you on December 7, 1941? There \nare some of us who can remember that day. I was around 6 or 7 years \nold. I remember being on that small farm where I was raised. We were \ndoing the evening chores when my mother--we did not have electricity in \nthose days so you had a battery-operated radio and you did not turn on \nthe radio until the evening. But mom had turned on the radio and the \nnewscast was that Japan had attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor. \nWhen she told dad about that--I remember dad had two feed buckets in \nhis hands--he said: ``Where in the world is Pearl Harbor?'' We did not \neven know where it was.\n  At 6 o'clock in the morning, Pearl Harbor time, 183 Japanese aircraft \nwere launched from six major fleet carriers and flew toward Oahu. At \n7:02 a.m. Honolulu time, the Japanese aircraft were spotted on their \napproach to Oahu, and they were mistaken for a flight of B-17 Flying \nFortresses on an approach to the islands. At 7:15 a.m., a second wave \nof 167 Japanese planes departed the fleet carriers for Pearl Harbor. At \n7:55 a.m., the attack on Pearl Harbor began, with the first Japanese \ndive-bomber appearing over Pearl Harbor. It was followed by a first \nwave of nearly 200 aircraft, including torpedo planes, bombers, and \nfighters.\n  The ships in our fleet were sitting ducks, all gathered up in one \nplace. The anchored ships in the harbor made perfect targets for those \nbombers, and since it was Sunday morning--a time chosen by the Japanese \nfor maximum surprise--they were not fully manned. In fact, back in \nthose days in the Navy, half of the crew on the ships was on liberty.\n  Most of the damage to the battleships was inflicted in the first 30 \nminutes of the assault. The Arizona, which still lies in state, so to \nspeak, at that harbor, sank. The Oklahoma was capsized. The California, \nNevada, and West Virginia sank in shallow water. In all, more than 180 \naircraft were destroyed. U.S. military casualties totaled about 3,400.\n  That was a fateful day in 1941. Tied up to the Arizona was a ship, \nthe USS Vestal. A good friend of mine, a member of our church, and his \ntwo brothers were on that ship. It was a repair ship. They were working \non the Arizona. He said he remembers that day like it was yesterday. \nGlenn Sahlgren is gone now. I spent many hours on the Big Horn River \nfishing with him. I told him: When they find our bones one of these \ndays, they will be down here on this river with a fly pole in our hand. \nHe said: Conrad, every day since December 8, 1941, has been a bonus to \nme. He and his two brothers were raised in Saco, MT. All three of them \nwere in the Navy and on that ship, and it too sank. All three survived \nthat fateful morning.\n  They were young Americans, hit by surprise. Now we are talking about \nanother intelligence bill on the heels of 9/11. There were 3,581 \nkilled, missing, and wounded. In my State alone, on the USS Arizona, \nMontana lost seven of its finest: Lloyd Daniel, Jerald Dellum, Joseph \nMarling, Earl Morrison, Robert Pearson, Harold Scilley, and George \nSmart.\n  Of course, that attack launched America into World War II where it \nsuffered even more losses. Thousands of men and women died in World War \nII, but it changed the face of the world and gave us the freedoms we \nenjoy today. None of us here earned those; we inherited them. What Tom \nBrokaw called ``the greatest generation'' is a true statement. For \nafter that attack, this country bound up its wounds and didn't look \nback. We honored those who were lost, and we built a better peace.\n  As this holiday season approaches and we gather around friends and \nfamily, it is important that we count our blessings. Most of those \nblessings were inherited and not earned. We remember those who went \nbefore us. We turn to this holiday and think about those families who \nare missing someone either because a family member died for their \ncountry or he or she is standing tall on foreign soil around the world.\n  One characteristic about Americans, we have always thought about the \nnext generation. Those who answered the call in 1941 knew full well it \nwas worth the sacrifice so that their families, their children and \ngrandchildren, would never be vulnerable to anything like that again. \nWe are witnessing today's greatest generation also. They understand the \nrisk and the mission, but they also understand their families and what \nthis great country stands for--we tend to forget that every now and \nagain--because they, too, think it is worth the sacrifice so their \nchildren and grandchildren will not live under the pall of terrorism, \nperpetrated on the world from the shadows by faceless people. Today we \nhave brave military men and women again, just as those who have gone \nbefore them, standing on alert, securing our freedoms, guarding the \ninnocent abroad. I salute their bravery and their sacrifice, and I ask \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  This December 7 is a reminder of where we have been, how we reacted, \nwhat we have done, and the challenges to be faced in the future by \nyoung folks who are willing to pay the price.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11864-2", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11864-S11865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LES BROWNLEE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak \nabout a truly remarkable American who, after serving his country with \nremarkable competence and quiet excellence, has moved on with little \nfanfare.\n  I am talking about Les Brownlee, a man we worked with very closely \nfor a long period of time. So often you learn to love these people when \nyou work with them over the years, and then they move on and you \nprepare to miss them, as we will.\n  Les Brownlee would probably not want me to talk about him. He \nnormally avoids that type of thing. He shunned public recognition for \nhis achievements, while compiling a stellar record of support and \nleadership for the men and women of the U.S. Army.\n  Mr. Brownlee was a highly decorated Vietnam veteran and executive \nofficer to Army Under Secretary James Ambrose when he retired as a \ncolonel in the U.S. Army in 1984. The experience he gained during his \ntime in uniform made him an attractive candidate to advise my colleague \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner.\n  Mr. Brownlee served on Senator Warner's staff for several years \nbefore joining the Senate Armed Services Committee as a professional \nstaff member, where I worked with him for 7 years. From 1994, when I \nfirst came from the House to the Senate, until 2001, when he accepted a \njob as Under Secretary of the Army, Mr. Brownlee proved his expertise \nagain and again while deflecting the accolades he deserved.\n  It is hard to conceive of a more tumultuous time for an acting \nSecretary of the Army to hold that position. From the events of 9/11, \nwhich helped convince Mr. Brownlee to take the Under Secretary \nposition, to the campaigns of Afghanistan and Iraq, to the myriad \nchallenges faced by the Army today, these times are like no other. In \nthe face of these daunting events, Mr. Brownlee provided incredibly \nstrong leadership from the top without losing touch with the personal \nintegrity that characterizes the finest members of the Army he oversaw. \nMoreover, while executing the high-level concerns of his office, he \nalso worked to ensure that the pressing needs of individual soldiers \nwere met. He reflected on the old days, and he knew he had the instinct \nas to what those needs were. I am thinking particularly of the need for \nmore and better body armor for our troops.\n  My only disappointment now is that Mr. Brownlee is moving on. It is \nclear his successors will have big shoes to fill, and the trajectory \nthat Mr. Brownlee set for the service and coordination with the \nSecretary of Defense\n\n[[Page S11865]]\n\nand Joint Chiefs is one that will lead to transformation and victory in \nour current engagements and dominance in the decades to come. Perhaps \nmore importantly, Mr. Brownlee has established a gold standard for \ncharacter to which all of our military personnel should aspire.\n  I thank him for his service, the time he spent, and the dedication \nand commitment he made to his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11865-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11865-S11868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Lance Corporal Lamont Noel Wilson\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I stand today to honor a brave young \nAmerican who gave his life defending our Nation. He felt a call to \nserve his country, to be part of something bigger than himself, and, \nultimately, paid the highest price.\n  LCpl Lamont Wilson, of Lawton, OK, was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 1st \nMarine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, \nfrom Camp Pendleton, CA. His parents, Lanny and Florence Wilson, still \nlive in Lawton, where he graduated from Eisenhower High School in 2003. \nBy June, he was already serving as a marine, fulfilling a military \ndream Lamont kept alive since childhood. When asked why he joined the \nMarines, Lamont explained it was to make his father proud.\n  On September 6, in Fallujah, Lamont was killed in combat. He gave his \nlife for the freedom of millions of Americans and also for the peace \nand prosperity of the Iraqi people crippled by a totalitarian regime. \nHis funeral, held at St. John's Missionary Baptist Church in Lawton, \nwas a joyous celebration of Lamont's life and service to God and \ncountry. Although the loss of this young man is a loss we all feel, our \nthoughts and prayers are especially with his family and friends.\n  Lamont's dedicated service showed the spirit that drives us to fight \noppression around the world. He knew that he and his fellow marines \nwere fighting to protect America, to keep their Nation safe. The way \nLamont signed letters he wrote home--``Sleep Well, America''--embodied \nthe noble spirit of sacrifice in the hearts of the men and women in our \nArmed Forces. It is for men like Lance Corporal Wilson that I am proud \nto be a part of this great country. He was a special marine but, more \nimportantly, a special man.\n  Several of us who have spent time over in Afghanistan and Iraq have \ntalked to these young people there, the young troops. They sometimes \nask the question: Why is it that people don't appreciate us? It is \nbecause they get kind of a perverted media over there that doesn't \nreally understand what the war is all about. I gave them my assurance \nthat we understand the sacrifices they make, that we are at the most \nthreatened position today this country has ever been in, and it is \npeople like you who are keeping and preserving our freedom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Brigadier General Charles ``Ben'' Allen\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is not very often that one has the \nopportunity to talk about someone they knew personally. We have so many \nfallen heroes in Iraq and in this war on terror. Those who have spent \nany time on the Armed Services Committee know that right now we are in \nthe most threatened position our country has ever been in.\n  Today, I honor the memory of a really remarkable man whom I had the \nhonor of meeting. In fact, I had the honor of meeting this man over in \nIraq. It was around the time the U.N. building was bombed and I \nhappened to be there at the time. He was over there with General \nGriffin, and I am speaking of BG Charles ``Ben'' Allen. He was a \nclassic Oklahoman, a hard worker and leader who was dedicated to his \nfamily, his faith, and his country.\n  General Allen was an assistant commander in the 4th Infantry Division \nand was killed along with six other soldiers in the Blackhawk \nhelicopter crash in central Texas.\n  Although he was born in Alaska, Ben Allen grew up in the Lawton/Fort \nSill, OK, area, an Army town where the artillery is king of battle and \nfamiliar to all.\n  The son of an Army colonel, he graduated from Eisenhower High School \nin Lawton and went on to study at Lawton's Cameron University where he \ngraduated from the ROTC program and was commissioned into the \nartillery.\n  General Allen's career was a long and distinguished one and included \nassignments with the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, WA, the 70th \nField Artillery Detachment in Greece, the 7th Infantry Division at Fort \nOrd, CA, and the 9th Field Artillery in Heilbronn, Germany, the 101st \nAirborne Division at Fort Campbell, KY, where he was the operations \nofficer for division artillery during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, \nand the 24th and 3rd Infantry Divisions at Fort Stewart, GA.\n  Allen then served as the J5 Balkans Branch Chief for the Joint staff \nat the Pentagon, after which he commanded the 4th Infantry Division's \nartillery and served in several positions under the Army deputy chief \nof staff for programming before returning to the 4th ID.\n  It is often said that when a soldier chooses a branch of service, he \nalso is choosing the hometown of his future wife. Ben changed the order \nof that expectation. He and Cindy were college sweethearts at Cameron. \nIn college, Cindy was a serious student who shared Ben's competitive \nspirit. For fun, the couple would compete for the highest GPA.\n  When Ben graduated from Cameron's ROTC program, he asked Cindy to \nmarry him. She has been a partner, a friend, and a source of strength \nand truth, a cherished wife and beloved mother.\n  Cindy is a teacher by trade. For her, life in the military was a \npositive challenge which she took on with the same focused energy Ben \nshowed whenever the Allens arrived at the new assignment. Cindy \neducated herself about each new duty assignment. She managed each move \nin an organized and disciplined way.\n  A lot of people do not understand what this is like for a family to \nbe moved around this way, but Cindy handled it very well. Her \nleadership, responsibility, duty, love, and calm made her the perfect \npartner in life and love for this soldier. Even in this dark hour, \nCindy is strong, dignified, and helping others cope with their losses \nas well.\n\n  Although General Allen was a man who faced the foes of the world with \nsteely resolve, he stood no chance when it came to his only daughter, \nLaura, who is a 20-year-old student at George Mason University. Ben and \nLaura had a special father-daughter relationship fortified by great \nhumor, warmth, understanding, and natural affection, a bond that will \nendure in her heart forever. She will always be his little girl.\n  I remember talking to him about this because my youngest daughter \nKatie and I also have that. To this day, I still call her my little \ngirl. That is the relationship Ben had with Laura.\n  As the saying goes, like father like son, we likewise send our \nheartfelt condolences to General Allen's son Brian who is attending the \nUniversity of Virginia on an ROTC scholarship. So we are talking now \nabout the third generation. Brian and Ben shared many great times \ntogether watching their favorite teams, the Boston Red Sox and the \nDallas Cowboys, and of course the University of Oklahoma, the No. 1 \nteam in the Nation.\n  Whatever career path Brian chooses, he will have the life and \naccomplishments of a great and courageous man to serve as a bright and \nshining example for selfless service.\n  I will also share several thoughts about GEN Ben Allen that I have \nheard from some of my constituents who knew him. Many of these folks \nattended the memorial service held yesterday at Fort Sill. I was unable \nto be there because of votes here but I believe their comments say even \nmore about the man, Ben Allen, than the long record of honorable \nservice I just read.\n  Here are their words:\n\n       Ben Allen was known to be a soldier's soldier. He cared \n     about his troops and he enthusiastically led his troops to \n     achieve victory both on and off the battlefield. He was also \n     a soldier's son. Ben was the beloved son of a career Army \n     officer.\n\n\n[[Page S11866]]\n\n\n  His father was a colonel.\n\n       Ben had a special talent for maintaining friendships. When \n     he arrived at new duty stations, he made a special effort to \n     seek out and reconnect with friends and colleagues from \n     previous assignments. Whether on the golf course or standing \n     on the bank of one of his favorite fishing holes, Ben could \n     make you feel as though only days had passed since he last \n     saw you.\n       Ben was a man of faith, with a great sense of humor. He \n     worked hard and expected the best from himself and from his \n     troops. He loved his family, the Army, his life, and his \n     country.\n\n  One friend suggested that this quotation from John Ruskin would be \nfitting in describing the way Ben Allen lived his life:\n\n       Tis a good and safe rule to sojourn in many places, as if \n     you meant to spend your life there, never omitting an \n     opportunity of doing a kindness or speaking a true word or \n     making a friend.\n\n  In this time of trouble and tragedy, we remember and pay tribute to \nGeneral Allen and also to the many other Americans who do dangerous \nwork not only overseas in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, but \nwithin our own borders. Soldiering is a risky job. I am a veteran of \nthe U.S. Army. I know there is no time you are not risking your life if \nyou take this career. We should be grateful there are people like \nGeneral Allen, people committed to defending freedom and truth, who are \nwilling to take those risks on our behalf.\n  We remember Cindy, Brian, and Laura Allen, as well as General Allen's \nmother, Christine Allen Harper. We grieve for them, for their fallen \nhusband and father and son. In his life and his death he set a high \nstandard for all of us to follow. As we travel onward together, we will \nnever forget BG Charles ``Ben'' Allen.\n  I know it is unusual to say something like this, but I have had \noccasion, just in the last few minutes, to talk to his wife Cindy. I \nrecall something that he said to me when we were together over in Iraq. \nI said to him, ``Do you know Jesus?''\n  He was very straightforward, and he said, ``Yes.''\n  I talked to his wife about that. There was no doubt in his mind. For \nsome who do not understand this, if you are a man of faith like Ben, we \ncan assure you it is not: Goodbye, Ben. He is with Jesus now. It is: So \nlong, we will see you soon.\n\n\n                         Corporal Bryan Wilson\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nOtterbein, IN. Corporal Bryan Wilson, twenty-two years old, died on \nDecember 1 as a result of injuries sustained in a Humvee crash in the \nAl Anbar Province. With his entire life before him, Bryan risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  After graduating from Seeger Memorial High School in 2001, Bryan \njoined the Marines. His mother-in-law, Linda, told the Lafayette \nJournal & Courier that Bryan ``knew when he graduated that he was going \nto be a Marine . . . He was very brave, and we're so proud of him. He \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for all of us.''\n  Bryan was the fortieth Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the 2nd \nBattalion, 11th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine \nExpeditionary Force, Camp Pendleton, California. This brave young \nsoldier leaves behind his wife Samantha; his parents Charles and Brenda \nWilson; his brothers Lonnie and Adam; and his 20-month-old daughter \nBreanne. May Bryan's daughter grow up knowing that her father fought \nbravely, giving his own life so that young Iraqis can some day know the \nfreedom she enjoys.\n  Today, I join Bryan's family, his friends and the entire Hoosier \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nBryan, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  Bryan was known for his dedication to serving others and his love of \nfamily and country. When looking back on Bryan's life, his wife \nSamantha told the Associated Press that he had been determined to serve \nhis country and that ``he would never have changed his mind about \ngoing.'' Today and always, Bryan will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Bryan's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Bryan's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Bryan Wilson in the official \nrecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about \nthis just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that \ncomes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Bryan's \ncan find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from \noff all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Bryan.\n\n\n                  Lance Corporal Adam R. Brooks, Usmc\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor LCpl \nAdam R. Brooks of Manchester, NH for his service and supreme sacrifice \nfor his country.\n  Lance Corporal Brooks demonstrated a willingness and dedication to \nserve and defend his country by joining the United States Marine Corps. \nHis enthusiasm and devotion to service were indicated early on by his \ndecision to enlist in the Delayed Entry Program which obligated him to \nthe Marines well before he graduated from Central High School in 2003. \nJust as many of America's heroes have taken up arms in the face of dire \nthreats, Adam, too, dedicated himself to the defense of our ideals, \nvalues, freedoms, and way of life. His valor and service cost him his \nlife, but earned him a place on the roll call of honor within the \npantheon of heroes this country has produced.\n  Adam reported to recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot \nParris Island in August 2003. Following his basic training, he \nvolunteered for and received further training as a rifleman in the \ninfantry. Upon completion of this training, he became a member of 1st \nBattalion, 2d Marines, 2d Marine Division. From this unit's home base \nin Camp Lejeune, NC, he would deploy to Iraq in pursuit of those who \nwould threaten our way of life.\n  Tragically, on November 28, 2004, Lance Corporal Brooks gave his last \nfull measure for our Nation during combat with the enemy in the Babil \nProvince of Iraq. Throughout his short career, Adam earned a series of \naccolades which testify to the dedication and devotion he held for the \nMarine Corps, his fellow Marines, and his country. Adam's hard work and \ndedication contributed greatly to his unit's successes and cemented his \nplace as a participant in the great endeavor known as America. Adam was \nrecognized for his service by the Purple Heart Medal, the National \nDefense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, \nand the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon.\n  My condolences and prayers go out to Adam's family, and I offer them \nmy deepest sympathies and most heartfelt thanks for the service, \nsacrifice, and example of their Marine, Lance Corporal Adam R. Brooks. \nAdam exemplified the words of Daniel Webster who said, ``God grants \nliberty only to those who love it, and are always ready to guard and \ndefend it.'' Because of his efforts, the liberty of this country is \nmade more secure.\n\n\n                       Specialist Alan J. Burgess\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the United States of America was founded on \na passion for freedom, personal liberties, and equality for all its \ncitizens. In a fierce battle for freedom and independence, the citizens \nof this new\n\n[[Page S11867]]\n\nworld cast off the shackles of tyranny and built for themselves a land \nof hope and promise. So fervently held were the beliefs and ideals of \nthis country, that a son of New Hampshire, General John Stark, reminded \nus of the price of our liberties with his admonishment to ``live free \nor die.'' The heroes and Founding Fathers of that long ago time have \nbeen joined by another noble son of New Hampshire, SPC Alan J. Burgess \nof Landaff. It is in his memory that I rise today to honor Alan for his \nservice and supreme sacrifice in the continuing defense of this country \nand for his relentless defense of freedom.\n  Specialist Burgess demonstrated a willingness and dedication to serve \nand defend his country by joining the National Guard after this country \nwas attacked in September 2001 and we had begun the task of destroying \nthe enemies of our country. Just as many of America's heroes have taken \nup arms in the face of dire threats, Alan too dedicated himself to the \ndefense of our ideals, values, freedoms, and way of life. His valor and \nservice cost him his life but earned him a place on the roll call of \nhonor within the pantheon of heroes this country has produced.\n  Following basic training, Alan joined his comrades in 2nd Battalion, \n197th Field Artillery Brigade, Army National Guard as a military \npoliceman and began training for his deployment to Iraq in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. From this unit's home base in Woodsville, NH, \nhe would deploy in March 2004 to Iraq in pursuit of those who would \nthreaten our way of life.\n  During his all too brief career, Alan accumulated a significant list \nof accolades and experiences which testify to the dedication and \ndevotion he held for the Army, his fellow soldiers, and his country. \nAlan's expertise contributed greatly to his unit's successes and \ncemented his place as a participant in the great endeavor known as \nAmerica. Alan was recognized for his service by the Bronze Star Medal, \nthe Purple Heart Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense \nService Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, and the \nArmy Reserve Overseas Service Ribbon.\n  I offer Alan's family my deepest sympathies and most heartfelt thanks \nfor the service, sacrifice, and example of their soldier, Specialist \nAlan Burgess. Alan exemplified the words of Daniel Webster who said, \n``God grants liberty only to those who love it, and are always ready to \nguard and defend it.'' Because of his efforts, the liberty of this \ncountry is made more secure.\n\n\n                         Specialist Daryl Davis\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a heroic \nAmerican, SPC Daryl Davis, a fellow Iowan originally from Spencer, IA. \nA member of the 144th Transportation Company of the Florida Army \nNational Guard, Specialist Davis was killed November 29, 2004 when his \nHumvee was involved in an accident traveling between military camps in \nIraq. Specialist Davis was serving as a gunner when the accident \noccurred. Daryl Davis graduated from Spencer High school and enlisted \nin the Iowa National Guard at age 17 before transferring to Florida \nearlier this year. Specialist Davis is survived by his mother and \nfather, Dana Davis and Richard Rosado, as well as two brothers. I know \nthat he will be deeply missed by his family and friends. My thoughts \nand prayers are with them.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate and my fellow Americans to join me \nin remembering Specialist Davis and the enormous sacrifice he made for \nhis country. Many people thought very highly of Specialist Davis and he \nwill always be remembered for his willingness to serve others. The \nUnited States owes its continued prosperity to Specialist Davis and \nothers like him who are willing to advance our ideals at great personal \ncost. Daryl Davis will be remembered as a great patriot and it is \nfitting that we honor him today.\n\n\n                       Marine Sergeant Nick Nolte\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Nick Nolte of Falls City, NE, a sergeant in the United States Marine \nCorps. Sergeant Nolte died November 24, 2004 at the Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center from wounds he received on November 9 when his Humvee \ndrove over a bomb near Baghdad, Iraq. He was 25 years old.\n  Sergeant Nolte graduated from Falls City Sacred Heart High School in \n1998. After graduating, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and became \na member of the Presidential Helicopter Squadron HMX-1, guarding \nPresidents Clinton and Bush. In June 2004, Nolte joined Operation Iraqi \nFreedom as a rifleman, Marine and personal security expert. Sergeant \nNolte will be remembered as a loyal Marine who believed in his mission \nand who had a strong sense of duty, honor and love of country. \nThousands of brave Americans like Sergeant Nolte are currently serving \nin Iraq.\n  Sergeant Nolte is survived by his mother, Anita Nolte; his wife, \nMelina and 3-year-old daughter, Alanna of Cherry Point, NC and sister, \nJessica Nolte of Omaha. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this \ndifficult time. The United States of America is proud of Nick Nolte's \nservice and mourns his loss.\n  For his service, bravery and sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring Sergeant Nick Nolte.\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Robert S. Doughty\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nKentucky hero, SSG Robert S. Doughty. Sergeant Doughty, an 11-year-\nveteran of the U.S. Army and from Paducah, KY, went to Iraq last spring \nas a member of the 3rd Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group. On July 8, \n2004, Sergeant Doughty was riding in the passenger seat of a Humvee \ndeep in the Sunni Triangle. His team's mission was to deliver laptop \ncomputers and a new vehicle to another Special Forces team. They didn't \nmake it.\n  A 155mm-mortar struck Sergeant Doughty's vehicle. Shrapnel tore \nthrough both of his legs. Two medics began treating him immediately, \nand Sergeant Doughty believes they saved his life by preventing him \nfrom bleeding to death. He was rushed by helicopter to a surgical \nhospital in Balad, Iraq, then to Germany, and finally to Walter Reed \nArmy Medical Center here in the Nation's Capital. Doctors were able to \nsave his life, but not his legs.\n  Sergeant Doughty's incredible courage has not diminished one iota \nsince that July day. Two months to the day of that vicious attack, he \nstood for the first time on two prosthetic legs. Since then, he has \ngraduated from using a walker to crutches to canes, and intends to walk \nwithout difficulty by Christmas. I have no doubt he will succeed.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Sergeant Doughty and his family in my \noffice on September 9. I told him how grateful America is for his \nservice to our country. This amazing man has not let his injury hamper \nhis love for his country, her military, or the cause of freedom and \njustice we fight for in Iraq. If he could, he would go back. He serves \nas a model of heroism to us all.\n  Today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring SSG Robert S. \nDoughty for his supreme valor. My prayers, and those of millions of \ngrateful Americans, are with him as he recovers from his injuries. With \nother fine men and women like him in our Armed Forces, we are sure to \nsucceed as we continue ridding the newly liberated Iraq of the \nterrorists trying to drive that country back into the hands of tyranny.\n\n\n                           lcpl joseph welke\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to LCpl \nJoseph T. Welke, a resident of Rapid City, SD who died on November 20, \n2004, while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Lance Corporal Welke was a member of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st \nMarine Regiment based out of Camp Pendleton, CA. He was killed while \nfighting insurgents in Fallujah, Iraq.\n  Answering America's call to the military, Lance Corporal Welke joined \nthe Marines after graduating from Rapid City Stevens High School in \n2003. As a fullback for the varsity football team, Joe earned Greater \nDakota All Conference team honors. He enjoyed riding his motorcycle and \nspending time with his family. Friends and family remember him as \nhaving a love for life and as an inspiration to all those who knew him \nbest.\n  Lance Corporal Welke served our country and, as a hero, died fighting \nfor it. He served as model of the loyalty and dedication that comes \nwith preservation of freedom. The thoughts and prayers of my family, as \nwell as the rest of the country, are with his family during this time \nof mourning.\n\n[[Page S11868]]\n\nOur thoughts continue to be with all of those families with loved ones \nserving overseas.\n  Lance Corporal Welke led a full life, committed to his family, his \nNation, and his community. It was his incredible dedication to helping \nothers that will serve as his greatest legacy. Our Nation is a far \nbetter place because of Lance Corporal Welke's contributions, and, \nwhile his family, friends, and Nation will miss him very much, the best \nway to honor his life is to remember his commitment to service and \nfamily.\n  Mr. President, I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my \nsympathies to the friends and family of LCpl Joseph Welke. I know that \nhe will always be missed, but his service to our Nation will never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11868-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, soon after we return in January, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee will begin consideration of the nomination of \nAlberto Gonzales for the position of Attorney General of the United \nStates. I met with Judge Gonzales on November 17, soon after his \ndesignation as the President's nominee. I had that meeting in \npreparation for our hearings. I look forward to working with Senator \nSpecter and the other members of the Judiciary Committee to assure a \nprompt and fair and thorough hearing on this important nomination in \nearly January.\n  There is no secret that Judge Gonzales will be called upon to explain \nnot only his vision of what the role of the Attorney General should be, \nbut also how he would distinguish it from that of the White House \nCounsel. And he is also going to be asked about the role he has played \nin formulating the administration's policy on the treatment and \ninterrogation of prisoners in U.S. custody overseas.\n  The scandal of Abu Ghraib, allegations of mistreatment in Guantanamo, \ninvestigations and charges from cases in Iraq and Afghanistan are \nserious matters. There are lingering questions. There is unresolved \naccountability left in their wake.\n  The Bush administration circled the wagons long ago. It has \ncontinually maintained that the abuses were simply the work of a few \nbad apples. But we know that the photos from Abu Ghraib do not depict \nan isolated incident. Abuses have occurred in many locations, including \nAfghanistan, Guantanamo Bay, and in a number of other facilities within \nIraq.\n  I have long said that somewhere in the upper reaches of the executive \nbranch, a process was set in motion that rolled forward until it \nproduced this scandal. Even without a truly independent investigation, \nwe now know the responsibility for abuse runs very high into the chain \nof command. Senior officials in the White House, the Justice \nDepartment, and the Pentagon set in motion a systematic effort to \nminimize, distort, and even ignore laws, policies, and agreements on \ntorture and the treatment of prisoners. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and \nlater LTG Ricardo Sanchez authorized the use of techniques that were \ncontrary to both U.S. military manuals and international law.\n  Former CIA Director Tenet requested, and Secretary Rumsfeld approved, \nthe secret detention of a ghost detainee in Iraq so he could be hidden \nfrom the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n  These issues, especially when they involve the greatest democracy \nhistory has known, are a significant concern. But there are also issues \nin which the administration has been far less than forthcoming. In \nletters dated May 17 and June 15 of this year, long before the fall \nelections, long before the resignation of John Ashcroft, and long \nbefore he was designated by the President as nominee, I asked Judge \nGonzales to describe his role in both the interpretation of the law and \nthe development of policies that led to what I and many others \nconsidered to have been a disregard for the rule of law. Those letters \nof May 17 and June 15 remain unanswered as of today.\n  I have repeatedly emphasized to Judge Gonzales the need for \nresponsiveness and accountability in these matters. Last Friday, I sent \nJudge Gonzales a letter reiterating my concerns. I emphasized the \nimportance of full disclosure during this confirmation process.\n  I urge him to cooperate, to cooperate now with all members of the \nJudiciary Committee on both sides of the aisle on the full range of \nissues of oversight and accountability that come before us. That is \nsomething his predecessor did not do. That lack of oversight on the \npart of the Senate, the lack of accountability and lack of \nresponsiveness on the part of the administration, should not continue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have my December 3, 2004, letter to Judge \nGonzales printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 2004.\n     Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales,\n     Counsel to the President, the White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Gonzales: I enjoyed our preliminary meeting and \n     look forward to your confirmation hearings. In following up \n     on our meeting, and to give you and your staff ample \n     opportunity to prepare for the hearings, I write to reiterate \n     several concerns that I have raised in prior discussions and \n     correspondence. When we met on November 17, 2004, I said that \n     these issues will be raised, by myself and other members of \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee, during the upcoming hearings. \n     Based on our conversation, I am encourage by your willingness \n     to answer questions about you role and your views in these \n     matters.\n       Photographs and reports of prisoner abuse in Iraq and other \n     locations show an interrogation and detention system \n     operating contrary to U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions. In \n     addition to the abhorrent images from the Abu Ghraib prison \n     that were published last spring, actions that have occurred \n     with Administration approval include the forcible rendition \n     of individuals to nations where they may face torture, and \n     the hiding of ``ghost detainees'' from the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross. Reports of abuse continue to \n     emerge. Just this week, The New York Times reported that the \n     Red Cross has charged U.S. military authorities with using \n     physical and psychological coercion ``tantamount to torture'' \n     on prisoners at Guantamano Bay. The Washington Post is \n     reporting that in December 2003 Army generals in Iraq were \n     warned in a confidential report that members of an elite \n     military and CIA task force were abusing detainees. According \n     to The Post, the report concluded that certain arrest and \n     detention practices could be deemed to be ``technically'' \n     illegal.\n       In letters dated May 17 and June 15 of this year, I asked \n     you to describe your role in both the interpretation of the \n     law and the development of policies that led to what I and \n     many other consider to have been a disregard for the rule of \n     law. These letters remain unanswered.\n       My concerns regarding the abuse of prisoners in U.S. \n     custody did not begin with these letters. I have been seeking \n     answers from the Administration for well over a year, before \n     the abuses at Abu Ghraib came to light. In a very few cases \n     my questions were answered, but with information that later \n     proved to be less than accurate. For example, in a news \n     conference on June 22, 2004, you stated, ``In Iraq, it has \n     always been U.S. position that Geneva applies. From the early \n     days of the conflict, both the White House and the \n     Department of Defense have been very public and clear \n     about that.''\n       However, an October 24, 2004, article in The Washington \n     Post revealed yet another Justice Department memo authorizing \n     actions that potentially violate the Geneva Conventions. The \n     draft memo, dated March 19, 2004, apparently was written to \n     authorize the CIA to transfer detainees out of Iraq for \n     interrogation--a practice expressly prohibited by the Geneva \n     Conventions. According to the memo's cover letter, it was \n     drafted at your request.\n       In another example, a June 25, 2003, letter from Department \n     of Defense General Counsel William Haynes stated that the \n     United States was adhering to its international obligations \n     including those under the Convention Against Torture. We \n     later learned of an August 1, 2002, Department of Justice \n     memorandum that twisted the definition of torture in \n     unrecognizable ways. That memo was addressed to your. We also \n     learned months\n\n[[Page S11869]]\n\n     later of the rendition of a Canadian-Syrian citizen to Syria, \n     despite his fear of being tortured there, and despite the \n     Syrian government's well-documented history of torture. \n     Unnamed CIA officials told the press that this man was in \n     fact tortured in Syria.\n       The Committee and the Senate will want to know your role in \n     these situations and your views with regard to the \n     development of the legal justifications that appear to \n     underlie so many of these actions. You will be called upon to \n     explain in detail your role in developing policies related to \n     the interrogation and treatment of foreign prisoners. The \n     American public and the Senate that will be called upon to \n     confirm your appointment deserve to know how a potential \n     Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer in the \n     nation, will interpret and enforce the laws and how you will \n     develop policy.\n       We want to know what the current policy on torture is, but \n     since the Administration disavowed the August 1, 2002, memo, \n     no public statement of policy has replaced it. Questions \n     remain unanswered on a host of issues. Requests to the White \n     House and the Department of Justice for relevant documents--\n     including my requests to you in May and June of this year--\n     have been ignored or rejected. I urge you and the \n     Administration to provide the documents that have been \n     requested by myself and others without further delay so that \n     the hearings will be well informed.\n       Another key concern you will be called upon to discuss is \n     how you view the duties and responsibilities of the Attorney \n     General. As we discussed, I view the White House Counsel \n     position and that of the Attorney General as quite distinct. \n     You may well have viewed this President as your ``client'' \n     while serving him at the White House, although the courts do \n     not recognize an attorney-client privilege in that setting. \n     We will want to know how differently you will act and view \n     your responsibilities as the Attorney General of the \n     United States.\n       Finally, I encourage you to commit to cooperating with all \n     members of the Judiciary Committee on issues of oversight and \n     accountability. In the 108th Congress, the Judiciary \n     Committee failed to fulfill its oversight responsibilities. \n     Accountability and improving government performance are sound \n     and long established purposes of congressional oversight, and \n     accountability has been lacking on these and other crucial \n     issues. With a new Congress, and a new Attorney General, I \n     expect a return to the diligent oversight envisioned by our \n     Founders to ensure that the Executive Branch remains \n     accountable to the American people.\n       Our meeting was a constructive beginning at the start of \n     the confirmation process, and I look forward to your hearing \n     early next month. In the meantime, Marcelle and I send our \n     best wishes to you and your family and hope that you have a \n     restful and rewarding holiday season.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                        Ranking Democratic Member.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota now seeking the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous consent, the \nSenator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ask consent to speak for 20 minutes \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak today about several items, \nthe first of which is the sale of agricultural goods to Cuba.\n  Some years ago, Attorney General John Ashcroft, who then was a U.S. \nSenator, and I, offered an amendment that opened the opportunity to \nsell agricultural commodities into the Cuban marketplace. For over 40 \nyears that marketplace had been closed to American farmers because of \nan embargo.\n  The bill that Congress passed was called the Trade Sanctions Reform \nand Export Enhancement Act of 2000. It permitted agricultural sales to \nCuba on the condition that the Cubans had to use cash in order to \npurchase agricultural commodities from this country. We have now sold \nover $900 million worth of farm commodities to the Cuban marketplace \nfor cash. In fact, about 1\\1/2\\ or 2 years ago, 22 train carloads of \ndried peas left North Dakota to be shipped into the Cuban marketplace--\nthe first time in 42 years our farmers had an opportunity to sell into \nthis market that the Canadians and the Europeans had been selling into \nall along.\n  That is what we did in the legislation. I felt that having an embargo \non food shipments to Cuba all those years was wrong. It didn't affect \nFidel Castro. We tried to injure Fidel Castro by slapping on this \nembargo which included food and medicine, which I thought was an \ninsidious policy. It didn't hurt Fidel Castro. He never missed a \nbreakfast, lunch, or dinner because we were not able to sell food into \nCuba.\n  The same is true with travel restrictions. We prohibited Americans \nfrom traveling into Cuba except for those who are able to get a license \nfrom the Treasury Department, which is increasingly difficult to do. \nRestricting the American people's right to travel is not hurting Fidel \nCastro. It simply injures the American people. We can travel in \nCommunist China and in Communist Vietnam but we can't travel in Cuba. I \nhave held up a picture on the floor of the Senate of Joni Scott. She \nwent to Cuba to distribute free Bibles. This administration's Treasury \nDepartment tracked her down and said we are going to try to slap a \n$10,000 fine on you for distributing free Bibles in Cuba. I have also \nshown the picture of Joan Slote, a retired senior Olympian in her \nmidseventies. She went to ride a bicycle in Cuba with a Canadian group. \nThe Treasury tracked her down even as she was dealing with her son's \nbrain cancer and slapped a fine on her and threatened, by the way, to \nseize her Social Security payments.\n  It is outrageous what this policy has been with respect to Cuba. But \nwe had a small victory when Senator Ashcroft and I were able to change \nthe law so that our farmers and ranchers could sell into the Cuban \nmarketplace. Since then we have sold $900 million of agricultural \ncommodities for cash to Cuba.\n  In recent weeks something else has happened. It is apparent this \nadministration is fighting every possible way to shut down the \nopportunities of farmers and ranchers to sell into the Cuban \nmarketplace. Here is a new way. This chart shows part of the Trade \nSanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 legislation. Here \nare the words that stipulate that the Cubans must pay ``cash in \nadvance'' for food they purchase. And that is exactly what the Cubans \nhave done for about $900 million in shipments so far. But someone at \nTreasury took a look at this, and said, You know, there is a way to \ninterpret these words to shut down these shipments even tighter. We \nwill interpret cash in advance to mean the cash must be received by the \nexporter before anything can be shipped toward Cuba.\n  That is much different from the way the term cash in advance has been \ngenerally understood by the export community and the way I as an author \nwould have understood what we meant. Up to now, cash in advance meant \nthat you must pay cash before you take receipt of the product. That \nship goes to Cuba with dried peas, or wheat, or flour, or beef. Before \nit is offloaded and the Cubans take possession, they must pay cash to \nthe seller. It is very simple. You pay cash before you take possession \nof the product.\n  The Treasury Department has now found a way to say, Not good enough. \nThe way sales have been made to Cuba for the past three years is not \nwhat the Treasury thinks the legislation says. We insist that the \nphrase cash in advance means you pay cash before anything gets loaded \non the ship.\n  What is this about? It is about someone down at the Treasury \nDepartment who has decided they have found another way to see if they \ncan stop our farmers and ranchers from selling into the Cuban \nmarketplace. I was an author of the legislation, and they need to \nunderstand that I knew what I was doing, and I believe my colleague \nSenator Ashcroft and others in the Congress knew what they were doing. \nWe were trying to provide access to the Cuban marketplace.\n  This country has now said for almost two dozen years the way to move \nCommunist countries such as China and Vietnam toward greater human \nrights is through more trade and travel engagement to move them in the \nright direction. We have said that with China and with Vietnam, both \nCommunist countries. The exception is Cuba. They say if we begin to \nallow people to travel in Cuba, to trade with Cuba, somehow that is \npernicious and moves in the wrong direction.\n  At some point you have to say that is an argument that is completely \ndevoid of common sense. But Congress has already acted on this. The \nCongress said it is all right and we believe we should be able to trade \nwith Cuba provided that sale is for cash. The Cubans buy agricultural \ncommodities from us.\n\n[[Page S11870]]\n\nThey pay for it through a European bank with cash so that no direct \ntransfer of funds from Cuba to a U.S. institution. And now there is \nsomeone who has found a way to restrict this, to try to interrupt rice \nshipments and other shipments to Cuba.\n  The farm community was caught unaware by this issue. I was unaware of \nit. Once we discovered it, I called people in the Bush administration \nto ask, What on earth are you doing this time? Can't you get it \nstraight that this Congress has already said this is the law, this is \nthe way the law reads? I have asked, by the way, the Inspector General \nat the Department of the Treasury to investigate what OFAC--called the \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control--is doing here. Essentially, the \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control at Treasury is supposed to be tracking \nmoney to terrorists. They are supposed to be shutting down the funding \nfor Osama bin Laden. They are supposed to be tracking the network of \nfunds around the world that finances terrorism.\n  But what are the people at OFAC doing? They are tracking down Joan \nSlote and Joni Scott who traveled to Cuba to ride bicycles and \ndistribute free Bibles. They are spending time trying to figure out how \nthey can reinterpret Federal law to try to put a wrench in the \ncrankcase of farmers and ranchers who are trying to sell into the Cuban \nmarketplace. They ought to be ashamed of themselves down at OFAC. They \nknow better than that.\n  When Secretary of Treasury O'Neill testified at a hearing a couple of \nyears ago, I asked him repeatedly about this. He finally answered, but \nhe didn't want to. I asked him, Wouldn't you, with some common sense, \nmuch rather use your assets in OFAC to track the financing of \nterrorists than track Americans who are suspected of taking a vacation \nin Cuba? Finally, he said, Sure, sure.\n  The OFAC is not a very big agency. But they have over 20 people who \nare tracking this Cuba issue trying to nab an American person who is \nsuspected of taking vacations in Cuba or trying to find ways to \nreinterpret the law to shut down agricultural trade to Cuba. They have \nmore people doing that than they have tracking Osama bin Laden, and \ntrying to shut down Osama bin Laden's network of funding to support his \nterrorist activity.\n  OFAC ought to be ashamed. What a false choice for the security of \nthis country. And what a false choice for the welfare and benefit of \nfamily farmers and ranchers, just like the Europeans and Canadians and \nothers who have access to this marketplace. My hope is they will have a \nmeeting in the administration. My understanding is they had one late \nyesterday afternoon, or will have one today, and perhaps some common \nsense will prevail. If not, we will find a way here on the floor of the \nCongress to see if we can't make the right thing happen and perhaps \nforce them to use their resources--or perhaps if they are misusing \ntheir resources, to diminish the resources they have.\n\n  In any event, we have a significant problem in agricultural trade.\n  Ten years ago, we had a $25 billion agricultural trade surplus. This \nyear, it is $9 billion. It shrank from $25 billion to $9 billion, and \nnext year it is expected to be zero. For the first time in over 50 \nyears we will not have a surplus in agricultural trade, according to \nthe estimates in the administration.\n  If that is the case, why are they trying to shut down our sales of \nagricultural product to Cuba? It doesn't make sense at all to me.\n  I hope those in the administration who have done this and who think \nthat redefining the meaning of cash in advance is a genius scheme to \ntry to thwart the will of Congress will think through it more clearly \nand understand it is a harebrained scheme that doesn't comport at all \nwith the law. My hope is they will finally get that message.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11870-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11870-S11871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TRADE ISSUES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me mention a couple of other trade \nissues because I think they are critically important. I am going to \nspend a great deal of time on trade issues in this coming session of \nCongress. We have the largest trade deficit in the history of the \ncountry. That translates into lost jobs and lost opportunity for our \ncountry. This town is completely brain dead on trade issues.\n\n  We can start with the Washington Post and the major news outlets. \nThey do not cover trade or care about it, and if they cover it at all, \nthey only cover one side, and that is the side of so-called free trade. \nLet me tell you where the so-called mantra of free trade has led: the \nlargest trade deficit in the history of our country with massive \noutsourcing of jobs replaced with jobs that pay less with fewer \nbenefits in our country.\n  I have spoken at great length about the trade issues to a deafening \nsilence; it could be because of my presentation. But this country, this \nCongress, this town, has to get serious about this issue because it is \nhollowing out the economic stability and opportunity for this country's \nfuture.\n  We have a huge unprecedented trade deficit with China. We buy \neverything China has to manufacture--shoes, shirts, shorts, trinkets, \ntoys, just name it. It is coming in an armada of ships every single \nday. We buy every single day nearly $2 billion more from other \ncountries than we are able to export.\n  Why do we do that? I have spoken about Huffy bicycles, and I will not \ngo through the story today, but Ohio workers making Huffy bicycles, \nproud of their jobs, lost their jobs, and Huffy bicycles are now made \nin China. The little red wagon, American Flyer, made in America for 120 \nyears, but the employees lost their jobs to China.\n  A new report, December 3rd in the Washington Post: ``A Rough Ride for \nSchwinn Bicycles.'' We know Schwinn bicycles. I rode a Schwinn when I \nwas a kid. They are now made in China. This story describes the mistake \nof Schwinn bicycles. They decided as a company they needed to try to \ncontinue to stay in the United States and manufacture bicycles here. \nWhat a huge mistake, they decided later, because it drove them into \nbankruptcy. So there are no longer any Schwinn bicycles made in \nAmerica.\n  Let me give an example of why this is happening, whether it is Huffy \nor Schwinn bicycles or a thousand other items.\n  This is a story about unrest in a Chinese manufacturing plant from \nthe Washington Post. In the latest unrest, about 1,000 workers staged a \nwalk out on November 7th at the Shanlin Technology appliance factory \nnear Guangzhou, demanding higher overtime pay and more days off, \naccording to the government-run New China News Agency. The workers \nreturned to the assembly line a day later after receiving assurances \nthat overtime pay would rise by 12 cents to 36 cents an hour and that \nthey would get two days off a month.\n  When the Huffy jobs went from Ohio to China, for example, the jobs \nchanged in one respect. The U.S. workers had made $11 an hour plus \nbenefits. The Chinese workers instead make 33 cents an hour and work 12 \nto 13 hours a day 7 days a week. Some insist that is what America \nshould compete with. I insist that is a race to the bottom of economic \nstandards and one this country should not aspire to win.\n  What has happened to our Yankee ingenuity when it comes to \ninternational trade? We used to be known as good traders. Instead, we \nnow have a strange idea that if we can just open up all markets and \nhave no admission standards or no admission price to the U.S. \nmarketplace, and allow the production of most goods to migrate to \ncountries in the world where you can hire 12-year-olds, pay them 33 \ncents an hour, work them 12 hours a day, and ship the products to \nToledo and Santa Fe, that America would be better off. And that is just \nnot so. In fact, as the jobs migrate from a country that cannot \ncontinue to pay workers $11 or $20 an hour, when corporations will \nsimply move the jobs to China where they are paid 33 cents or 50 cents \nan hour, this country begins to feel the economic pain and the \nshrinking of economic opportunity.\n  It seems to me, that after decades of failed trade policy--whether it \nis GATT, WTO, NAFTA, CAFTA or any one of a number of trade agreements--\nat some point those who predicted a good outcome for these trade \nagreements, and were so fundamentally wrong, should be discredited.\n\n  NAFTA is an example. We were told with respect to NAFTA, This is a \ngood thing for our country because what will happen if jobs migrate to \nMexico, they will only be low-wage and low-\n\n[[Page S11871]]\n\nskill jobs. But since NAFTA has been in effect, the three largest \nexports from Mexico have been automobiles, automobile parts, and \nelectronics, all the product of high-skilled labor. It is exactly the \nopposite of what the experts predicted.\n  I am told that we now import more cars from Mexico than we export to \nthe entire rest of the world. We now import more automobiles from \nMexico than we export to the entire rest of the world. What that means \nis the migration of jobs in automobiles and automobile parts to Mexico \nafter NAFTA. Why? Because of lower wages and fewer health, \nenvironmental, and safety regulations on manufacturing. That has meant \nthose jobs have left our country. It results in part in this very \nsignificant trade deficit, which, in my judgment, injures this country \nand is a long-term serious problem.\n  I intend to speak at much greater length about that, and repeatedly, \nbecause we must find legislative approaches to interrupt this failed \ntrade policy. I am not saying I am opposed to free trade. I believe \ntrade must be fair trade. There must be fair trade requirements. This \nfree trade is a mantra that people chant. But chanting ``free trade'' \nat a time when we are up to our neck and choking on trade debt, with \njobs moving from the country in wholesale quantity, it is time to stop \nthat and decide it ought not be something to be ashamed of for anyone \nto say: My interest is in the economic well-being of the United States \nof America. I am so tired of people refusing to say: My interest is in \nprotecting the economy of our country.\n  Why are we afraid to stand up for American jobs? Why do we believe it \nis inappropriate for an employee to make $15 an hour in a manufacturing \nplant? Somehow large corporations have convinced most policymakers and \neditorial writers that it makes a lot of sense to hollow out our \nmanufacturing business.\n  I guarantee this: No country will long remain a world economic power \nif it does not have a strong manufacturing base. We are headed in the \nwrong direction. This country needs to make a U-turn. As I have said, \nwe are completely brain dead in trade policy. We intend to have that \ndiscussion. I will force that discussion in the next session of \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11871-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11871-S11872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        WHISTLEBLOWER: FIRM DEFRAUDED IRAQ OCCUPATION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the largest area of deficiency for the \nCongress in the last few years has been the failure to have oversight \nhearings on issues that demand oversight hearings. I have held some \nhearings as chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, in cases where \nmembers of other committees have asked for oversight hearings and they \nhave been denied. This has been particularly true, by the way, when it \ncomes to Halliburton.\n  Let me give an example of why oversight hearings are critical. This \ncomes from a report recently on National Public Radio. I will read this \nbecause it describes why this Congress must begin exercising its \noversight responsibility. This is about waste, fraud, abuse, and the \nAmerican taxpayers being cheated.\n  Let me read some of it:\n\n       Custer-Battles was a young company founded by former Army \n     Rangers Scott Custer and Michael Battles who came to Iraq on \n     borrowed money. An August Wall Street Journal article said \n     that he (Mr. Battles) only had $450 when he convinced an \n     official to put Custer-Battles [his new company he formed] on \n     a list of bidders at an airport security contract.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. An August Wall Street Journal article said Mr. Michael \nBattles, a former Army Ranger, showed up in the country of Iraq with \n$450. He and his partner, former Army Ranger Scott Custer, convinced an \nofficial to put Custer-Battles, a new company, on a list of bidders for \nan airport security contract. They promised to get the job done fast, \nand they won the contract, which included two upfront cash advances of \n$2 million each.\n  Then there was a fellow, a former FBI agent, whose name is Isakson \nwho said 2 weeks into this job, by this two-person company that showed \nup with no money but got $2 million of advanced funding for this \ncontract at the airport--Isakson, a former FBI agent, said something \nwent wrong. ``They approached me to participate in a scheme to defraud \nthe government.'' Isakson said it involved bidding for cost plus \ncontracts which guarantee payment for a contractor's actual cost plus \nan agreed to profit margin.\n  This is what Isakson said:\n\n       They would take and open a company in Lebanon and buy \n     materials through the Lebanese company, which they owned, \n     then the Lebanese company would sell it to their American \n     company [Custer-Battles] at a highly inflated rate and then \n     they would charge their profit on top of the highly inflated \n     rate. In other words, they would make a [big] profit plus \n     another profit.\n\n  Isakson said he refused to go along, and he warned company officials \nthat such a plan would put them in jail. Again, this is an ex-FBI \nagent. He said he could not go along with this. It will put you in \njail.\n  The next day at the airport, Isakson claims, Custer-Battles security \nguards cornered him in a hallway at gunpoint. His brother and his 14-\nyear-old son were there as well.\n  Isakson said:\n\n       They said you're terminated and you're under arrest and \n     don't move or I'll shoot you.\n\n  Isakson said the guard took their weapons and ID badges and \neventually turned them out of the airport compound, where they made the \ndangerous journey from Baghdad to the Jordanian border. He has filed a \nlawsuit against Custer-Battles over the ordeal, and he is also a party \nto a $50 million Federal lawsuit filed in Virginia under the False \nClaims Act.\n  The other whistleblower in this case is a Pete Baldwin, a former \ncountry manager for Custer-Battles in Iraq who now runs another firm \nthere. Baldwin describes a web of false billing practices designed to \ninflate costs and boost company profits. He cites a deal to provide \nforklifts on a security detail.\n  Now, this is what Baldwin says:\n\n       They confiscated old Iraqi airways green and white \n     forklifts and transported them out of the airport facility \n     which Custer-Battles had control over and painted them blue, \n     then sold them back to the [U.S.] government on a lease.\n\n  He says:\n\n       This is a blatant example where something was actually \n     acquired free and sold back to the government [after they \n     were repainted blue].\n\n  So Baldwin took his suspicions to Government investigators and quit \nover the company's billing practices. Now Baldwin claims his life has \nbeen threatened because of his actions.\n  The Pentagon has suspended Custer-Battles from receiving further \nmilitary contracts and sources, according to NPR, say a Federal \ncriminal investigation is ongoing. However, a civil probe ended in \nOctober when the U.S. Justice Department declined to join in the \nwhistleblower case.\n  Here is the key, and it is an interesting piece of information: A \nspokesman says the Bush administration has made a policy decision that \ncheating the Coalition Provision Authority in Iraq is, for the most \npart, not cheating the U.S. Government. Let me say that again. This is \nquoting Mr. Gracing:\n\n       The reason they gave to us is that the Bush administration \n     has made a policy decision that cheating the Coalition \n     Provision Authority in Iraq or basically the military, and \n     for the most part the U.S. military, is not the same as \n     cheating the U.S. government.\n\n  The fact is, the Coalition Provisional Authority was us. It was our \nmoney, our resources, our people. So here we have a company that takes \nforklift trucks from an airport property, moves them someplace to a \nwarehouse, paints them blue, sells them back to the Coalition \nProvisional Authority, which pays for them with U.S. taxpayer funds, \nand our U.S. Justice Department says: That's all right. We'll close our \neyes while you cheat us because the Coalition Provisional Authority is \nnot really the U.S. Government. Are they nuts? Don't they care whether \nwe are being cheated?\n  These are the kinds of things that literally beg for oversight \nhearings. Yet this Congress is dead silent on these issues. I said I \nhave held oversight hearings about Iraq with respect to Halliburton. \nThe minute you talk about Halliburton, somebody raises the Vice \nPresident. I did not talk about the Vice President in those hearings, \nbut I talked about Halliburton and about\n\n[[Page S11872]]\n\ncheating. This is about Halliburton. It is not about anybody else.\n  When a company says they are feeding 42,000 soldiers and being paid \nfor it by the U.S. Government and it ends up they are only feeding \n14,000 soldiers a day, and 28,000 meals are being paid for that are not \nbeing fed, it seems to me there ought to be aggressive oversight \nhearings to figure out what is going on, who is cheating the \nGovernment. Yet there is dead silence.\n  I come from a really small town, about 300 people. We have one small \nlittle cafe right in the middle of Main Street. My guess is, if \nsomebody got a check for 4 meals that were never served, they would \nsure know that, and the same goes for 14 meals, or 40 meals. It would \nappropriately be a big deal in my hometown. But 28,000 meals that are \nbilled but were not delivered to U.S. troops? In my little town, they \nwould call that cheating and fraud. Yet there is dead silence with \nrespect to the oversight responsibility we ought to have as a Congress \nto find out what is happening, why, and who is responsible.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about this as well, and we \nintend to continue to hold oversight hearings as well in the Democratic \nPolicy Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a couple minutes as we come \nto the close of this congressional session and soon will be entering \ninto a new one. It seems to me we have some great challenges before us, \nof course, as is always the case. However, in this instance, we have \nperhaps some more defined issues than normal. There are lots of issues \nbefore us, of course.\n  There are always challenging issues before the Congress. Sometimes \nthey are less well defined, but this time hopefully we can come \ntogether on issues we have talked about, trying to find answers to \nquestions that are important to this country.\n  It seems to me there are several issues that are pretty well defined. \nI hope we can find, on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the \nCapitol, some solutions or at least move toward some solutions that are \nvery important to us.\n  In doing that, it seems to me--and I will comment on it a little \nlater--we have to take a long look at the kinds of things we deal with \nhere to try to make some kind of an analysis as to the issues that are \nappropriate for the Congress to deal with.\n  There are lots of interesting things going on, of course, but we find \nourselves in the position of dealing with lots of things that I think \nquite easily could be defined as a role for some other Government level \nor indeed for the private sector to deal with.\n  We find ourselves dealing with a good many of those things that are \ninteresting. I was thinking a while back about the activity we had with \nrespect to--I don't remember what it was--$15 million to help kids play \ntennis. Well, playing tennis is a great thing, and helping kids to play \ntennis is a great thing, but is that a congressional activity, I \nwonder.\n  I have some concerns from time to time, but there are issues we \nclearly have to face up to. One of them is health care and the cost of \nhealth care throughout the country. Particularly, I am aware of the \nissues of health care in my State of Wyoming, as is the Presiding \nOfficer, which include the fact that the costs of health care are \nbeginning to limit access to one of the best health care systems in the \nworld.\n  Well, we have the best health care in the world, but if people cannot \nutilize it and are not able to take advantage of it, then, of course, \nwe have to do something. The cost of health insurance, which is related \nto the cost of health care, more and more is one of those issues we \nneed to deal with nationwide. It is not an easy issue.\n\n  One of the obvious problems is the uninsured. Approximately 40 \nmillion are uninsured. Quite often the costs, when the uninsured \nreceive health care, have to be shifted to those who have insurance, \nand that lifts the price. The same is true of hospitals and emergencies \nand Medicare and Medicaid, which actually pay less than the cost, quite \noften, so that cost again is shifted. It is particularly difficult for \nthe families of the self-employed. In our case, many rural ranchers and \nfarmers pay very high prices to carry insurance for their families. \nThat is one we clearly need to work on. I don't suppose we will find \nthe total solution all at once. We are moving forward in Medicare, but \nthis goes beyond Medicare. This goes to health care in general. We are \ngoing to have to do some things there, I am sure.\n  Energy, of course, continues to be an issue that we have sort of \navoided over the last couple years. I guess we have the idea that all \nyou have to do is turn the light on or get in the car and go to the \nstation and everything is going to be all right. The fact is, demand is \nexceeding production in many of these areas, and we are going to have \nto do something about it. I am hopeful we can at least begin with an \nenergy policy--and we have tried a number of times--that looks ahead \nfor 15 years or 20 years and says here is what we will have to do, here \nis where we want to be. And to be there, we have to do other things.\n  Unfortunately, in this body we haven't been able to pass a policy. I \nhave never understood why. Some areas, such as New England, generally \nhave been cold on it, and they don't even have production. Production \nhas to come from somewhere else, but there is no interest in that. We \nneed to talk about alternative sources. We need to talk about \nrenewables, efficiency, and conservation of energy, as well as domestic \nproduction. We find ourselves with a 60-percent dependence on imported \noil, much of which comes from the Middle East, which is unsettled. That \nis a tough thing. I hope we can get moving on that.\n  Social Security is a hard one. The President has talked a great deal \nabout it. I am sure there will be some things done here. But clearly \nthere has to be something done for the future. It is true that over the \nnext few years things won't change very much. When Social Security was \nbegun, I believe there were 28 people working for every beneficiary. \nNow it is about three people working for every beneficiary. Obviously \nthe system that we started with is not going to be able to continue to \nbe the kind of system that we need. It is going to be hard. We will \nhave to get together.\n  On the highway bill, nothing is more important to us than having \nhighways. We haven't really done that in terms of the 6 years looking \nout. It is important because the highway departments in the various \nStates do almost all their work by contracting, and they have \ndifficulty contracting if they don't know what their income is going to \nbe over a period of time.\n  Obviously, we have to continue our fight on terrorism until that job \nis done, whether it is here or in Iraq, wherever. We will do that, I am \nsure.\n  However, now we are faced with a deficit, a legitimate deficit. When \nyou have emergencies in your business or in your family, you spend more \nthan you would normally spend. That is what has happened in the last 4 \nyears. It hasn't been normal. We had September 11. We had a turndown in \nthe economy. We had terrorism. We had Iraq. Now it is more important. I \nam pleased in the last year in our omnibus bill, the increase in \ndiscretionary spending was only about 1 percent. That is good. We will \nhave to continue to do that.\n\n  I had a thick book outlining all the Federal programs we have, a \ntremendous number of Federal programs. I hope we can take an analysis \nof those from time to time and see if programs that were started 10 \nyears ago are still as viable as they were at that time. I wish we had \nprograms that ended in a few years so that there would be time to \nevaluate and see what is getting done.\n  I hope we can work on some of these things and that we can do a \nlittle sorting. I hope we don't become part of that group which thinks \nthat Government action is the only answer to problems in the world. I \nhope we don't think the Congress has to get involved in every issue \nthat is there. Many of them can be better done in the private\n\n[[Page S11873]]\n\nsector and by local governments. I know you get requests from everyone \nto do something, but we need to control our activities and control our \nspending and yet do the things that are there that need to be done.\n  We have a great challenge and a great opportunity. Hopefully, we will \nbe away for a year or so from the real intense politics in this body. \nThe election is over. We might consider that for a year or so and \nreally move ahead on those things that have merit rather than political \nimpact.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my 18-year tenure in the Senate \nhas capped an extremely satisfying personal experience with great \nrewards and gratification of public service. These have been some of \nthe most significant influences on my life. The greatest influence, of \ncourse, has been my family.\n  I was born into a family with good values and an admiration for \neducation and an interest in politics. In February of 1936, my mother \nand father made two significant decisions. First, my father, who was a \nmining engineer by education and a dairy farmer by occupation, a man \nwho had become extremely distressed at the level of underworld \ncorruption in Dade County, FL, decided to run for the Florida State \nSenate to represent that county on a platform of cleaning up underworld \ncorruption.\n  The second decision my parents made in February of 1936 was to have a \nbaby. I was the happy result of that second decision. My mother says \nthat I came by my political instincts from the womb, that she spent her \nwhole pregnancy going to political activities and that I became \naddicted.\n  Throughout my public career, I have had the love and support of my \npartner of 45 years, Adele. No person in public life could have a more \nloving, a more caring, and a more contributing partner than I.\n  At one point, Adele used to be nervous in public settings. Today, I \nwish I had her calm, her persuasiveness, her effectiveness in public \nsettings. Together, we have had the privilege of raising four wonderful \ndaughters, two of whom were born after our first election to public \noffice.\n  All of those qualities have been enhanced during my Senate years, \nincluding the addition of 11 grandchildren. On Thanksgiving Day I \nshared a special tradition with 9 of those 11 grandchildren when they \njoined me here at this desk on the Senate floor and observed and \ncritiqued my skills--and lack of skills--as I carved my name into the \nSenate desk.\n  The second greatest influence is my home, the State of Florida. I \nthought I knew a lot about Florida as a native and as a two-term \nGovernor, but I have learned so much more during the last 18 years. \nSince 1974, I have been taking different jobs, jobs alongside fellow \nFloridians, and as of last Thursday I have done 406 of these workdays; \n214 of them have been done since I became a Member of the Senate. Even \nthough my day job is 1,000 miles away from where many Floridians live, \nthese workdays have been an important part of maintaining a close \nrelationship with my fellow Floridians and reminding me what our \npriorities should be on their behalf here in Washington. Workdays and \nmy experiences in Congress have taught me ways in which the Federal \nGovernment affects the lives of typical Americans and, most acutely, \nFloridians.\n  I come from a State which is marked with dramatic growth in a very \nfragile environment, with a close affiliation with the countries to the \nsouth of the United States, a State in which one out of five of our \ncitizens is over the age of 65, and therefore programs such as Medicare \nand Social Security take on a very special significance. How we conduct \na law-based immigration system with humanity intimately affects many of \nour people, as does the obligation to use power responsibly. All of \nthese issues I have learned about at greater depth during my service in \nthe Senate.\n  What I have also gained in my three terms here is an appreciation of \nthe institution of the Senate and the unique role it plays in balancing \nour Government in order to avoid excessive power falling into the hands \nof any one person or governmental institution.\n  One of our greatest responsibilities as Members of the Senate is to \nassure an independent judiciary. I am especially pleased that I was \nable to join my Florida colleagues in the Senate in establishing and \nmaintaining a bipartisan, merit-based process by which we recommended \nand confirmed applicants for the Federal judiciary.\n  Particularly, I am gratified by the work I did with former Senator \nConnie Mack. As a Democrat and as a Republican, we forwarded \noutstanding judicial candidates to both Democratic and Republican \nPresidents. Because this process was based on judicial merit, Florida \nnominees have been uniformly and expeditiously accepted for nomination \nand confirmation.\n  I also came to see the Senate as our country's best graduate school, \noffering access to private seminars with the best and the brightest, \nsupplemented by outside organizations such as the Aspen Institute's \ncongressional program and the InterAmerican Dialog's Focus on \nHemispheric Issues.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as with you and your father, I came to \nappreciate the people of the Senate. Simply put, I enjoy being around \npoliticians and the people who love politics, including my staff and \nthe family of the Senate, and including the journalists who cover our \nactivities. I value my relationship with each of my colleagues, and I \nwish I had the time to tell a story about each of you.\n\n  Mr. President, your father was one of the first people I met when I \ncame into the Senate. We had a number of things in common in our \nbackground and quickly formed a friendship which was one of the most \nsignificant parts, particularly, of my early years in the Senate. My \ngrief at his loss is diluted by the knowledge not only that he has\n\n[[Page S11875]]\n\nbeen followed by his son, but that his son is a person of such \nexemplary qualities as you represent.\n  I would also like to single out one of my colleagues, a non-\nFloridian, as representative of the over 200 people with whom I have \nserved during my tenure in the Senate. Senator Jay Rockefeller has been \nvery special to me. We served as Governors at the same time. Jay, as \nmuch as anyone, encouraged me to run for the Senate.\n  I especially treasure the relationships I have had with my \ncongressional political mentors such as Congressman Danny Fascell and \nSenator, later Congressman, Claude Pepper, and my Florida colleagues in \nthis institution: Lawton Chiles, Connie Mack, and Bill Nelson.\n  Bill Nelson is a man I have known for over 40 years. In each stage of \nhis life he has been committed to public service and to excellence in \nthe execution of that public service. It has been a joy for the last 4 \nyears jointly representing our 17 million constituents with Bill. I \ngreatly admire his contributions to Florida and to the Nation. I wish \nto Senator Nelson a long tenure in the Senate. Florida and America will \nbe better places because of his service.\n  I am also hugely grateful to those who have been willing to share \nthis journey with me, the tens of thousands of people who have worked \nwith me in my successful statewide campaigns, and the over 1,000 people \nwho have joined me in public service in appointive or staff positions. \nI regret that I do not have time today to name all of them, but \nillustrative of all of them I will mention a few: Buddy Shorstein, Ken \nKlein, and Buddy Menn, all of whom have served as chiefs of staff in \nthe Senate; Gary Smith, Dick Burroughs, Charles Reed, Jay Hakes, and \nTom Herndon, who served in a similar position when I was Governor of \nFlorida; Mary Chiles, Ellen Roth, Lula Rodriguez, Susan McGinn, and \nLydia Mount; Al Cumming and Bob Filippone; Mark Block, John Provenzano, \nand Paul Anderson--these wonderful people and a thousand more who have \nshared this joyful experience in public service.\n  Winston Churchill once declared:\n\n       Now is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the \n     end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\n\n  My friends, the Senate needs to regain its tradition of controlled \npartisanship; in other words, placing country before party. Another of \nmy Florida political mentors, former Governor and Senator, Spessard \nHolland, once said that it was the jet airplane that caused the \ngreatest change in the culture of the Senate.\n  Prior to the jet airplane, Senator Holland and his wife would come in \nthe first week of January to Washington, would settle in the hotel \nwhere they would live while they were here, and they would spend the \nnext 6 to 7 months doing the business of America. While they were doing \nthat, they would spend time with the families of their colleagues. They \nwould become more than just occasional colleagues. They would become \ngenuine friends.\n  It was out of that development of relationships across regions and \nacross parties that the Senate came to earn the title of ``the world's \nmost exclusive club.'' And it was the club where the essential bond was \nthat of common respect.\n  The jet airplane began to change that, because instead of staying \nhere for a 5-day workweek and then a weekend of personal relations with \nthe families of their colleagues, it became possible for each Member of \nthe Senate to leave on Friday to return to their home State for \nwhatever request was made of them. The Senator knew that and the \nrequesting organization knew that. So it became a matter of political \nnecessity to respond.\n  The effect of that was not only did the work of the Senate extend \nfrom 6 to 7 months to today's 7th of December--we have been in session \nnow for 11 months and 1 week--it also meant that those weekends of \npersonal relationships were largely lost.\n  My No. 1 suggestion in this post-jet airplane age is that we try to \nget back to the tradition of spending more time together as families, \nas Americans, rather than as Republicans and Democrats. For instance, \nrather than holding our traditional partisan retreats in the spring of \nthe year, huddling as reds and blues, we should go to a retreat as a \nwhole Senate celebrating the families of this great institution.\n  I point to the pending intelligence reform bill, which I hope we will \npass in the next day, as an example of what can be done when we \nrecognize that an issue is so important to our Nation that we must work \ntogether to understand the problem and then develop solutions which are \ndriven by pragmatism, not ideology.\n  I suggest we apply the lessons that are being learned in developing \nand forming and passing intelligence reform to some of the challenges \nthat are before us now such as reform of Social Security and Medicare, \nand reform of our energy policy that we as a nation would be well \nserved.\n  Franklin Roosevelt declared in 1940:\n\n       I do not believe that the common denominator of our great \n     men in public life has not been mere allegiance to one \n     political party, but the disinterested devotion with which \n     they have strived to serve the whole country--and the \n     relative unimportance that they have ascribed to politics \n     compared with the paramount importance of government.\n\n  The Congress should also spend less time looking at the rearview \nmirror for the accidents behind and more time looking out of the front \nwindshield.\n  Since I have served there for a decade including 18 months as \nchairman, I would cite the Intelligence Committee as a prime example of \nthis institutional failure to focus ahead. Prior to September 11, the \ncommittee spent an inordinate amount of time examining a series of \nmistakes, of acts of treachery and of bureaucratic turf fighting. What \nwe failed adequately to do was to look forward to the threats and \nchallenges that our intelligence agencies needed to address before \nthose threats and challenges resolved into a tragedy. We desperately \nneed to apply this principle of looking out the front windshield to our \naccumulative deficits, budgetary deficits, trade deficits, \ntransportation and public utilities deficits, education deficits among \nthem. These deficits are challenges which this generation, unlike our \nforefathers, is ignoring because they are tough and managing them now \nhas political downsides. But it is wrong, it is immoral to let our \ngrandchildren do the heavy lifting because we have refused to do so.\n\n  We need to learn again the principle of federalism that our \nforefathers laid out for us. I come out of a Jeffersonian philosophy \nbelieving that the best governmental decisions are most likely to be \nmade by those closest to the citizens who will be affected by those \ndecisions. I recognize the importance of a national response to truly \nnational issues and to the protection of the civil rights of all \ncitizens. But America's great contribution to political thought has \nbeen federalism, the sharing of responsibility between a central \ngovernment and our 50 individual States.\n  I am concerned that this appreciation for federalism has too \nfrequently been situational. We at the Federal level, the national \nlevel, determine what outcome we wish to secure and then support either \ncentralization or a distribution of power based on what has a better \nchance of achieving the goal we seek. We would be well advised to \nresist this temptation.\n  Daily we are learning from the headlines of Ukraine and Iraq and \nother countries such as America with a diverse population which are \nstruggling to secure peace and prosperity. These foreign countries \nremind us of how difficult it is to hold to the model of federalism \nunless we are prepared to treat it with respect even when it may result \nin a different outcome than we would personally prefer.\n  Finally, we should support the institution of the Senate. Its \nprocedures and prerogatives are not arbitrary but reflect a \nresponsibility to balance a complex government which is designed to \nprotect the freedoms of the people against the temptation of government \nbecoming authoritarian.\n  I would like to give special recognition to Senator Robert Byrd. \nFrankly, when I entered this institution, Senator Byrd and I had some \ndisagreements over how we thought the National Government should \naddress its priorities. But over the years, I have come to gain \nincreasing respect and admiration for his defense of the institution of \nthe Senate precisely because it plays such a crucial role in protecting \nour individual freedoms.\n  Mine has been a wonderful life, an exciting and unpredictable \njourney. But\n\n[[Page S11876]]\n\nit is a journey that is not ending but, rather, taking a different \ncourse. I am planning to travel especially in Latin America to teach, \nto write at least one more book, to continue my years of interest in \nrelations within the Western hemisphere and in modernizing America's \nintelligence capability, and finally to fulfill our responsibilities to \nfuture generational leaders through the creation of an institution that \ninstills the values of public service of such great Floridians such as \nLeRoy Collins, Reubin Askew, and our former colleague Lawton Chiles.\n  These are things that excite me, that inspire me and to which I am \nconvinced I can make a better contribution as a private citizen at \nthis, the end of the beginning of my life.\n  Four years after he left the Presidency, President Harry Truman said:\n\n       I have seen a great many men in public life, and one of \n     their besetting sins is to stay in office too long.\n\n  I decided that I would not be guilty of this common failing, and that \nI should make way for younger men.\n  I extend my congratulations to the man Floridians have chosen as my \nsuccessor, soon to be Senator Mel Martinez. I wish him the very best in \nhis new role. Mel is a friend. He is a good man who has served Florida \nand America in many different positions of responsibility. I know the \nSenate will welcome him to his new home in the Senate.\n  We Floridians have high expectations for Senator Mel Martinez and for \nthose who will be serving in the 109th Congress and beyond.\n  Goodbye, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Privacy...................................................1801''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is poised to \npass S. 1301, the DeWine-Schumer-Leahy Video Voyeurism Prevention Act \nof 2004. This bill targets the pernicious practice of invading a \nperson's privacy through the surreptitious use of hidden surveillance \nequipment. Specifically, the bill makes it a crime to capture an \nimproper, naked, or near-naked image of a person without his or her \nconsent, and in such a way as to violate his or her privacy. Any person \nfound guilty of video voyeurism as outlined in the bill may be fined or \nimprisoned for up to 1 year or both.\n  In recent years, the explosion of microcamera technology has fed the \ngrowing phenomenon of video voyeurism. Hidden cameras have been \ndiscovered in bedrooms, bathrooms, public showers, changing rooms, \nlocker rooms, and tanning salons, all aimed at filming unsuspecting \nvictims in various states of undress. Often, the invasion of privacy is \nexacerbated when captured images are posted on the Internet for all the \nworld to see.\n  I commend Senators DeWine and Schumer for bringing this invasive \npractice to the attention of the Judiciary Committee and for crafting a \nbill that addresses it in a thoughtful and measured manner. In \naddition, I thank them for addressing a concern I raised during the \ncommittee's consideration of the bill. As introduced, the bill did not \nexpressly prohibit ``cyber-peeping''--a particularly offensive form of \nvideo voyeurism involving the contemporaneous transmission of improper \nimages of a non-consenting person over the Internet through Web cameras \nand other means. As reported by the Judiciary Committee, the ``cyber-\npeeping'' loophole has been closed: The bill before the Senate today \ncovers the simultaneous Web casting of images or any other \ntransmissions that may not be recorded so that defendants who use this \nmeans of violating people's privacy cannot escape punishment.\n  The National Center for Victims of Crime has dubbed video voyeurism \n``the new frontier of stalking.'' The States are already responding to \nthis ``new frontier'' in many different ways. Some have passed video \nvoyeurism laws; others have addressed the conduct within the context of \ntheir laws against stalking. The Video Voyeurism Prevention Act brings \nthe Federal criminal laws to bear on those who commit this offense \nwithin the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United \nStates. It should be enacted without delay.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of passage of the \nVideo Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004. This act would help safeguard \nthe privacy we all value, and help ensure that our criminal law \nreflects the realities of rapidly changing technology. It would do this \nby prohibiting both the filming of and taking compromising pictures of \npeople in places where they expect privacy the most. This important \nlegislation would give prosecutors\n\n[[Page S11877]]\n\nand law enforcement officers the tools they need to fully prosecute \nthese disturbing acts, acts that have, tragically, become more and more \nprevalent.\n  For example, a woman in my home State of Ohio became a victim of \nvideo voyeurism while she attended a church picnic with her young \ndaughter. She told the Cincinnati Enquirer that, ``as I crouched down \nto put the baby in my stroller, I saw a video camera sticking out of \nhis bag, taping up my dress. . . . It rocked my whole sense of \nsecurity.'' The law needs to say clearly that such an act is illegal.\n  As disturbing as these acts are, they are occurring with increasing \nfrequency and are going unpunished. Almost weekly, there are reports of \ncameras found in public bathrooms and changing rooms. Just recently, an \nemployee of the New Mexico Department of Transportation had installed a \ntiny camera in an office restroom. What makes these crimes even more \ntroubling is the ease with which these images can be transmitted to \ncountless people via the Internet. Now, not only has an individual been \nvictimized by having per picture taken, she faces the possibility of \nmillions more seeing those pictures in cyberspace.\n  While video voyeurism is currently illegal in over 30 States, \nincluding Ohio, there are still areas where prosecutors are unable to \nfile charges for these crimes. As the defense attorney for one video \nvoyeur aptly observed, ``The criminal law necessarily lags behind \ntechnology and human ingenuity.''\n  This legislation takes an important step toward ensuring a person \nthat he or she will not be filmed or photographed where there is a \nreasonable expectation of privacy on Federal land, like at a national \npark. Additionally, the bill makes certain that perpetrators of video \nvoyeurism are punished, by imposing a sentence of a fine or \nimprisonment for up to 1 year.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting the legislation.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendment, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Soda Ash Royalty Reduction \n     Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 702. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The combination of global competitive pressures, flat \n     domestic demand, and spiraling costs of production threaten \n     the future of the United States soda ash industry.\n       (2) Despite booming world demand, growth in United States \n     exports of soda ash since 1997 has been flat, with most of \n     the world's largest markets for such growth, including \n     Brazil, the People's Republic of China, India, the countries \n     of eastern Europe, and the Republic of South Africa, have \n     been closed by protectionist policies.\n       (3) The People's Republic of China is the prime competitor \n     of the United States in soda ash production, and recently \n     supplanted the United States as the largest producer of soda \n     ash in the world.\n       (4) Over 700 jobs have been lost in the United States soda \n     ash industry since the Department of the Interior increased \n     the royalty rate on soda ash produced on Federal land, in \n     1996.\n       (5) Reduction of the royalty rate on soda ash produced on \n     Federal land will provide needed relief to the United States \n     soda ash industry and allow it to increase export growth and \n     competitiveness in emerging world markets, and create new \n     jobs in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 703. REDUCTION IN ROYALTY RATE ON SODA ASH.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 102(a)(9) of the Federal Land \n     Policy Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701(a)(9)), section \n     24 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 262), and the terms \n     of any lease under that Act, the royalty rate on the quantity \n     or gross value of the output of sodium compounds and related \n     products at the point of shipment to market from Federal land \n     in the 5-year period beginning on the date of the enactment \n     of this Act shall be 2 percent.\n\n     SEC. 704. STUDY.\n\n       After the end of the 4-year period beginning on the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and before the end of the 5-year \n     period beginning on that date, the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall report to the Congress on the effects of the royalty \n     reduction under this Act, including--\n       (1) the amount of sodium compounds and related products at \n     the point of shipment to market from Federal land during that \n     4-year period;\n       (2) the number of jobs that have been created or maintained \n     during the royalty reduction period;\n       (3) the total amount of royalty paid to the United States \n     on the quantity or gross value of the output of sodium \n     compounds and related products at the point of shipment to \n     market produced during that 4-year period, and the portion of \n     such royalty paid to States; and\n       (4) a recommendation of whether the reduced royalty rate \n     should apply after the end of the 5-year period beginning on \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       Amend the title so as to read ``An Act to direct the \n     Secretary of the Interior to convey certain land to the \n     Edward H. McDaniel American Legion Post No. 22 in Pahrump, \n     Nevada, for the construction of a post building and memorial \n     park for use by the American Legion, other veterans' groups, \n     and the local community, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nfollowing revision transmitted to the Senate on December 7, 2004, by \nthe President of the United States: 1995 Revision of Radio Regulations \n(Treaty Document No. 108-28).\n  I further ask that the revision be considered as having been read the \nfirst time, that it be referred with accompanying papers to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed, and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the 1995 Revision of the Radio \nRegulations, with appendices, signed by the United States at Geneva on \nNovember 17, 1995 (the ``1995 Revision''), together with declarations \nand reservations of the United States as contained in the final Acts of \nthe World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-95). I transmit also, for \nthe information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State \nconcerning these revisions.\n  The 1995 Revision, which was adopted at WRC-95, constitutes a \nrevision of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio \nRegulations, to which the United States is a party. It provides for the \nsimplification of the Radio Regulations, the introduction of new global \nmobile-satellite services, and new regulatory provisions both for non-\ngeostationary satellites operating in the same frequency bands as \ngeostationary satellites and for other new space services that share \nspectrum with the space research and terrestrial services.\n  Subject to the U.S. declarations and reservations mentioned above, I \nbelieve the United States should become a party to the 1995 Revision, \nwhich will facilitate the development of mobile-satellite and non-\ngeostationary satellite orbit communication services by U.S. Government \nand industry, it is my hope that the Senate will take early action on \nthis matter and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor a \ndistinguished American for his tireless, dedicated service to the U.S. \nArmy, the U.S. Senate, and the American people. After more than four \ndecades of national service, Acting Secretary of the Army Less Brownlee \nis resigning his post as Under Secretary of the Army.\n  Secretary Brownlee is a highly decorated veteran. He has earned the \nSilver Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Bronze Star with two Oak Leaf \nClusters, and a Purple Heart during his two tours of duty in Vietnam \nand over 22 years on active duty.\n  He has also served this body with distinction for 18 years as a Hill \nstaff member, reaching the post of staff director for the Armed \nServices Committee. During his time on the committee, Secretary \nBrownlee was the committee's principal professional staff member \nresponsible for Army and Marine Corps programs, Special Operations \nForces, and drug interdiction policy and support. In addition, he was \ndeeply involved in policies and programs ranging from ballistic missile \ndefense and weapons programs to strategic deterrence and naval \nstrategy.\n  Most recently, during his 18 months as Acting Secretary of the Army, \nSecretary Brownlee has been responsible for managing the Army's $80 \nbillion annual budget and more than 1.3 million Active Duty, National \nGuard, Army Reserve, and civilian personnel. As a part of this duty, \nSecretary Brownlee has overseen recruiting, organizing, supplying, \nequipping, training, and mobilization efforts.\n  In addition, during his tenure, the Army began the process of an \nextraordinary transformation to meet the threats and challenges of the \n21st century. Most notably, the Army has born the brunt of the global \nwar on terrorism, making all Americans proud of its victories and \nachievements in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other far-off places around the \nglobe.\n  Throughout these challenging times for the Nation and our Armed \nForces, Secretary Brownlee has consistently provided strong, steady \nleadership for the Army as it adapts and prepares for the future. His \nservice as Acting Secretary of the Army will undoubtedly have a \nprofound impact on our fighting men and women and will ensure that the \nArmy remains the world's finest fighting force for years to come.\n  I congratulate Secretary Brownlee on a brilliant career. I thank him \nfor his\n\n[[Page S11883]]\n\ncommitment and dedication to making America stronger and safer, and I \nwish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11883-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RETIREMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT TO SECRETARY OF THE ARMY\n\n  Mr. REED.

He epitomizes leadership by example, \nperpetuating a work environment in which harmony, resilience, and \nproductivity reign. In the days following the terrorist attack on the \nPentagon, he faced his toughest leadership challenge. Not only did he \nhave to deal with the tragic loss of 40 staff members and the injury of \nmany more, he also had to lead the effort of restoring calm and \nproductivity to the agency, the Army, and the Pentagon, minimizing any \ndisruption of support to the Army and OSD.\n  As the overseer of the Defense Post Office, Mr. Hudson faced the \npossibility of receiving mail contaminated with chemical or biological \nagents since the Pentagon's mail is processed through the same facility \nwhere two United States Postal Service workers died from exposure of \nmail contaminated with anthrax spores. Working in collaboration with \nDefense Department and White House officials, Mr. Hudson quickly \nassessed the threat and developed courses of defense.\n  His reputation for initiating leading-edge business practices is \nwidely recognized. His vision, adaptability, and passion for customer \nsuccess have enabled him to gain recognition for the Office of the \nAdministrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army as a preferred \nsupport provider throughout Headquarters, Department of the Army, and \nDefense Department activities within the Pentagon and the National \nCapital Area.\n  Mr. Hudson has been a focused and competent defender of the Army's \nlimited resources and is absolutely committed to achieving operational \nexcellence. In more recent years, he consistently used his keen \nbusiness acumen, technical expertise, political savvy, and \nresourcefulness to proficiently position the agency for the best \nbusiness results.\n  Mr. Hudson is a superior advisor, astute negotiator, and superb \nadministrator who can operate comfortably in all environments. His \nability to bring divergent parties together and forge a common vision \nto achieve desired outcomes is renowned. His mastery of unique Defense \nDepartment and National Capitol Region relationships has enabled him to \nconsistently produce quality results, even on the most contentious and \ncomplex issues. Perhaps the best examples of Mr. Hudson's ability to \nbuild coalitions and achieve results for the Army and the Department of \nDefense are evident in his management of the Army's executive aircraft \nfleet and his championing of the Pentagon Athletic Facility. In the \nfirst initiative, Mr. Hudson worked with Defense Department and \nCongressional representatives to acquire two state-of-the-art executive \nairplanes. As the overseer of the Pentagon's 55-year old athletic \ncenter, Mr. Hudson realized that the aging infrastructure of the \ncurrent facility and the growing demand for fitness facilities in \nsupport of the Army's readiness mission required quick action. Once \nagain, he negotiated prime real estate at the Pentagon for the \nconstruction of a new facility and fought for and won funding for the \n$19 million project that offers a state-of-the-art facility comparable \nto well-known commercial fitness facilities.\n  Mr. Hudson's distinctive accomplishments, selflessness, dedication, \ncommitment to excellence, and willingness to ``go the extra mile'' in \nsupporting the Department of the Army, the Department of Defense and \nJoint Service activities in the Pentagon truly set a standard of \nexcellence for others to follow. Mr. Hudson's distinctive \naccomplishments and selfless service in support of the Defense of our \ngreat nation truly set a standard of excellence worthy of emulation. I \nthank him on behalf of a grateful Nation and wish him well in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11883-2", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11883-S11884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WORLD AIDS DAY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to comment on World AIDS Day, which \nwas on December 1. The global HIV/AIDS pandemic is a humanitarian \ncrisis of horrific proportions. World AIDS Day is a day to remember the \nmillions of lives lost to and devastated by this global pandemic and to \nstrengthen our commitment to fight this disease.\n  Last year, Congress passed legislation that created the Office of the \nGlobal AIDS Coordinator and pledged $15 billion over 5 years to address \nthe HIV/AIDS crisis. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee continues \nto make HIV/AIDS a priority. Charged with the oversight of the \nPresident's initiative, we will continue to hold hearings and briefings \non the subject of AIDS and the progress of the President's Emergency \nPlan for AIDS Relief. Earlier this year, for instance, we held a \nhearing focused on the intersection of HIV/AIDS and hunger. At this \nhearing, Ambassador Randall Tobias, the Global AIDS Coordinator, and \nJim Morris, Executive Director of the World Food Program, testified \nabout the devastating effects that the HIV/AIDS crisis is having on \nagricultural workers and the food supply in sub-Saharan Africa. In \naddition, we explored the special nutritional needs of individuals who \nare taking antiretroviral medication.\n  The theme of World AIDS Day this year, ``Women, Girls, and HIV and \nAIDS,'' is an appropriate one. This disease is having a particularly \ndevastating effect on women and girls around the world. We are just \nbeginning to understand how women, and young girls in particular, are \nespecially vulnerable to HIV and AIDS, due to a combination of \nbiological, cultural, economic, social, and legal factors. Young girls \nconstitute 75 percent of new infections in South Africa among \nindividuals between 14 and 25 years of age. In Malawi, the National \nAIDS Commission has said that HIV and AIDS is killing more women than \nmen, and that HIV-positive girls between 15 and 24 years of age \noutnumber males in the same age group by a six-to-one margin. Even in \nthe United States, the disease is having a devastating effect on women \nand is the leading cause of death among African American women ages 25 \nto 34.\n  Not only are women and girls more vulnerable to infection, they are \nalso shouldering much of the burden of taking care of sick and dying \nrelatives and friends. In addition, in the vast majority of cases, they \nare the caretakers of the estimated 14 million children who have been \norphaned by this pandemic. Grandmothers often take the responsibility \nof caring for grandchildren, and older female children often take care \nof their younger siblings.\n  One such young girl is Fanny Madanitsa. Fanny is a 16-year-old girl \nliving in Malawi with her two younger sisters and a brother. Life has \nbeen difficult for Fanny and her siblings since they lost their parents \nto AIDS. As the oldest child, Fanny must deal with the stress of taking \ncare of her younger siblings. They live in a modest house and share one \nbed. Fanny dreams of\n\n[[Page S11884]]\n\nbeing a nurse, but reaching this goal will be a challenge for her. She \ncannot always attend classes, as she sometimes has to look after her \nsiblings. Because money is scarce, she has a difficult time paying for \nschool materials and other costs of her education.\n  But Fanny is more fortunate that many girls in similar circumstances. \nWith the help of her Village AIDS Committee, a community-based \norganization that has organized to take care of the orphans in its \nvillage, Fanny and her siblings receive food, soap, school materials, \nand also medicines. Through the Village AIDS Committee, which receives \nsupport from Save the Children, the community assists Fanny in watching \nher siblings so she can attend school.\n  This June, I introduced the Assistance for Orphans and Other \nVulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of 2004. My bill would \nrequire the United States Government to develop a comprehensive \nstrategy for providing assistance to orphans and would authorize the \nPresident to support community-based organizations that provide basic \ncare for orphans and vulnerable children.\n  Furthermore, my bill aims to improve enrollment and access to primary \nschool education for orphans and vulnerable children by supporting \nprograms that reduce the negative impact of school fees and other \nexpenses. It also would reaffirm our commitment to international school \nlunch programs. School meals provide basic nutrition to children who \notherwise do not have access to reliable food. They have been a proven \nincentive for poor and orphaned children to enroll in school.\n  In addition, many women and children who lose one or both parents \noften face difficulty in asserting their inheritance rights. Even when \nthe inheritance rights of women and children are spelled out in law, \nsuch rights are difficult to claim and are seldom enforced. In many \ncountries, it is difficult or impossible for a widow--even if she has \nsmall children--to claim property after the death of her husband. This \noften leaves the most vulnerable children impoverished and homeless. My \nbill seeks to support programs that protect the inheritance rights of \norphans and widows with children. Although the legislation will not \nbecome law this session, I am hopeful that, with bipartisan support, it \nwill become law early next year.\n  The AIDS orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for \npolitical stability, development, and human welfare that extend far \nbeyond the region. Turning the tide on this crisis will require a \ncoordinated, comprehensive, and swift response. I am hopeful that, with \nthe President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Global Fund, and \nthe Congress, we can make great strides in the battle against this \npandemic.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, December 1 marked the 17th annual \nobservance of World AIDS Day. HIV/AIDS is an epidemic that requires a \nglobal solution and the United States has a responsibility to lead the \nworld in addressing this horrible disease.\n  Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic more than two decades \nago, over 21 million people have died as a result of this disease. \nWorldwide, more than 42 million people are living with HIV/AIDS. It is \nestimated that AIDS claims the lives of over 8,000 people per day and 5 \nmillion more people are infected with HIV/AIDS each year.\n  This year's theme for Global AIDS Day is ``Women, Girls, HIV and \nAIDS'' to recognize and call attention to the rapidly growing number of \nfemales with HIV/AIDS. Women, and especially young women, are almost \ntwo and a half times more vulnerable to the disease than men because of \nthe social and educational inequalities they face in many areas of the \nworld. Women are much more likely to be sexually abused and are less \nlikely to be aware of the risks associated with unprotected sex and IV \ndrug use. Women also risk passing the disease on to their newborn \nchildren. It is estimated that over 19 million women currently live \nwith HIV/AIDS, of which 2 million will pass the disease on to over \n700,000 newborn children worldwide this year alone.\n  Tragically, more Americans lost their lives to AIDS in the 1990s than \nin all wars in U.S. history. Currently it is estimated that there are \nnearly 950,000 Americans living with HIV/AIDS, nearly one-third of \nwhich do not know they are infected. The disease continues to spread \nthroughout the country and we have seen infection rates among women and \nminorities rise at alarming rates over the last few years.\n  The vast majority of deaths from HIV/AIDS occur in the developing \nworld, most notably in Africa where AIDS is the leading cause of death. \nWhile Africa accounts for only 10 percent of the world's population, \napproximately two-thirds of the world's HIV/AIDS cases occur there. \nThere are an estimated 11,000 new infections per day in Africa and 57 \npercent of all women living with HIV/AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  In addition, there have been dramatic increases in HIV/AIDS cases in \nAsia, Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean. This is clearly not a regional \nissue. The disease is spreading in every corner of the globe. The \nindustrialized world has benefited greatly from new medicines that help \npeople live with HIV/AIDS, but most developing countries still lack \naccess to them in sufficient quantities. In many areas, non-\ngovernmental organizations are operating small-scale pilot programs \nthat clearly are not adequate to meet the needs of the millions who are \nliving with the disease. In order to successfully combat HIV/AIDS on a \nglobal scale, resources must continue to be made available to \ndeveloping countries to assist in integrating prevention, treatment, \nand education programs into a national health care system.\n  There are no easy solutions to the problems associated with this \nepidemic. Researchers are continuing to work hard to find new \ntreatments and ultimately a cure for this devastating disease. Halting \nthe spread of the epidemic requires prevention and a commitment to \nsupporting organizations that are vigorously working to defeat HIV/AIDS \nthrough education, humanitarian relief, and public awareness.\n  We must recognize the sobering reality that this disease continues to \nspread and infect people around the globe regardless of race, gender, \nage, or income. Remembering those who have already lost their lives to \nHIV/AIDS requires us to redouble our efforts to defeat the disease and \nprevent its spread to new members of our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11884-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11884-S11885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NORTHERN ARIZONA FOREST LANDS EXCHANGE AND VERDE RIVER BASIN \n                            PARTNERSHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after several years of negotiation and \ncompromise, I am pleased that the Northern Arizona Forest Lands \nExchange and Verde River Basin Partnership Act of 2004 was approved by \nthe Senate today. Through the dedicated efforts of all parties, this \nbipartisan agreement provides a sound framework for a fair and equal \nvalue exchange of 50,000 acres of private and public land in Northern \nArizona. The bill also addresses the water issues raised by the \nexchange of lands located within the Verde River Basin watershed by \nlimiting water usage on certain exchanged lands and by supporting the \ndevelopment of a collaborative science based water resource planning \nand management entity for the Verde River Basin watershed.\n  It is gratifying that the compromise reached on the bill, after \ncountless hours of deliberation and discussion, is both balanced and \nforesighted in terms of addressing the various issues raised by the \nexchange. I want to thank Senator Kyl and his staff, as well as \nSenators Domenici and Bingaman, and their staffs on the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, for their tireless efforts in reaching \nthis agreement. I also want to recognize the work of Congressmen Renzi \nand Hayworth who have championed this legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The bill sets forth a sound process for the achievement of a fair \nmarket value exchange which is expected to offer significant benefits \nfor all parties. Benefits will accrue to the U.S. Forest Service and \nthe public with the consolidation of checkerboard lands and the \nprotection and enhanced management of extensive forest and grasslands. \nThe communities of Flagstaff, Williams, and Camp Verde also will \nbenefit in terms of economic development, water supply, and other \nimportant purposes.\n  Since introducing this legislation in April 2003, I have heard from \nhundreds\n\n[[Page S11885]]\n\nof Arizonans and learned first-hand of the significant water issues \nraised by the transfer of federal land into private ownership. I want \nto thank all of the citizens that offered their time, expertise, and \ninterest and provided us with valuable information on these issues. In \nlarge measure because of their efforts, I am more keenly aware that one \nof the most crucial challenges facing Arizona is the wise management of \nits water resources, particularly as we endure extended drought coupled \nwith rapid population growth. Therefore, I am pleased that in addition \nto facilitating the Northern Arizona land exchange, this bill includes \na number of new provisions to address water supply concerns associated \nwith the exchange.\n  First, in order to ensure that current water users and water rights \nholders are not adversely affected by increased future water demands, \nan agreement was reached to remove an 820 acre parcel of federal land \nin the Verde Valley, where the long-term availability of water supplies \nis uncertain and current problems exist. On the remaining 2000 acre \nparcel of federal land in the Verde Valley, a maximum water use limit \nof 300 acre-feet per year has been established along with other land \nand water use restrictions.\n  Further, this bill includes a new title which supports the creation \nof a Verde River Basin Partnership to advance sound water resource \ndecision-making at the state and local level in Northern Arizona.\n  The development of a sound, long-term watershed management plan \nrequires the involvement of all the stakeholders with water supply \nresponsibilities and interests and a foundation of knowledge about \navailable resources and existing demands. We are fortunate to have an \nexisting model of collaborative science-based water resource planning \nand management with the Upper San Pedro Partnership in the Sierra Vista \nsubwatershed of Arizona. In my view, the establishment of a similar, \ncooperative body in the Verde Basin will be a vital step in assuring \nthe wise use of our limited water resources.\n  Again, I want to thank all of the parties involved in this \nlegislation during the past several years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11885-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            VETERANS HEALTH PROGRAMS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the \npassage of H.R. 3936, which is essentially a conference report on \nvarious veterans' health care measures. This bill will go far in giving \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, the tools it needs to continue \nproviding high-quality health care to our Nation's veterans. Though the \nbill contains many important provisions, I would like to draw attention \nto just a few of its key ones.\n  H.R. 3936 would authorize specialized centers to improve the \nrehabilitation services available to veterans suffering from multiple \ncombat injuries. The centers would focus on all aspects involved in the \ndevelopment of improved rehabilitation programs, including through \nresearch, education, and clinical activities. These comprehensive \ncenters are designed specifically to fill the gap that currently exists \nin the treatment of the complex injuries that result from modern \nconflict. Due to technological advancements in warfare and body armor, \nas well as improvements in battlefield medical care, an increased \nnumber of service personnel are surviving wounds that probably would \nhave been fatal in previous wars.\n  The centers would be part of a larger collaboration effort between \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, and the Department of Defense, \nDoD, in order to improve the rehabilitation process and treatment of \nthese service members once they have returned from overseas. The \ninitiative as a whole truly represents the way in which VA health care \nis evolving with changes in the areas of warfare and health care \ndelivery.\n  The Veterans Health Programs Improvement Act of 2004 also would \nrequire VA to track waiting times for specialty care services and \nsubsequently issue to Congress a report on any such waiting times of \nmore than 3 months. VA has been suffering from a severe shortage of \nspecialty care physicians. This shortage has led to significant \nincreases in the time it takes for veterans to get appointments for \nspecialty services like audiology and ophthalmology.\n  This compromise legislation would also provide a fix for the way VA \nper diem payments to State homes for veterans are handled, as they \nrelate to Medicaid. Recently, many State homes have become Medicaid-\ncertified to secure eligibility for payment for any veteran who \nqualifies under the Medicaid program. However, Medicaid officials \ndetermined that VA per diem payments made to State homes for the care \nof veterans are ``additional payments'' made on behalf on an individual \npatient. Thus, VA's per diem payments must be reimbursed to the \nMedicaid program. This provision would specify that per diem payments \nmade by VA for the care of veterans in State homes will not be used to \noffset or reduce any other payment made to assist veterans in securing \nhealth care services. The impact of this change will be felt in many \nStates across the country, including my home State of Florida.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have contributed to legislation that is \nso vital to the continued provision of quality health care to our \nNation's veterans. I thank my colleagues in both Chambers of Congress \nfor their support of this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11885-2", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11885-S11886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VETERANS' BENEFITS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, as ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am proud to announce the passage of \nS. 2486, the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004, by both \nChambers of Congress.\n  This bill, which I shall call the compromise agreement, is the final \nversion of a veterans omnibus bill. The compromise agreement will \nimprove and expand a host of veterans benefits, including: survivors \nbenefits for spouses with dependent children; housing benefits; and \neducational benefits for Guard and Reserve members, veterans, and \nspouses of veterans killed on active duty.\n  It is very appropriate that at a time when our airmen, soldiers, \nsailors and marines are in harm's way, that we remember the sacrifices \nthat those before them have made on behalf of this great Nation by \nimproving and expanding veterans benefits for our Nation's bravest and \ntheir families.\n  I will briefly highlight some of the more important provisions. For \nfurther explanation of the proposed legislation please see the Joint \nExplanatory Statement, which accompanied the passage of the bill.\n  Dependency and indemnity compensation is a monthly benefit paid to \neligible survivors of service members who died on active duty, and of \ncertain veterans. A larger monthly benefit is paid to surviving spouses \nwith children under the age of 18. Under this legislation, dependency \nand indemnity compensation for survivors, with dependent children, of \nspouses killed on active duty would be increased by $250 a month, for 2 \nyears, beginning on the date when entitlement to benefits begins. A VA \ncontracted study found that spouses with children had a higher level of \nunmet need than spouses without children. This provision is included to \nfurther aid the transition of surviving spouses with dependent \nchildren. We must make every effort to make certain that the families \nof service members who paid the ultimate sacrifice have their needs \nmet.\n  Owning a home of one's own is the American Dream. This legislation \nwould make that dream a reality for more of our veterans by increasing \nthe maximum amount of the VA home loan guaranty. The current VA loan \nlimit of $240,000 restricts beneficiaries from using the guaranty \nbecause it is insufficient to cover median housing prices in many parts \nof the Nation. Section 403 of the compromise agreement would increase \nthe maximum VA loan amount to $333,700. It would also index the loan \nlimit to 25 percent of the conforming loan limit for a single-family \nresidence as set by Freddie Mac. This would allow the loan limit to \ncontinue to rise with the cost of housing inflation automatically. This \nchange, coupled with the reinstatement of the VA adjustable rate \nmortgage loan program and improvement of the hybrid adjustable rate \nmortgage loan program will allow many more veterans to be able to \npurchase a home.\n\n[[Page S11886]]\n\n  The second half of the American Dream is a college education. \nEducational assistance is provided to the surviving spouse of a service \nmember or veteran who died of a service-connected injury, or the spouse \nof a veteran who is rated by VA to be totally and permanently disabled. \nThe spouse has 10 years to use the entitlement. However, many surviving \nspouses, during this difficult transitional period, are busy raising \nchildren and working making it impossible to use the education benefit. \nThis legislation would give an additional 10 years to the surviving \nspouse of a service member who died of a service-connected disability \nto use the benefit.\n  Under current law, a member of the Selected Reserve or National Guard \nmust contribute a nonrefundable $1,200 in order to participate in the \nMontgomery GI Bill education program. However, a member of the Selected \nReserve must spend one year on active duty before being eligible for \nthe program. Section 109 of the committee bill would create flexibility \nand allow the Montgomery GI Bill participation fee to be collected not \nlater than 1 year after the completion of 2 years of active duty, \nensuring that the Reserve or Guard has become eligible by satisfying \nthe service requirement.\n  With the costs of attending college rising, it is important that we \ndo as much for our veterans as possible so that they may reach their \nacademic objectives. This legislation would allow VA to reimburse \neligible beneficiaries for the cost of certain national admission \ntests, such as the Law School Admission Test, Graduate Record Exam, \nGraduate Management Admission Test, and Scholastic Aptitude Test, and \nfor course credit at institutions of higher learning, such as the \nAdvanced Placement Exam and College-Level Examination Program.\n  In keeping with this committee's continuing effort to aid veterans in \nattaining appropriate education and employment opportunities, this \nlegislation improves the full-time apprenticeship and on-job training \nprograms under the MGIB. Section 103 of the compromise agreement, for \nmore than a 2-year period, would increase the full-time VA monthly \neducational assistance allowance payable to individuals participating \nin these training programs. For the first 6 months of training, the \nmonthly benefit would increase to 85 percent from 75 percent; for the \nsecond 6 months, 65 percent from 55 percent; and the remainder of \nmonths, 45 percent from 35 percent. Additionally, section 104 of the \ncompromise agreement authorizes VA to pay educational benefits to \nveterans participating in competency-based apprenticeships, in addition \nto time-based apprenticeships, bringing the VA program in line with the \nway most apprenticeship programs are structured today.\n  These provisions show our veterans America's continuing unwavering \nsupport of the service and sacrifice that they have made on behalf of \nthis country. Particularly at a time when we are at war, we must ensure \nour service members that we will fulfill the commitment promised by \nAbraham Lincoln, ``to care for him that shall have borne the battle and \nfor his widow and his orphan.''\n  In conclusion, I specifically thank Senator Specter and his benefits \nstaff for their work on this comprehensive bill, specifically Bill \nTuerk, Jon Towers and Chris McNamee, and my staff--Buddy Menn, Mary \nSchoelen, Dahlia Melendrez, Ted Pusey, Amanda Krohn, and Tandy Barrett, \nwho recently left the committee, for all of their hard work in helping \nto put this legislation together. I thank my colleagues for their \nsupport of this legislation on behalf of America's veterans and their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11886-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HEALTH CARE PERSONNEL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF \n                                  2004\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the \npassage of S. 2484, which reflects a compromise agreement on a new \nsystem for compensating physicians and dentists in the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, VA, health care system, as well as alternative work \nschedules for VA nurses. VA doctors and dentists have not gotten a pay \nadjustment in over a decade. All of these measures are aimed at \nimproving VA's ability to recruit and retain quality health care \nprofessionals. I would like to highlight some of the key aspects of \nthis legislation.\n  The compromise agreement would set forth a three-tiered system for \npaying VA physicians and dentists. The three tiers consist of base, \nmarket, and performance pay. The base pay element is similar to that \nemployed by other Federal agencies, also known as the General Schedule, \nGS, system. As such, increases would be guaranteed for every 2 years a \nphysician or dentist remains employed by VA.\n  The second component of the new pay system is market pay. This \nelement would be implemented by the Secretary in the form of pay bands \nthat will be determined by surveys of regional salaries in the academic \nand private sectors. Also relevant to the market pay determinations are \nfactors such as the scarcity, or abundance, of certain specialty \nphysicians, type and years of experience, and board certifications. \nFinally, the Secretary would consult with professional review panels \ncomposed of other physicians or dentists.\n  The final component is performance pay. Performance pay would be \nawarded to doctors and dentists if they meet certain goals and measures \nset forth by the Secretary. Currently, VA has extensive performance \nmeasures that it utilizes to motivate its health care providers and \nensure quality of care. This element has a maximum of $15,000 or 7.5 \npercent of the sum of the base and market pay.\n  One other major section of this agreement would establish alternative \nwork schedules for VA nurses.

Mr. President, I commend President Bush on his recent trip \nto Canada and efforts to build on our strong relations with our \nneighbor to the north. Canada is our Nation's largest trading partner \nand one of our closest allies, and this relationship must continue to \nremain vibrant and strong. As the co-chairman of the Canada-U.S. \nInterparliamentary Group, I continue to work with my peers in Canada to \ndo what I can to assist in this effort.\n  Despite certain media coverage to the contrary, many Canadians warmly \nembrace Americans and the President's policies. I want to share \ncomments made by Senator Jerry Grafstein in the Canadian Senate on the \noccasion of President Bush's visit. I ask unanimous consent that they \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               ``Manifest Democracy''--The Bush Doctrine\n\n       Honourable senators, today President Bush visits Canada. We \n     welcome President Bush, his wife and his senior advisers to \n     our nation's capital. As Co-chair of the Canada-U.S. \n     Interparliamentary Group, now the largest interparliamentary \n     group in Parliament, it is my hope that Canada will actively \n     engage President Bush and the Bush doctrine, which I call \n     ``Manifest Democracy.''\n       Senators will recall that, in 1947 the then Minister of \n     External Affairs, Louis St. Laurent, in Toronto defined the \n     principles and practices of Canada's foreign policy based on \n     these words: ``freedom, liberty and democracy.'' Mr. St. \n     Laurent and his then Deputy Minister, Mr. Pearson, were not \n     confused by political debate or shifting political opinion \n     within or outside Canada when it came to Canada's strategic \n     interests.\n       In 1947, the UN was gridlocked. It was Mr. St. Laurent who \n     convinced a reluctant Mr. King that Canada should take the \n     lead in constructing and joining a transatlantic coalition of \n     democracies to enhance our collective security called NATO. \n     Mr. St. Laurent had learned well from the lessons of \n     history--the sad experience of the League of Nations and the \n     causes of World War II. Mr. St. Laurent believed in the \n     democratic dialectic. Both Mr. St. Laurent and Mr. Pearson\n\n[[Page S11887]]\n\n     were not confused. They understood that democracies did not \n     make war with democracies.\n       Before the shock of 9/11, it seemed the 21st century voices \n     for a democratic dialectic were muted. The origins of the \n     Helsinki Process were forgotten. It was the Helsinki Process, \n     in 1974, that laid the groundwork for democratic change in \n     Europe. The Berlin Wall collapsed following the popular \n     democratic movement of Solidarity in Poland and the \n     ``Velvet'' revolution in the Czech Republic. The drive toward \n     human rights and expanding democracies slowed at the turn of \n     the century. Yet, the appetite for democracy once tasted \n     cannot be easily satisfied. With the ``Rose'' revolution in \n     Georgia, and now the ``Orange'' revolution in Ukraine, \n     democracy is on the march again.\n       The Bush doctrine of manifest democracy provoked by \n     September 11, 2001, continues to gain support by raising the \n     banner of freedom, liberty and free markets. Public sentiment \n     for democracy is rising not only in the East, in Georgia and \n     now Ukraine, but across Eurasia, in Afghanistan and seeping \n     into the dialectics of the Middle East as well as, painfully, \n     in Iraq.\n       My hope is that Canada will regain its principal place as \n     an active protagonist and creative partner for democracy, \n     liberty and freedom and as a forceful agent in the spread of \n     free trade and free markets around the globe.\n       Canada owns a capacious toolbox of democratic instruments \n     and best practices that can quickly and cost-efficiently be \n     deployed to help build the infrastructure of democracy--\n     independent parliamentary commissions; parliamentary \n     practices, including checks and balances; separation of \n     powers; policing; independent judging and free trade \n     agreements.\n       We hope that Prime Minister Martin and Canada will actively \n     re-engage with President Bush and America, as we did after \n     World War II, in a collective effort to spread democracy, \n     free trade and free markets around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11887-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBRANCE OF ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today marks the sixty-third \nanniversary of the horrific attacks on Pearl Harbor, HI, the first \nmajor attack on American soil by a foreign enemy since British troops \nset fire to the White House and the Capitol Building in the War of \n1812. It was 60 years later, September 11, 2001, before the next attack \ntook place on American soil. Pearl Harbor will always be remembered as \nthe first incident to shock the collective psyche of our Nation out of \nits complacency.\n  Whether it could be classified as a terrorist act or otherwise, the \nattack on Pearl Harbor claimed the lives of 2,403 American servicemen. \nThis event, perpetrated by a people who have long since reconciled \ntheir differences with America and the world, is a reminder to all of \nus of the sacrifices made by millions of individuals during this time \nof national peril. Their selfless actions and incredible courage in the \nface of extreme personal risk helped to ensure that the freedoms which \nare the bedrock of our country were preserved. We honor the memory of \nour countrymen who sacrificed their own lives, so others could live, \nand the families who lost loved ones in the attack. And we honor the \nsurvivors of Pearl Harbor, including the roughly 6,000 who are still \nalive today. We must never forget any of these brave Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11887-2", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT AND COPYRIGHT ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, in the waning hours of this \nCongress, the Senate has passed legislation that will improve important \nparts of our intellectual property law. Sponsored by myself, as well as \nby Senators Hatch, Cornyn, Biden, and Feinstein, the Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act of 2004 is the product of many months \nof bipartisan effort. Many of its provisions have passed the Senate \nbefore, others have passed the House, and the package enjoys the well-\njustified support of the many stakeholders. I am especially grateful \nfor the assistance and support of our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives as we have tried to craft a broad, consensus bill.\n  Intellectual property is one of the driving forces in our Nation's \neconomy, but if we do not continue to protect it, we will lose our \nplace as the global leader in its production. Just as importantly, the \nUnited States enjoys the fruits of the labors of a multitude of \ncreative and talented artists and inventors. Our arts and sciences \nbring not only monetary revenue to the country, but deep artistic \nsatisfaction and rewards on a cultural level. The Digital Age has great \npotential to bring more of each.\n  Digital technology has allowed producers of intellectual property to \nfind new and innovative ways to create and distribute their products, \nand it has enhanced our position as a global leader in the creation of \ncultural and intellectual works. However, the ease of duplication and \nnearly instantaneous communication that make these technologies so \nwonderful has also been used by some to undermine intellectual property \nrights; as a result, many of our copyright-holders are reluctant to \nembrace the very tools that offer so much to consumers and, if used \nlegally, to our innovators. Thus, we face a key challenge: to preserve \nintellectual property rights while at the same time promoting the \ngrowth of new technologies. This act responds to the challenge. It \nbolsters our intellectual property protections while preserving the \nfreedom necessary to make full use of music, movies, and other \nentertainment. The act also takes important steps to preserve our \nNation's rich cultural heritage, and to ensure that this heritage \nremains available to our children.\n  The act includes the version of the CREATE Act that has passed both \nthe House and Senate. That bill corrects for a provision in the Bayh-\nDole Act which, when read literally by the Court of Appeals for the \nFederal, runs counter to the intent of that legislation. The correction \nwill encourage more of the joint efforts between private industry and \nresearch universities that have proved so fruitful to the U.S. economy, \nour research universities, and the many Americans who work in the \npatent industries.\n  It also includes a version of the National Film Preservation Act and \nthe Preservation of Orphan Works Act. These two provisions each play an \nimportant role in preserving our national heritage. The National Film \nPreservation Act, which I first introduced on November 21, 2003, \nreauthorizes a Library of Congress program dedicated to saving rare and \nsignificant films. The Preservation of Orphan Works Act corrects a \ndrafting error in the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. \nCorrection of this error will allow libraries to create copies of \ncertain copyrighted works, such as films and musical compositions that \nare in the last 20 years of their copyright term, are no longer \ncommercially exploited, and are not available at a reasonable price.\n  The act also includes the Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act, \nwhich protects filmmakers from an increasingly common threat: the theft \nof their work by individuals who record films as they are played in \ntheaters. Part of that provision directs the Register of Copyrights to \ncreate a registry of pre-release works in order to better address the \nproblems associated with piracy of creative works before they are \noffered for legal distribution and provides improved remedies for such \npiracy.\n  It also includes the Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004, an important \npiece of legislation that Senator Biden has championed for several \nyears. This provision adds much-needed protections to those who create \nrecords, films, and computer programs, by expanding the prohibition on \naffixing counterfeit labels to such products. Another provision, the \nFraudulent Online Identity Sanctions Act, enhances the integrity of the \nInternet by creating a rebuttable presumption that a trademark or \ncopyright infringer acted willfully if that infringer used false \ninformation to register a domain name used in connection with the \ninfringement. It also increases penalties for crimes committed using \nfraudulently-acquired domain names.\n  Finally, the act includes the Family Movie Act, which will preserve \nthe right of home viewers to watch motion pictures in the manner they \nsee fit. At the same time, the act protects the rights of directors and \ncopyright holders to maintain the artistic vision and integrity of \ntheir works.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and in both houses \nof Congress, for their hard work on this bill. Our efforts here should \nbe a model for achieving legislative consensus in this area, and \nothers, in the future.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11888-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11888]]\n                 ARUBA AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nGovernment of Aruba, a leader in the fight to stop the flow of \nterrorist funds in the Caribbean and Latin America. There can be no \ndoubt that terrorism is the defining challenge of the Nation since 9-\n11. While I have always believed that the United States must boldly and \nconfidently lead the way in this brutal war we find ourselves in, I \nbelieve that help from our allies is essential to stop the financial \nnetworks that support terrorism.\n  One of the most important fronts in the war on terror concerns the \nfunding mechanisms that support terrorist activities, including \nunderground financial systems, illicit charities, and corrupt financial \nservice providers. Financiers, fundraisers, or donors who provide \nfinancial support to terrorists need to be stopped.\n  Earlier this year, I had met with the Prime Minister of Aruba, Mr. \nNelson Oduber. We discussed the international threat of terrorism and a \nnumber of other issues. Prime Minister Oduber stressed his nation's \nsupport for stopping terrorism and his determination in stopping money \nlaundering and terrorist financing in his nation.\n  In fact, Aruba's leadership in this field started in 1990 when it \nhosted what became known as the Aruba Drug Money Laundering Conference, \na regional mirror of the Financial Action Task Force--FATF--launched at \nthe Paris G-7 summit of 1989. This started a process, which eventually \nled to the creation of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force--\nCFATF--an organization that now plays a key role in the War on Terror. \nOn October 30, 2001, the FATF adopted eight special recommendations on \nterrorist financing and Aruba has moved to implement some of those \nrecommendations.\n  I pay tribute today to Aruba for joining the United States of America \nin the War on Terror.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11888-2", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as a former Sacramento County, CA, \nsheriff's deputy, I have, throughout my congressional career, zealously \nsought to ensure the safety and effectiveness of America's Federal, \ntribal, State and local law enforcement officers. I have also worked \nhard to promote a better understanding and appreciation of law \nenforcement's extraordinary service and sacrifice by the American \npublic.\n  Underscoring this commitment, I was proud to have authored a number \nof important laws, including the National Law Enforcement Museum Act \n(P.L. 106-492); the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003 (P.L. \n108-277); the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act (P.L. 106-517); the Cops \nin School Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-302) and the resolution passed each \nyear to designate May 15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. I \nwant to take this opportunity to also commend my deputy chief of staff \nand legislative director, Larry Vigil, for all of his good work in \ngetting these important initiatives passed on behalf of law \nenforcement.\n  As I conclude my tenure in the U.S. Senate, I challenge my colleagues \nand those who will follow in my footsteps to continue this valuable and \nnecessary work to support those brave individuals who are putting their \nlives at risk each and every day for our safety and protection. There \nare currently some 870,000 sworn law enforcement officers serving our \nNation. Each year, on average, 167 officers are killed in the line of \nduty--that is one officer killed somewhere in America every 53 hours. \nRoughly 58,000 officers are assaulted each year, resulting in about \n17,000 injuries. It is the most dangerous profession in our Nation, and \nalso one of the most important.\n  An inscription on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, \njust a few blocks from here in a place called Judiciary Square, says it \nbest: ``In valor there is hope.'' As long as there are men and women \namong us who are willing to put their lives on the line for others, \nthere is indeed great hope for this Nation of ours.\n  But, it must be remembered that our officers cannot do their job \neffectively or safely without the necessary resources. This means the \nbest possible training and equipment, especially bullet-resistant vests \nfor every officer. Studies have clearly shown that these vests save \npolice lives. In fact, nearly 3,000 police lives have been saved by \nbullet resistant vests since they first started being used some 30 \nyears ago.\n  But, another vital resource that our officers need is the trust and \nsupport of the American public they serve. That is why one of my \nproudest achievements as a legislator and former law enforcement \nofficer was authoring the law to establish a National Law Enforcement \nMuseum here in our Nation's capital. The U.S. Department of Justice has \ndetermined that only about one out of five Americans has any direct \ncontact with a law enforcement officer during the course of a normal \nyear, and most of those contacts are traffic stops. The fact is that \nmost of our citizens draw their conclusions about law enforcement from \nthe fictional works of Hollywood and the often sensationalized \nreporting by the media. Most Americans do not truly understand, nor \nfully appreciate the tremendous worth of the law enforcement profession \nto our Nation.\n  But all of that will soon change when the doors of the National Law \nEnforcement Museum open, which is expected to happen in 2009. Finally, \nwe will have a popular destination here in Washington, DC, devoted to \ntelling law enforcement's true story of selfless service and supreme \nsacrifice. Through some of the most entertaining and stimulating \nexhibit ideas I have ever seen for a museum, visitors will experience \nwhat it is like to walk in the shoes of a police officer, and to make \nsplit-second, life-or-death decisions. They will understand the vital \nroles our officers played in every pivotal moment of our Nation's \nhistory, including the taming of the Wild West, and the wars against \ngangsters, drug lords and now, terrorists. In short, this museum will \nvastly increase public understanding and support for law enforcement, \nand the museum's research repository will contribute greatly to \npromoting police safety. It will truly be a must-see destination in our \nNation's capital and, appropriately, it will be located right across \nthe street from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n  I want to commend Craig W. Floyd, the chairman of the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial Fund, his talented staff and dedicated \nboard of directors for working so hard to make this museum a reality, \njust like they made the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial a \nreality in 1991. Neither of these projects would be successful, though, \nwithout the generous funding provided by citizens and corporations \nacross this country and I am grateful to see that support pouring in \nfor the museum.\n  I pledge my continued full support for this museum project and I \nchallenge my colleagues to do the same. That means ensuring that during \nthe public approval process the integrity and importance of this museum \nas a major visual presence in Judiciary Square must not be compromised \nin any way.\n  Those dedicated public servants of the law enforcement profession--\nespecially the more than 16,500 officers who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice in the performance of duty, and their families--deserve no \nless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11888-3", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11888-S11890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ELDER JUSTICE ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to commend Senator John \nBreaux and his staff for their excellent work on the Elder Justice Act. \nThey have worked long and hard on this legislation, and I share their \nstrong desire to see it pass the Senate this year.\n  I would like to share the comments I received from two Florida \nattorneys, Nick Cox and Mark Shalloway, who have extensive knowledge \nand experience in elder justice issues.\n  Nick Cox is a professor at the Stetson University College of Law in \nSt. Petersburg, where he specializes in elder consumer protection \nmatters and works on a special Federal project within the Elder Law \nCenter. Mr. Cox, a former State prosecutor, worked for Attorneys \nGeneral Bob Butterworth and Charlie Crist as their acting central \nFlorida regional deputy and bureau chief of the Economic Crimes \nDivision, which is the Florida Attorney General's consumer protection \nunit. Mr. Cox's comments are as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S11889]]\n\n\n       I feel very strongly about passage of this act from a \n     consumer protection standpoint. At this time I have been \n     researching criminal elder exploitation issues and have found \n     that there is a complete lacking in good support research. \n     Despite several attempts to get a statistical handle on how \n     bad criminal exploitation of the elderly is, the reports that \n     have been done have been consistently criticized or found to \n     be scientifically/statistically deficient. The Elder Justice \n     Act calls for such research to be done on a national level \n     and would provide the needed data that could assist those of \n     us in the field of identifying the primary issues and \n     hopefully some suggestions for solutions to the problem.\n       I also am very excited about the call in the Elder Justice \n     Act for nationwide centers of excellence for study into these \n     matters. We have already begun such work here at Stetson, but \n     we can only address it on a regional basis here given the \n     magnitude of our senior populations in Florida and throughout \n     the Southeast United States. However, the work we have done \n     so far has been very well received and applauded by those in \n     the aging network. I think the Elder Justice Act would also \n     give us some significant strides forward in that respect as \n     well.\n       I also, as a former prosecutor, appreciate the attention it \n     seems to give to increasing prosecutions. From the \n     exploitation standpoint, I have experienced the positive \n     outcome of criminally charging scam artists and the resulting \n     change in business practices in that area. My office \n     conducted undercover sting operations with the Florida \n     Department of Law Enforcement. Once we convinced a prosecutor \n     to charge a few of the salesmen and business owners who were \n     targeting and scaring seniors into buying unneeded and \n     overpriced equipment, there was an immediate change in the \n     manner in which other companies conducted business.\n       Anything we can do to encourage or mandate criminal \n     prosecutions will be a positive step. I think the Elder \n     Justice Act starts us in the right direction.\n\n  Mark Shalloway is a practicing attorney in West Palm Beach and has \nextensive experience in elder abuse and exploitation. Mr. Shalloway's \ncomments are as follows:\n\n       Elder Law attorneys, including my Florida colleagues see a \n     great deal of elder abuse and financial exploitation on a \n     weekly to monthly basis in our offices. The National Academy \n     of Elder Law Attorneys (NAELA) is one of the five founding \n     members of the Elder Justice Coalition that has worked for \n     several years to get this piece of legislation passed. \n     Senator Breaux and other supporters, like yourself, deserve \n     much credit for keeping this bill on the front burner during \n     a year when few bills have been addressed.\n       The revised version of S. 333 that the Finance Committee \n     has marked up is not as comprehensive as the original bill, \n     but is a great starting point and should be passed by the \n     full Senate as soon as possible.\n       As a Long-Term Care Ombudsman in Florida, I am anecdotally \n     aware of the difficulties in identifying and prosecuting \n     crimes against the elderly. This Act should give greater \n     recognition to a silent but huge and growing problem.\n\n  I agree with the comments of Mr. Cox and Mr. Shalloway, and have thus \nstrongly supported passage of the Elder Justice Act.\n  During Finance Committee deliberations of the Elder Justice Act, I \nadded two critically important provisions to the bill. These amendments \nstrengthened the bill immensely, would have greatly improved patient \nsafety in long-term care facilities, and, in fact, would have saved \nlives.\n  Therefore, I am greatly disappointed that my patient safety \nprovisions were the basis of an objection from Senator Gregg. That \nobjection resulted in the provisions being stripped from the Elder \nJustice Act. The result? The legislation will do less on behalf of our \nelderly Americans than it could have done, and the elderly will \ncontinue to suffer from adverse events and death as a result of \nmedication errors. This disappoints me deeply.\n  I would like to briefly describe the two amendments I had hoped would \nbe part of the Elder Justice Act.\n  The first would have provided grants to long-term care facilities to \nimprove quality and prevent neglect by improving patient safety and \nreducing health care complications and deaths resulting from medication \nerrors in long-term care settings.\n  Section 108 of the Medicare Modernization Act gave authority to the \nSecretary to make such grants available to physicians in order to \nimprove the quality of care and patient safety in physician offices. We \nshould strive for no less for our patients in long-term care \nfacilities.\n  According to the Institute of Medicine, medical errors cause up to \n98,000 deaths in this country each year, in addition to otherwise \navoidable injuries, hospitalizations, and expenses.\n\n  Although technologies are available to reduce errors and save lives, \nstart-up costs and a lack of awareness have slowed the diffusion of \nthese technologies, and prevented our long-term care facilities and \nelderly patients from reaping the benefits of these technologies.\n  The grant program would improve patient safety among the elderly by \nreducing medication errors in long-term care facilities. Grant money \ncould be used by long-term care facilities to purchase proven \ntechnologies; the adoption of computer physician order entry systems, \nfor example, is an essential component of any effective strategy to \nreduce medication errors.\n  Purchase and deployment of such systems is a substantial investment. \nCosts can delay the rapid introduction of new information technologies \ninto long-term care facilities that already are grappling with other \nmajor financial challenges.\n  The grant program would have reduced this barrier by providing \nfinancial incentives for long term care facilities to adopt the \nresource intensive information technologies essential to system wide \nstrategies for reducing and eventually ending most medication errors.\n  We know how to improve patient safety. We know how to save lives. My \nprovision to create a grant program would have done just that, and I \ndeeply regret having to strike the provision because of Senator Gregg's \nobjection to it.\n  My second amendment would have required the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to develop a plan for adopting open standards to enable \nimproved electronic submission of clinical data by long term care \nfacilities and allowing electronic transmission of data using such \nstandards.\n  Although the Medicare Modernization Act requires the Secretary to \ndevelop uniform standards relating to requirements for electronic \nprescription drug programs, there is no provision for adopting uniform \nstandards for data not related to prescription drug programs and no \nrequirement that the Secretary allow long term care facilities to \nsubmit data electronically to HHS using uniform open standards.\n  The use of open standards is critical to ensuring that systems are \nable to communicate with each other and without human manipulation, \nthus allowing information to be processed automatically and quickly. \nAutomatic, expedited processing of information will reduce neglect in \nthe form of medical errors and save lives.\n  Currently, data may only be transmitted electronically using \nspreadsheets, PDFs, or SAS transport files. This form of submission \ndoes not allow systems to communicate with each other, and slows the \nprocessing of information.\n  I would like to explain the importance of this amendment to my \nconstituents back in Florida and to people throughout our country.\n  Flu season is approaching. Without timely and accurate information to \nguide public health officials and physicians, seniors in my State and \nthroughout the country are at risk. But, the public health system \ncurrently relies on a slow and unreliable methods of tracking outbreaks \nsuch as postcards and phonecalls from physicians and other medical \nprofessionals. If I want to get information on the health status of 290 \nmillion Americans, post cards and telephone calls simply aren't \nadequate. We need to use electronic reporting based on some common \nmethod of collecting that data to make public health safer.\n  Vioxx provides another example. Vioxx is a drug used for arthritis by \nseniors throughout the world; it was withdrawn by its manufacturer this \nfall. Vioxx was first sold in the United States 5 years ago and has \nbeen marketed in more than 80 countries. Worldwide sales of Vioxx in \n2003 were $2.5 billion. It is a major drug with broad use. But, the FDA \nrelies on slow and unreliable methods of tracking problems associated \nwith drugs that may only appear after they go into broad use. Although \nprescriptions are one of the most thoroughly computerized areas in \nmedicine, the FDA relies on slow and unreliable methods to track \nmedical problems resulting from drug use. We need to use electronic \nreporting based on common method of collecting that data to make drug \nuse safer.\n\n[[Page S11890]]\n\n  One last example: heart conditions are one of the leading diseases \naffecting Medicare patients and heart attacks can result in deaths and \nhigh costs. Many heart attack victims can be helped if they receive \ndrugs to assist their damaged heart while it recovers. CMS studies \nindicate that many of the victims do not receive those medications. \nBut, CMS collects that data with great effort--relying on many health \nprofessionals to extract data from clinical records and summarize the \ndata for analysis. By the time the data is available, the patient has \nmet their fate and the time for correcting a mistake, for getting them \na lifesaving drug, has passed. We need to use electronic reporting \nbased on a common method of collecting data to improve quality of care \nand patient safety for those in long-term care facilities, and for all \nMedicare patients.\n  I had hoped to see these measures pass in my final days in the Senate \nand thus leave patients with a safer medical system. I am deeply \ndisappointed in the removal of the amendments from the Elder Justice \nAct.\n  However because of my great desire to see the Elder Justice Act go \nthrough, I removed my hold on the legislation on Wednesday, November \n17. It is my understanding that the Elder Justice Act has not yet \ncleared the Senate because of Republican objections to the substance of \nthe legislation.\n  I share Senator Breaux's desire to see the legislation enacted this \nyear, and fervently hope that may still be possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11890-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ``HUGS, NOT BULLETS''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues a campaign by the Neighborhood Service Organization's Youth \nInitiatives Project in Detroit, MI, called ``Hugs, Not Bullets.'' This \nis an outstanding example of involvement by youth leaders who want to \nmake a difference in their community by decreasing gun violence.\n  The Youth Initiatives Project was created in 1999 to address growing \ncommunity issues including violence and substance abuse in Detroit. For \nfive years, community organizations and students have been involved in \na coordinated effort to accomplish the goals of the project. Previous \nYouth Initiatives Project campaigns have focused on after-school \nprograms to reduce gun violence and increase the use of trigger locks \nin homes.\n  The current campaign, ``Hugs, Not Bullets,'' is intended to reduce \nthe use of firearms during the celebration of the New Year's holiday. \nYouth leaders have been organizing for months and plan to enlist over \n200 students and numerous community groups in support of the campaign. \nSeveral rallies and a candlelight vigil are planned to draw attention \nto the campaign and the issue of gun safety. In addition, the \ncenterpiece of the campaign is a four-foot by eight-foot card which \nwill make its way through schools and the community to be signed by \nthose who pledge to help reduce gun violence over the New Year's \nholiday. The card will serve as a powerful symbol of the community's \ndetermination to fight violence, particularly involving firearms.\n  I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the members of the \nYouth Initiatives Project for their hard work to bring an end to the \ngun violence that continues to plague our society. I am hopeful that \nthe 109th Congress will do more to support their efforts and pass \nsensible gun safety legislation. We owe it to them, to our police \nofficers, and to our communities to do all we can to keep dangerous \nguns off of our streets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11890-2", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate having this opportunity to \nexpress my congratulations and note for the Record the achievements of \nDr. Steven F. Barrett who has just been named the Wyoming Professor of \nthe Year. This prestigious honor is the only national award that \nrecognizes the performance of college and university professors who \nhave produced outstanding results as undergraduate teachers and \nmentors.\n  As an assistant professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at \nthe University of Wyoming, Dr. Barrett has served as a role model for \nhis colleagues on the school's academic staff, as well as the students \nhe teaches in his classes. His unique teaching style gets students more \ninvolved in their classes and increases their commitment to the \nsuccessful completion of their education.\n  Dr. Barrett played a key role in the effort to improve the electrical \nand computer engineering curriculum. He revived courses in biomedical \nengineering and image processing that had not been taught for years. He \nalso served on a committee to establish a computer engineering degree \nat the university. Thanks in no small part to his efforts, the degree \nwas approved by the university trustees in 2000, and the first students \ngraduated from the program in 2001. Wyoming students now have the \nchance to obtain a degree in one of the fastest growing job industries. \nThat will help to improve their future chances for success and the \nability of our workforce to compete in an ever changing job market.\n  Dr. Barrett's dedication to his profession extends far beyond his \nefforts to establish the computer engineering degree. To ensure his \nstudents have the skills they will need to prepare them for post \ngraduate life, he has upgraded the department's course work and \nlaboratory activities involving microcontrollers, which are small self-\ncontained computers. When he couldn't find a textbook he liked for the \ndegree, he contacted a close friend and former colleague to help him \nwrite a text that he could use in his classes. He has gone on to write \nanother textbook and is in the process of completing a third. He truly \ndoes exemplify the characteristics needed to get students excited about \neducation and what they need to do to reach their greatest potential.\n  Dr. Barrett's classes provide his students with a unique opportunity \nnot only to learn, but to take a more active role in the process by \nhelping to teach what they have learned. He applied for and was able to \nsecure funding from the National Science Foundation for a program that \nimproves the interaction between undergraduates and those with \nassistive technology needs. Through the program, students have had the \nsupport and encouragement they needed to develop a workshop to teach \nassistive technology professionals how to adapt off-the-shelf toys to \nassistive technology teaching aids. His students were also involved in \nthe effort to create a 50-page workshop manual that they then used to \nhelp teach the workshop to assistive technology professionals across \nthe state of Wyoming. By giving students these life experiences, they \ncan more readily see the positive impact of the skills they have \ndeveloped in the effort to improve the lives and education of others.\n  Wyoming can be very proud of professors such as Dr. Barrett who are \nsuch an integral part of our Wyoming school system. His dedication to \nthe future of his students and his enthusiasm for teaching continues to \nimprove the quality of the education Wyoming students receive in our \nschools, and better prepares them for the challenges they will face in \ntheir postgraduate years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11890-3", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11890-S11891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNITED STATES CAPITOL HOLIDAY TREE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate Virginia's role \nas the 2004 provider of the annual U.S. Capitol Holiday Tree, selected \neach year from America's national forests.\n  In recent decades, the traditional Christmas tree has moved beyond \nits place as solely a religious symbol in the homes of hundreds of \nmillions of Americans. Although the Christmas tree will always, and \nrightfully, have a special meaning in Christian homes, today all \nAmericans await the annual tree-trimming to signal the beginning of the \nyear-end religious and holiday season.\n  It is with great pleasure that I join my colleagues from the Virginia \ncongressional delegation in recognizing the first-ever contribution \nfrom the Commonwealth of Virginia to this fine tradition. This year, \nour State, the home of the first English-speaking colony in the \nAmericas, and home to our first President, George Washington, and eight \nof his successors, will make America proud as the home of the Nation's \nholiday tree for the first time since this tradition began 40 years \nago.\n  The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote of friendship as a \n``sheltering\n\n[[Page S11891]]\n\ntree.'' And this year, thousands of Virginians--from all ages and from \nall across the Commonwealth--have extended the right hand of friendship \nto their fellow Americans by providing this great tree for display in \nour Nation's capital.\n  At five o'clock on the evening of December 9, the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives will mark the official beginning of America's \nholiday season by lighting 10,000 small lights on a 79-year-old \nVirginia red spruce that, until last month, stood as one of Virginia's \nfinest. Without question, it has lived through a remarkable period in \nour Nation's history.\n  That flip of a switch will culminate over a year of activity by \nordinary Virginians, park rangers, State officials, schoolchildren and \ncountless others in selecting, preparing and decorating this wonderful, \n82-foot tree from Warm Springs Ranger District of the George Washington \nNational Forest in Highland County.\n  All Virginians rightfully take pride that this 7,500 pound tree will \nremain lit each evening on the National Mall until the 2nd of January, \nwelcoming the Christmas and Holiday season for citizens across this \ngreat land. Since the day last month that the tree was airlifted from \nits place in the George Washington National Forest, Virginians from \nevery corner of the Commonwealth have played a part in getting this \nwonderful tree ready for primetime. Beginning on November 13, the \nspruce visited 33 communities in our State on its way to the National \nMall: Monterey, Winchester, Leesburg, Culpeper, King George County, \nWestmoreland County, Henrico County, Petersburg, Charles City, Hampton, \nOnancock, Cape Charles, Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Suffolk, Emporia, \nSouth Boston, Chatham, Damascus, Smyth County/Marion, Wise, Tazewell, \nWytheville, Clifton Forge, New Market, Staunton, New Castle, Roanoke, \nOrange, Amherst, Farmville, Manassas, Alexandria, and Vienna.\n  In addition to the thousands of Virginians who greeted the tree on \nits way to Washington, thousands of other school children, scouts, \nState and Federal officials, police departments, members of 4-H clubs, \nand citizen volunteers also took part in crafting and preparing some \n10,000 original ornaments for the tree. Approximately 5,000 of these \nwill hang on the holiday tree, and the rest will decorate 70 smaller \ncompanion trees in the Nation's capital.\n  As the time-intensive, individual contributions of tens of thousands \nof Virginians demonstrate, our State is proud to take a lead role this \nyear in welcoming in the Christmas and holiday season for our fellow \nAmericans. On a personal note, one of my longest-serving and hardest-\nworking staff members, Ms. Doriene Steeves, has played a key organizing \nrole in putting together this wonderful event for the benefit of our \nState and our Nation. I salute her and those other Virginians whose \nhard work and creativity have brought this magnificent tree to the \nNation's doorstep for all to see and appreciate through the holidays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11891-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING TOM BROKAW\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly honor and \nrecognize one of South Dakota's favorite sons, Tom Brokaw. He has had \nan extraordinarily successful career as anchor of NBC Nightly News. \nDuring his 21-year reign as anchor, NBC moved from the least watched to \nthe most watched network newscast.\n  Born in Webster, SD, in 1940, Mr. Brokaw attended high school in \nYankton, SD, and began his journalism career after graduating from the \nUniversity of South Dakota in 1962. He was hired by NBC news in 1966.\n  Throughout his tenure at NBC, Mr. Brokaw has gathered an impressive \nlist of accomplishments. In 1987, he was the first American to \ninterview Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, and this exclusive one-on-\none from the Kremlin earned him the prestigious Alfred I. duPont Award. \nMr. Brokaw was also the first American anchor to interview the Dalai \nLama and to report on human rights abuses in Tibet. In 1989, Mr. Brokaw \nwas the only anchor at the scene when the Berlin Wall fell, and in 1995 \nhe was the first anchor to report from the site of the Oklahoma City \nbombing. He was also the first American anchor to interview Russian \nPresident Vladimir Putin in 2000. Mr. Brokaw has reported live from war \nzones in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo.\n  Mr. Brokaw is a highly respected political journalist, having covered \nevery American election since 1968. He anchored all of NBC's political \ncoverage from 1984 through 2004, including primaries, national \nconventions, and election nights. He has also moderated nine primary \nand general election debates, including the Presidential debates of \n1987 and 1991.\n  In 1997, Mr. Brokaw won his second duPont award for ``Why Can't We \nLive Together,'' a documentary examining the racial separation within \nAmerican suburbs. He won his first Peabody award in 1989 for examining \nAmerican society in his report, ``To Be An American,'' and received \nanother Peabody in 2004 for ``Tom Brokaw Reports: A Question of \nFairness,'' which discussed the University of Michigan affirmative \naction case and the history of affirmative action in the United States. \nMr. Brokaw has received seven Emmy awards for reports on China, the \n1992 floods in the Midwest, and the 1999 Kosovo conflict, among others.\n  With his 1998 book ``The Greatest Generation,'' Mr. Brokaw became a \nbest selling author. ``The Greatest Generation Speaks,'' ``An Album of \nMemories,'' and ``A Long Way from Home'' subsequently followed. He has \nalso contributed to The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los \nAngeles Times, Newsweek, and Time.\n  Prior to his position as sole anchor for NBC Nightly News, Mr. Brokaw \nserved as Whitehouse Correspondent for NBC from 1973 to 1976, reporting \non the Watergate scandal, and from 1976 to 1981 he anchored NBC's \n``Today.''\n  After 38 years with NBC, Tom and his wife Meredith will be moving on \nto new challenges. Tom and Meredith have never forgotten their South \nDakota roots and have returned home with great frequency. Their \ngenerous contributions of time and financial assistance to projects in \nYankton, at the University of South Dakota, and throughout our State \nreflects their wonderful spirit of giving and a commitment to an \nenhanced quality of life for all South Dakotans. It is with great honor \nthat I share his impressive accomplishments with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11891-2", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11891-S11892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN HONOR OF THE ARLES GREENE FAMILY\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have a few words before we adjourn \nfor the holidays. This isn't the first year that there will be a lot of \nempty places at our holiday dinner tables. Even if our own table \ndoesn't have a missing spot, we know a neighbor or a friend whose \nbrother, mother, or husband is away fighting to keep us safe at home. \nThese empty places remind us of the generations of men an women who \nhave sacrificed to keep us free so that we can, in freedom, celebrate \nthose holidays that are important to each of us.\n  Today I rise to honor the service of the family of Arles Greene of \nHendersonville, TN. Arles's family has a lot of empty places around \ntheir dinner table in the Second World War. Arles's father Eugene W. \nGreene, his uncle William Edwin McDavid and friend Ed Gallbreath, Jr., \nall served some 60 years ago.\n  Ed Galbreath, Jr., a friend of Arles's family, joined the Air Force \nin February 1944, during his senior year of high school. He flew 23\\1/\n2\\ missions as a gunman, operated a VHF radio, and worked the radar \njammers. He survived four crashes. In his last crash, out of a B-24 \nTiger Shark, he landed in Berlin where he was taken prisoner. He spent \nmonths in confinement with some 6,000 other prisoners of war until he \nwas liberated by the Russian Army. For his bravery, Sergeant Galbreath \nreceived many awards, including the Air Medal with three Oak Leaf \nClusters, the Purple Heart, the P.O.W. Medal, and the Parachute Club \nMedal. His understanding of those prisons shaped his many future \ncontributions to his community of Goodlettsville, TN.\n  In October of 1943, Arles's uncle, PVT William Edwin McDavid, left \nMoccasin Gap, Virginia, to serve in the 38th Infantry Division. Private \nMcDavid was just 18 years old when he served in Normandy, the \nRhineland, the Ardennes, and northern France. While fighting in the \nBattle of the Bulge on New Year's Eve of 1944, McDavid suffered \nfrostbitten hands that ended his infantry\n\n[[Page S11892]]\n\ncareer. Private McDavid's service and bravery was recognized with the \naward of a European-African Theatre Ribbon with four Bronze Battle \nStars, a Bronze Star Medal, and a Purple Heart.\n  Arles's father, Eugene Greene, began his career with the U.S. Army in \nJuly 1944. The oldest of 12 children, he enlisted at 18 years old with \nthe Hancock County Draft Board. He served with the U.S. Army infantry, \n2nd Division, 9th Regiment that assisted in the liberation of Nazi \nconcentration camps in the spring of 1945. Greene and his unit \nliberated the death camps at Dachau. He remembers finding only 25 \npeople alive at the sub-camp where he shot a lock off a prison gate \nsetting them free. Those prisoners rushed to drink the milk of Holstein \ncattle pastured nearby.\n  Eugene met General Patton shortly before his death. He says of \nPatton, ``He was over there to get a job done, and that's what he \ndid.'' Eugene Greene returned with may memories of the war. Most of \nthese he buried in the fields of his Tennessee farm, but some lived \non--the faith he had in his fellow soldiers, in his family, and in God.\n  I have had a lot to say about the importance of teaching American \nhistory and civics to help our children grow up understanding what it \nmeans to be an American. The teacher in me thinks of this tribute as an \nassignment. I hope when we gather around our holiday tables this season \nwe pause to take stock, like Arles did, to answer what our own families \nhave contributed to America's history and to answering the question of \nwhat it means to be an American.\n  Thank you for allowing me to honor my friend Arles Greene and his \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11892-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MS. GLORIA MARTIN\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I honor Ms. Gloria Martin, a legal \nassistant to the Battalion Commander, 1st Battalion, 210th Aviation \nRegiment, Fort Rucker, AL. Ms. Martin was hired at Fort Rucker in \nJanuary of 1980. She has 24 years of exemplary and dedicated service to \nthe United States Army and Fort Rucker.\n  This morning, the Army will honor Ms. Martin with the Army \nOutstanding Employee of the Year with a Disability Award. Later today, \nMs. Martin will be honored by the Department of Defense as the Army's \nrecipient of the DoD Outstanding Disabled Employee of the Year Award. \nMs. Martin will also be honored with the Meritorious Civilian Service \nAward.\n  Ms. Martin was born on August 13, 1955, to Paul and Mallie Martin in \nOpp, AL. Ms. Martin has five brothers and sisters, including her twin \nsister Gladys. While Gladys was born healthy, Gloria suffered from \nserious abnormalities that she has battled her entire life. The \ndebilitating effects of scoliosis, neurofibromatosis and osteoporosis \nrequired a series of major back surgeries, the first when Gloria was 5 \nyears old making her childhood very difficult. Through all the \nsurgeries and many months of recovery and therapy, Gloria showed great \ncourage and strength by working extremely hard to complete her school \nwork to remain with her peers. She completed elementary school on time, \nand she also completed high school on time. She went on to complete a \nbusiness course as a member of the Dean's List at Douglas MacArthur \nTechnical College and worked two jobs before being hired at Fort \nRucker.\n  Gloria faced another major back surgery in 1992 and, despite \ncomplications that required a prolonged absence, she returned to her \njob at Fort Rucker with the same fierce determination and strength of \nwill that had made her such a popular and respected colleague with so \nmany of her fellow employees. A back injury in 2000 that left her with \na compression fracture in her middle back did not deter Gloria from \ncontinuing to perform her duties from home as best she could. But \nGloria returned to work at Fort Rucker with the help of a walker and \ncane even though she was in constant, often severe, pain.\n  Gloria Martin's tenacious and courageous service to the Army and Fort \nRucker is being very rightly rewarded. She has a wonderfully supportive \nfamily, and she also loves her church, the First Assembly of God in \nKinston, AL. She has held many leadership positions in her church and \nparticipates in community service activities. In a recent Army Flier \narticle, Ms. Martin put her experience in perspective when she said, \n``I think it's made me a stronger person because I grew up going to the \nHospital and to doctor appointments a lot. I feel like it has \nstrengthened my faith because when you have a disability, you have to \ndepend more on God. My faith gives me confidence in my abilities. It \ngives me the strength to get up in the morning. I know that my faith in \nGod and His care has enabled me to keep working.''\n  Gloria Martin is a very special lady, and I am very proud to join the \nArmy and Department of Defense in honoring her tremendous \naccomplishments and extraordinary service to our military. She is a \nrole model for us all. She is an example for so many others with \ndisabilities and a true testament to what faith and personal courage \ncan accomplish. She has touched many lives, and I thank her today for \nher service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11892-2", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11892-S11893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               KEITH KIDD\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, over the Thanksgiving weekend, I \nreceived a letter from a State Department employee from Dallas, Keith \nKidd, who left his previous job to serve in Afghanistan in 2003 and \nthen in Iraq early this year. As a representative from the U.S. Embassy \nto Iraq, he worked with military and civilian leaders from the Western \nAl Anbar Province. I want to share his Thanksgiving message to his \nfriends and family because he represents the best of America and his \nletter reflects the positive spirit that is so representative of our \ncountry. He has volunteered for the mission to stabilize Iraq and help \nthe Iraqi people have the freedom and democracy that every human being \ndeserves. I hope this letter makes every American proud of the \nthousands of U.S. men and women, both military and civilian, serving \nbravely overseas during the holidays.\n  His letter reads as follows:\n\n       Greetings from Ramadi.\n       As Thanksgiving draws near, I found it fitting to tally my \n     blessings. As it turns out, I have oodles of them.\n       I'm thankful that I'm alive. All of the attempts on my life \n     have failed. I realize I'm wrecking some poor terrorist's \n     batting average, but that's just tough. I'm thankful for the \n     guys on my Personal Security Detail who help ensure those \n     attempts keep failing. I'm thankful for my health. The dust \n     storms are bad for my eyes, nose, throat and lungs so I cry, \n     sneeze and cough but it could be much worse. Much worse.\n       I'm thankful for the Dining Facility. The grub is not all \n     that good but it sure beats MREs. The food is usually warm. \n     Sometimes it's even hot. We often go weeks without fresh \n     vegetables, but we enjoy them when we have them. I'm thankful \n     for Coke. I'm not a coffee consumer so that crimson-colored \n     can of carbonated cola contains the caffeine I crave when I \n     work to the wee hours all week.\n       I'm thankful for the military postal system. It eventually \n     delivers the dusty, bashed, mangled boxes that contain the \n     vital vittles, the essential sundries and the other simple \n     pleasures of home that folks have sent my way.\n       I'm thankful for fall. It has been over a month since the \n     mercury was measured in triple digits. I'm thankful for cool \n     evenings. I'm thankful for full moons, bright stars and \n     desert sunsets. I'm thankful that I get to see that big \n     orange orb drop below the horizon every day. The only thing \n     worse than having a bad day is not making it to the end.\n       I'm thankful for the shipping container that acts as my \n     desert abode. It's modest but it's higher class than the \n     plywood box I called home in Afghanistan. I'm thankful for \n     showers. Standing under a gentle cascade of water with a bar \n     of soap in hand is far superior to baby-wipe style bathing.\n       I'm thankful for electricity. It powers the window unit air \n     conditioner that keeps me from melting and the computer that \n     makes it possible for me to communicate with you. Sometimes \n     we don't have any of these things but it's nice when we do.\n       I'm thankful for armored cars. They have saved my life more \n     than once. I'm thankful for ballistic vests. They protect me \n     from flying projectiles when I'm in town. I'm thankful for \n     sandbags. They protect me from flying projectiles when I'm at \n     home. I'm thankful for Mylar. It's a plastic coating on my \n     windows that prevents the glass from shattering into \n     thousands of pieces when flying projectiles break through it. \n     I'm thankful for dumb luck.

Carol was \ninstrumental in establishing the Fall River Visitor Center at Rocky \nMountain National Park, the acquisition of Cherokee Park by the Forest \nService, and many other smaller objects that have greatly benefitted \nour public lands and will lead to greater enjoyment by the public.

I \nwish to take a moment now to honor NJCDC for the important work it is \ndoing in the State of New Jersey and the accomplishments it has \nachieved over the past decade.\n  The work of the NJCDC has helped make the dreams of New Jersey \nresidents become a reality for over a decade now. The NJCDC provides \nhope for a rewarding future through urban revitalization efforts, \nfinancial support, education initiatives, and the creation of jobs. The \nwork done by NJCDC has directly transformed the lives of many, \nespecially in the city of Paterson, where I was born.\n  In honor of the accomplishments of this organization, I ask that a \nproclamation honoring the tenth anniversary of the NJCDC be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The proclamation follows.\n\n       Whereas, the New Jersey Community development Corporation \n     is a non-profit community development and social service \n     agency based in the City of Paterson, New Jersey; and\n       Whereas, the New Jersey Community Development Corporation \n     and its dedicated staff empowers individuals to transform \n     their lives and offers a variety of programs and services to \n     assist economically disadvantaged individuals, at-risk youth, \n     and people with disabilities; and\n       Whereas, the New Jersey Community Development Corporation \n     helps create jobs, support affordable housing, generate \n     educational initiatives, and support men, women, and children \n     of the community; and\n       Whereas, the New Jersey Community Development Corporation \n     has contributed to the revitalization of the City of Paterson \n     and the Great Falls Historic District, helping to ensure a \n     vibrant future for the City and its residents; and\n       Whereas, now as the New Jersey Community Development \n     Corporation prepares to celebrate its 10th Anniversary, we \n     congratulate the staff and volunteers on this milestone.\n       Therefore, in presenting this citation to the New Jersey \n     Community Development Corporation, I, Frank R.

MARIE PRINGLE\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mrs. Marie \nPringle who is retiring this month from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA. Mrs. Pringle's retirement is well deserved after serving \nmore than 30 years for the Federal Government, including over 20 years \nin the VA's Office of Budget. Mrs. Pringle epitomizes the best of \npublic service in terms of her dedication, commitment, hard work, and \nprofessionalism.\n  Mrs. Pringle began her Federal service in 1972 with the Department of \nArmy as a clerk typist. She then moved on to the Department of Energy \nin 1978 to work as a budget analyst. After a 2-year period in the \nprivate sector, Mrs. Pringle returned to the Federal Government working \nfor the VA's Office of Budget. At the VA, Mrs. Pringle worked \ndiligently in analyzing the budgetary activities of the Department \nwhose budget has grown to some $68 billion.\n  As chairman of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, my staff and I have found Mrs. Pringle to be an \ninvaluable resource for reliable and timely data that was critical in \nhelping me make decisions impacting the millions of veterans who depend \non the VA.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize Harrison Lim, the founder and executive director of Charity \nCultural Services, who is retiring after 21 years of dedicated service \nto the community.\n  Mr. Lim emigrated from China to San Francisco over 30 years ago. Upon \nhis arrival in America, he struggled with the difficulties of learning \na new language and assimilating into a new culture. As he worked hard \nto establish himself in his new country, Mr. Lim noticed that there \nwere other immigrants who faced similar situations. Seeing the \nstruggles of immigrants, Mr. Lim dedicated his life to making sure that \nnew immigrants had resources available to them to ease the transition \nof immigration.\n  To achieve this goal, Mr. Lim founded and established Charity \nCultural Services Center, CCSC, in 1983. Located in the heart of San \nFrancisco's Chinatown, CCSC aimed to provide essential services to new \nAsian American immigrants and their families. Today, CCSC successfully \nassists over 4,000 people\n\n[[Page S11894]]\n\neach year by offering a variety of services, from employment-training \nfor adults, apprenticeship programs, and English-as-a-Second-Language \nclasses to school-based academic support services and other activities \nfor youth. Working with local government, businesses, and educational \ninstitutions, CCSC's programs result in the ability of new immigrants \nto improve their quality of life and provide them with a greater chance \nat equal opportunities. In 1990, seeing a similar need by Asian \nAmerican immigrants in Silicon Valley, Mr. Lim worked successfully with \nthe Silicon Valley community to establish a Silicon Valley chapter of \nCharity Cultural Services Center, the Silicon Valley Crosscultural \nCommunity Services Center.\n  In addition to his work at CCSC, Mr. Lim has also been involved with \nother community-based organizations in San Francisco. He has served as \nthe President of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association and \nalso sits on the Chinatown Economic Development Committee.\n  Mr. Lim has tirelessly strived to address the issues and meet the \nneeds of new immigrants and their families who find themselves living \nin two different cultures. Through CCSC, he has enriched the community \nby helping its residents develop positive identities, build confidence \nin their capabilities, and become active members of society.\n  Harrison Lim is an invaluable asset to the Bay Area's Asian American \ncommunity. I commend him for his dedication, hard work and many \nachievements, and wish him well in his future endeavors. I am sure \nthat, even in his retirement, he will continue to serve as an advocate \nfor the Bay Area's Asian American immigrants. He is the kind of person \nwho makes my state and our country a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11894-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO NORTH AMERICAN BAPTIST MISSION\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish today to give tribute to \nthe North American Baptist Mission for the great leadership and \nassistance they provided the citizens of Alabama in their time of need \nfollowing Hurricane Ivan. Their selfless devotion of time, energy, and \nskills played an integral role in helping Alabamians recover from such \na tragic event.\n  Much of Alabama suffered as a result of Hurricane Ivan. It was a \nmajor hurricane that did tremendous damage to homes and properties, \ntimber, and agriculture throughout the State. I was shocked by the \ndevastation that was left in the wake of the storm. I was, however, \nencouraged by the resilient nature of the citizens in Alabama during \nsuch a difficult time. I remain continually thankful for the thousands \nof volunteers and, in particular, the North American Baptist Mission, \nthat came to Alabama lending helping hands in our time of need.\n  Concerned for Alabama, the North American Baptist Mission alerted its \nchurches to the extreme destruction caused by Hurricane Ivan, and \nBaptist churches across the Nation responded. Volunteers from 14 \ndifferent States ventured into the most devastated counties in Alabama: \nBaldwin, Butler, Conecuh, Covington, Clarke, Escambia, Mobile, and \nWashington Counties. The Baptist volunteers assisted Alabamians in \nputting their homes and lives back together. The Baptist groups set up \n16 feeding sites that served 559,000 meals in Alabama. Specifically, in \nButler County, 45 North Carolina Baptist Men volunteers served 17,586 \nmeals. I had the opportunity and privilege of seeing this particular \noutreach mission, and I was thoroughly impressed with the volunteers \nattitudes and selfless acts. In addition to serving meals, clean up \ncrews removed yard debris from 1,750 homes and businesses throughout \nthe eight counties in Alabama, and in some locations the Baptist groups \nwere able to set up portable showers and washer/dryer connections, \nproviding 1,118 people with laundry assistance.\n  These men and women, working from motor homes and in the heat, \nreflected the best in selfless service. Many were retired and some have \nserved the Lord for many years, yet they were full of energy and \nvitality. They served, they encouraged, and they helped. The spirit of \nJesus was indeed alive and strong in Greenville.\n  I realize that there were numerous organizations, charities, \nchurches, and individuals that came to Alabama's aid in our time of \nneed. Additionally, I realize that what I witnessed in Greenville was \nmultiplied all across the State, and I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank all of the good Samaritans who sacrificed their \ntime, energy, and resources to help Alabamians on their road to \nrecovery. Particularly, I would like to say thank you to the North \nAmerican Baptist Mission volunteers I met in Greenville for their \nselfless devotion of time and energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11894-2", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NANCY EARLE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recently learned that Nancy Earle \nof South Conway, NH, was presented with the New Hampshire Lakes \nAssociation John F. Morton Annual Award for Exemplary Service, 2004.\n  I mention this for two reasons. First, although Nancy is not a \nVermonter, she and her husband Rink Earle once lived in Putney, VT \nwhere three sons and two granddaughters later attended the Putney \nSchool, her husband has a niece who lives in Norwich, VT, and they both \nhave close friends in Vermont. Second, this award honors Nancy for her \ntireless work to protect New Hampshire's many beautiful lakes, lakes \nwhich not only citizens of New Hampshire, but Vermonters and people \nfrom around the country, as well as from other countries, enjoy \nparticularly in the summer months.\n  Protecting the environment is a global challenge, but much if not \nmost of the work is done at the local level. New Hampshire's lakes, \nlike Vermont's and every State's, are threatened by rapid development \nalong their shores, by pollutants caused from marine craft and by over-\nfishing. It is concerned individuals like Nancy Earle, motivated by \nnothing more than their sense of responsibility to protect these \nfragile aquatic ecosystems for the use and enjoyment of future \ngenerations to whom we owe a debt of gratitude.\n  I want to congratulate Nancy for this award, and to commend the New \nHampshire Lakes Association for paying tribute to such a fine and \ndeserving person. Nancy was the president of the Walker's Pond \nAssociation in Conway for over 30 years. She will be 86 years old this \nDecember 24, and despite a recent bout with cancer I suspect that, \nhealth permitting, Nancy Earle will continue to do what she can to \nprotect New Hampshire's lakes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11894-3", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11894-S11895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENDING MAJOR GENERAL JOHN E. ``GENE'' PRENDERGAST ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a great man \nand his long career of selfless service to our country. On August 31, \nMajor General John E. ``Gene'' Prendergast retired after serving 12 \nyears as Montana's Adjutant General.\n  His 46-year career in the Montana National Guard began 1958, when he \njoined the Montana Air National Guard. I had the pleasure of getting to \nknow Gene during his time as Montana's Adjutant General. His \nleadership, vision, and dedication brought a great deal to the \ndedicated and professional men and women of the Montana National Guard.\n  Over the years, he worked to improve the Guard's infrastructure in \nthe State and saw the 1940s vintage buildings at Fort Harrison \nconverted into some of the most state-of-the-art facilities in the \ncountry. Top of the line military training sites exist today at \nLimestone Hills. In addition, new and improved infrastructure exists at \nthe Air National Guard Base at Gore Hill in Great Falls and the Army \nAviation Support Facility at the Helena Airport.\n  Our warfighters need the best equipment and infrastructure possible \nto do their jobs. Gene understood this and I enjoyed working with him \nto make some of these improvements a reality. As a result, Montana's \nGuard is known as one of the best in the Nation.\n  His work did not just stop there. During General Prendergast's time \nas Adjutant General, Montana's involvement in the Partnership for Peace \nProgram with the country of Kyrgyzstan became a model for the rest of \nthe United States. Also, the Montana National Guard's Youth Challenge \nProgram has successfully transitioned hundreds of ``at risk' youth to \nactive, involved members of society.\n  While he had a talented, dedicated, selfless group behind him, \nGeneral\n\n[[Page S11895]]\n\nPrendergast led in an inspiring and intelligent manner which will not \nbe forgotten. I enjoyed my time working with General Prendergast--a man \nI am proud to call my friend. His presence will be missed, but a new \nchapter of his life lies ahead, and I wish him well as that chapter \nunfolds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11895-1", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING TIM TURNER\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues a fine Iowan and American. Tim Turner, \nformerly of Iowa, has been selected for his photographic skills to \nrepresent the United States in the First International Culinary \nCompetition. This competition brings together professional culinary \nphotographers from around the globe to bring to life the elements of \nwine and food in unique settings. The artists will be judged by \nprofessional chefs, members of the press, and the general public.\n  Mr. Turner began his interest in photography while at Heelen High \nSchool in Sioux City, IA, and pursued it further at the University of \nIowa and the Brooks Institute of Photography. By combining his passion \nfor cuisine with his keen eye for photography he has received major \nrecognition for his work. His photographs have appeared in over 40 \ncookbooks and he has been nominated three times for the prestigious \nBeard Award and received a Beard Award for best food photography in a \ncookbook.\n  Commenting about his photograph selected for the competition, Turner \nstated:\n\n       The human touch is vital to the authenticity of the food we \n     eat, the wines we drink and the heirlooms we treasure. These \n     are the connections to the heart and soul of mankind.

Mr. President, I rise today to publicly recognize \nCecelia Fire Thunder, the newly elected president of the Oglala Sioux \nTribe. Ms. Fire Thunder is the first woman ever to hold this \ndistinguished position.\n  Located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southwest South \nDakota and comprised of about 16,000 residents, the Oglala Sioux Tribe \nelected Ms. Fire Thunder over Russell Means by a margin of 648 votes. \nTraditionally, the Oglala Sioux Tribe has only been led by male \npresidents or leaders. Those leaders include historic figures such as \nCrazy Horse and Red Cloud.\n  Ms. Fire Thunder's election is truly a momentous occasion, but this \naccomplishment is not the first example of her selfless dedication to \nserving her community. Ms. Fire Thunder has devoted much of her energy \nto enriching the lives of those around her, and now she will take on an \neven larger role in her tribe. Her altruistic vision for her people is \nunmatched.\n  Ms. Fire Thunder was born on the Pine Ridge Reservation but moved to \nCalifornia as a young child. Upon her return to the reservation 24 \nyears later, she attended nursing school and became active in an effort \nto provide free health care to people unable to afford it themselves. \nFire Thunder's background includes her work at a hospital, for the \ntribe itself, for state government, and as a private consultant. Most \nrecently, she served as the education specialist for Cangleska, Inc., a \ndomestic abuse education and prevention program on the reservation.\n  President-elect Fire Thunder was inaugurated today and I have faith \nthat her hard work will be a catalyst for positive changes in her \ncommunity. I congratulate Cecelia Fire Thunder on her election as the \nnext president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in southwest South Dakota. Ms. \nFire Thunder is a shining example of perseverance and strength for her \npeople, and for all South Dakota citizens. I have known Cecelia for \nsome time and I sincerely look forward to working with her for many \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11895-3", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF STEPHEN MYERS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly thank \nStephen R. Myers for his 32 years as chief investment officer of the \nSouth Dakota Investment Council. Mr. Myers has served with distinction \nas the state investment officer for the State of South Dakota since \nSeptember 11, 1972. He will retire in January to spend more time with \nhis wife, Mary Lynn.\n  The South Dakota Legislature created the investment council in 1971 \nto manage seven funds, including assets from the State's retirement \nsystem and the proceeds from tobacco lawsuit damages. Mr. Myers \ninvested $65 million during the first year of the council's existence \nand had immediate success. In more than three decades the fund has \nreturned an average of 11.2 percent annually, while the capital markets \nbenchmark is only a 10.5-percent annual return. The assets have grown \nto over $7.2 billion, with returns putting the funds in the top 1 \npercent of the Nation's pension funds. The returns from the SDIC's \ninvestments allow over 65,000 South Dakotans to retire with financial \ndignity.\n  Mr. Myers is a man of passion and integrity who takes his \nresponsibility to retiring South Dakotans very seriously. As he himself \nhas stated, ``When you're managing other people's money, it simply \nwon't do to have 99 percent integrity.'' Mr. Myers is also humble and \nquick to give credit to his co-workers and members of the South Dakota \nState Government for their roles in the SDIC's success.\n  In addition to his role as chief investment officer of the South \nDakota Investment Council, Stephen is a co-founder and past president \nof the South Dakota Investment Society and co-founder and executive \ncommittee member of the National Association of State Investment \nOfficers. He also received the National Association of State Investment \nOfficers' Stoddard Award for his significant contribution to the \nState's public pensions funds.\n  After growing up in Pierre, Mr. Myers attended the University of \nSouth Dakota, where he met his future bride. His dedication to and love \nof the State of South Dakota is evident and has led to investments that \nhave positively impacted every South Dakotan, either directly or \nindirectly. The State will miss his leadership, and it is with honor \nthat I share his accomplishments with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11895-4", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11895-5", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the President Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/12/07/senate-section/article/S11895-6", "month": "12", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11895-S11896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               ENROLLED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 2003, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on November 29, 2004, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills and \njoint resolution:\n\n\n[[Page S11896]]\n\n\n       S. 150.

3029. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage guaranteed lifetime income payments from annuities and \nsimilar payments of life insurance proceeds at dates later than death \nby excluding from income a portion of such payments; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, with over 77 million baby boomers beginning \nto retire in 2008, a serious retirement challenge is looming in our \ncountry. Moreover, with Americans living longer and a growing numbers \nof retirees facing the challenge of managing their own retirement \nsavings, we need to provide them with better retirement options. In \nresponse, I rise today to offer legislation aimed at assisting people \nto maintain their financial independence and their standard of living \nthroughout their retirement by making it easier for them to secure a \nsteady income for life.\n  In recent years, the focus of the ``retirement security'' debate in \nCongress has almost entirely been on the need to accumulate a nest egg \nto fund retirement. Congress is doing much to encourage personal saving \nand employer-provided retirement plans. I am proud of both our \nsuccesses and our continuing efforts in these areas. Encouraging \ngreater savings is an important step; however, it is not enough.\n  Unfortunately, there has been little attention paid to the retirement \nincome or ``payout'' phase of the retirement security equation. The \nrisk of outliving one's savings is one of the biggest problems facing \nretirees. I have heard it said that Americans perceive the retirement \nsavings ``finish line'' to be the point of retirement. But retirement \nis just the beginning of a very different kind of race, one of unknown \nduration. If Americans are going to fully enjoy their retirement years, \nwe need to ensure that as many Americans as possible will have a stream \nof income they cannot outlive. We have some control over when we \nretire. However, we have very little control over how long we will \nlive.\n  For most Americans, a ``secure retirement'' means maintaining their \nstandard of living through retirement and the means to deal with life's \nchallenges from the first day of retirement to the very last. For the \nmajority of Americans, that requires a steady stream of income that, \ncombined with Social Security or other retirement income, covers basic \nliving expenses--from housing expenses to medical bills, taxes to \ntransportation, food to clothing. Yet, Americans today are facing a \nserious and growing challenge to retirement security.\n  At the same time Americans are living longer, the future of private \nand public retirement programs, as well as financial markets, is \nincreasingly uncertain. Fewer Americans are covered by traditional \npension plans, and Social Security currently replaces on average only \nabout 42 percent of earnings. This means it's increasingly up to each \nindividual to manage their retirement savings to last their lifetime. \nAnd exactly how long will that period in retirement be? It depends. Of \ncourse none of us know how long we will live; research shows most \nAmericans vastly underestimate their longevity.\n  According to the Society of Actuaries, a male age 65 has a 50 percent \nchance of living beyond age 85 and a 25 percent chance of living beyond \nage 92. Indeed, the biggest risk we face in retirement is the longevity \nrisk--that is, living longer than our retirement savings lasts. In \norder to meet this challenge, Senator Conrad and I are introducing \nlegislation to encourage the use of retirement vehicles that pay a \nguaranteed lifetime income.\n  Under the Retirement Security for Life Act that Senator Conrad and I \nare introducing today, a tax incentive would be enacted that encourages \nretirees to provide themselves with a guaranteed lifetime income that \nthey can't outlive. Specifically, the proposal would exclude from \nFederal taxes one-half of the income payments from an annuity purchased \nwith after tax dollars (a so-called non-qualified annuity). \nImportantly, we have proposed a cap on the exclusion so that no more \nthat $20,000 could be excluded in a year. For a typical American in the \n25 percent tax bracket, this would provide an annual maximum tax \nsavings of up to $5,000. I believed that this modest tax incentive will \nenable some retirees to consider annuitizing a portion of their nest \negg so that they have a guaranteed lifetime of income.\n  This legislation has a wide range of support from organizations \nrepresenting women, minorities, farmers and small businesses. Many in \nthese groups do not have access to traditional employer provided \npension. As we tackle the challenges of retirement policy, we need to \nensure that all Americans have adequate financial security to meet \ntheir basic needs during retirement. Personal savings and \nresponsibility are the keys to a balanced national retirement security \npolicy. Please join me in supporting our proposal as a crucial step in \nproviding a secure retirement for all Americans. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3029\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Gordon Smith from Oregon, in introducing legislation \nthat can help seniors enjoy a more secure retirement. The good news is \nthat Americans are living longer but it also means that people have to \nplan for a longer period of retirement. A successful retirement income \nplan is a challenge even for the savvy investor. How much more \ndifficult is this task for the millions of Americans with limited \ninvestment experience?\n  For years Congress has encouraged people to save for their \nretirement. Through the tax code, we encourage asset building through \nhome ownership. We provide significant tax incentives for employer-\nbased pension plans and for dedicated retirement savings programs by \nindividuals, such as IRAs and 401(k) plans.\n  One of the biggest threats to retirement income security for baby \nboomers is their own longevity. It will not be easy to manage their \naccumulated assets so that they will last a lifetime. Unprecedented \nnumbers of Americans are now living into their 90s and even past 100. \nToday, actuaries tell us that\n\n[[Page S11900]]\n\nabout one in six 65-year-old men and one out of three 65-year-old women \ncan expect to live into their 90s.\n  Consequently, people are going to spend more time in retirement than \nprevious generations. Over the course of the 20th century, the \npercentage of men in the workforce aged 65 years or older dropped from \nabout 66 percent to less than 20 percent. Now our society confronts the \nimpending retirement of 77 million baby boomers. Many of them will not \nhave the guaranteed monthly retirement checks that many of their \nparents enjoyed as a result of employer-based pension plans. \nTraditional defined-benefit pension plans have given way to defined \ncontribution plans, which have shifted the retirement income security \nrisk from the employer to the individual.\n  Of course, there are still many Americans who have no access at all \nto employer-provided pension plans. Some have never been in the \ntraditional workforce; others work in seasonal jobs or part time. In my \nstate of North Dakota, as well as in rural and farming communities \nacross America, there is an acute need for retirement vehicles that \nwill provide a secure lifetime payout. Others who could face difficulty \nin securing retirement income are widowed individuals--both men and \nwomen--who suddenly find themselves having to make a life insurance \nbenefit or proceeds from the sale of a business or family home last a \nlifetime.\n  The proposal we are introducing today will provide a valuable tool \nfor helping people avoid the risk of outliving their assets. \nSpecifically, we are proposing a tax incentive to encourage Americans \nto available a portion of their assets annuitize for retirement. If \nthey annuitize--in other words, elect to receive their money from an \nannuity in a series of payments for the rest of their lives, no matter \nhow long that may be--they would be able to exclude from income a \nportion of the annuity benefit that represents the accumulation in the \nannuity above and beyond the original investment. The tax benefit is \ncapped to ensure that tax sheltering activity is not encouraged and \nthat the incentive will be effective for people who would benefit most \nfrom securing a lifetime income stream.\n  This proposal we offer today would apply only to life-contingent, \nnonqualified annuities. A life-contingent annuity that is subsequently \nmodified to a fixed-term payout would be subject to a recapture tax.\n  Baby boomers represent an unprecedented challenge to our retirement \nsecurity policies. They should have a wide range of options available \nfor responsible retirement planning. Our proposal focuses on non-\nqualified annuities because it is important to have this option \nconsidered as part of the larger retirement income security debate that \nCongress should have before baby boomers begin retiring in large \nnumbers. Options for making qualified plans more secure should be part \nof that debate as well.\n  I hope that the 109th Congress will tackle this matter promptly \nbecause time is short. That first wave of baby boomer retirees begins \nin 2008--just over 36 months from today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 3030. A bill to establish an Office of Consumer Advocacy and \nOutreach within the Federal Trade Commission to protect consumers from \ncertain unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a \nbill to create a new government reward hotline designed to solicit tips \nfrom Spanish-speaking immigrants and other groups that are more likely \nto be the silent victims of consumer fraud.\n  The hotline will allow anyone with knowledge of a fraud scheme \ninvolving deceptive advertising to get a reward for reporting it \ndirectly to the experts who work at the Federal Trade Commission.\n  This legislation addresses the unscrupulous businesses that target \ncertain communities because they know the victims are less likely to \nreport crimes. It will further the efforts of the Federal Trade \nCommission to combat this problem by creating an Office of Consumer \nAdvocacy and Outreach within the Federal Trade Commission which will \nadminister programs and services that make it easier for victims in \nthese communities to hold wrong-doers accountable.\n  A Federal Trade Commission survey from earlier this year revealed \nthat nearly 25 million adults in the United States, or 11.2 percent of \nthe adult population, were victims of fraud, and that certain \ncommunities were more likely to fall prey to fraudulent schemes. For \nexample, the survey found that Hispanics are twice as likely to be \nvictims of fraud as non-Hispanic whites. A study conducted by the \nNational Institute of Justice concluded that immigrant victims report \ncrimes less frequently than other victims. The factors cited as \ncontributing to this underreporting included language barriers, \ncultural differences, and a limited understanding of the United States \nJustice system.\n  During this past year the Federal Trade Commission has levied an \nincreasing number of complaints against deceptive Spanish-language \nadvertisements, including fraudulent driving permits and junk \ncomputers. Two of these complaints were filed against businesses in \nSouth Florida that targeted Spanish speakers with advertisements for \n``scientifically unfeasible'' weight-loss pills.\n  The Office of Consumer Advocacy and Outreach created by this bill \nwill provide information to targeted consumers in these communities on \nhow to protect themselves against fraudulent schemes and where to seek \nredress if they become a victim. The Office will work with law \nenforcement to track and investigate fraud schemes that target \nimmigrants, the elderly, minorities and other communities.\n  One of the ways the Office will work to increase reporting of fraud \nby Spanish-speakers, for example, will be to publicize the reward \nprogram through a Spanish-language public service advertising campaign \nproduced by the Federal Trade Commission that warns against consumer \nfraud and provides the number for this newly created anonymous hotline.\n  Additionally, the Office will work with law enforcement to increase \ntheir level of participation in the Consumer Sentinel database system. \nThis database, currently in existence, collects information from local, \nState and Federal agencies on consumer complaints to assist in the \ntracking and investigating of consumer fraud issues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Craig, and Mr. \n        Inhofe): S. 3031. A bill to provide for the reform of \n        intercountry adoption, and for other purposes; to the Committee \n        on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, last month we celebrated National \nAdoption Month. In 2003, Americans opened their hearts and homes to \nover 20,000 orphaned children born overseas. In order to adopt these \nchildren the families had to submit extensive paperwork and work with \nthree federal agencies in order to be approved to adopt a foreign born \nchild and to be able to bring that child home to America. The \nIntercountry Adoption Reform Act that I am introducing today along with \nSenators Landrieu, Craig, and Inhofe streamlines the process families \ngo through to adopt a child from overseas by eliminating unnecessary \npaperwork and consolidating the federal functions into one office.\n  Last November, I introduced the first version of the Intercountry \nAdoption Reform Act, known simply as the ICARE Act, along with Senators \nLandrieu, Craig, Inhofe, Bingaman, and Smith. Over the last year we \nhave received many comments about the bill from groups representing \nadoption professionals as well as comments from the administration. In \nresponse to these comments, we have revised our original bill to \nincorporate many of the suggestions provided to us and to address some \nof the concerns expressed.\n  Two major changes have been made. First, we have added enforcement \nprovisions. We revised the bill to make clear that the new Office of \nIntercountry Adoption (OIA) will have the ability to protect children, \nbirth families and adoptive families from fraud and abuse through \nenforcement provisions. It also clarifies that the OIA can work with \nthe Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to \nenforce the provisions of the Act. Second, we added provisions to \nprovide a smooth transition from the\n\n[[Page S11901]]\n\ncurrent adoption process to the new and improved process. These \nprovisions ensure that all adoption cases filed prior to the opening of \nthe OIA would be processed under the current rules. Any cases filed \nafter the opening of the OIA would be processed under the provisions of \nICARE.\n  There were many other technical and minor changes made to clarify and \nperfect the original language. I believe that these changes have \nsignificantly improved the bill and address many, if not all of the \nconcerns that were raised.\n  Since 1998, I have been working to improve the foreign adoption \nprocess. It was in that year that I introduced the first version of the \nChild Citizenship Act which became law in 2000. This Act provides for \nautomatic U.S. citizenship for foreign born children adopted by \nAmerican citizens. When that bill took effect on February 27, 2001, \nover 150,000 foreign adopted children became U.S. citizens \nautomatically.\n  In the fall of 2001, and the first half of 2002, I helped work on the \ncrisis that ensued when the INS suspended American adoptions from \nCambodia. Four hundred and fifty families who were in the process of \nadopting from Cambodia were left stranded, unable to bring their \nadopted children home to America. Although there was evidence that \nfraudulent players were involved in adoptions in Cambodia and that \nthere is a need for a fraud free, transparent adoption process, the \nsuspension impacted many American families and the Cambodian orphans \nthey hoped to adopt. The children and families stuck in the process \nwhen the suspension was announced needed to be able to complete the \nadoption process they had started prior to the suspension. I worked \nwith the Administration to develop a plan to process those adoptions \nwhere it was determined that no fraud was involved. I worked closely \nwith Senator Landrieu and other members of Congress on both the House \nand Senate side to ensure that these Cambodian orphans could come home \nto their American families.\n  I have also been working since 2002, to develop the ICARE Act. ICARE \nhas two main goals. First, and most importantly, this bill acknowledges \nand affirms that foreign adopted children of American citizens are to \nbe treated in all respects the same as children born abroad to an \nAmerican citizen. Under existing law, foreign adopted children are \ntreated as immigrants to the United States. They have to apply for, and \nbe granted immigrant visas to enter the United States. Once they enter \nthe United States, citizenship is acquired automatically. Had these \nchildren been born abroad to American citizens, they would have \ntraveled back to the United States with a U.S. passport and entered as \ncitizens. This bill provides for equal treatment for foreign adopted \nchildren.\n  The second goal is to consolidate the existing functions of the \nfederal government relating to foreign adoption into one centralized \noffice. The office would be located within the Department of State. \nCurrently, these functions are performed by offices within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of State. \nConsolidation of these functions into one office will result in focused \nattention on the needs of families seeking to adopt overseas and on the \nchildren they are hoping to make part of their families.\n  Although I have not been able to see this bill through to completion \nduring my tenure in the Senate, it is my hope and desire that my \ncolleagues who have cosponsored this bill with me will continue to \npress forward until the goals of this bill are accomplished.\n  I introduce this revised version of the ICARE Act and hope that it \nwill be reintroduced and acted upon in the next Congress. Passage of \nthis bill will significantly improve the foreign adoption process so \nthat more children worldwide can find loving, permanent homes. It is my \nprayer that someday, adoption will not be needed. That all children \nwill be born into stable, loving homes to parents who want them and are \nable to care for them. However, until that day comes, the foreign \nadoption process can be improved and should be improved. Foreign \nadopted children of American citizens should be treated as children of \nU.S. citizens, not as immigrants, and should be accorded all the same \nrights as biological children of U.S. citizens. To that end, I \nintroduce this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3031\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Intercountry Adoption Reform \n     Act of 2004'' or the ``ICARE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) That a child, for the full and harmonious development \n     of his or her personality, should grow up in a family \n     environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love, and \n     understanding.\n       (2) That intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a \n     permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot \n     be found in his or her country of origin.\n       (3) There has been a significant growth in intercountry \n     adoptions. In 1990, Americans adopted 7,093 children from \n     abroad. In 2001, they adopted 19,237 children from abroad.\n       (4) Americans increasingly seek to create or enlarge their \n     families through intercountry adoptions.\n       (5) There are many children worldwide that are without \n     permanent homes.\n       (6) In the interest of children without a permanent family \n     and the United States citizens who are waiting to bring them \n     into their families, reforms are needed in the intercountry \n     adoption process used by United States citizens.\n       (7) Before adoption, each child should have the benefit of \n     measures taken to ensure that intercountry adoption is in his \n     or her best interests and prevents the abduction, selling, or \n     trafficking of children.\n       (8) In addition, Congress recognizes that foreign born \n     adopted children do not make the decision whether to \n     immigrate to the United States. They are being chosen by \n     Americans to become part of their immediate families.\n       (9) As such these children should not be classified as \n     immigrants in the traditional sense. Once fully and finally \n     adopted, they should be treated as children of United States \n     citizens.\n       (10) Since a child who is fully and finally adopted is \n     entitled to the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as \n     a biological child, the law should reflect such equality.\n       (11) Therefore, foreign born adopted children of United \n     States citizens should be accorded the same procedural \n     treatment as biological children born abroad to a United \n     States citizen.\n       (12) If a United States citizen can confer citizenship to a \n     biological child born abroad, then the same citizen is \n     entitled to confer such citizenship to their legally and \n     fully adopted foreign born child immediately upon final \n     adoption.\n       (13) If a United States citizen cannot confer citizenship \n     to a biological child born abroad, then such citizen cannot \n     confer citizenship to their legally and fully adopted foreign \n     born child, except through the naturalization process.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the \n     best interests of the child;\n       (2) to ensure that foreign born children adopted by United \n     States citizens will be treated identically to a biological \n     child born abroad to the same citizen parent; and\n       (3) to improve the intercountry adoption process by making \n     it more citizen friendly and focused on the protection of the \n     child.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 483\n\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State and \n     international human rights organizations, the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China continues to commit widespread \n     and well-documented human rights abuses in Tibet;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China has yet to \n     demonstrate its willingness to abide by internationally \n     accepted standards of freedom of belief, expression, and \n     association by repealing or amending laws and decrees that \n     restrict those freedoms;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has detained hundreds of Tibetan nuns, monks, and lay persons \n     as political prisoners for speaking out against China's \n     occupation of Tibet and for their efforts to preserve Tibet's \n     distinct national identity;\n       Whereas Phuntsog Nyidron was arrested on October 14, 1989, \n     together with 5 other nuns, for participating in a peaceful \n     protest against China's occupation of Tibet;\n       Whereas, on February 26, 2004, following a sustained \n     international campaign on her behalf, the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China released Phuntsog Nyidron from \n     detention after she served more than 14 years of her 16-year \n     sentence;\n       Whereas Tenzin Delek, a prominent Tibetan religious leader, \n     and 3 other monks were arrested on April 7, 2002, during a \n     nighttime raid on Jamyang Choekhorling monastery in Nyagchu \n     County, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture;\n       Whereas, following a closed trial and more than 8 months of \n     incommunicado detention, Tenzin Delek and another Tibetan, \n     Lobsang Dhondup, were convicted of inciting separatism and \n     for their alleged involvement in a series of bombings on \n     December 2, 2002;\n       Whereas Lobsang Dhondup was sentenced to death and Tenzin \n     Delek was sentenced to death with a 2-year suspension;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     told senior officials of the United States and other \n     governments that the cases of Lobsang Dhondup and Tenzin \n     Delek would be subjected to a ``lengthy review'' by the \n     Supreme People's Court prior to the death sentences being \n     carried out;\n       Whereas the Supreme People's Court never carried out this \n     review, and Lobsang Dhondup was executed on January 26, 2003;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has failed to produce any evidence that either Lobsang \n     Dhondup or Tenzin Delek were involved in the crimes for which \n     they were convicted, despite repeated requests from officials \n     of the United States and other governments;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to imprison Tibetans for engaging in peaceful \n     efforts to protest China's repression of Tibetans and \n     preserve the Tibetan identity;\n       Whereas Tibetan political prisoners are routinely subjected \n     to beatings, electric shock, solitary confinement, and other \n     forms of torture and inhumane treatment while in Chinese \n     custody;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to exert control over religious and cultural \n     institutions in Tibet, abusing human rights through the \n     torture, arbitrary arrest, and detention without fair or \n     public trial of Tibetans who peacefully express their \n     political or religious views or attempt to preserve the \n     unique Tibetan identity; and\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has paroled individual political prisoners for good behavior \n     or for medical reasons in the face of strong international \n     pressure, but has failed to make the systemic changes \n     necessary to provide minimum standards of due process or \n     protections for basic civil and political rights: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China is in \n     violation of international human rights standards by \n     detaining and mistreating Tibetans who engage in peaceful \n     activities to protest China's repression of Tibetans or \n     promote the preservation of a distinct Tibetan identity;\n       (2) sustained international pressure on the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China is essential to improve the \n     human rights situation in Tibet and secure the release of \n     Tibetan political prisoners;\n       (3) the Government of the United States should--\n       (A) raise the cases of Tenzin Delek and other political \n     prisoners at every opportunity with officials from the \n     People's Republic of China; and\n       (B) work with other governments concerned about human \n     rights in China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region and \n     other Tibetan areas, to encourage the release of political \n     prisoners and promote systemic improvement of human rights in \n     China; and\n       (4) the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     should, as a gesture of goodwill and in order to promote \n     human rights, immediately release all political prisoners, \n     including Tenzin Delek.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 484--TO HONOR AND THANK ROBERT RAY HOWE\n\n  Mr. FRIST submitted the following resolution;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Castillo de San Marcos \n     National Monument Boundary Adjustment Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 912. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The early defense lines for Fort Marion, Florida, today \n     known as the Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, \n     included defenses extending in a line due west to the \n     Sebastian River, a distance of about one half mile.\n       (2) In the 1830's, during the Seminole Wars in Florida, \n     these defensive lines were maintained, but as Florida became \n     more settled they fell into disrepair and/or became obsolete.\n       (3) In 1908 the War Department deeded much of the property \n     running west to the Sebastian River to the St. Johns County \n     Board of Public Instruction. The portion of this property \n     remaining in federal ownership today is occupied by Orange \n     Street, a City of St. Augustine, Florida street.\n       (4) For nearly a century, the City of St. Augustine has \n     maintained and managed Orange Street, a modern city street, \n     and associated utilities in the Orange Street corridor.\n       (5) Any archeological remains that are still present on the \n     property overlaid by Orange Street are adequately protected \n     by the City's archeological ordinances, and by the City \n     having an archeologist on staff.\n       (6) Although the city currently operates Orange Street \n     under a right-of-way from the National Park Service, from a \n     management perspective it is appropriate for the City of St. \n     Augustine to own Orange Street.\n\n     SEC. 913. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT.\n\n       (a) Conveyance of Land.--The Secretary of the Interior \n     shall convey, without consideration, to the City of St. \n     Augustine, Florida, all right, title, and interest of the \n     United States in and to the lands known as Orange Street, a \n     portion of the Castillo de San Marcos National Monument \n     (Monument), consisting of approximately 3.1 acres, as shown \n     on the map entitled Castillo de San Marcos National Monument \n     Boundary Adjustment and Correction, numbered 343/80060, and \n     dated April 2003. Upon completion of the conveyance, the \n     Secretary shall revise the boundary of the Monument to \n     exclude the land conveyed.\n       (b) Boundary Revision.--Effective on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the boundary of the Monument is \n     revised to include an area of approximately 0.45 acres, as \n     shown on the map identified in subsection (a). The Secretary \n     shall administer the lands included in the boundary as part \n     of the national monument in accordance with applicable laws \n     and regulations.\n\n     TITLE X--NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL WILD HERITAGE WILDERNESS\n\n     SEC. 1001.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Western Reserve Heritage \n     Areas Study Act''.\n\n[[Page S11926]]\n\n     SEC. 1602. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE STUDY REGARDING THE WESTERN \n                   RESERVE, OHIO.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The area that encompasses the modern-day counties of \n     Trumbull, Mahoning, Ashtabula, Portage, Geagua, Lake, \n     Cuyahoga, Summit, Medina, Huron, Lorain, Erie, Ottawa, and \n     Ashland in Ohio with the rich history in what was once the \n     Western Reserve, has made a unique contribution to the \n     cultural, political and industrial development of the United \n     States.\n       (2) The Western Reserve is distinctive as the land settled \n     by the people of Connecticut after the Revolutionary War. The \n     Western Reserve holds a unique mark as the original \n     wilderness land of the West that many settlers migrated to in \n     order to begin life outside of the original 13 colonies.\n       (3) The Western Reserve played a significant role in \n     providing land to the people of Connecticut whose property \n     and land was destroyed during the Revolution. These settlers \n     were descendants of the brave immigrants who came to the \n     Americas in the 17th century.\n       (4) The Western Reserve offered a new destination for those \n     who moved west in search of land and prosperity.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This title may be cited as the ``Bleeding Kansas National \n     Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area is a \n     cohesive assemblage of natural, historic, cultural, and \n     recreational resources that--\n       (A) together represent distinctive aspects of American \n     heritage worthy of recognition, conservation, interpretation, \n     and continuing use;\n       (B) are best managed through partnerships between private \n     and public entities; and\n       (C) will build upon the Kansas rural development policy and \n     the new homestead act to recognize inherent strengths of \n     small towns and rural communities--close-knit communities, \n     strong local business networks, and a tradition of \n     entrepreneurial creativity.\n       (2) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area reflects \n     traditions, customs, beliefs, folk life, or some combination \n     thereof, that are a valuable part of the heritage of the \n     United States.\n       (3) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area provides \n     outstanding opportunities to conserve natural, cultural, or \n     historic features, or some combination thereof.\n       (4) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area provides \n     outstanding recreational and interpretive opportunities.\n       (5) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area has an \n     identifiable theme, and resources important to the theme \n     retain integrity capable of supporting interpretation.\n       (6) Residents, nonprofit organizations, other private \n     entities, and units of local government throughout the \n     Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area demonstrate support \n     for designation of the Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area \n     as a national heritage area and for management of the \n     Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area as appropriate for \n     such designation.\n       (7) Capturing these interconnected stories through \n     partnerships with National Park Service sites, Kansas State \n     Historical Society sites, local organizations, and citizens \n     will augment the story opportunities within the prospective \n     boundary for the educational and recreational benefit of this \n     and future generations of Americans.\n       (8) Communities throughout this region know the value of \n     their Bleeding Kansas legacy, but require expansion of the \n     existing cooperative framework to achieve key preservation, \n     education, and other significant goals by working more \n     closely together.\n       (9) The State of Kansas officially recognized the national \n     significance of the Bleeding Kansas story when it designated \n     the heritage area development as a significant strategic goal \n     within the statewide economic development plan.\n       (10) Territorial Kansas Heritage Alliance is a nonprofit \n     corporation created for the purposes of preserving, \n     interpreting, developing, promoting and, making available to \n     the public the story and resources related to the story of \n     Bleeding Kansas and the Enduring Struggle for Freedom.\n\n[[Page S11932]]\n\n       (11) Territorial Kansas Heritage Alliance has completed a \n     study that--\n       (A) describes in detail the role, operation, financing, and \n     functions of Territorial Kansas Heritage Alliance, the \n     management entity;

Board of Education, Nicodemus and Tallgrass Prairie \n     sites through the interpretation and conservation of the \n     associated living landscapes outside of the boundaries of \n     these units of the National Park System.\n       (3) To describe the extent of Federal responsibilities and \n     duties in regard to the Heritage Area.\n       (4) To further collaboration and partnerships among \n     Federal, State, and local governments, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the private sector, or combinations \n     thereof, to conserve and manage the resources and \n     opportunities in the Heritage Area through grants, technical \n     assistance, training and other means.\n       (5) To authorize Federal financial and technical assistance \n     to management entity to assist in the conservation and \n     interpretation of the Heritage Area.\n       (6) To empower communities and organizations in Kansas to \n     preserve the special historic identity of Bleeding Kansas and \n     with it the identity of the Nation.\n       (7) To provide for the management, preservation, \n     protection, and interpretation of the natural, historical, \n     and cultural resources within the region for the educational \n     and inspirational benefit of current and future generations.\n       (8) To provide greater community capacity through inter-\n     local cooperation.\n       (9) To provide a vehicle, particularly in the four counties \n     with high out-migration of population, to recognize that \n     self-reliance and resilience will be the keys to their \n     economic future.\n       (10) To build upon the Kansas rural development policy, the \n     Kansas agritourism initiative and the new homestead act to \n     recognize inherent strengths of small towns and rural \n     communities--close-knit communities, strong local business \n     networks, and a tradition of entrepreneurial creativity.\n       (11) To educate and cultivate among its citizens, \n     particularly its youth, the stories and cultural resources of \n     the region's legacy that--\n       (A) reflect the popular phrase ``Bleeding Kansas'' \n     describing the conflict over slavery that became nationally \n     prominent in Kansas just before and during the American Civil \n     War;\n       (B) reflect the commitment of American settlers who first \n     fought and killed to uphold their different and \n     irreconcilable principles of freedom and equality during the \n     years of the Kansas Conflict;\n       (C) reflect the struggle for freedom, experienced during \n     the ``Bleeding Kansas'' era, that continues to be a vital and \n     pressing issue associated with the real problem of democratic \n     nation building; and\n       (D) recreate the physical environment revealing its impact \n     on agriculture, transportation, trade and business, and \n     social and cultural patterns in urban and rural settings.\n       (12) To interpret the effect of the era's democratic ethos \n     on the development of America's distinctive political \n     culture.\n\n     SEC. 2203.
