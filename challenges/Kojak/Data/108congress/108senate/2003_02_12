The Senate will resume consideration of the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada to be a circuit judge for the DC Circuit. We have spent \n4 days and over 20 hours debating this eminently qualified nominee. \nYesterday 14 Senators participated in the debate. To afford Senators \nample time to fulfill their constitutional advise and consent \nresponsibilities and to facilitate unfettered consideration of this \nnomination, I expect tonight to be a very late night. Senators are \nencouraged to come to the floor over the course of today to engage in \nthis debate.\n  The Democratic leader and I have discussed options to conclude the \nSenate's constitutional responsibilities as they pertain to this \nnominee. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to \nobject to any time agreement and refuse to set a time for a dispositive \nvote. My objective is to provide all Senators with sufficient \nopportunity to debate the merits of this nominee and then to move this \nnomination to a final vote.\n  Therefore, once again, I encourage Senators to come to the floor \ntoday and this evening and, if necessary, tomorrow and tomorrow \nevening, to express their views so a final vote can be scheduled. I do \nhope the Democratic leader will assist me in achieving this goal.\n  In addition, the Senate continues to wait for the completion of the \nvery important conference report on the omnibus appropriations bill. \nThose discussions have gone on over the course of the last several \ndays, well into last night and over the course of this morning. This \nomnibus appropriations bill--I believe I speak for both sides of the \naisle--is a must-pass item to be addressed and ultimately passed prior \nto any recess.\n\n  Mr. REID. While the majority leader is on the floor, Mr. President, \nwe on this side are prepared to stay as long, of course, as the leader \nasks us to do so. But because we will have to have people here to make \nsure there are people on the floor to discuss whatever they feel they \nwant to discuss during this nomination process, do you have an idea how \nlate you might want us to stay tonight?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to provide ample opportunity. We \nhave been on this nomination since last Wednesday. I would expect we \nwill be here very late into the evening; I don't know what time. But if \nwe are to achieve having a recess at all, I do want to be able to fully \naddress the issue of the omnibus appropriations and the Estrada \nnomination. I would think it is going to be very late tonight, but I \ncan't give an exact time.\n  Mr. REID. As I said last night, as Senator Hatch and I were closing \nthe Senate, everything has been said, but not quite everyone has said \nit, on the nomination of Miguel Estrada. Both sides have talked about \nwhat they like and dislike about this nomination. Yesterday, of course, \nthere were a lot of repetitive statements.\n  We will be here. I think it is quite clear that we won't be speaking \nmuch about Miguel Estrada as the day proceeds. We will want to talk \nabout\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\nChairman Greenspan's statements and other issues we think are just as \nimportant to talk about. But during these nominations, when there is \nextended debate, we are allowed to do that. Whatever the leader wants \nus to do, we are here. Whether it is tonight, tomorrow night, Friday, \nSaturday, whatever it is, we will be at your disposal.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the assistant \nDemocratic leader. My objective is to fully address the nomination of \nthis outstanding, well-qualified candidate. If we really get to the \npoint where the other side of the aisle says there is nothing more to \nbe said, I would simply ask that we do take this to a vote and give us \nin this body the opportunity to vote, yes, we are for the nomination \nor, no, we are against the nomination, if we really have had full \ndebate, and from what I have just heard we are getting close to that \npoint, and if everything has been said.\n  But the one thing I don't want to happen is for people to be \ncritical: We didn't have enough time; we didn't have enough opportunity \nto debate.\n  Our willingness to at least present why we believe Miguel Estrada is \nextremely well qualified is close to being fulfilled. And if we get to \nthe point where there is nothing more to say on the other side of the \naisle, then we would expect, if that is the case, an up-or-down vote. I \nthink that signal is being sent strongly through our colleagues and \nwhat has happened on the floor this week.\n  I think America is paying attention, recognizing that at this \njuncture, we believe Miguel Estrada is well qualified and that there is \na critical, drastic shortage of Federal judges today. When you put \nthose two together--that we feel strongly Miguel Estrada is a well-\nqualified judge and that there is a drastic shortage of judges and our \nresponsibility to address that issue, which we are doing well on the \nfloor now--we would expect that up-or-down vote in the next couple of \ndays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I compliment the leader. In the short time \nhe has been leader, he has allowed full and adequate debate. He could \nhave tried to stop debate on the omnibus bill, and the leader chose not \nto do that, and I think it worked to everyone's advantage. On this side \nof the aisle, we appreciate that very much.\n  I do say, though, speaking as one Senator, but having spent a little \ntime on this floor, just about everything has been said about Miguel \nEstrada. There will be other people who wish to make statements. As I \nsaid, everything has been said but not everyone has said it. We will do \neverything we can to make sure everyone has said it. The majority \nleader is going to find there will be other issues spoken about here. \nWe are not going to--there is no reason to mince around. We are not \ngoing to allow an up-or-down vote on Miguel Estrada. That is clear.\n  Our leader gave a speech yesterday to that effect. So the majority \nleader has to make a decision whether this nomination is going to be \npulled, whether the memos will be supplied to us so we can review them, \nwhether there is going to be more opportunity to ask questions, or \nwhether there is going to be a vote on cloture. Those are the three \nchoices the leader has.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I agree, in essence, those are the three \nchoices, and as majority leader, I consider what I feel is stalling on \nthis nomination and not allowing an up-or-down vote of sufficient \nimportance that we will continue to address it. There are many other \nimportant issues this Senate must address. If we could just agree on an \nup-or-down vote right now, which the distinguished assistant Democratic \nleader has said they are not going to do on the other side of the \naisle, we could go on to address these other important issues.\n  I do want to make it clear, both to this body, to the House of \nRepresentatives, and to America, this side of the aisle is ready for an \nup-or-down vote since, as we just agreed, there has probably already \nbeen adequate debate put forward, and I think it is important for \nAmerica to understand your side of the aisle--whether you use the word \n``filibuster'' or not--is obstructing or stalling the process which is \nimportant to our judicial system and to our responsibilities, our \nconstitutional responsibilities in this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/12/senate-section/article/S2232-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session to resume consideration of Executive Calendar \nNo. 21, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I see the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee on the floor. Under normal \nprocedures, he would speak first. I appreciate his courtesy in \nwithholding for a moment.\n  A lot has been said, and as the distinguished senior Senator from \nNevada said, not all have said it. There is actually one person who, \nwere he to speak, could speed this whole matter up very quickly. Miguel \nEstrada has written extensively on his views on very complex issues on \nlaw which would be of great interest to those who have to vote on \nsomebody for a lifetime position in the courts. He has written \nextensively, but he has kept the writing secret.\n  We have ample precedent for similar writings that have been made \navailable for everything from a nomination of a man who became Attorney \nGeneral to a man who became the Chief Justice of the United States, \nWilliam Rehnquist. The Democratic leader and I wrote to the President \nand asked once again: Release those secret writings.\n  Ironically, Mr. Estrada told us, when asked, he had no objection to \nthose writings being released. He has no objection to them being \nreleased. It is only the White House has said: We will not release \nthem. If they were released, I suspect we would then have a discussion \nof what is in those writings, and we would go to a vote up or down, win \nor lose.\n  At least we would know what we are voting on. We would not have a \nstealth candidate before the Senate. I think the White House ought to \nlook at the fact Mr. Estrada has said he has no objection to his \nwritings being made public. They ought to make them public, and then we \ncan go ahead and complete action up or down on this nominee.\n  Again, I thank my good friend from Utah for his courtesy in letting \nme go forward. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is interesting that my colleague, who is \nmy friend, says Miguel Estrada is holding this process up, and then at \nthe end of his remarks says he has agreed, he has no objections to \ngiving these documents, but they never emphasize the fact the Justice \nDepartment is highly justified, is absolutely right, and has the \nopinion of the seven former Solicitors General saying these types of \nconfidential memoranda should not be given to the Judiciary Committee \nor to Congress. The reason for this is that these memoranda are \nutilized in deciding what the Solicitor General's Office should do with \nregard to various cases.\n  If these memoranda become readily available or available at all \noutside the Justice Department, this would chill the honest, forthright \ndeliberations, suggestions, and recommendations by those who work in \nthe Justice Department. I do not think it takes any brains to realize \nthe Justice Department is totally right.\n  Miguel Estrada is being blamed because the Justice Department, in \naccordance with their seven former Solicitors General, refuses to give \nup these confidential memoranda, which are privileged, so the Democrats \ncan go on a fishing expedition and see if they can find some matters in \nthose memoranda with which they disagree. They can then say: We cannot \nconfirm him because he wrote some memoranda with which we disagree.\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\n  That is what is behind this. This is not trying to be fair. This is \nnot trying to understand what is good or bad about Mr. Estrada. It is a \nfishing expedition to try to get into privileged documents that should \nremain privileged, according to these seven former Solicitors General \nof the United States, four of whom are Democrats and partisan Democrats \nat that, although highly respected by me. And the other side seems to \nact like we should just brush those opinions aside, even though they \nare bipartisan opinions by people who have held this office. I do not \nthink they can have it both ways. I do not think their arguments are \nworth a grain of salt.\n  In addition, I listened intently yesterday morning, when I could, to \nthe comments by the junior Senator from New York who spoke about the \nrole of the Senate in the constitutional advice and consent process. \nAccording to the Senator, Mr. Estrada's failure to answer questions \nabout his personal views on legal issues, which she called ``basic \ninformation about where a nominee stands,'' amounts to an \nunconstitutional strategy to deny the Senate an opportunity to engage \nin its role to advise and consent on nominations.\n  While this is an interesting argument, it is wrong on the law. It is \nwrong on the law and wrong on the facts, too. Her argument ignores the \nbasic underpinnings of the Senate's role in the advice and consent \nprocess. In fact, I submit that the other side's effort to demand Mr. \nEstrada's personal views on certain legal issues is itself an \nunconstitutional threat to the separation of powers inherent in our \nsystem of Government and to the Framers' desire to maintain an \nindependent judiciary. I think that is a very persuasive argument on my \nbehalf.\n  It has never been the case that the Senate is constitutionally \nentitled to an answer to any question it chooses to ask a nominee while \nexercising its advice and consent responsibility.\n  The reason for this is clear. The Framers sought to ensure the \njudicial branch would remain independent of the legislative branch. \nAccording to the Federalist Papers 78, judicial independence ``is an \nexcellent barrier to the despotism of the prince'' and ``in a republic \nit is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions \nof the representative body.''\n  For this reason, the Constitution prohibits Congress from reducing \nFederal judges' salaries, guarantees that judges will remain on the \nbench ``during good behaviour'' and allows Congress to remove them only \nby the process of impeachment. These protections were borne of the \nFramers' fear that like King George III, the Federal legislature would \npressure judges into reaching outcomes of which it approved that \notherwise were consistent with its interests.\n  The Framers' intent to insulate Federal judges from the political \ninfluence of the legislative branch also informed their decision to \nrestrict the role of the Senate in the confirmation process. The \nSenate's limited function is apparent from the Constitution's very \ntext. To state the obvious, the President holds the power to nominate \ncandidates to the Federal bench while the Senate's role is restricted \nto providing ``advice and consent.''\n  Now, that does not mean advice and filibuster. It does not mean \nadvice and obstruction. It does not mean advice and a demand that only \nthe Senate's will can be followed. It does not mean advice and fishing \nexpeditions, which is exactly what is going on.\n  I do not think my colleagues on the other side have a leg to stand on \nin these arguments they have been making. Even if they did, they had \nevery opportunity to examine Mr. Estrada. This argument that he did not \nanswer the questions is ridiculous. They had every opportunity to ask \nhim every question they wanted to, and even stupid questions they could \nask. Any member of the Judiciary Committee could ask anything they \nwanted to, and sometimes we have some of the dumbest questions anybody \ncould possibly hear, but they have a right to ask these dumb questions. \nBut the nominee has a right to say: I do not think I can answer that \nbecause that issue may come before me as a judge, and if it does, I do \nnot want to have to recuse myself. Virtually everybody who has ever \nbeen nominated, who has been in any controversy, has said exactly that. \nTop authorities from both sides of the political spectrum agree they \nshould not answer that, and the American Bar Association's ethical rule \nsays they should not. Yet, Mr. Estrada is being crucified because he \ndid not tell them everything they wanted to hear.\n  The real problem was, and I think is, that Mr. Estrada just did not \nsay anything they could use against him. It is very disconcerting to my \ncolleagues on the other side that they didn't find anything to use \nagainst Mr. Estrada. So they use ridiculous, idiotic arguments like he \nhas no judicial experience. I saw the press release by Congressman \nMenendez who has led this terrible fight against Mr. Estrada, with his \nvery partisan Democrat colleagues in the House, all of whom are \nrebutted by the Republican Hispanics in the House.\n  He basically said, well, he has no judicial experience. Well, that is \nnot only ridiculous, it is idiotic. One of them made the case one does \nnot have to have judicial experience to be a great judge, and that \nPresident Clinton nominated innumerable people to be judges, that we \napproved, who had no judicial experience. Some of the greatest judges \nin the history of this country did not have any judicial experience, \nand yet that argument is used.\n\n  It is a terrible argument. I think it is a prejudicial argument \nagainst Hispanics, because how many Hispanic judges are there in this \ncountry who might be put on the circuit court of appeals? Very few. \nThat means all these great Hispanic lawyers who belong to the Hispanic \nBar Association do not have a chance to be a judge under that reasoning \nbecause they have not sat as a judge anywhere before. Talk about \ndiscrimination. Talk about ridiculous arguments. Talk about prejudice.\n  It is a shame it comes from one of the Hispanic leaders in the \nHouse--Democrat Hispanic leaders, I might add. I cannot imagine anybody \nwho really wants to see Hispanics progress and to become judges saying \nhe has no judicial experience, therefore, he cannot be a judge. Give me \na break.\n  Very few Hispanics have judicial experience, but there are a number \nof them who I hope President Bush and succeeding Presidents will give \nthe opportunity of being a judge.\n  Now that just shows the lengths to which the other side has gone to \nbasically scuttle this nomination, and this constitutional argument we \nhad yesterday fits in that category. The Constitution assigns the \nSenate a limited role in the selection of judicial nominees. It simply \nallows the Senate to ratify the President's choices, or decline to do \nso. That is the Senate's power.\n  Put simply, the President selects, then the Senate reviews and \nreacts. As Alexander Hamilton explained in The Federalist No. 66:\n\n       There will, of course, be no exertion of choice on the part \n     of the senate. They may defeat one choice of the Executive, \n     and oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves \n     choose--they can only ratify or reject the choice he may have \n     made.\n\n  I think some of our colleagues on the other side want to choose these \njudges, and we are finding that continuously in their arguments, that \nthe administration does not ``consult'' with them. If consultation \nmeans the administration has to take whatever judges the Democrats \ndesire, then that is not consultation. Consultation is letting them \nknow what is on the mind of the President, and the administration \ndiscussing it with them, seeing if they have any real objections to the \nchoices of the President, asking them to weigh in and give the \nadministration whatever information they can, and then making the \nchoice and going from there. That is consultation.\n  The administration even goes further. The administration has had to \nput up with the blue slip system, which means local Senators have a lot \nof power in determining who are going to be the Federal district court \njudges. They do not have the same type of power in who should be \nFederal circuit court of appeals judges. That power has always been \njealously guarded by whichever White House.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to make sure, the Senator is saying we are going \nto stay with the blue slip approach then for judges in the future?\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I doubt we are, because I have said I will follow the \nexact blue slip policy Senator Kennedy, Senator Biden, and I followed. \nSo all this bull in the press saying that I am going to change the blue \nslip laws, yes, I am changing it from what Senator Leahy did, but I am \ngoing back to the process of Kennedy, Biden, and Hatch.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So if the Senators from a State were----\n  Mr. HATCH. I have said it enough I would hope the Senator heard it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. To make sure it is clear for the record, if Senators from \na State where a judge is being appointed do not approve of that judge, \nthen you are not going to have a hearing; the Senator has to have two \nblue slips from two Senators from the State?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is absolutely false. Senator Kennedy set the process \nto begin with. When he became chairman of the committee, he said \nnegative blue slips shall be given great weight, but they are not \ndispositive.\n  If both Senators are against the nominee, that is given great weight \nby me. It was by Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator Leahy's approach of both Senators having a voice \nas to whether the nominee goes forward, the Senator is not going to \nabide by that blue slip process in the future?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have changed the Leahy approach because it was in \ncontradiction to the Kennedy, Biden, and Hatch approach, who followed \nKennedy and Biden and did it to the letter.\n  It is very difficult, when two Senators go against a nominee, for \nthat nominee to make it, but it is, as Senator Kennedy said, not \ndispositive. That has been the rule, as long as I can remember, until \nSenator Leahy changed it. I think even Senator Leahy basically \nacknowledged that rule.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Utah, the rule that has been \nfollowed since I have served in the committee under your leadership, as \nwell as under Senator Leahy, said both Senators would have a voice in \nthe blue slip process.\n  Mr. HATCH. And both do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The fact the Senator is changing it suggests to me, \nagain, he is removing the power of the committee and of the Senate to \nlook at judicial nominees.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not one bit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is what the debate is all about.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not one bit. In fact, I reiterate to my friend again, I \ndid not set this policy. It was set by Senator Kennedy. I remember when \nhe set it way back then, there was a lot of people upset about it on \nour side, but it became the policy of the committee. Then when Senator \nBiden became chairman of the committee, he agreed with that policy. He \nadopted that policy. Then when I became chairman of the committee for \nthe first time, I agreed with that policy and I followed that policy. \nAll I am saying is I am going to follow the policy set by Democrats.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Utah is rejecting Senator Leahy's \npolicy?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not rejecting it. I am just saying we are going back \nto the original policy set by Senator Kennedy, Senator Biden, and \nmyself.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is a very positive spin, but I think the answer is \nthe Senator is rejecting Senator Leahy's approach.\n  Mr. HATCH. We will not use the Leahy approach, that is true, because \nI think it is wrong. And I think Senator Kennedy and Senator Biden \nthought it was wrong, as well, by their actions.\n  I find it a little strange that Democrats are criticizing a policy \nthey themselves set and trying to say I have changed the policy when in \nfact it was set by Democrats--and leading Democrats at that.\n  The fact that Senator Leahy changed it does not mean it was right for \nhim to overrule Senators Kennedy and Biden and myself. I believed he \nwas wrong.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator one last question, does the Senator, as \nchairman----\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me ask this: Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. Did the Senator from Utah, as chairman of the \ncommittee, ever have a hearing for a nominee who did not receive both \nblue slips from Senators in the State?\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't recall.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the answer is no.\n  Mr. HATCH. As the general rule, it stopped the nominee--as a general \nrule, but it is not dispositive.\n  (Ms. MURKOWSKI assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. So we will change not only the Leahy approach but the \nHatch approach?\n  Mr. HATCH. No, I still have the same approach. I gave great weight to \nthe Senators, and I intend to in the future. But that does not mean \nthat a legitimate nominee should not have his or her day in court.\n  Mr. DURBIN. One last question: Does the Senator, as chairman of the \ncommittee, now send out blue slips to Members so they can respond?\n  Mr. HATCH. We do. That is a policy of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. They have been sent out?\n  Mr. HATCH. As far as I know. If they have not, they should be. We \nknow some have been returned and some have not been returned.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. HATCH. Now, let me just say this. I was speaking a few minutes \nago about the Federalist Papers and what they had to say.\n  As I said before, and has been repeatedly quoted, as though I said \nsomething I am not following to this day, I agree that the Senate \nshould not be a rubberstamp to a President's choices for the judiciary. \nWe do not have to be a rubberstamp.\n  We have an obligation to look at these people and to see what is \nwrong. Tell me what is wrong with Miguel Estrada. Tell me one glove \nthey have laid upon him. Tell me one proof they have that he is not \nworthy of being on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia--other than the specious, spurious argument: Well, we do not \nknow enough about him.\n  They conducted a hearing. They controlled the process. They asked \nquestions. That hearing transcript is this thick. Normally the \ntranscript is 10 pages. They controlled everything. They could have \nasked written questions. Only two of them did--two Democrats did. And \nhe answered them.\n  Now they are coming in here crying over their failure to ask any \nfurther questions, saying: We must examine him more.\n  I am hearing that on every judge this President has nominated. We \nhave 26 emergency situations in this country--in other words, 26 real \nproblems in this country--and other vacancies that are also problems, \nand I am getting these spurious arguments.\n\n  We have a markup tomorrow. We have 3 circuit court nominees, and we \nhad a hearing for 12 solid hours. I was willing to stay even longer. I \nwould have stayed all night, if necessary, to get that hearing over \nwith. It was the Democrats who decided it was over. They had every \nchance to ask questions. I am hearing they will filibuster these three \nnominees in the Judiciary Committee tomorrow.\n  When is it going to stop? When are they going to start doing what is \nright? Will this all be partisan just because they did not win the \nPresidency? Is President Bush going to be treated this way on every \njudgeship? They say these are controversial judges. I have not seen one \ncircuit court of appeals nominee since I have been chairman of this \ncommittee who they do not think is controversial. Every one is \ncontroversial. The reason is they are circuit court of appeals \nnominees, and this President has nominated them, and they presume they \nmust be Republicans and conservative. The only nominees about whom I \ndid not hear any argument were the Democrats this President has \nnominated, holding out his hand to them, saying, let's work together. \nHe has nominated Democrats we have been able to get through, and with \nmy approval.\n  Now that we have some Republicans such as Miguel Estrada, who may be \nconservative, the President is not getting a fair shake. They are not \neven trying to give him a fair shake. I don't think my friends on the \nother side have to rubberstamp anybody, but they ought to be fair. They \nought to be fair to this President. He is the President of the United \nStates. He has a right to nominate these people. Unless they can show \nsome legitimate reason for not confirming these people, then these \npeople should be confirmed.\n  Where is the legitimate reason against Miguel Estrada? I don't see \nany. I have not heard one legitimate\n\n[[Page S2235]]\n\nreason the whole time we have debated this for the last week--not one, \nnot one--other than we should be able to continue a fishing expedition \nlong after they held a very extensive hearing on this person, long \nafter they had the opportunity of sending him written interrogatories \nor questions. And only two of them did. Now they are in here crying as \nif they have been somehow mistreated in this process. They controlled \nthe process.\n  As has been the case history, the Senate is entitled to detailed \ninformation about a nominee's background, career, and qualifications \nfor the bench. Mr. Estrada has provided ample information to allow the \nSenate to determine his qualifications.\n  First, it bears repeating that the American Bar Association, their \ngold standard, when we were having problems whether the Bar Association \nwas fairly examining judges--and there were some real questions on our \nside because of some ridiculous, I think, ratings they had given in the \npast--the Democrats said: We must have the ABA ratings. We will not \nallow candidates to go through, nominees to go through, without the \nratings. It is our gold standard.\n  I think it bears repeating that the American Bar Association \nunanimously--the standing committee that really examines these judges \nand takes it seriously--unanimously rated Mr. Estrada well qualified \nfor this position, the Democrats' ``gold standard.'' That is the \nhighest rating the American Bar Association grants.\n  Let me say one other thing before I yield to my colleague. That is \nthis: I have had real problems with the American Bar Association in the \npast. I was the one who said: We are not going to allow them to be part \nof the process. They can submit their recommendations. I will give them \nweight, and Senators can give whatever weight they want. But they will \nnot be a vetting processor that can determine whether a person sits or \nnot. The reason I did that was I believed they were not being fair.\n\n  In the intervening years, and currently, I believe the American Bar \nAssociation has straightened out its act, and I believe they are being \nfair, and I believe they are doing a good job. I want to be the first \nto correct the record as to why I am in agreement that we can pay very \ngood attention. I don't think even the American Bar Association should \nstop someone from being a judge just because they disagree--and I can \nname two cases where I personally led the fight to have judges \nconfirmed who were rated not qualified by the American Bar Association \nand the judges have turned out to be very good judges in the end.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator may have answered. I was going to \nask, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, if the Senator \nbelieves we should approve Miguel Estrada because he was rated well \nqualified by the American Bar Association, has the Senator from Utah \never failed to approve a nominee from President Clinton who was well \nqualified by the American Bar Association? I think the Senator has \nanswered that question that there were times when he rejected nominees, \nvoted against nominees, refused to have hearings for nominees, delayed \nhearings on nominees who were rated well qualified by the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not that I recall. I never allowed the American Bar \nAssociation to make the determination in my mind whether I was for or \nagainst someone. I have paid attention to what they do, even when I \ndisagree with them. I always read what their recommendations were, and \nI always gave credibility where credibility should be given. I will \ncontinue to do that.\n  What I disagree with: I don't think the American Bar Association \nsystem should be a determining factor one way or the other whether a \nperson is approved by a Judiciary Committee of the full Senate, whether \na person is confirmed. I personally don't think anybody should take \nthat attitude. Some did. But that should not be a rule of the Senate. \nWe have that responsibility, not the ABA. I appreciate the Senator's \nexcellent question.\n\n  Nor am I for Mr. Estrada because he happens to be unanimously well \nqualified. It is because he is the fulfillment of the American dream. \nHere is this young Hispanic man who came to America not speaking a lot \nof English, he learned English, and then he goes on and becomes a \ngraduate of Columbia University, magna cum laude, and then he goes to \nHarvard and graduates magna cum laude there, where he was editor of the \nHarvard Law Review. Then he holds various positions, ranging from clerk \non the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and clerk for Justice Anthony \nKennedy, a moderate on the Supreme Court. And then he worked in the \nSolicitor General's Office in the first Bush administration and also \nfor the Clinton administration. He has raving reviews of the kind of \nwork he did there. Then he becomes a partner in one of the great law \nfirms in this country, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, at a relatively young \nage. He has argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, winning 10 \nof them.\n  Look, it doesn't take many brains to say this must be one heck of a \nguy, he must be one heck of a lawyer, and he must really be someone who \ncan do the job on any bench in this country. To say he has no judicial \nexperience when he clerked for two major Federal judges--one a circuit \njudge and the other a Supreme Court Justice--I think is pure bunk, and \neverybody knows it. That keeps coming up like it is a real argument. \nThat is what they call arguments--that he wasn't a judge and, \ntherefore, he should not have this privilege; that he hasn't answered \nquestions just the way they want him to answer, even though the \ntranscript is thick with extensive hearing questions and answers. He \nanswered their interrogatories, written questions, but only two of them \ntook the time to write them. I hope we don't send written questions to \nevery one of these nominees, but if you have some questions, send them.\n  He said if the Justice Department wants to give up these memoranda, \nit is OK with me, I am proud of my work. But he fully understands why \nthey don't want to simply turn them over. They are private, they are \nconfidential, and they involve opinions that could undermine the work \nof the Solicitor General of the United States in arguing for our \ncountry. If they are disclosed and if other workers in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office believe their opinions are going to be disclosed to \nthe public, guess how honest the future opinions are going to be, \nespecially if somebody wants to go on to hold another position in the \nJustice Department or Government that is a confirmable position, or \nwants to become a district court, or circuit court, or Supreme Court \njudge.\n  Second, Mr. Estrada testified for a full day in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on a range of subjects and then answered written follow-up \nquestions from committee members. As I said, it should be mentioned \nthat only two members of the committee decided to pose such questions.\n  Third, Mr. Estrada has received broad bipartisan support from lawyers \nwho know him best, including former Clinton Solicitor General Seth \nWaxman and Vice President Gore's former chief of staff, Ron Klain--\nthese are top Democrats who say this man deserves confirmation--former \nClinton Justice Department officials Randolph Moss and Bob Litt--again, \ntwo top Democrats, many individuals in the Justice Department; and, in \naddition, 14 other colleagues of Miguel Estrada in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office have all written glowing recommendations of Mr. \nEstrada.\n\n  Fourth, the Senate is free to review the briefs and other publicly \navailable written work Mr. Estrada performed on behalf of clients in \nthe more than 15 Supreme Court cases he has handled during his career.\n  The record is voluminous. They are also able to get the oral \narguments he made before the Court. Surely they can get, from all of \nthat documentation, enough to understand what his judicial philosophy \nmight be. Keep in mind, he was representing clients, so it would \nprobably even be unfair for them to distort and utilize anything they \ndisagreed with in all these documents because he represented clients \nand had to do the best he could for them. That doesn't mean those were \nnecessarily his opinions, other than he did a job as an attorney must \ndo on behalf of his clients. It's a ridiculous argument that we don't \nknow enough about him because there is no doubt that the record is \nvoluminous. They could go through\n\n[[Page S2236]]\n\nall of that. I don't believe they have gone through very much of it. \nPerhaps some of the staff.\n  This is just a phony bunch of excuses for giving this Hispanic \nAmerican a rough time. They are against him because he is supported by \na Republican President and he may be conservative. My goodness, he may \neven be against their hallmark decision of Roe v. Wade. Come on. These \nare foolish arguments.\n  All of this information is more than adequate. We have the Supreme \nCourt cases, the briefs that were filed, and arguments that were made--\nall of that information is more than adequate to address Mr. Estrada's \nqualifications. We have approved thousands of judges who have never \nargued a case in the Supreme Court. He argued 15, winning 10 of them. \nThis body must, in order to maintain the proper constitutional balance, \nrefrain from seeking just this sort of information from Mr. Estrada. We \nshould not have a right to this sort of information any more than we \nhave a right to have them from their nominees to serve in our Federal \ncourts.\n  Many distinguished Democrats have themselves noted that seeking \npersonal views is highly inappropriate. Justice Thurgood Marshall made \nthis point in 1967, when he refused to answer questions at his \nconfirmation hearing about the fifth amendment. He said:\n\n       I do not think you want me to be in the position of giving \n     you a statement on the fifth amendment, and then, if I am \n     confirmed and sit on the Court, when a fifth amendment case \n     comes up, I will have to disqualify myself.\n\n  Lloyd Cutler, one of the great lawyers in this town, a former Clinton \nWhite House counsel, and former Carter White House counsel, who also \nwas at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue at the same time as the \nSenator from New York, disagrees with efforts to discern a nominee's \nideology during the confirmation process. According to Mr. Cutler:\n\n       It would be a tragic development if ideology became an \n     increasingly important consideration in the future. To make \n     ideology an issue in the confirmation process is to suggest \n     that the legal process is and should be a political one. That \n     is not only wrong as a matter of political science; it also \n     serves to weaken public confidence in the courts. Just as \n     candidates should put aside their partisan political views \n     when appointed to the bench, so too should they put aside \n     ideology. To retain either is to betray dedication to the \n     process of impartial judging.\n\n  Former Senator Albert Gore, Sr., also believed that efforts to \ndiscern a nominee's personal views were inappropriate. Former Senator \nGore noted the following in connection with the 1968 nomination of Abe \nFortas to serve on the Supreme Court:\n\n       [A] judge is under the greatest and most compelling \n     necessity to avoid construing or explaining opinions of the \n     Court lest he may appear to be adding to or subtracting from \n     what has been decided, or may perchance be prejudging future \n     cases.\n\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee agreed with Senator Gore, noting the \nfollowing in a committee report on the Fortas nomination that year:\n\n       Although recognizing the constitutional dilemma which \n     appears to exist when the Senate is asked to advise and \n     consent on a judicial nominee without examining him on legal \n     questions, the committee is of the view that Justice Fortas \n     wisely and correctly declined to answer questions in this \n     area.\n\n  To require a judge to state his views on legal questions or to \ndiscuss his past decisions before the committee would threaten the \nindependence of the judiciary and the integrity of the judicial system \nitself. It would also impinge on the constitutional doctrine of \nseparation of powers among the three branches of government as required \nby the Constitution.\n  Democrats back then made it very clear, including Lloyd Cutler and \ncountless others, that they should not be answering questions about how \nthey might rule on given cases. Why this is suddenly not so clear to my \ncolleagues on the other side is a mystery.\n  Finally, the ABA's Model Code of Judicial Conduct also prohibits a \nnominee from discussing his personal views.\n  Canon 5A(3)(d) of the ABA's Model Code of Judicial Conduct states \nthat prospective judges ``shall not . . . make pledges or promises of \nconduct in office other than the faithful and impartial performance of \nthe duties of office . . . [or] make statements that commit or appear \nto commit the candidate with respect to cases, controversies or issues \nthat are likely to come before the court.''\n  Mr. Estrada's opponents in essence are asking him to violate this \nethical canon.\n  Mr. Estrada possesses an excellent record--one which merits \nconfirmation. Efforts by the other side to deny him confirmation in the \nface of this excellent record are unfair and degrading to the \nconfirmation process.\n  The arguments made by the other side are not constitutional, they are \npolitical. The other side knows that the Constitution prohibits this \nbody from intruding on the independence of the judiciary, and from \nforcing candidates to provide us with their personal views on legal \nissues. I hope the Senate will reject these unconstitutional efforts \nand I surely hope that we will vote soon to confirm Miguel Estrada.\n  I have to ask, Where are the real arguments against Mr. Estrada? The \nfact they haven't been able to dig up any dirt on him is lamentable, I \nguess, to them. But, on the other hand, they haven't been able to. The \nfact is they do not have a good argument against Miguel Estrada, other \nthan these specious arguments that they should be allowed to get into \nconfidential, private, and privileged information at the Department of \nJustice in the Solicitor General's Office. They can't get those \nmaterials, but the fact of the matter is they shouldn't be able to do \nso. Not only do I say that, but seven former Solicitors General--four \nof them are top Democrats--even to this day take that position as well.\n  My gosh. The fact he wasn't a judge is irrelevant. If he is \nqualified, as he certainly is--and I don't think anybody can really \nargue he is not, with the reputation and the achievements he has had in \nhis life--in all honesty, we should move to a vote. The fact he hasn't \nhad judicial experience other than the years he spent as a judicial \nclerk in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and with the Supreme Court \nof the United State of America--I mean, in all honesty, we have had \nfellow Hispanics say he is not Hispanic enough, and he hasn't done \nenough for the Hispanic community. Gee, I think everything he has done \nhas been for the Hispanic community, and for everybody else as well. \nThis is a man who really does.\n  Where does all of this come from? It comes from the 2001 retreat the \nDemocrats held where they had some of the top liberal law professors \ncome in and suggest to them how they have to fight on judges and how \nthey have to be unfair. They came up with these ``weapons of mass \nobstruction'' because they do not want to have Bush judges confirmed.\n  No. 1, they suggested: ``Bottle up these nominees in committee.''\n  We are doing that every day. I have had a threat they will filibuster \nthe nominees in our markup, which I do not recall ever happening in my \nalmost 30 years in the Senate. But that is what I have been informed \nmight happen. I hope they will reconsider that.\n  No. 2: ``Inject ideology in the confirmation procession.''\n  We see that regularly, where heretofore both sides have said ideology \nis not a part of this process. Yet, we have seen that in almost every \ncircuit court of appeals nomination.\n  No. 3: ``Seek all unpublished opinions.''\n  That is why they are upset. Because he is not a judge, he has no \npublished opinions. He has unpublished opinions. But unpublished \nopinions--judges do hundreds of those every year. Over a course of \ntime, such as in the case of Dennis Shedd, he did thousands of them. \nYet, they wanted his unpublished opinions because that would slow the \nprocess down even more. Regardless of how much it cost the taxpayers to \ngo back through all of those archival records and dig up unpublished \nopinions, there were thousands from Dennis Shedd.\n  They don't have that in this case. They can't do that in the case of \nMiguel Estrada. What they seek is privileged in terms of memoranda. No \nnominee worth his salt is going to want his privileged internal \nmemoranda made public to the Senate Judiciary Committee, or to anybody \nelse, because that would chill the giving of fair, reasonable, and \nhonest, and I might say, effective opinions of the Justice Department.\n  What they really then said--and this is the bottom line--if all those \ntop three weapons don't work, and so far\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\nthey haven't worked in the Estrada nomination--then you do the last \nthing; that is, filibuster for the first time in the history of the \nUnited States against a circuit court of appeals nominee, or even a \ndistrict court nominee.\n\n  I acknowledge we have had cloture votes in the past, but not because \nthere was a true filibuster. But yesterday we were told by our \ncolleagues on the other side they are going to filibuster. And we are, \nin effect, in the middle of a filibuster, as my good friend from Nevada \nmentioned this morning; that they are not going to allow a vote unless \nthey can get these privileged internal memoranda, which is again part \nof this weapon of ``mass obstruction'' or these weapons of ``mass \nobstruction'' to totally shut down and delay fairness to President \nBush's nomination. That is what it comes down to.\n  Let me tell you, it is the wrong thing to do, because it works both \nways. Someday perhaps the Democrats may get the Presidency themselves \nand then find themselves in the same stupid position we find ourselves \nin where they cannot get honest treatment for their nominees because \nwhenever there is a ``controversial'' nominee, there is going to be a \nfilibuster. It is a dangerous road to go down. I want to recommend to \nmy colleagues on the other side, don't go down that road anymore. The \nbest thing you can do is to face the music and let the Senate vote. \nThat is what the Senate should do in this matter. It should vote up or \ndown.\n  It is believed by some on the other side that Miguel Estrada is a \nshoo-in because every Republican is going to vote for Miguel Estrada. \nWe know there are a number of Democrats--I do not know how many, but \nthere are a few for sure, and I believe others--who will vote for him \nas well, which means he will sit on the Circuit Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia. There are some on the other side who do not \nwant him to sit on the bench under any circumstances because they think \nhe might be a conservative judge who might disagree with them on some \nof their litmus test issues.\n  That is wrong. If we took that attitude, there would be very few \njudges sitting on the circuit courts of appeals.\n  I have worked my very best to make sure we never, ever had a \nfilibuster started on my watch. We were successful. There were some who \nwanted to filibuster occasionally because they felt so deeply \nideologically opposed to some of the Clinton nominees. There were some \nwho felt deeply against some of the Carter nominees. But we stopped it. \nI believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle ought to do the \nright thing to stop it here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have sat here for the last couple of days \ntrying to figure out a way to explain Miguel Estrada's refusal to \nanswer questions. I think I have finally come to a conclusion of how to \nexplain why he has not answered questions.\n  Travel with me 3,000 miles to Nevada. We have a home in a place \ncalled Searchlight, NV. It is a relatively new home. We built it a year \nago last December. We have new furniture in it. I have a lot of \ngrandchildren--12 and soon to be 13. One of my sons has three little \nboys. They are just very close together. My little grandson, Wyatt, \njust turned 3. It was obvious he had gone to one of our new couches and \nhad written on it.\n  So his dad sees that, and he goes to him and he starts interrogating \nmy 3-year-old grandson. He had just turned 3. He said: Did you do that? \nWyatt said: No. He said: Well, who did it, then? He said: I don't \nremember his name.\n  That is how Miguel Estrada answers questions. He uses the ``Wyatt'' \nanswering method. Sure, he fills up a book, but he does not say \nanything: ``Who did it?'' ``I don't remember his name.''\n  Mr. President, I cannot do it in a better way: ``Miguel Estrada's \nAnswers to the Judiciary Committee's Questions.'' Here they are, on \nthis chart, for everyone to see. That is it: ``Miguel Estrada's Answers \nto the Judiciary Committee's Questions.'' That is it. It is a blank \npage.\n  He can fill up a volume this deep with ``Wyatt'' answers. And the way \nhe answers questions, here is what we know about his legal philosophy, \nas shown on this chart. That is it: ``Miguel Estrada's Legal \nPhilosophy'' is summed up with those four words. There isn't any. We \ndon't know.\n  And if we want to take a look at his memoranda, which is some \nevidence of what he said in his legal writings, this is what we have: \n``Miguel Estrada's Legal Memoranda.'' That is it, another blank page.\n  I said, as politely as I could, to the distinguished majority leader, \nwe have a problem here. Now, we may be wrong, Mr. President. We think \nwe, on the basis of principle, are doing what the Constitution directs \nus to do. We believe, as a matter of principle, we are right. And \nhistory, I believe, will prove we are right.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will, in just a second, to my dear friend.\n  Mr. President, people have a right to disagree with us, but we are \nunited in saying we want from this man the ability to have him answer \nreal questions and not give ``Wyatt'' answers.\n  We also believe, Mr. President, without any question, we have a right \nto his legal writings he performed while he was with the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. It has been done before.\n  Now, if this man is as good as they say he is, then that seems a very \nsmall duty. They can talk about how it is chilling, and all this kind \nof stuff, and that there have been people who say he should not do it. \nOf course, they say he should not do it. But that does not mean it \ncannot be done and has not been done in the past. Ask Chief Justice \nRehnquist: Has it been done in the past? Of course, it has been done in \nthe past. Ask others who have been here, Attorney General Civiletti, \nand others.\n  Of course, when there is a question that arises and you think \nsomebody is really good, then you do what is necessary to get them \nconfirmed. We are not asking that much: Answers to questions, real \nanswers, not ``Wyatt'' answers. And let's see what you wrote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator familiar with this huge transcript of the \nhearing? I do not believe the Senator was there.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend----\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it is a little unfair to put up there that he \ndoesn't answer any questions. This whole transcript is filled with \nanswers. He may not have answered them all the way the Democrats wanted \nhim to answer them.\n  Is the Senator also familiar with the fact he argued 15 cases before \nthe Supreme Court, and that the Democrats have had access to all of \nthose briefs, all of those arguments?\n\n  Mr. REID. As I told the majority leader----\n  Mr. HATCH. I think that is a little unfair to use that type of \nargument--look at it.\n  Mr. REID. As I told the majority leader this morning, everything has \nbeen said but not everybody has said it. What I am doing today is just \nsaying it a different way. Everything has been said.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let's be fair about it.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to answer my friend. As I said--I am sure \nmy friend was not listening--you could fill up a volume twice that big \nwith ``Wyatt'' answers. That is what he has done. He has not answered \nquestions. He has said words, but he has not answered questions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. REID. We have gone through his transcript. And, in fact, the \ndistinguished Senator from California, Dianne Feinstein, is a person \nwho is very fair, and on these nominations she bends over backwards to \nmake sure the Republican President gets whoever he wants. But Dianne \nFeinstein was so concerned, she went back and reread everything, and \nshe came to the conclusion he has said nothing. And that is what this \nis all about: He has said nothing.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield again for another question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. HATCH. Has the Senator read this transcript?\n  Mr. REID. I have gone through the transcript.\n  Mr. HATCH. You have read it, and you say he has not answered the \nquestions?\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\n  Mr. REID. He has given ``Wyatt'' answers. He has answered questions, \nbut he has not answered questions committee members felt he should have \nanswered. I think he was evasive, terribly evasive, and I think this \nadequately describes his answers.\n  I want to say something else. It has been said--but let me say it \nagain--he has been at the Supreme Court 15 times. Now, the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer is a trial lawyer. I was very \nimpressed, even though I disagreed basically with his presentation, \nright here, 4 years ago. But it was very clear, as I learned afterward, \nthat the Presiding Officer was a fine trial lawyer. And I would like to \nthink I have had some fairly good experience in a courtroom. I tried \nover 100 jury trials. But with all the jury trials I tried, you could \ngo back and read every word I argued to a jury, every cross-examination \nI did, every direct examination I did, and you would not know how I \nstood on a single issue, because I was there representing people. I \nrepresented people who killed people. I represented people who robbed \npeople with guns. I represented insurance companies. I represented \npeople who had been injured. And I sued insurance companies. That does \nnot have any bearing on how I feel about a particular principle, me \npersonally.\n  You could have 5,000 cases at the Supreme Court and that does not \ndetermine how you stand. You write briefs. You are an advocate for a \nclient. And Miguel Estrada argued cases before the Supreme Court when \nhe worked for the Federal Government. He had a job to do, and he did a \ndecent job. He won 75 percent of his cases, I understand.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The point has been made by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch of Utah, that because some Democrats do not \nagree with what is supposed to be Miguel Estrada's political \nphilosophy, that is why he is running into some difficulty in the \ncourse of this debate.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada, is it not true we have \napproved over 100 nominees from the Bush White House, and 100 of those \nwere under Senator Leahy, the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee? And is it not also true that among those nominees were \npeople who were generally conservative in terms of their political \nbeliefs, who have been approved by the Judiciary Committee, and by the \nSenate, because we understood where they particularly held their \nbeliefs and went forward and gave them approval?\n  Mr. REID. Let me answer the question this way. A member of the \nJudiciary Committee, who has liberal credentials, came to me and said: \nYou know, there's this man named McConnell--I think that was the name \nof the individual who came before the Judiciary Committee. The member \nof the Judiciary Committee disagreed with every answer he gave, but he \nknew what he was talking about, and he answered every question to the \nbest of his ability. And that Senator voted for that person, even \nthough that member of the Judiciary Committee told me he was not of \nthat person's political philosophy. That is an example. Not only did we \ndo 100, exactly 100 last year, the 18 months we were in control, but as \nI recall, Monday we voted on three judges. Not a single Democrat voted \nagainst any of those nominees.\n\n  I said last night, and I will tell my friend from Illinois--I will \nrepeat just what I said. My father-in-law was a chiropractor, but even \nthough he was not a trained medical doctor, he really understood \npeople's feelings and their illnesses. He always used to tell my wife, \nand he told me, that if a person says they are sick, they are sick. We \nhave had people second-guess: He's not really sick, he's faking it. He \nsaid if somebody says they are sick, they are sick.\n  What I have been telling everybody on the other side is Miguel \nEstrada has a problem. You may not agree it is a problem, but it is \njust like my father-in-law says: When somebody keeps telling me they \nhave a problem, they have a problem. Miguel Estrada has a problem, and \nthe only way they can have that problem resolved is supply his memos \nand, in addition to that, answer questions. If he doesn't do that, \nthere are very few alternatives left.\n  One is to try to invoke cloture to stop this debate. No. 2 is pull \nthe nomination. That decision has to be made by the Republican \nmajority. We are not in the business of stopping judges. We, along with \nmany groups in America today--not the least of which is the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, but we could go on and on with other \ngroups--believe this man is a blank slate.\n  I want to say something to my friend from Illinois and everyone \nwithin the sound of my voice, including my dear friend from the \nneighboring State of Utah, somebody for whom I have great respect and \nadmiration, Orrin Hatch.\n  I don't know who came up with this ``weapons of mass destruction,'' \nbut they should be ashamed of themselves. We have a situation where my \nfamily is out today trying to buy duct tape because they are afraid. \nThey are afraid there is going to be a biological attack or a chemical \nattack, as we have been told by Secretary Ridge there might be.\n  Why? Because people are going to bring to our country weapons of mass \ndestruction. A play on words today, thinking it is real cute--they are \nsaying we are using ``weapons of mass obstruction.'' I think it is \ncheap, petty, wrong, and is below the dignity of this Senate.\n  I want anyone who thinks that is cute to get a better joke writer \nbecause it is not very funny.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Matter of personal privilege.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. We did not use the term ``weapons of mass destruction.'' \nMatter of personal privilege.\n  Mr. REID. I have the floor. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to say to my friend from Nevada----\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senators yield for an inquiry?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to say to my colleague, the Senator from Nevada, \nmany people here may characterize this debate over Miguel Estrada in a \nvariety of ways, but many of us believe--I think the Senator from \nNevada shares this belief--what is at issue here is a constitutional \nprinciple. It goes to the founding of our Republic. When the Founding \nFathers decided that this body of 100 people would have the last word, \nto advise and consent on appointments to the Federal bench of judges \nwho were seeking lifetime appointments, this is no trivial thing. It is \nnot a personal thing when it comes to Miguel Estrada.\n\n  I think the point I tried to make to the Senator from Nevada: We have \napproved 103 nominees from the Bush White House without fail, each one \nof them conservative politically. I am sure I disagree with them on \nmany issues, but so be it. That is the nature of the system.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, what is at stake in this debate, the \nreason it is taking so much time? Is it not a constitutional principle \nthat goes beyond a cute political phrase as to whether or not this \nSenate is going to meet its constitutional responsibility to make sure \nthat every nominee is honest and open and candid with the American \npeople and the Senate so we do not end up with a secret judiciary, men \nand women who skate through by keeping their mouths shut?\n  I am sorry your grandson has become the object of this debate, but \nhis answer to the question is a priceless one. When he was asked if he \nwas guilty of mischief, he said: I don't remember the name of the \nperson who was. That is the kind of evasive answer we have with Miguel \nEstrada. It goes way beyond a catchy political phrase. It goes way \nbeyond political posturing.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, did we not sit here yesterday, both of \nus, going to the Constitution itself, to read again our constitutional \nresponsibility when it comes to advice and consent on the judges \nnominated by any President?\n  Mr. REID. Article II, section 2.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate it. I knew he would. My friend is a very fair \nand\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\nvery decent man. Personally, I just want to correct the Record. We did \nnot use the term ``weapons of mass destruction.'' We used the term \n``weapons of mass obstruction.''\n  Mr. REID addressed to Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator yielded to me. We have used what was used in \nthe Senate retreat for the Democrats in 2001, exactly what these \nliberal law professors said Democrats should do to mess up the \nconfirmation process and make it difficult for this President to be \ntreated fairly. If these are not weapons of mass--obstruction--to make \nit clear, then I don't know what they are. But I would be ashamed to \nuse all of those approaches. Above all, I would be ashamed to use a \nfilibuster, the first time in history, to risk the whole judiciary \nbecause of partisan politics, and to do it against the first Hispanic \never nominated to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia.\n  What is fair about that? What is right about that? I would be \nashamed.\n  Mr. REID. I thought the Senator had a question for me.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thought I was yielded the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I technically yield the floor. I thought it was for a \nquestion. You have the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. If not, I apologize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. And then bring up Moreno, as if there were a blue slip \npolicy issue? It could have been. But the real issue was that the White \nHouse refused to consult with the two Senators of the State. I wrote a \nletter to Chuck Ruff and said: You need to consult with them. And they \nnever did.\n  I have to say, in my chairmanship, if this administration doesn't \nconsult with two Democrat Senators in the State, that nominee is not \ngoing to move. Now, I am not going to put up with a screwed-up \ndefinition of what consultation is. But they are going to have to \nconsult. And they are consulting. That has been my direction to Judge \nGonzales, to the Justice Department, to anybody: You need to consult \nwith Democrats and Republicans up here. We do have some rights as \nSenators.\n\n  But let me tell you, I personally resent anybody trying to compare \nwhat we are doing here, quoting liberal law professors who ought to \nknow better, by calling what they have suggested to the Democrats \n``weapons of mass obstruction''--it is a far cry from ``weapons of \ndestruction.''\n  This is true. There is not a word on there that is not true. You go \ndown to the bottom line, which is, if you can't win on all these other \nprocedural mechanisms that really are not valid, then you filibuster; \nfor the first time in the history of circuit court nominees, we have a \ntrue filibuster. And to do it against the first Hispanic ever nominated \nto the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia I find \nparticularly reprehensible. But it is not just that. It is not just \nthat. The real reason they are doing this is that they are so afraid \nthat this brilliant young Hispanic lawyer, with all of these \ncredentials, may someday be tapped by the President for the U.S. \nSupreme Court. The very fact that he is considered for that shows the \nquality of the man.\n  But look at his record. Then, to try to imply that he did not answer \nquestions, or even state that he didn't, with this kind of hearing \nrecord, when they controlled the whole process, I think is particularly \nwrong.\n  Look, I happen to respect my colleagues on the other side. I like \nthem. I definitely have a great relationship with my friend from \nNevada. We are close personal friends. This isn't the usual language \naround here. I am saying he is one of my close personal friends. I \nwould do almost anything for him. I like the Senator from Illinois. He \nis one of the brightest, most articulate people in this body. He is a \ngood lawyer.\n  But I tell you, I have never seen anything like this, not in my whole \ntime in the Senate. I think it is wrong. I think it is wrong.\n  You know what is driving all these outside left-wing groups that are \nout there? It is their base, and they even say it, led by People for \nthe American Way who are acting in a very un-American way: Distorting \nthese people's records, bringing partisanship in, demanding litmus test \nvotes, demanding a filibuster, which is exactly what the other side has \ndone. They are hurting this process like you can't believe.\n\n  Are my colleagues on the other side listening to that stuff? We have \nhad some on our side listen to it, but we have always stopped it. I am \nreally concerned about it. I am concerned about this process. As \nimportant as Miguel Estrada is, this process is even more important. \nBut I have to say, Miguel Estrada is a terrific nominee. They should \nhave to come up with something valid or substantive, not just all of \nthese philosophical objections that really have no merit to begin with.\n  Mr. REID. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator raised a personal privilege.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withdrew that.\n  Mr. REID. And then I yielded the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. You did.\n  Mr. REID. I didn't do it in the proper way. I had not finished my \nstatement. I should have said, I yield the floor to my friend for a \nquestion. I didn't do that. I hope the Senator doesn't talk too much \nlonger so I can get the floor back.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me honor my colleague's request by just saying that I \nhope we can work fairly through this process. I know my friends on the \nother side don't like President Bush or don't agree with his \nphilosophy, and they don't agree with his choices of judges. Several of \nthem really feel that way, and they do it sincerely. I can understand \nthat. But let's treat them fairly. Let's treat the President of the \nUnited States fairly. Some day the Democrats will have that position. I \nhope it is not in the near future. But they may have that position. And \nif I am here, I am going to treat them fairly, which I did for \nPresident Clinton. I think everybody around here knows it. I made every \neffort I could.\n  If my colleague asks for the floor back, I will be glad to give it \nback at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to complete my statement, and I will \nbe very brief.\n  I think it is improper. I have attended every Democratic retreat that \nhas been held in the last many years. I don't remember anyone ever \nsaying that at a retreat that I attended. It is improper and not good \nto use it at a time when the President is talking about going to war, \nwhen we have a war going on with terrorists today.\n  Suffice it to say that Miguel Estrada's answers to Judiciary \nCommittee questions are just like this, a blank slate. He has given \nanswers, as my grandson answers questions: I don't remember his name.\n  We refuse to serve as a rubberstamp. We believe strongly that there \nis a way out of this, and that is by answering the questions that were \nasked in detail as have other nominees who have come before us. We also \nbelieve he should supply the memoranda that he wrote when he was in the \nSolicitor General's Office.\n  We believe this is our constitutional duty. And as I said before, \neverything has been said. We are going to figure out, however long the \nmajority leader wants to talk, different ways to say it. But we are not \ngoing to back down from this. This is something we believe as a matter \nof principle. If we let this go through, somebody can come before the \nJudiciary Committee and, in effect, give them nothing and say, boy, I \nshowed you guys. I think people need to be candid, forthright, and he \nhas simply not done that. The record is very clear to that effect. I \nthink using the term ``weapons of mass obstruction'' is wrong.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Nevada has said this morning that the\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\nDemocrats would not allow a vote on this nomination. He has also said \nthey want to see the memoranda that were compiled by Miguel Estrada \nwhile he was working for the Clinton administration.\n  Mr. REID. And the Bush administration.\n  Mr. BENNETT. And the Bush administration. I would ask the Senator \nfrom Nevada if he knows of any Senator on his side who, upon seeing the \nmemoranda, would change his vote and allow a vote, not change his vote \nand vote for Estrada but change his vote and allow a vote on Estrada \nupon seeing the memoranda?\n  Mr. REID. We would have to leave that to individual Senators. I am \nsure there could be some. It would be very helpful.\n  I am not a member of the committee, but we have a former chairman and \nranking member here and one of the active members who has been on the \nfloor a lot during this debate.\n  It could be very important in arriving at a decision about how you \nfeel about this man if he did give his opinions. It helped with \nRehnquist. It helped with Civiletti, Roberts, and a number of other \npeople who came before various committees seeking their attention in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Nevada is aware of what \nthe Senator from Vermont said, I realize the junior Senator from Utah \nwas not in the Chamber at that time--the senior Senator from Utah was, \nas was the distinguished majority leader--it would be safe to say to \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah that the Senator from Vermont \nstated this morning very clearly that I would be prepared to see this \ngo to a vote once response would be made. And the Senator from Vermont \nnoted that Mr. Estrada himself said he had no objection to having all \nthis memoranda that we have sought made available but had been told by \nthe administration that he would not be allowed to.\n\n  If the question is how various Senators would feel if the memoranda \nwere made available and we were allowed to question Mr. Estrada, \nsomething he said personally that he would have no objection to, then \nas far as I am concerned I would be perfectly willing after that to \nhave the matter go forward to a vote and have Senators vote up or down \nhowever they may feel.\n  Mr. REID. I would respond to my friend from Vermont, I would only add \nthis: I think if the memoranda raise any questions, then certainly the \nmembers of the committee would be entitled to ask questions relating to \nthose memoranda and get better answers--I should say, get answers, \nperiod--to the questions that were asked relating to those memoranda. \nThat is fair; would the Senator agree?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would agree. In fact, that is what I said again this \nmorning. If we had the memoranda, something Mr. Estrada said he is \nperfectly willing to let us have but the administration wouldn't let \nhim, but if we had the memoranda, if we were able to ask what he meant \nby this or that in the memoranda, once that was done, if he answered \nthose questions, whether I agreed or disagreed with the answers to the \nquestions, this Senator at least is perfectly willing to have it go \nforward on a vote, which is basically what we did with numerous other \nDemocratic and Republican nominees in the past in similar \ncircumstances. I don't want there to be any question about that.\n  This Senator is perfectly willing to have this matter come to a vote \nonce Mr. Estrada did what he has said that he is perfectly willing to \ndo--make available his memoranda and answer questions about them. So \nfar only the administration has refused, and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader and I wrote a letter to the President to that effect.\n  Mr. REID. That was yesterday.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That was yesterday.\n  Mr. REID. It is no secret that the ranking member, on behalf of the \nmembers of the committee, has for weeks and weeks sought this \ninformation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from Utah have another question? I would \nbe happy to yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, without the Senator from Nevada losing \nhis right to the floor, I would like to continue a discussion at this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Because I see perhaps the makings of a deal here, if \nindeed the senior Senator from Vermont is willing to allow this to go \nforward if the memoranda were made public and if indeed the nominee \nhimself knows of nothing in the memoranda that would be \nobjectionable, it comes down now, ultimately, to the decision of the \nclient because this was an attorney serving a client, the decision of \nthe client to allow this information to come forward.\n\n  Now, every living Solicitor General has said it would be a bad idea \nfor this to come forward. The Washington Post has said it would be a \nbad idea for it to come forward. But if it could be worked out that on \na one-time basis, not setting precedent, the opinions of the Solicitors \nGeneral, both Republican and Democrat, could be set aside and these \nmemoranda could be made available, do we have a commitment that, then, \nthis could come to a vote? Because if that is the case, I, for one, \nwould go to the administration and say let's allow it to come forward.\n  I recognize this is a precedent no one wants to set, but I think the \nprecedent of establishing a filibuster is one nobody wants to set. I \nwould be happy to join with the Senator from Vermont in asking the \nadministration to consider these memoranda to be made public if, in \nfact, we can get a commitment that upon their being made public, we \ncould get a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Utah that even \nthough he is not a lawyer, he certainly acts like one. I won't tell \nanybody in Utah that.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am not sure that is a compliment.\n  Mr. REID. I indicated I would not tell anyone in Utah.\n  I want to respond to this question. The Democratic leader and the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee wrote a letter to the \nPresident of the United States yesterday and outlined exactly what we \nhave talked about today. If, in fact, the memoranda were made public, \nwere given to the Judiciary Committee--and it has happened other times \nin the past--and he would respond to questions, we would be happy to \ntake another look at this man. That is what the letter said to the \nPresident of the United States. I said last night, and this morning, \nthat there are a number of ways out of this: Pull the nomination, give \nus the information we want, the memoranda, and answers to these \nquestions, or file cloture.\n  I yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I might, Mr. President, the suggestion has been made on \nthe floor that this is a one-time precedent. It is not a fact that this \nis a one-time precedent. It happened in the nominations of Robert Bork, \nWilliam Bradford Reynolds, Benjamin Civiletti, Stephen Trott, and \nWilliam H. Rehnquist.\n  I yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend from Nevada, thank you for yielding. \nAnd I say to my colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, with whom I share \nsome responsibility on the Appropriations subcommittee, and whom I have \nfound to be an extremely fair person, I think perhaps he has come up \nwith the solution to the gordian knot we face.\n  We are not against Miguel Estrada. Without information, we cannot \nmake a judgment on Miguel Estrada. We believe it is our constitutional \nresponsibility to ask of every judicial nominee, from both Democratic \nand Republican Presidents, obvious important questions. In the case of \nMr. Estrada, since he never served as a judge, he has legal writings, \nlegal memoranda, legal opinions. We are asking him to share those with \nus so we can have insight into who he is, what he believes, and what he \nwill do with a lifetime appointment to one of the most important \nFederal benches in America.\n  That is what this is about. It is not about being Hispanic. If you \nlook at the record on the Democratic side, President Clinton appointed \nfar more Hispanics to the bench than any other President in history. We \nsupported him, and we continue to support that. I believe this \naffirmative action by the\n\n[[Page S2241]]\n\nWhite House to bring Hispanics into the judiciary is a good thing for \nAmerica. Our judiciary should reflect the diversity of the country. \nWhether they are Hispanic, Irish, or Lithuanian, we are going to ask \nthe hard questions. Then the Senate will make a decision. The thing the \nSenator from Nevada has stated repeatedly is that what we are about \ntoday is a real quest for information, a search for information.\n\n  I hope the Senator from Utah will prevail not only on his leadership, \nbut on the President, to follow the Bennett model here--full \ndisclosure. Bring the legal memoranda and writings before us, let us \nask the obvious questions that they will lead us to, and then let us \nconsider up or down this nomination. That is an honest approach, and I \nthink it would avoid what we have been through in the last couple \nweeks. Isn't this what the Senator from Nevada has been asking for and \nwhat the leadership has been asking for?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, I have said not once, not \ntwice, I don't know how many times--over a dozen times--if this man is \nas good as they say he is, this seems to be such a small push, to have \nhim answer questions and give us his legal memoranda. That is what we \nare asking, because as I had shown through my visual aid today, we have \nnothing from him. If he is as good as they say, I repeat, bring that \nforward. That would make us happy in so many different ways. It would \nshow that we don't have to take these people given to us, just jammed \nthrough, having blank slates. We have the right to ask questions.\n  Secondly, it is important because I believe it sets a very dangerous \nprecedent that Miguel Estrada, Harry Reid, Dick Durbin, or anyone going \nthrough the process can go through without the Senate having the \nability to learn who they are. We have that obligation. The Senator is \nabsolutely right. We sat back there next to one another yesterday \nlooking through the Constitution--we both had one--looking up article \nII, section 2, to make sure we felt good about what we were doing. I \nthink it is very clear that our constitutional responsibilities not \nonly allow us to do this but demand that we do it. We have an \nobligation to not only this Senate but future Senates, and not only the \npeople of America today but future generations, that we are doing the \nright thing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield further for a question, I \nlistened earlier when the Senator made his presentation about Miguel \nEstrada and what he said and did not say to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and to the American people. He was challenged by Senator \nHatch, who produced a binder and said: Have you read the words in here?\n  The Senator from Nevada said: You can evade answers and fill up pages \nand pages.\n  I would like to read, if the Senator will allow me, one exchange that \nI think gives light to why we are here today. This was between the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer, and the nominee. Senator Schumer \nasked the following question:\n\n       Other than the cases in which you were an advocate, please \n     tell us three cases from the last 40 years of Supreme Court \n     jurisprudence you are most critical of.\n\n  Mr. Estrada answered:\n\n       I'm not even sure that I could think of three that I would \n     be--that I would have a sort of adverse reaction to, \n     if that's what you're getting at.\n\n  Senator Schumer asked:\n\n       So with all of your legal background and immersion in the \n     legal world, you can't think of three or even one single case \n     that the Supreme Court has decided that you disagree with?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       I don't know that I am in a position to say that I disagree \n     with any case that the Supreme Court has ruled on or that I \n     think that the Court got it right.\n\n  Senator Schumer:\n\n       I'm not asking you how you approach cases. That is a \n     legitimate question and some have asked it. I want to know \n     how you feel about cases, and you have said more broadly than \n     any other witness I have come across, you have given us \n     virtually no opinion on anything because it might come up in \n     the future.\n\n  Answer:\n\n       But the problem is the same, Senator Schumer, because in \n     taking case A and looking at whether the Court got it right \n     or whether I think they got it right, I have only the benefit \n     of the opinions. I haven't seen the litigants. I haven't--the \n     case is ruled on, but I don't get to see what didn't make it \n     into the opinion.\n\n  That is the end of that exchange.\n  I went to law school many years ago, as did the Senator from Nevada, \nbut if they put you on the spot today and said can you think of one \nSupreme Court case with which you might disagree----\n  Mr. REID. I think maybe I would come up with Dred Scott.\n  Mr. DURBIN. A case that approved slavery in the United States is one \nwith which we might disagree. Why would a man with his academic and \nlegal background not have that spring to his mind? How about Plessy v. \nFerguson, separate but equal?\n  Mr. REID. That was another dandy they did.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Those are two obvious ones. You don't have to go to law \nschool to think about those. This is an example of the how he filled up \na page, and what did he say? I guess he would say: If I didn't get a \nchance to meet Dred Scott, I will not comment on that case. I didn't \nknow Mr. Plessy or Mr. Ferguson, for that matter, so I should not say \nwhat I think about that.\n  You wonder why the Democrats are coming to the floor and saying, for \ngoodness' sake, this makes a mockery of the process. If a man wants a \nlifetime appointment to the second highest court in America, should he \nnot be more honest, open, and candid? That is all we are asking today.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, does he believe, as Senator Bennett is \nsuggesting, that if there is full disclosure and openness that this \nwill come to a vote? Miguel Estrada's legal memoranda will be \npresented, we will have a chance to ask questions, he will give us \nstraight answers instead of these evasions, and then let the chips fall \nwhere they may; is that not what we are about?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, that is what we have been saying, and I told the \nmajority leader this morning, this is no game we are playing; this is a \nfilibuster. We have a right to do that. Why? Because we believe that \nwhat is being done is wrong.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, we talk about article II, section \n2, but the Constitution is a little document. It is so unique, and it \ndoes so much to protect people. The Constitution was not written to \nprotect majorities. They can always protect themselves. It was written \nto protect minorities.\n  We know that the majority would vote 51 for this man today, and I \nthink we have set a very bad tone for what we are doing in this \ncountry. What we have said is, there are a significant number of \nDemocratic Senators--well over 40--who say this is not right. If we do \nthis, why do you need the Senate? If you do this, why not just have, \ninstead of President George, King George? He can just tell us what he \nwants done. It is not King George; it is President Bush. As a result of \nthat, he has to go through this process, and if he wants this man, who \nthey say they like so much, then let them come forward with the \nmemoranda he wrote when he was in the Solicitor General's Office and \nlet him answer some questions. It is as simple as that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, I, of \ncourse, will give my friend and colleague from Utah the opportunity to \nrespond.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to ask this question. I assume the Senator from \nNevada, as a Senator from that great State, has had an opportunity to \nsit down with judicial nominees who were seeking district or circuit \ncourt appointments affecting Nevada and probably has nominated men and \nwomen for the Federal bench in Nevada. I do not know what his process \nhas been. I have had that great honor in Illinois, and I try to get to \nknow these people. I ask them questions to get an idea of what is going \non in their minds.\n  It is not uncommon for me to ask the question we asked Miguel \nEstrada: Can you think of a Supreme Court case you think was \nparticularly good or particularly bad and tell me why, as open-ended \nand as nonconfrontational as possible?\n  I say to the Senator from Nevada, this is a question I asked Miguel \nEstrada, and I ask the Senator from Nevada to think about it in the \ncontext\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\nof interviewing nominees for the Federal bench in Nevada. A simple \nquestion and a simple answer. The question I asked was:\n\n       In terms of judicial philosophy, please name several \n     judges, living or dead, whom you admire and would like to \n     emulate on the bench.\n\n  That is a pretty tame question: Tell me who you admire.\n  Answer--this is Miguel Estrada:\n\n       There is no judge, living or dead, whom I would seek to \n     emulate on the bench whether in terms of judicial philosophy \n     or otherwise.\n\n  Forgive me, you cannot go through law school, you cannot be a clerk \nat the Supreme Court, you cannot argue before that Court 15 different \ntimes and not look at least at those nine Justices and think: I like \nthat Justice's approach, or read the history of the Supreme Court and \nthink: This judge added something to America; I would like to emulate \nthis judge.\n\n  If you have no heroes, living or dead, among the Federal judiciary, \nthe obvious question is, Have you been paying attention? Have you \nnoticed that men and women have made a difference for America sitting \non the Federal bench?\n  Here is this man being carefully groomed by the White House to move \nto the highest circuit court in our land, the DC Circuit, and perhaps \nto the Supreme Court--no one has denied that--and he cannot give us an \nanswer to that question? It is the reason why we are here today.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, when he brings nominees before him for \nhis State, what kind of questions does he ask them?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I respond to my friend, I think he asked a \ntrick question. I am being facetious, of course. I think that answer--\nthat is why I sat here, and I have sat here for days now and the \nSenator has been in the Chamber--but I finally came upon it: I do not \nremember his name, just like my little grandson. That ended the \nconversation. He could not remember whether it was one of his brothers \nor his grandmother. So that ended that. That is what we have here.\n  We have a man who is evading answering a question. Obviously, he was \npretty smart in doing that. He filled up a whole book saying: I am not \ngoing to answer. He filled up a book of nonanswers.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from Utah wants to ask a \nquestion.\n  I allow the Senator from Utah to ask a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have now been given a copy of the \nletter signed by Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy addressed to the \nPresident. As I have examined the letter, I do not find in it the \ncommitment I have been seeking in our dialog here. So I renew that with \nthe Senator from Nevada. The question is, Could we on this side of the \naisle get a commitment that we could go to a vote if the memoranda were \ndelivered? Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy do not give that \ncommitment in this letter. They simply say they want that information, \nthey would appreciate the President's personal attention, and that they \nneed the information in order to make an informed decision.\n  I think most of the Senators have already made their decision, be it \ninformed or otherwise, and the issue that I am striving at is to try to \nget an up-or-down vote, an opportunity for them to express their \ndecisions. So I am asking again----\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend, I think we have answered that very \ndeliberately to the effect we feel that the memoranda are important, \nand we feel his answering questions regarding the memoranda and a \ncouple of other issues are important.\n  This is my recommendation to the majority leader and to my friend \nfrom Utah who is, by the way, a deal maker, and there is nothing \nnegative at all about that. Legislation is the art of compromise, and \nthis is no different than any other issue.\n  If I were majority leader, I would simply ask the White House to \nsupply this information, and that answer speaks for itself. I think if \nthe information were forthcoming and the man, either in writing or \notherwise, answers a few questions--I do not know what questions could \ncome up by virtue of that information--but my answer speaks for itself. \nI think the majority leader should have that done. We should go on to \nother business in the Senate. There are other judicial nominations. \nThere is other substantive legislative business on which we can work. I \nthink when we come back from our break, this matter could be resolved \nvery quickly.\n\n  I do say that unless this is done, this nomination is going nowhere. \nWe have waited a long time to announce we were conducting a filibuster. \nWe understand the seriousness of looking at judicial nominations in the \nmanner we did. We understand. We understand the heartburn we are \ncausing Senator Hatch. We know how he feels, that this is intemperate \nand wrong. We know, as we have explained in conversation between \nSenator Durbin and me this morning, that it is extremely important we \ndo this. We are locked in. We have talked to our Members over here. We \nare locked into this, but this does not mean if the information is \nforthcoming--and we will do what we think is appropriate. The margins \nin the Senate are very slim. You do not have to change a lot of votes \nto get what you want.\n  I suggest if you do what we want, things will work out probably for \nyou. If you do not, nothing is going to happen.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I may, I ask unanimous consent, \nwithout the Senator from Nevada losing the floor, to make a comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I think the Senator from Nevada and I could probably \nmake a deal here, but we are both representing groups behind us. What I \nwould search for would be a firm commitment that this can come to a \nvote, not a statement that, well, we will do the right thing; not a \nstatement that we will review the answers; but a firm commitment that \nif the memoranda is produced and Mr. Estrada gives answers with respect \nto that memoranda, we can then have a firm vote.\n  The Senator from Illinois has given us an example of a question that \nwas asked. He received an answer. He considers the answer totally \ninadequate and improper, but he received an answer. If we get into this \nconversation and say, all right, the memoranda will be produced, he \nwill be questioned, and then you say, We do not like his answers, so we \nstill will not give you a vote, that is not a blind alley into which I \nwant to go.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me reply to my friend. Without that \ninformation, Miguel Estrada will never be a Federal judge. We have \ntalked with our Members, and it does not matter if there is 1 cloture \nvote or 50 cloture votes, we will all be together on that--those who \nhave agreed to hold up on this nomination.\n  I am speaking only for myself, but I think if he supplied that \ninformation, not evasive answers but tried to be fair in responding to \nany questions we had regarding those materials--and answers to some of \nthese other questions people feel serious about--it would be resolved. \nI have no doubt that would be the case. So I think the Senator could \nspend his time with the significant influence he has--I know he is \nfilling in for my counterpart who is ill temporarily, and that shows \nthe respect people have for him on his side of the aisle--I am sure if \nthe Senator from Utah went to work on that side, it would bear fruit. \nIf it does not happen, nothing will happen other than acrimony, which \nis too bad because we are going to see this one through.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Bennett for the \ncontribution he has made. I hope he understands my position--I cannot \nspeak for others--once this nominee has made full disclosure--his legal \nbackground, opinions, memoranda, his answer to questions--frankly, I \nwould view him as other nominees. I may vote for him or against him. I \nthink I voted against 6 out of 103 of President Bush's nominees. I have \nnot made a pattern of this, but some disagree with this thought. I \nthink that is where we are leading to. I hope that is where we are \nleading to.\n  More importantly, I hope the Senator from Utah understands why we are \ndoing this. There is a belief among some that with the newfound \nmajority on the Republican side since the last\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\nelection and with the control of Congress by the Republican Party and \nthe White House, the process is going to be pushed aside and things are \ngoing to be moving quickly through without the kind of deliberation we \nhave had in the past in the history of the Senate.\n  Some have suggested that on their way to the bar serving on the \nbench, people will be moving through the Senate Judiciary Committee \nlike the receiving line at an Irish wedding, and I hope that does not \nhappen. I think what we need to have is a deliberative process where \nMembers have a chance to ask questions of every nominee, and then, \nsatisfied or not satisfied, they come to a vote.\n  Make no mistake, Miguel Estrada is opposed by a variety of \norganizations which believe they know who he is and have seen enough \nevidence to raise questions in their mind. But I think for the sake of \nthe Senate as an institution, whether Republican or Democrat, what we \nare asking is not unreasonable.\n  When one reads these answers from this nominee, they have to say to \nthemselves, why is the Senate Judiciary Committee wasting its time? \nBecause if someone can get by with that type of an answer where they \ncannot identify one single Supreme Court decision they disagree with, \nthey cannot name a single Federal judge, living or dead, whom they \nadmire--if they can get by with that, why are we here?\n  It reminds me of the Clarence Thomas nomination when he said before \nGod and the world he never considered the issue of abortion in his \nlife, had no opinion on it. A man who was a former Catholic seminarian \nat Conception Abbey in Missouri, a man who had been in law school when \nRoe v. Wade was decided, had no opinion on the issue of abortion? I \nguess that sort of thing was glossed over because of all the other \nhoopla and attention given to his nomination, but I thought to myself--\nand I was not in the Senate at the time--would the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee let others get by with this where they do not even answer the \nquestion?\n  I can tell the Senator from Utah, and others who are following this \nmatter, there have been nominees who have come before this Senate \nJudiciary Committee with whom I have disagreed vehemently on issue \nafter issue. In fact, I have even successfully nominated judges to the \nbench in my State whom I disagreed with on basic issues. But I am not \nlooking for a person who has the same political DNA that I am bringing \nto this job. I want a person who is moderate and reasonable, who shows \nthat they are open minded and prepared to be a fair jurist.\n  How can one reach that conclusion about a person without asking some \nvery basic questions to try to get into their mind a little bit as to \nwhat makes them tick and where their values might be?\n  Think about the election process for the Senate. Is that not what it \nis about? Don't the voters of this country basically want to know, \nwhether it is Robert Bennett or Richard Durbin, who are you? What are \nyour values? What are you likely to do?\n  We cannot predict what votes they are going to cast, but what have \nthey done in the past or generally how do they feel about the \nprinciples and the constitutional values of this country? Those are \nsome pretty basic questions. Why wouldn't we ask that of a person \nseeking a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench, a person who, with \nthe stroke of a pen, could basically wipe out a law or say that a law \nis valid? That is an enormous delegation of power to the judiciary, \nparticularly to this level of the judiciary.\n\n  What we are saying today when it comes to Miguel Estrada is we want \nto know some basic answers. We do not expect him to tell us his opinion \nof a case pending before the DC Court and how he is going to rule. \nLloyd Cutler is right; we should never ask about a particular case. But \nto ask a judicial nominee their views on the issue of privacy, is that \nan important issue today?\n  Pick up this morning's paper. We are going through a debate now as to \nwhether the Department of Defense can collect information about \nAmericans across the board in the hope of finding those who might be \nthreatening this country with terrorism, and Congress has basically \nsaid to the Department of Defense: Close that shop. We do not know if \nwe want you mining these data banks across America at the expense of \nthe privacy of individuals' rights and liberties.\n  This is an issue which is not going away. Since September 11, 2001, \nit has been front and center in the national debate and will continue \nto be.\n  So when one asks a judicial nominee, a person who is going to the \nsecond highest court in the land with a lifetime appointment, what is \ntheir view on the issue of privacy, is that an important question? It \nis not only important; it is timely; it is critical. And for nominees \nsuch as Miguel Estrada to basically say, I do not have an opinion, that \ntells me we have a problem.\n  We should be able to ask these nominees the most basic general \nquestions relative to constitutional law and the rights and liberties \nof Americans, and we should not apologize for it.\n  I have told my colleagues in the Senate Democratic Caucus, I met \nMiguel Estrada. I sat down with him. I have read his background, his \npersonal resume, his legal credentials. They are very impressive. This \nis a man who has come very far in his life against great odds, and I \nrespect him so much for that. He is an immigrant to America.\n  I have a special affection for immigrants because my mother was an \nimmigrant. I am proud to put her naturalization certificate in my \noffice for everyone to see that I, as her son, would be standing today \nas a Senator from Illinois. Immigrants such as Miguel Estrada, my \nmother, and so many others bring so much to this country. So from a \npersonal point of view, I admire this man very much. His legal \ncredentials put me to shame. As a law student, I never got close to his \nlevel of achievement in law school, so I certainly admire that.\n  Having said all of that, accepting that he is a good person, \naccepting that he has a marvelous career as a lawyer and as a law \nclerk, I still need to ask some basic questions in terms of where he is \ngoing, given this position of responsibility. When the Democratic \nCaucus sat down, they decided this was an important issue to raise. \nMiguel Estrada was the case in point.\n  It is an important issue relative to the role of the Senate when it \ncomes to President Bush's judicial nominees. If we cannot ask the \nquestions, if we cannot ask questions that have been asked of nominees \nover and over again when Presidents of different political parties have \nbeen in power, then frankly we have given up more than our political \nright, we have squandered our constitutional responsibility.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I want to pursue this with the Senator. If we can get \nMiguel Estrada to give the Senator the name of a Supreme Court Justice \nwhom he appreciates, along with the memoranda, and answer questions on \nthe memoranda, would the Senator--not speaking for his caucus, just for \nhimself--agree to give us a vote?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, obviously we do not know what the \nanswers might be and what they might lead to, but what he suggests as a \nbasic principle is one I stand behind. When nominees are open and \nhonest with the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate, they are \nentitled to a vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I appreciate the comment of the Senator because we must \nunderstand, once again, we are not talking about the Senate \nrubberstamping something from King George. We are talking about the \nSenate entering a whole new era of saying a nominee must be approved by \n60 votes--which is something we have not done before. I appreciate the \nSenator's understanding of how serious this is, that because Miguel \nEstrada gave answers that were not acceptable to some members of the \nJudiciary Committee, and because this memoranda has not been \nforthcoming--not at his request, but at his clients' request--we are \nnow going to sail into a whole new sea. I hope everyone understands how \nsignificant that is, regardless of the qualifications of this man.\n  I will do what I can to get him to come up with a name for the \nSenator from Illinois. I do not know if I will be successful. If that \nis the whole thing stopping his confirmation, that he could not think \nof a Supreme Court Justice whom he admired under those circumstance and \nif, after reflection,\n\n[[Page S2244]]\n\nhe now can come up with a name, we would like to see the Senator from \nIllinois allow this to come to a vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We gave two illustrations where we asked Miguel Estrada \nfor a Supreme Court Justice, or a Federal judge, living or dead, he \nwould emulate and admire; we also asked for a Supreme Court case he \nmight disagree with. Senator Schumer asked the question. I say to the \nSenator from Utah, those are two very egregious illustrations of his \nevasion. There were others.\n  I cannot speak for my colleagues, but I will go back to the premise \nof my reply. I believe when a nominee is open and honest and \ncooperative, they are entitled to go through the process and have a \nvote. That is my personal view. I don't speak for any other Senator.\n  I have felt the same about issues on the floor of the Senate. My \nfeeling is this: This is a deliberative body. We take our views on \nissues to the court of public opinion and to the 100 Senators gathered. \nWe should be entitled to produce an amendment or a bill, debate it, and \nhave an up-or-down vote. I think that is what the process should be all \nabout. I have lost plenty in the Senate--the Senator of Utah can attest \nto that--I have won a few, but lost quite a few, too. I accept that \nconsequence. That is why we serve.\n  The same is true with nominees. If they are open and cooperative, \nthey are entitled to go through the process, whether nominated by a \nDemocratic or Republican president.\n  When you take a look at the groups that oppose Miguel Estrada, many \nof them have seen in his background areas of great concern. Consider \nthe groups that have opposed him: The Congressional Hispanic Caucus--\nall members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have opposed this \nHispanic nominee; the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, which is the \npremier civil rights organization for Mexican Americans and many \nHispanics in the United States, opposes Miguel Estrada; the Puerto \nRican Defense and Education Fund opposes Miguel Estrada. And then more \ngeneric groups: The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NARAL, Pro-\nChoice America, the Sierra Club, the National Women's Law Center, \nPeople for the American Way, and many others. I had printed in the \nRecord yesterday the names of the organizations and I will not take up \nthe pages of the Record again today with those illustrations.\n\n  The clear question before the Senate is why a man with such a \ncompelling personal story and such great legal credentials has so many \ngroups questioning whether he is the right person for a job. Some of it \nhas to do with his evasion. Some has to do with the secrecy that has \nsurrounded his nomination and the suggestion that this relatively young \nlawyer is on his way to the Supreme Court as early as next year.\n  Many believe when it comes to Supreme Court nominees, there are \ncertainly higher standards that need to be met, but the DC Circuit \nCourt is not far behind. As I said yesterday, the DC Circuit Court is \nthe AAA for the major leagues on the Supreme Court. We have been told \ntime and again by the ``great leakers'' at the White House, Miguel \nEstrada is on the fast track of the major leagues, the Supreme Court. \nWe want to know his batting average and we want to know whether he can \ntake an inside pitch. And he will not answer those questions. That \nreally calls into question whether we are meeting our responsibility.\n  As I said yesterday, the choice is simple. It is a choice between the \nConstitution, article II, section 2, which says the Senate shall advise \nand consent to nominees. It gives us a role of responsibility to advise \nand consent. Or whether we will give up this Constitution for a \nrubberstamp and just say, as the President sends his nominees, thanks a \nlot, Mr. Bush, ``approved.'' I will not do that. I don't think I was \nselected for that purpose.\n  I think the Senator from Utah is understanding better what we are \nabout. The fact Miguel Estrada has refused to disclose his writings is \nunprecedented. We have at least five illustrations, including Justice \nWilliam Rehnquist, nominated as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who \nproduced his writings so we could understand more about his thinking \nbefore he assumed the highest judicial post in America.\n  Antonin Scalia, who was called on to rule in a case involving the \ndisclosure of legal views, Antonin Scalia, absolutely the hero of the \nrightwing in American politics and of our President, when he had to \nrule on a case as to whether or not nominees would disclose their \nopinions on legal issues, the case was the Republican Party of \nMinnesota v. White, Justice Antonin Scalia said:\n\n       [E]ven if it were possible to select judges who do not have \n     preconceived views on legal issues, it would hardly be \n     desirable to do so. ``Proof that a Justice's mind at the time \n     he joined the Court was complete tabula rasa [blank slate] in \n     the area of constitutional adjudication, would be evidence of \n     lack of qualification, not lack of bias.''\n\n  So, many of us, despite this impressive resume of Miguel Estrada, \nhave fundamental questions. Is the man qualified for the job? By \nstepping back and saying, I am a blank slate, can't think of a Supreme \nCourt case I disagree with in its history, can't think of a Supreme \nCourt Justice or any Federal judge whom I admire, you wonder why we \nhave questions about him? You wonder why this extraordinary debate is \nunder way?\n  I see my colleague from New Jersey has come to the floor and I thank \nhim for joining us this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, to my colleague from Illinois, who is so \neloquent on so many issues, his articulation, a reason why it is so \nimportant we challenge this nomination, if not the nominee, because of \nthe process we have gone through, is just overwhelming. I think it is a \nbasic sense of responsibility we should have as Senators. If we do not \nask the questions on how one will respond in a jurisprudence context to \nnot specific issues but general thought process before we hire someone \nto be an appellate court judge, I don't think we are fulfilling our \nconstitutional responsibility of advise and consent.\n  Would the Senator hire someone if you had not been able to ask how \nthey may think about some of the basic processes and logic they might \nbring to bear in giving you advice with regard to legal counsel in your \noffice? It is incredible to me. No one with a blank slate would turn \nover such an important duty without doing a serious interview process \nto understand at least the thinking process of an individual.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Just to respond to my colleague from New Jersey, not only \nwould I not hire them, I would be derelict in my responsibility in \ndoing so. I think the Senator from New Jersey would agree, many times \nhe has asked prospective staff people their opinions--and may even \ndisagree with them. I, frankly, believe within my legislative staff \nthere are people who think I am wrong on some issues. That is not only \ntheir right but their responsibility to give me that point of view. But \nat least going in, that is a pretty basic question.\n\n  If we can't ask Miguel Estrada, who is seeking a lifetime appointment \nto the second highest court in the land, what is in his mind in terms \nof his values and principles when it comes to constitutional law, then \nwe have failed as Senators and we fail our constitutional \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I could not agree more with the Senator \nfrom Illinois. I have a responsibility to the people of New Jersey to \nmake sure we ask serious questions with regard to how judges are \nselected. In my own process in reviewing district court judges and \ncircuit court judges that we are asked to opine about by the White \nHouse, about how we would react, I have a bipartisan committee that \ndoes just exactly that. It sits literally for hours to make sure we \nhave some sense of the approach future judges might take, how they \nthink about issues, how they feel about constitutional principles. I \nthink this is one of the most important debates we can have with regard \nto the responsibilities of being a Senator--making sure, when we \ndetermine the people who are actually going to sit on the court with \nlifetime appointments, that we do so with the full knowledge and \nunderstanding of where they are coming from.\n  By the way, that is not to say you are going to agree with everyone \nwith regard to all aspects about how they might think about issues. But \nyou\n\n[[Page S2245]]\n\nought to at least understand what you are getting into. I certainly \nhope we will have the opportunity to review real information on this as \nwe go forward.\n\n\n                            The Bush Budget\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to make a statement \nwith respect to something I believe is vital that the American public \nget focused on. Last Monday President Bush proposed a budget to the \nAmerican people that, if it were adopted, would basically dramatically \nchange the landscape, reshape the future of our Nation in a lot of \ndifferent ways. I would like to speak about that in the context of a \nfew ideas today.\n  I hope I can come here every day, as long as is necessary, to make \nsure we raise up this, I think revolutionary document, radical \ndocument, with regard to what the shape of our economy and the shape of \nour participation of the Federal Government in our life in America is \nabout.\n  Perhaps because of its release so soon after the tragic Columbia \nshuttle tragedy, the budget has not received the public attention it \ndeserves. Frankly, we had unbelievably revealing testimony by the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve yesterday with respect to how that \nbudget fits into the overall concept of fiscal responsibility and \nfiscal prudence that is so important for Americans to understand. But \neven with that, even with such dramatic statements coming from the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, the budget has not received the \npublic's attention. I think we need to raise up the debate that is \nembedded in many of the propositions that are made in the President's \nbudget.\n  I do not think this is a run of the mill--these are the revenues, \nthese are the expenses. By the way, we are going to have a $307 billion \nbudget deficit, but that is not so important. This is a radical change \nfrom the direction that we in this country have been moving for a very \nlong time. I don't think we are talking about it in those contexts, and \nI think the American people should understand the huge implications of \nits many far-reaching proposals.\n\n  There are so many significant elements in this budget that it is \ndifficult for me to actually even know where to start. The big picture \nis clear. The Bush budget is fiscally reckless, in my view, and \nimprudent in the extreme in the macroeconomic context, and would \nsubstantially reduce the security of America's working families for \ndecades to come. I will try to go through some of that.\n  But at the biggest level, when President Bush came to office we were \nprojecting budget surpluses of $5.6 trillion over 10 years. We just \npreceded that with 3 years of budget surpluses. Since then that figure \nhas declined by almost $8 trillion. We had projected $5.64 trillion in \nsurpluses. Now in the same timeframe, until 2011, we are projecting $1 \ntrillion-plus in deficits. Where I come from in the private sector, if \nyou have an $8 trillion negative cashflow, somebody would ask some \nquestions about what is driving it, what is making such an overwhelming \ndifference in the context of our financial posture with respect to \nfiscal affairs in this country. That is extraordinary.\n  By the way, take that a step further. It was projected at the same \ntime that we were going to pay down, for all practical purposes, the \npublicly held debt of the U.S. Government. That was in 2001, early \n2001--going down to $36 billion.\n  Today, out to 2008, we are expecting a $5 trillion publicly held \ndebt. That is extraordinary. That is an extraordinary amount of debt \nthat will go on, not just to be financed by current generations of \nAmericans. The view that we are not going to transfer to our kids and \nour grandkids future responsibilities to pay for what we are doing \ntoday, as we benefit from those expenditures--we are transferring it \non. That is $5 trillion.\n  By the way, it is a heavy burden not only in the debt that the \ncurrent generation is transferring to future generations, but it is \nalso an extraordinary expense. We are going from a $622 billion cost of \nour debt under the projections that were established in 2001 to, get \nthis, $2.3 trillion we are going to spend--$2.3 trillion we are going \nto spend just to finance that debt, that change in that $8 trillion \nthat comes across. That is what it is going to cost us over 10 years to \nfinance the bad fiscal policies we are taking on.\n  I don't know about most Americans, but I think they can figure out \nthat we have lots of important things in this country that we could \nspend $2.3 trillion on, relative to this $622 billion, that we would \nhave been able to spend if those changes had not occurred such as Leave \nNo Child Behind, such as making sure our health care systems are \nproperly funded, or that the Social Security trust fund is in place so \nSocial Security can be in place. And maybe most importantly, we could \nprotect Americans with something other than duct tape. We could \nactually put real protections in our ports, on our highways. We could \nmake sure that the security surrounding our chemical plants across this \ncountry was in place. There are lots of things that this country could \ndo if we had that $2.3 trillion that we are going to now give out in \ninterest expense, many of those dollars going offshore, not even to \nAmericans.\n  I think it is absolutely irresponsible that we are putting ourselves \nin a position that we are going to run the kinds of deficits we are \ntalking about. In fact, I think that was the overwhelming weight of the \nconversation we had with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board \nyesterday. If we do not get our fiscal house in order, we are going to \nput ourselves into a position where the United States is going to have \nnot just small deficits and not just $2.3 trillion worth of interest \nexpense, but we are going to see that explode in the years well beyond \nthe next decade because that is when the baby boomers retire. We will \ngo from 40 million retired Americans to 75 million retired Americans on \nMedicare and Social Security and that will put unbelievable pressures \non what we have as a nation in our fiscal responsibility.\n\n  So I find this a hard budget, at a macro level, for us to take on. I \nhope the American people can understand that we are burdening our \nchildren and our grandchildren as we go forward; that we really are \nputting at risk Medicare and Social Security as we understand it today \nas we go forward. Frankly, I think without a full discussion and \nwithout creating a full understanding in the minds of the American \npeople, we are not doing our jobs. I think it is almost a question of \nethics, about what our responsibility is to raise up this discussion so \nthose choices are understood by the American people and not buried in \nsome document of hundreds and hundreds of pages of numbers that really \ndo not translate into the practical impact that the individuals need.\n  I go back to it again. It is basic economics.\n  We have had an $8 trillion swing in the cashflow of this government. \nThere is no one I know who would think that is a positive way for us to \napproach the financial management of this country.\n  To carry on with slightly more detail, as economists would say, this \nbudget calls for a dramatic reduction in national savings. When you are \nborrowing all this money, that money isn't going into the private \nsector. It isn't going into areas of productivity and growth in this \ncountry.\n  That is what we saw happen in the 1990s. We saw 22.5 million new jobs \ncreated, and we saw productivity rise from very low levels to the kind \nof high levels that are driving the successes of the economy in the \nlate 1990s and continue to be the only really positive element we see \nin the economy today.\n  When you have that capital going off to the Federal Government, it \nmeans less capital to be available to invest in plant and equipment and \nless capital to implant new technologies and new inventions, and to do \nresearch and medical advances. The end result almost inevitably will be \nlower economic growth in the future, if you carry those kinds of debt \nburdens into the future. That is not a conclusion based on partisanship \nor ideology. It is economics 101. Less savings means less investment \nwhich means lower growth.\n  It is just that those are the truisms defined by the basic laws of \neconomics. Less savings means less investment which means lower growth.\n  By the way, when you are borrowing money at the $8 trillion level at \nthe Federal Government, you are having less savings.\n  That is just by definition. I guess that is why the 10 Nobel \neconomists\n\n[[Page S2246]]\n\nyesterday put out the statement they thought we were on the wrong track \nwith regard to our fiscal policy; that we were putting ourselves into a \ngrave position with regard to our longrun fiscal structure. It is \nabsolutely essential, in my view, that we stand back and get hold of \nthe budget mess I think we are putting in place, if we go forward.\n  Unfortunately, many administration officials have lately been denying \nthe laws of economics, as far as I can tell, dismissing the importance \nof fiscal discipline. As OMB Director Mitch Daniels put it, while we \nhave returned to an era of deficits, ``We ought not hyperventilate \nabout this issue.''\n  I guess we are just taking off the board all that discussion about \nbalanced budget amendments, the No. 1 issue, and the Contract With \nAmerica, all that discussion we had through the 1990s, all that \ndiscussion that the private sector has tried to impart to the public \nsector; that there really is competition for funds out in the \nmarketplace; that deficits really do drive up long-term interest rates \nwhich, by the way, Chairman Greenspan once again reiterated very \nclearly and unequivocally yesterday; and that we hear consistent \nconversation about deficits do not matter to the investment function of \nthe economy.\n  It is hard to believe we are so blind to the fundamentals of \neconomics. Supply and demand do matter. When there is demand for the \ncredit in the marketplace for the Federal Government, it does impact on \nthe private sector and the savings function.\n  Comments like these--the one about hyperventilating about deficits--\nmake it seem like we are living in a strange twilight zone, in my view.\n  As I said, we just came through a heavy period of discussion--\nactually before I got into political life--about amending the United \nStates Constitution to establish a rigid Balanced Budget Act. I do not \nknow where that discussion went. I guess we had a change of heart and a \nchange of mind at some particular point. But it really is hard for me \nto understand. I almost find it humorous, although I don't, really.\n\n  We hear comments with regard to my Democratic colleagues that we are \nconcerned about rising deficits. One of the leaders in the House \ndismissed the importance of fiscal discipline, arguing that ``The \nSoviet Union had a balanced budget.''\n  I am not exactly how sure that fits into the overall structure of our \ndebate. But I think it demonstrates we are making so light of this $8 \ntrillion--I repeat, $8 trillion--negative cashflow swing this \ngovernment is now burdening our people with. It is serious.\n  I come from a part of the world where you can tolerate some negative \nincome for a short period of team, but, after a while, you go bankrupt. \nIt undermines the reality of your financial success. It will for our \nGovernment. It may not go bankrupt, but we will be living with higher \ninterest rates than we need be, and we will be losing the ability to \nsee our private sector invest appropriately and basic saving functions \nas defined by economics.\n  Think about it. Perhaps the most powerful Member of the other body, \nin effect, was comparing fiscal discipline to a failed regime on how \noperations work.\n  I am really troubled about how light we are making this issue of our \nfiscal responsibility.\n  Why are the administration and its supporters abandoning fiscal \ndiscipline? Quite simply because their overriding priority is to \nprovide huge new tax breaks to those who are doing the best, I guess. \nThere is no other basis of understanding. It looks to me like political \npolicy as opposed to economic policy.\n  Let us look at these tax breaks. As many of my Democratic colleagues \nhave pointed out, they would provide relatively few benefits to working \nAmericans. But, more importantly, they would do virtually nothing to \ncreate jobs or stimulate our economy. In fact, the Bush plan could well \ncost jobs, and I believe very clearly it is bordering on antigrowth. \nThat is true for at least four reasons I would like to expand on.\n  First, very simple, very little impact of that initiative the \nPresident has laid out--less than 5 percent of the growth package--\nwould kick in right away in 2003, and very little of it in 2004. Most \nof its impact would be delayed into the future, undermining the long-\nterm structure of our fiscal health, but doing little for the current \npackage.\n  By the way, those 10 Nobel economists yesterday also talked about \ntemporary, short-term stimulus was needed to create demand in our \neconomy--create demand now so we can pump-prime the economy and help \nget it going. And then we will see the growth of revenues be the basis \nof how we reestablish the cashflow to the Federal Government.\n  By the way, we don't need to have all of these long-term cash cuts \nunless you are going to do it in a tax reform package. And, by the way, \nI totally agree with Chairman Greenspan. Double taxation on dividends \nis a bad idea. It ought to be done from a comprehensive, revenue-\nneutral position of tax reform. No one would argue there is very little \nin tax difference. But it ought to be done with a comprehensive set of \ntax reforms. The American people understand that. They understand \ncompanies are paying only about one half of what they report on their \nincome statements to the public when they try to sell their stock as \ntaxable income. They are doing all kinds of things--some legitimate, \nsome not so legitimate--to try to shelter income.\n  We need to have a reform package that actually works--to raise \nrevenues but also to make sure we don't have inhibition on American \nbusiness in formation of capital such as taxes on dividends. But it \nought to be on a comprehensive, revenue-neutral basis.\n  I think most people, when they are honest and step back, will see the \nlogic of that. Certainly the American people do.\n  Second, the President's tax proposals provide, as I said, most of the \nbenefit for those at the very highest incomes. These are the people \nleast likely to spend a tax break. I think a better approach, as I have \nadvocated with Senator Landrieu--and as Senator McCain talked about a \n``payroll tax holiday''--would target tax relief to middle-class \nworking Americans who need help.\n  By the way, I happen to think this ``payroll tax holiday'' and what \nSenator Landrieu and I talked about is really fundamental to how we can \nstimulate the economy today. Three out of four Americans pay more in \npayroll taxes than they do in income taxes. It is also the people who \nare stretched the hardest in trying to keep their budget together at \nhome. By the way, individuals have to balance their budgets. So it is \nnot exactly like they can walk away from running their debts up. We can \ndo that in the Federal Government, but you cannot do that at the \nindividual level. Otherwise, your creditors will come and see you and \nsay it is time for you to sell your house.\n\n  Third, the Bush plan to exempt most dividend income from taxation \nwould have the effect of taking cash off the balance sheets of American \ncorporations. That would mean less money to invest in plants and \nequipment and less money to hire new workers and retain old ones. In \nother words, it will depress the economy further as opposed to \nstimulating it.\n  If you want to deal with double taxation on dividends, you do it at \nthe corporate level. It might not be as politically attractive, but it \nwould certainly be more rational that you would treat dividends as the \nequivalent of interest, and it would allow for the basic judgment of \ncorporations as to whether they wanted to invest, pay dividends, hire \nnew workers, or do whatever the economic, advantageous element of \nmanaging their business is about. But if you take the cash off the \nbalance sheet, and pay it out in dividends, because you have an \nincentive to do that, you end up with far less of an incentive to grow \nthe economy. And, in fact, you may very well get an incentive to stifle \ngrowth in the economy. I think it is very dangerous.\n  Finally, whatever stimulative impact--and very few people think it is \nsignificant at all--the budget would have in the short-term, it is \nlikely to be offset by those higher long-term rates, as projected \nfuture deficits shoot through the roof.\n  I know the administration likes to claim there is no connection \nbetween deficits and interest rates, as I suggested, but the economic \nevidence is overwhelming that expectations of future deficits--that is, \nmore Government competition for a limited pool of\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\ncapital--almost inevitably leads to higher interest rates.\n  It was actually refreshing yesterday at the Senate Banking Committee \nto hear someone--who I do not necessarily always see eye to eye with, \nwith respect to economic policy--make a clear and unequivocal statement \nthat deficits do matter with respect to interest rates and the \nperformance of the economy, and particularly with respect to the \nperformance of the investment activities of this Nation. This is, \nagain, simple supply and demand. If you have $8 trillion worth of \ndeficits that you would not have had otherwise--or $5 trillion--it is \ngoing to compete with the private sector for capital. That, ultimately, \nis going to have something to do with the shape of our economy in the \nfuture, and it is absolutely the most important element of the savings \nfunction in the country.\n  So the administration's tax breaks, in my view, for all of those \nreasons, are antigrowth as much as they are anything else. Again, I \nreemphasize that I think it is a political proposal, not an economic \none. They have the effect of starving the Government of resources \nneeded to protect the security of working families, while we are \nbasically rewarding those who I think are doing reasonably well.\n  The last I checked, in the 1990s, people did pretty well \neconomically. There were more millionaires made in the 1990s, while we \nwere creating 22.5 million jobs than I think we are doing so far in the \nnew century. I wonder why it is that we think we need to have all these \nstructural changes when, in fact, if we just get some demand going, \ntaking up some of that overhang of excess production we have in our \ncountry, that we could get going.\n  There are, though, some issues in this budget that go beyond these \nmacroeconomic issues. And they are really important. I do not want to \nmake light of them in and of themselves.\n  I think budget deficits and whether you have a stimulus program or \ngrowth program are all fair questions, but are we going to continue as \na nation to participate in helping protect the security of working \nfamilies, protect the security of Americans everywhere?\n  I think what is really radical about this budget is that it is \nbeginning the process to undermine whether we are really going to \nprovide that kind of support. Because we have to make choices, we are \ngoing to have to make choices whether we are going to run those \ndeficits, driven in at least a significant part by the kinds of tax \ncuts we have, or whether we are going to retain some of those resources \nto be able to invest in the security of working families.\n  I will take a few examples from the President's budget.\n  First, the budget fails to provide funds that are badly needed to \nprotect our Nation against the threat of terrorism. This is maybe the \nmost important domestic issue. While there is some funding for some \nhomeland security programs, we have really turned our back on a lot of \nthe critical priorities, such as port security and border patrols.\n  I heard today that actually we will have fewer people at border \ncrossings, based on this budget, than we had prior to 9/11. I just \nvisited the New York/New Jersey Port a weekend ago. The fact is, we are \ninspecting less than 2 percent--less than 2 percent--and that has not \nchanged. We have been using that same number in debates on the floor of \nthe Senate. It was not changed in our port at all.\n  The resources are not being made available to check containers, and \nwe are doing nothing to improve the safety and security of the American \npeople--certainly the people in New Jersey and New York--with regard to \nour ports. We are doing nothing with regard to improving the security \nsurrounding our chemical production facilities in this country. And all \nthis just keeps going on and on, without putting our money where our \nmouth is with regard to homeland security. We talk about it as our top \npriority, and we do not put the resources with it.\n  Time and time again, we have asked to try to increase the budget \nappropriations in this area and have not been able to do it. I think \nmaybe it is the most important domestic issue. It is certainly on the \nminds of the people of New Jersey, and I suspect it is for most \nAmericans.\n  Second, the budget reneges on the President's promise to provide a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit for our seniors. Instead, the \nadministration, in effect, forces millions of seniors to drop their own \ndoctor and move to a private sector approach in order to secure a \nprescription drug. It moves away from fee-for-service plans. This \namounts to a backdoor attempt, in my view, to privatize Medicare.\n  We have not seen all the details, so it is a little hard to be as \nspecific as I would like to be, but I have to tell you, if it is \nanything similar to the headlines we have heard in the State of the \nUnion speech, there are a lot of us who are going to fight this tooth \nand nail. This is not the promise we have given to the individuals who \nhave been paying payroll taxes for years and years with the expectation \nthere will be a serious Medicare benefit at the end of the day. As you \nknow, if anybody does any analysis, not only are the payroll taxes that \ngo to Social Security being used to finance tax cuts for those who are \nalready doing well, we are now using payroll taxes for Medicare to also \ndo that. And we have gone through all those numbers. It is very hard to \nunderstand how we are putting this together.\n\n  Many of my constituents say: What is going on with those payroll \ntaxes that we are paying every day? We go to work with the expectation \nthat we are going to get Medicare benefits and Social Security benefits \nat the end of the day when we retire. It is really wrong, and I hope, \nas we discuss this budget, that becomes clear and more clear to the \nAmerican public.\n  Third, the budget process proposes to gut health care coverage for \nthe most disadvantaged Americans. Under the administration's plan, \nGovernors, in effect, would be--I was going to say bribed--encouraged \nto leave the current Medicaid system and move to an alternative that \nprobably would end up with poor and disabled Americans losing coverage.\n  I tell you, I know in New Jersey that we have to cut the number of \npeople who are accessing this, particularly kids in the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, because we do not have the resources to be \nable to deal with bringing them into these programs which have long \nbeen something that has provided broader health care.\n  There is big, bipartisan support for a concept around here called \nStart Healthy, Stay Healthy, which is to bring prenatal care to a lot \nof our less economically enabled citizens. And it is through the \nMedicaid system and State programs. We are having to cut all of those \nkinds of programs because the resources are not available.\n  I have to ask--anyone has to ask--is that what the administration \nmeans by ``compassionate conservatism''?\n  I could go on and on with the misplaced priorities, from my point of \nview, of the administration's budget: Its underfunding or complete \nelimination of so many education programs, including afterschool care; \nits cuts in environmental protection--the riders included in the \nomnibus bill that is coming over which doesn't have to do with the 2004 \nbudget, is a mind-boggling way to legislate environmental laws--its \nabandonment of a program to put police officers on the streets, the \nCOPS program--there are law enforcement officials who are enraged about \ntheir ability to continue to protect the public; again, it sort of \nrelates to homeland security--its cuts for children's health insurance; \nits abolition of the HOPE VI homeownership initiative, which is one of \nthe great programmatic efforts to try to get people to buy into their \ncommunities, to be a part of the community, a whole host of other \nhousing programs.\n  I could go on, and I probably will as the days go on, because these \nissues need to be identified in the mind of the American public. This \nis a budget that is changing the shape of what the role of the Federal \nGovernment is. Maybe that is what people want. Maybe they don't want \nafterschool programs for kids. Maybe they don't want the COPS programs. \nMaybe they don't want Leave No Child Behind underfunded. Maybe they do \nwant it underfunded. Maybe they want no increase in affordable housing. \nMaybe they don't want them, but we ought to tell them what they are \ngetting as opposed to piling it up into a whole host of numbers and \ncovering it up with other things that\n\n[[Page S2248]]\n\ndon't make it clear why we are doing what we are doing.\n  I also want to talk about the administration's proposal to \nfundamentally change the tax treatment of investment income, another \narea where--a little bit of my background--it strikes me as really \ndebilitating to the longrun fiscal posture of this country. I know \nproposals to allow sheltering of investment income sound attractive to \nmany. I used to promote a few of them myself. I think we all agree \nabout the value of expanding opportunities for all Americans to save, \nto better prepare for retirement. But when you look at the \nadministration's proposal, it has little to do with promoting \nretirement security for working families.\n  In fact, there are a whole series of these. For most Americans, these \nproposals are much more likely to undermine retirement security, and \nthey will apply to a very narrow segment of American retirees or future \nretirees. Most Americans are not using all the tax-supported programs \nwe have today. They are only using about 25 percent of them, if memory \nserves. And these programs will drain resources critical to the Federal \nbudget to protect Social Security and Medicare in the future--again, as \nwe go from 40 million retired seniors to 75 million. They represent a \ndramatic shift in the tax burden, a redistribution of wealth, to speak \nbluntly, to the benefit of those who have substantial investment income \nand to the detriment of people who depend on wages and support \nthemselves and, by the way, pay payroll taxes.\n  Once again, those people who are paying payroll taxes are funding tax \nbreaks in the income tax system--really hard to understand.\n  These new tax proposals are not merely radical in their \nredistribution of the tax burden, they are fiscally irresponsible and \nreckless in the context of our overall budget situation. There are a \nfew elements of this program that need the light of day. They need the \nfocus of the American people, whether it is homeland security, taking \ncare of our kids' educational system, our health care, but probably \nmost important, the longrun ability to fulfill the promise of Social \nSecurity and Medicare. That is what this debate is about. Are we really \ngoing to have the resources to do the kinds of things the American \npeople have been promised?\n\n  It is not enough to say: We don't want to do this. We have promised \nthe American people they will at the end of the day have their Social \nSecurity benefits, guaranteed benefits. We need to make sure we have \nthe fiscal structure that is in place that allows that to happen.\n  This budget will not allow for that to take place. It needs lots of \ndebate from the American people, lots of debate by the Senate, and a \nlot of debate in general until we get to a conclusion that is a long \nway from where we are starting.\n  There is too much at risk here, too many jobs in the first instance, \ntoo much in the longrun investment in our economy, to grow our \nproductivity, too much investment to protect the American people with \nregard to homeland security and the war on terrorism, too much risk \nwith regard to health care and disparities, the ability to provide a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit to seniors, too much at risk with \nregard to Social Security.\n  I hope we can truly flush out what the choices are being made through \nthe context of this budget.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak. It will be one of many times I \nwould like to come to the Chamber to make sure the American people \nunderstand we have a radical reshaping of America's priorities through \nthis budget. Frankly, it is a political statement, not an economic \nprogram. Nothing less than the future of our country is at stake. We \nneed a real and serious debate about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a number on the other side, in the majority, \nhave lamented the fact that to get this man, Miguel Estrada, approved \nto be a circuit judge, it is going to take 60 votes. They ask, why \ncan't we just have an up-or-down vote? Both Senators from Utah have \ntalked about that today. Senator Bennett indicated it would be a \ntremendous change if we required 60 votes for Mr. Estrada. There are \ncartoons around the country today in support of our position--cartoons \nthat have indicated nominees are coming through here and no one is \nasking any questions that are answered, and that there should be some \nanswers forthcoming. But the issue is that in fact Mr. Estrada hasn't \nanswered many important questions. That is one of the big problems.\n  I found my colleagues' remarks very curious, lamenting the idea that \nit would take 60 votes to approve Mr. Estrada's nomination. They have \nlamented this, but I find this interesting because when President \nClinton sat in the White House, his nominations were subject to \nanonymous holds by one or more Senators. Many were not provided \nhearings. Many were provided no votes. That is, rather than needing at \nleast 41 votes to delay or block consideration of a nominee, \nRepublicans allowed one Senator or a handful to block many of President \nClinton's judicial nominees from getting hearings or votes.\n  Mr. President, I have a list of nominees, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Clinton Judicial Nominees Not Confirmed in Congress First Nominated\n\n\n(31 Circuit/48 district--59 of these never allowed votes by Republican-\n                           controlled senate)\n\n   31 circuit court nominees (22 blocked from getting vote or being \n                               confirmed)\n\n       Merrick Garland, D.C.

Thomas Thrash, District Court. \n     Cheryl Wattley, District Court, never given a vote by \n     Republicans/not confirmed. Wenona Whitfield, District Court, \n     never given a vote by Republicans/not confirmed. Ronnie \n     White, District Court, never confirmed by floor vote. \n     Frederic Woocher, District Court, never given a vote by \n     Republicans/not confirmed.\n\n  Mr. REID. They had mysterious holds and were not provided with votes \nof any kind and were simply not allowed to have their matters brought \nbefore the Senate. We would have liked the opportunity to even see if \nwe could have stopped a filibuster, if that was what they wanted, but \nthey simply would not bring them forward.\n  I will name a few circuit court nominees. Out of 31 submitted who \nwere not confirmed in the first Congress they were nominated, 22 were \nblocked by the Republicans from ever being confirmed. Allen Snyder, DC \nCircuit, never given a vote by Republicans, certainly not confirmed; \nElena Kagen, DC Circuit, never given a vote by the Republicans; Robert \nCindrich, Third Circuit, never given a vote; Steven Orlofsky, Third \nCircuit, never given a vote; Robert Raymar, Third Circuit, never given \na vote; James Beatty, Fourth Circuit, never given a vote by the \nRepublicans; Andre Davis, Fourth Circuit, never given a vote; Elizabeth \nGibson, Fourth Circuit, never given a vote by the Republicans; Roger \nGregory, Fourth Circuit, never given a vote by the Republicans, but \nfinally, Mr. President, because President Clinton, in a recess \nappointment, appointed him, as a sitting judge, he was eventually \nconfirmed; J. Richard Leonard, Fourth Circuit, never given a vote by \nthe Republicans; James Wynn, Fourth Circuit, never given a vote by the \nRepublicans; H. Alston Johnson, Fifth Circuit, never given a vote by \nthe Republicans; Enrique Moreno--a Latino nominee--never given a vote \nby the Republicans; Jorge Rangel, Fifth Circuit, never given a vote--he \nis also Hispanic--Eric Clay, Sixth Circuit, and nothing happened with \nhim; Kent Markus, Sixth Circuit, never given a vote by the Republicans; \nKathleen McCree Lewis, Sixth Circuit never given a vote; Helene White, \nSixth Circuit, never given a vote; Bonnie Campbell, Eighth Circuit, \nnever given a vote; James Duffy, never given a vote; Barry Goode, Ninth \nCircuit, never given a vote; and Christine Arguello and James Lyons, \nTenth Circuit, never given a vote.\n  I just note that Helene White waited more than 1,500 days, never to \nbe allowed a hearing or a vote. Richard Paez waited more than 1,500 \ndays, but there is good news there: He was finally confirmed. I spoke \nto that good man on a number of occasions during his time in ``legal \nlimbo,'' or wherever he was, never being given a vote. But, finally, he \nhad a hearing and he was confirmed after more than 1,500 days, more \nthan 4 years.\n  Mr. President, we submitted 48 district court nominees who were \nblocked in the first Congress they were nominated, and 37 were blocked \nfrom ever getting a vote or being confirmed. So for my friends to \nlament the fact that we are in the light of day, where we have told \neverybody here we are not going to allow Miguel Estrada to be confirmed \nunless he submits to proper questioning--I should not say proper \nquestioning, how about proper answers--and unless we are allowed to \nreview the Solicitor's memoranda that have been given to us on other \noccasions and unless he is forthcoming in answers to questions.\n  These are not anonymous holds. We are telling the world that we will \nnot allow Miguel Estrada to become a DC Circuit Court judge unless he \ndoes that. If he doesn't do that, the majority leader has three \noptions: Pull the nomination, go forward to invoke cloture, or have \nthis on the floor forever, which is something--boy, they are really \ngiving it to us tonight. They are going to make us work late.\n  That is what the leader said. We are going to work late. I said \neverything has been said about Miguel Estrada, just not everyone has \nsaid it. So we are going to have other people come and say the same \nthings that have been said by approximately 20 Senators, and they will \ntry to say it a little differently, but everything has been said.\n  If the majority leader wants to take the time of the Senate and go \nforward on this nomination, not trying to invoke cloture, then that is \nhis prerogative. He runs the floor. But there is other business we need \nto do. I know the omnibus bill should be here tomorrow. There are other \njudges we could approve perhaps. We approved three on Monday including \nJudge James Otero of California. So there is other business that could \nbe done, but if he wants to have us stay late and keep talking about \nthis person--we on this side believe there is a problem, and we feel it \nis our constitutional prerogative and duty to ask questions and have \nthem answered.\n  When we have someone who has a track record like this, where there is \nnot much in the way of legal information other than some cases he \nhandled, we should be able to review his legal memoranda he wrote when \nhe was a member of the Solicitor General's Office.\n  There were 48 district court nominees who did not get through the \nSenate in the Congress first nominated; 37 were blocked from getting a \nvote or being confirmed:\n  Steven Achelpohl, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; \nJoseph Bataillon, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; \nSteven Bell, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; John \nBingler, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; David \nCercone, district court--once in a while there is some good news. David \nwas not given a vote but eventually was confirmed.\n  Patricia Coan, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; \nJeffrey Colman, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; \nValerie Couch, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; \nLegrome Davis, district court, never given a vote by Republicans \nfinally allowed a vote once Democrats became the majority; Rhonda \nFields, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; S. David \nFineman, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; Robert \nFreedberg, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; Dolly \nGee, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; Melvin Hall, \ndistrict court, never given a vote by Republicans; Marian Johnston, \ndistrict court, never given a vote by Republicans; Richard Lazzara, \ndistrict court, never given a vote by Republicans; J. Rich Leonard, \ndistrict court, never given a vote by Republicans; Stephen Lieberman, \ndistrict court, never given a vote by Republicans; James Klein, \ndistrict court, never given a vote by Republicans; John Lim, district \ncourt, never given a vote by Republicans; Harry Litman, district court, \nnever given a vote by Republicans; Frank McCarthy, district court, \nnever given a vote by Republicans; Sue Myerscough, district court, \nnever given a vote by Republicans; Lynette Norton, district court, \nnever given a vote by Republicans; Virginia\n\n[[Page S2250]]\n\nPhillips, district court, never given a vote by Republicans; Linda \nRiegle, district court, never given a vote by Republicans. This is very \nfamiliar to me because she is a bankruptcy judge from Nevada, still \nserving on the bankruptcy court. I nominated her. It simply did not \nmove forward. I had a couple judges who did move forward and was very \nhappy about that. Senator Hatch allowed me to move those nominations.\n  Anabelle Rodriguez, district court, never given a vote by \nRepublicans; Michael Schattman, district court, never given a vote by \nRepublicans; Gary Sebelius, district court, never given a vote by \nRepublicans; Kenneth Simon, district court, never given a vote by \nRepublicans; Clarence Sundram, district court, never given a vote by \nRepublicans; Cheryl Wattley, district court, never given a vote by \nRepublicans; Wenona Whitfield, district court, never given a vote by \nRepublicans; Ronnie White, this is a fine man. He was defeated in a \nsurprise strict party-line vote, but his nomination at least was done \nin the light of day, and I appreciate that. That is better than all \nthese anonymous holds and nothing never happens.\n  Frederick Woocher, district court, never given a vote by Republicans.\n  My friend, and he is my friend, Senator Bennett from Utah, a \nneighboring State--I have great admiration for him. He comes from a \nwonderful family. His father served in the Senate. He was very \nhonorable. His wife is a friend. She is quite a musician. So I have \nonly good thoughts about my friend, Senator Bennett, but I do say to \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah that he should not come here and \ntalk about what a terrible thing it is for us to require that Mr. \nEstrada answer these questions and submit the memos. This is something \nwe are doing openly. We are not trying to hide what is happening in any \nway.\n  I want to say one thing, I wanted to say it to him before he left the \nfloor this morning, that I have been very honored to serve in the \nSenate. It is something I never dreamed could happen. I am every day \naware of what an honor it is to serve in the Senate, and to serve with \nother Senators is an honor for me. This is unique.\n  The two Senators from Vermont are in the Chamber. One just walked in. \nThe senior Senator from Vermont has been in the Senate approximately 30 \nyears, and I have watched a magician--I say that in the most positive \nsense--perform his duties. I have the honor of serving with a senior \nmember on the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee. I have so much admiration and respect for the work \nhe does. He has been so fair. When people were saying, Don't do this, \nthe senior Senator from Vermont stepped above the political fray and \ndid what was right on many judges.\n  I have come to the Chamber many times telling the Senator what a good \njob he has done, but I have not done it recently. I want the Senator to \nknow the people of Vermont are so well served by his public service. \nThe Senator from Vermont could go anyplace in America and make a \nfortune, literally, because of his legal skills and his experience in \nthe Senate, but he has taken the more difficult path, and that is \nserving the Senate because of his love of public service.\n  The people of Vermont are well served, but so are the people of \nNevada. The people of Nevada benefit every day from the service of the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  I am very grateful he is here helping us--not helping us, this is his \ncommittee. He is leading us on this most important matter to bring \nabout some direction and responsiveness to the process which we are now \ngoing forward with.\n  I see the other Senator from Vermont who is such a fine man. I want \nhim to know how much I respect his service to the country, especially \nthe work he does on the Environment and Public Works Committee. The \nenvironment is better because of the junior Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank my dear friend, the senior \nSenator from Nevada, for his comments. We have served together for a \nlong time, as he said, on the Appropriations Committee. I have been in \nthe Senate with several hundred Senators. I have been fortunate. Like \nthe Senator from Nevada, I never knew I was going to be a Senator. I \ngrew up in Montpelier, the State's capital. It had only 8,500 people. I \nlived almost diagonally across from the Statehouse.\n  I remember as a child, probably about 4 years old, riding my tricycle \nthrough the halls of the Statehouse delivering newspapers to the \nGovernor, playing on the Statehouse lawn, sliding in the snow. Suddenly \none day, at the age of 34, I was being sworn in as a Senator and I \nthink what a thrill it was. I was the junior most member of the Senate, \nbut then I realized the best part of it is the people you get to know \nand serve with.\n  Nobody has been more of a help, a mentor, a conscience for me, than \nthe Senator from Nevada. Every morning when I come to work I look at \nthe Capitol and I think this is a nation of 260 to 270 million \nAmericans, so diverse, and there are only 100 of us who get a chance to \nserve at any given time. Only 100 Americans get a chance to serve and \nrepresent the whole country. Out of that 100, only 4 get to be the \nleaders of their party, the Republican leader and the deputy Republican \nleader, the Democratic leader, the deputy Democratic leader.\n  I have served with a number of them, but I would say the Senator from \nNevada, Senator Harry Reid, is one of the most extraordinary leaders \nthe Senate has ever had. He has kept the old-fashioned virtue that was \ndrilled into me by the first leader I knew, Senator Mike Mansfield. \nSenator Mansfield said, whatever you do--and this is far more important \nthan how you vote--always keep your word.\n  No Senator has a higher reputation for integrity and truth-telling \nthan the Senator from Nevada, and that means a lot to me. I do \nappreciate the way he has watched the floor and brought dignity and \nrespect to this debate. I admire him for it because, just as with the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, we all bring different experiences to \nthe Senate. We all have different reasons for being here and we all \nhave different life experiences.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer was a war hero. After serving, he \nbegan a business. He gained great experience in that field in his home \nState of Nebraska, and then he came to the Senate.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nevada, of whom I was speaking, had \nvaried experiences before coming to the Senate. He was a trial lawyer, \na boxer, and a state official in Nevada. He even served as a Capitol \npolice officer back in the days when many times they were chosen by the \nSenators of the congressional delegation from the particular State. All \nof these experiences of his he has brought to the Senate.\n  Many times I have asked the distinguished Presiding Officer questions \non military matters, not having had the experience of serving in the \nmilitary. Considering how close he came to ending his life in Vietnam, \nthe country has benefited by the fact he was there. I know as a result \nof his life being spared, I had the opportunity to gain another close \nand dear friend in the Senate.\n  There are a few observations I would like to make before I go into \nthe discussion I had earlier with both of the Senators from Utah about \nthe administration's refusal to allow Senators to examine Mr. Estrada's \nwritings--which, incidentally, is an unfortunate situation because Mr. \nEstrada told me and other members of the committee on both sides of the \naisle he is perfectly willing to share and discuss his writings. He \npersonally had no objection to his writings, his memos, his suggestions \nin the Department of Justice and elsewhere to be made public. He would \nhave no objection to answering questions based upon what he wrote but, \nas he said, and he was very honest about this, the administration had \ntold him he could not.\n\n  Mr. Estrada said the administration told him he could not, which in \nitself is too bad because when this matter has come up many times \nbefore in history in connection with nominations for lifetime \nappointments as well as for short-term appointments, past \nadministrations, Democratic and Republican, have allowed memoranda by \nDepartment of Justice attorneys to be examined by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n\n[[Page S2251]]\n\n  I make this point speaking as one Senator, if Mr. Estrada were \nforthright and responsive to questions of Senators and if the \nadministration sent these writings up and allowed Mr. Estrada to \ndiscuss them and answer questions about them--something Mr. Estrada \nhimself has said he is perfectly willing to do--I may not like the \ncandid and responsive answers, I may disagree with what is in the \nwritings, but at that point I feel the questions have been answered, \nassuming he is forthcoming and we have the material, so then let us go \nahead and vote for him or against him. But when my colleagues are going \nto vote for somebody on one of the most important courts in the \ncountry, at least we should do it knowing what is in the record and \nhaving meaningful, not evasive, answers to questions about his judicial \nphilosophy, his views, and his feelings about legal decisions.\n  Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents have faced this \nquestion before. President Reagan, President Carter, and other \nPresidents did, and the material was forthcoming and the Senate then \nwent on to make a decision based on what they knew about the nominees. \nThis is the best way to do it.\n  Before I discuss this precedent in more detail, I would like to note \nthat this morning we had our third hearing in 2 weeks on the Judiciary \nCommittee. This included the 16th nominee to receive a hearing, the \nfifth nominee to a circuit court in just two weeks. That is interesting \nbecause when a Democrat was President, the same Judiciary Committee \nchairman often took until the summer before having a hearing for these \nmany nominees, especially this many circuit court nominees, many of \nwhom have controversial or divisive records.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Utah on the floor. When \nhe was chairman under a Democratic President, when the Democrat was \nmaking the nominations to the courts, it often took until the summer to \nhave hearings for this many nominees, especially circuit court \nnominees. We are talking about having hearings for five circuit court \nnominee hearings by early February.\n  In 1996, the Republican chairman did not hold hearings for five \ncircuit court nominees all year. Of course, it was a Democrat \nPresident. Actually, no circuit court nominees were confirmed that \nyear, and none of the four who were allowed a hearing were confirmed \nduring that entire year.\n  In 1997, when President Clinton had been in office now on his fifth \nyear, we did not reach this number if circuit court nominees getting a \nhearing until September. Now the Committee has done it in just 2 weeks. \nIt is interesting because there have been questions of partisanship. \nNow the Senate Judiciary Committee does in 2 weeks with a Republican \nPresident, with the same chairman, what took 9 months--more than 35 \nweeks--to do with a Democratic President.\n  I think that sort of demonstrates what the partisanship is. In fact, \nthere is a nomination hearing being held this morning for a seat that \nhas been vacant since 1999. One part of me says good, it is about time \nwe have had a hearing for that vacancy, but President Clinton nominated \ntwo people to that vacancy. This was to the Court of Appeals for the \nTenth Circuit. One is the Honorable James Lyons who was blocked for \npartisan political reasons. There was an anonymous hold on the \nRepublican side.\n  I mention this because also coincidentally we hear a lot about \nsomebody getting the highest rating from the American Bar Association, \nactually from a screening committee which is now headed by a close \nfriend and supporter of President Bush's. This nominee of President \nClinton's had the highest rating possible. He could have easily been \nconfirmed, but anonymous holds, not open holds but anonymous holds, on \nthe Republican side stopped it. He was not even allowed a hearing or a \nvote in the committee. So the President nominated a second person, \nChristine Arguello, a Latina nominee. She had bipartisan support. She \nwas supported by both her home State Senators. One would think she \nwould get at least a hearing or a vote in the committee. No. A number \nof people were nominated after her and were given hearings and votes, \nbut this Hispanic American woman was not. Under Republican control of \nthe Senate, Professor Arguello was not even given a hearing, to say \nnothing about a vote.\n\n  Regarding the document request related to Mr. Estrada's nomination, \nhe has told both Senator Hatch and myself, as well as several Members \nof the Senate, that he is perfectly willing to show us his writings and \nrespond to them and answer questions about them, but he has been told \nby the administration that he cannot; the administration, however, \nwould review those writings. They are the only ones who know whether \nthis direct evidence of his views, the interpretation of law, is \naccurate or misleading--they are the only ones who have access to it \nand they say, basically: Trust us. In carrying out your constitutional \nduties of advise and consent: Trust us. Give someone a lifetime \nappointment of one of the most important posts in the country: Trust \nus.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that one point? I have some new \ninformation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will yield on the basis that I will be allowed to retain \nthe floor, to which I know the Senator from Utah does not object, and I \nwant to continue then. Because of my deep respect and quarter century \nof friendship with the distinguished Senator from Utah, I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. And we do have mutual friendship.\n  I have done some checking on this, and I thought I would bring it do \nthe attention of the Senator. They tell me at the White House that they \nhave never, the Justice Department has never given out these materials \nrequested by the Democrats--not in the Bork case, not in any other \ncase.\n  Now, in the Bork case they did give materials that pertained to his \ndismissal of Archibald Cox during Watergate, specific materials, but \nnot a widespread fishing expedition. And there is a reason they do not \nwant to give these documents up--because they are privileged, they are \na work product of the Solicitor General's Office, they are crucial to \nthe Solicitor General's Office functioning well.\n  I bring that to my friend's attention because the arguments that have \nbeen brought up have been not persuasive, they are not accurate, and \nfrankly in the other people beside Judge Bork, there is no record at \nall that the Justice Department ever gave those documents to those \npeople. Somebody may have leaked them, but the Justice Department did \nnot give them.\n  I thank the Senator. I just wanted to tell the Senator that I think \nthis is a red herring.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Retaining my right to the floor, I ask the Senator from \nUtah to hear my speech because it may be that whoever he talked to at \nthe White House may be new or may not be aware of this.\n  Here are some of the memos past White Houses have provided us. They \nare still in the files here. They are pretty extensive. Included in \nthis large volume are some of the same memos written by attorneys to \nthen-Solicitor General Bork, as well as memos related to the \nnominations of Justice William Rehnquist to be Chief Justice, of \nBradford Reynolds, the Reagan Associate Attorney General for Civil \nRights to be Associate Attorney General and other nominees to short-\nterm or lifetime appointments.\n\n  I really do want to finish my speech, and I think that then the \nSenator from Utah will understand what is going on--with Mr. Reynolds, \nMr. Benjamin Civiletti, in his nomination to become Attorney General, \nand other past nominees. I will not put them in the Record now, but if \nmy friend from Utah will bear with me, he will see what happens on \nthis, and I will lay out the case where this has been done over and \nover again in the past.\n  This is a case where the administration asks for the Senate to advise \nand consent to a lifetime appointment, something that will go on well \nafter most of us have left the Senate, but the administration does not \nwant to provide information and memoranda relevant to this nomination. \nThe administration has done this in both judicial and executive \nnominations. Even this very administration has done so in another \nnomination for a short-term position, but it has refused to do so in \nthe case of Mr. Estrada.\n\n[[Page S2252]]\n\n  I wonder--and of course if the Senator wishes me to yield, I will--I \nwonder if he would give me the courtesy of hearing some of these \npoints.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could ask one question, and of course I will listen \nto the Senator.\n  It is my understanding that the Democrats have asked for memoranda of \nappeals, certiorari petitions, and amicus curiae. Does the Senator have \nany indication that any documents pertaining to recommendations of \nappeals, certiorari, or amicus curiae have ever been given by the \nJustice Department?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I do have evidence of exactly that. If the Senator would \nlet me finish my speech, he would understand that.\n  The current White House has disclosed to the Senate legal memorandum \nwriting by an attorney of President George H.W. Bush's White House \nCounsel's Office in connection with the nomination of Jeffrey Holmstead \nto be Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, \nand, interestingly enough, this was a position of far less duration and \nimportance than a lifetime judicial appointment.\n  In Mr. Estrada's case, the White House will not provide any of the \ninformation sought. That bothers me. I wonder what is in there. They \nseem to be saying: We have looked at it; trust us, it is OK. Well, I \nremember the made-up Russian proverb that President Reagan speech \nwriters came up with: Trust, but verify. Even though there was no such \nproverb, I thought it was a great saying, so I will use the same one.\n  The administration's claim that such a request is unprecedented, as \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah suggested, is actually wrong within \nthe administration's own knowledge, even their own history. It is also \nwrong with respect to prior administrations and the confirmation \nhistory of the Judiciary Committee.\n  What is happening is the White House seems willing to rewrite history \nfor this case. I suspect if that is to be allowed, then the next \ndifficult confirmation that comes up, the history will be rewritten \nagain and the Senate will be stonewalled again.\n  The facts, I say to my friend from Utah, are these. The Senate has \nrequested, and past Justice Departments have provided, similar \nmemoranda such as memoranda related to appeals, certiorari petitions, \nand amicus curiae--the decision to join a case as a friend of the \ncourt--written by attorneys of the Department of Justice. They have \ndone this in connection with the nominations of Robert Bork to become \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court; William Bradford Reynolds, \nAssistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, to become \nAssociate Attorney General; Benjamin Civiletti, nominated by President \nCarter to become Attorney General; Stephen Trott, nominated to become a \njudge in the Ninth Circuit; and then- Justice William Rehnquist, who \nwas nominated by President Reagan to become Chief Justice--among \nothers.\n  I did not get a chance to go to the gym this morning, but I guess I \ncan almost get as much exercise in picking up and holding some examples \nof the memoranda that have been provided by both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations in the past, the exact same type of \nmemoranda to the Solicitor General, as well as other similar legal \nmemoranda, that we now ask for on Mr. Estrada. So the real red herring \nis to assert that there is no precedent and to claim that no such \ndocuments have never been shared with the Senate Judiciary Committee in \npast nominations, and to say therefore that the Senate cannot examine \nsuch documents and that they will not accommodate the committee's \nrequest. Mr. Estrada has stated, and I admire his candor in doing this, \nthat he is proud of his memoranda and has no personal objection to us \nseeing his memoranda and he has no objection to answering questions \nbased on what he wrote. The administration, however, says: We object. \nThat objection is based on a complete rewriting of the history of such \nrequests and past cooperation and accommodation. They have refused to \nallow Mr. Estrada to answer many questions and they have refused to \nallow the Senate to look at his memoranda.\n\n  The Committee's request, however, is well within the practice of the \nSenate in prior administrations.\n  What does seem to be said by the administration is we cannot ask for \nthis because we have not asked it in relation to every judicial nominee \nwho has ever worked at the Department. Many who worked there and who \nwere nominated did have lengthy careers or academic writings or had no \ncontroversy about being unable to set aside deeply held beliefs, unlike \nthe stealth candidate before us. The administration also ignored the \nfact that when the Senate Judiciary Committee has requested memoranda \nwritten by nominees for term and lifetime appointments who worked at \nthe Justice Department, past Justice Departments have accommodated past \nCongresses upon the request.\n  We get a lot of paperwork on nominees. Sometimes we ask for more and \nsometimes we ask for less, depending on the record before us. But when \nwe have asked for it, everybody, except this administration, has \nallowed it and not stonewalled us. In fact, I have been here for 29 \nyears and I do not know of a time when the Justice Department has taken \nsuch an uncooperative approach to a request for information relating to \na nomination.\n  History shows the Senate does not always seek information it has the \npower to seek. We could ask for a whole lot of things that would be \nrelevant to entrusting a person with a lifetime appointment as a judge. \nOften we do not ask. Sometimes there does not seem to be a need for it \nbecause there is enough other information on the record.\n  But when the requests have been made, they have been honored by prior \nadministrations that have followed a policy of accommodation in \nresponse to a request from a co-equal branch of the Government for \nrelevant information related to constitutional responsibilities, \nespecially related to nominations.\n  This administration has not taken this position. Instead, they seem \nto be saying: We know what is there, just trust us. Rubberstamp what we \nsend up to you. Don't ask any questions. Be quiet little boys and \ngirls, just approve our lifetime judges and leave us alone.\n  The irony with all this is that they don't want to show us this \nmaterial so we could make an objective analysis and not look to second \nhand evaluations, but they are perfectly willing to go to some of these \nfiles and take out selective pieces and give them to the supporters of \nthe nominee and give them to the press or leak them to the press. They \nwant to have it both ways. They are more than happy to use anything \nfrom a confidential Government file they think will help them, but they \ndon't want to disclose the entire record because they don't want to \nhave it in context because then the truth may hurt.\n  If this is how the administration and Department of Justice approach \nour shared constitutional responsibility for the appointment to high \noffice, how are we to have confidence in them in their other \nrepresentations about so many things critical to how our Government \nfunctions and how they exercise the enormous power entrusted to them as \na function of the public office they occupy? How are we to accept it \nwhen they say, We don't want to talk about this but trust us? Yet when \nwe ask questions about things we legitimately believe could be looked \nat--nothing classified, nothing confidential--they say they still don't \nwant to show us that.\n\n  We talked about the performance evaluation. The administration and \nRepublican supporters of Mr. Estrada have sought to exploit his \nperformance evaluation.\n  Let's go to the whole story on that. They keep saying Professor \nBender gave the highest evaluation to Mr. Estrada when he was at the \nDepartment of Justice. They claim that is all you need to know. They \nsay we can't give you anything else in the file, but we will show you \nthis one thing.\n  Well, this is not quite the whole story. There is a letter received \nfrom Professor Bender this week. It was sent to Senator Hatch and the \nmembers of the committee. I assumed, since Senator Hatch had been \nputting so much in the Record, he would probably put this in. He \nsomehow didn't.\n  This is what Professor Bender's letter says in part. I would like to \nhave the entire letter printed. He says:\n\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\n\n       It has come to my attention that, in responding to \n     statements I made to the press several months ago regarding \n     the Estrada nomination, you [Senator Hatch] have said, both \n     to the Judiciary Committee and to the full Senate, (1) that I \n     have since changed my opinion about the nomination, and (2) \n     that performance evaluations of Mr. Estrada's work that I \n     signed in 1995 and 1996, when I was Principal Deputy \n     Solicitor General, are inconsistent with the views about the \n     nomination that I gave to the press. I am writing this to \n     correct those statements of yours.\n       No. 1. I have not changed my opinion of the nomination--\n  That is, the adverse opinion he had, in which he opposed the \nnomination of Mr. Estrada.\n  He said:\n\n       I have not changed my opinion of the nomination, nor have I \n     ever said to anyone that I had changed my opinion. . . . I \n     have not changed that opinion in any respect.\n\n  This is dated February 10, 2003. He can't be any more specific than \nthat. He was opposed to his nomination before. He is opposed to his \nnomination since.\n  Then he says, speaking of the performance evaluations of Mr. Estrada, \nthese:\n\n       . . . are not inconsistent with my published statements [of \n     opposition to him.] To the best of my recollection, it was \n     the policy of the Solicitor General's Office at the time to \n     give every Assistant to the Solicitor General exactly the \n     same performance evaluation.\n\n  These things could have been printed up a month before.\n\n       The language in the Performance Achievements portions of \n     Mr. Estrada's evaluations was not written by me, nor did I \n     fill out the Employee Appraisal Record form.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       I believe that the Solicitor General's Office had the \n     policy of giving each of the Assistants exactly the same \n     Excellent rating each year.\n\n  And he stated why? Of course. It paid them the highest salaries \npermitted by the Government. Everybody they hired had those highest \nsalaries. To keep the highest salaries, they had to have the excellent \nrating.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Arizona State University,\n\n                                     Tempe, AZ, February 10, 2003.\n\n     Renomination of Miguel A. Estrada to the United States Court \n         of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: It has come to my attention that, in \n     responding to statements I made to the press several months \n     ago regarding the Estrada nomination, you have said, both to \n     the Judiciary Committee and to the full Senate, (1) that I \n     have since changed my opinion about the nomination, and (2) \n     that performance evaluations of Mr. Estrada's work that I \n     signed in 1995 and 1996, when I was Principal Deputy \n     Solicitor General, are inconsistent with the views about the \n     nomination that I gave to the press. I am writing this to \n     correct those statements of yours.\n       1. I have not changed my opinion of the nomination, nor \n     have I ever said to anyone that I had changed my opinion. \n     Someone must have inadvertently given you incorrect \n     information about this. When asked by reporters what I \n     thought of the nomination when it was first made (I assume I \n     was asked because I have been one of Mr. Estrada's \n     supervisors in the Solicitor General's Office), I stated my \n     honest opinion, to the best of my ability. I have not changed \n     that opinion in any respect.\n       I have declined to keep stating the same views to the \n     press, over and over again, because I am not engaged in, and \n     do not wish to seem to be engaged in, any kind of campaign or \n     crusade against Mr. Estrada. I did not volunteer my negative \n     comments to anyone, either in the press, the government, or \n     elsewhere. I was asked my opinion and I gave it. Having done \n     so, I did not see any reason to keep repeating it to \n     reporters who called. My opinion has not changed.\n       2. The ``Excellent'' performance evaluations of Mr. Estrada \n     that I signed in 1995 and 1996 are not inconsistent with my \n     published statements about the nomination. To the best of my \n     recollection, it was the policy of the Solicitor General's \n     Office at the time to give every Assistant to the Solicitor \n     General exactly the same performance evaluation. The language \n     in the Performance Achievements portions of Mr. Estrada's \n     evaluations was not written by me, nor did I fill out the \n     Employee Appraisal Record form. You will notice, in examining \n     the Performance Appraisal Record form, that the language in \n     the Performance Achievements portion was taken, word for \n     word, from the printed Performance Standards that precede \n     each part of the evaluation form. As far as I can remember, \n     an administrator in the Solicitor General's Office prepared \n     identical ``Excellent'' evaluations for each Assistant each \n     year, taking the language directly from the printed \n     performance standards. I do not think this practice is an \n     unusual one in the government.\n       When these filled-out-forms came across my desk, I believe \n     that I asked the Solicitor General what to do with them, and \n     that he asked me to sign them, as written, as the Rating \n     Official. I did as he requested. He then signed them as the \n     Reviewing Official. No actual individual written evaluation \n     was done by me--or, so far as I know, by anyone else--in \n     connection with these evaluations for any Assistant to the \n     Solicitor General. They were boilerplate.\n       I believe that the Solicitor General's Office had the \n     policy of giving each of the Assistants exactly the same \n     Excellent rating each year because it hired only the most \n     highly qualified lawyers and it paid them the highest \n     salaries permitted by the government. ``Excellent'' ratings \n     were necessary to justify these salaries. I signed the \n     already filled-out Performance Evaluation forms, as they were \n     give to me, as part of that policy.\n       Since my views seem to be relevant to the Senate's \n     consideration of the nomination, I would appreciate it if you \n     would share this information with your colleagues who are \n     considering the nomination. I thank you in advance for this \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Paul Bender,\n                                                 Professor of Law.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am doing that because Professor Bender \nasked that this be made known to the Senate, especially as he has been \nquoted as having changed his mind. He still opposes Mr. Estrada. I will \nquote him again. He says:\n\n       I have not changed my opinion of the nomination, nor have I \n     ever said to anyone that I had changed my opinion.\n\n  He makes it very clear that he feels he has been misquoted on the \nSenate floor. He may feel it was done inadvertently. He said, ``Someone \nmust have inadvertently given you incorrect information about this,'' \nmaking it very clear that he was misquoted.\n  I know what he means. It is easy to get misquoted around here. \nEarlier this week a Republican Senator misquoted me in the Senate \nChamber. The Senator who purported to quote my words certainly could \nnot have known that he was quoting me incorrectly. I can't believe--I \nwould be shocked to think somebody would come here and quote me out of \ncontext or incorrectly to make a partisan point. I would be as shocked \nas Claude Raines was in ``Casablanca.''\n  So people understand, the statement I did make on June 18, 1998, was \nto protest the anonymous Republican hold in the consideration of the \njudicial nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. The nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor was held up, as I have stated before, for months and \nmonths and months by anonymous holds. She had been nominated by \nPresident Clinton to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I believe she \nwas the very first Hispanic woman to go to that court of appeals. \nEverybody assumed her to be a slam dunk. She had been originally \nappointed by President George H.W. Bush to the district court. But \nRepublicans allowed anonymous holds and nobody on the Republican side \nwould say who was holding her up, but they held her up.\n  I am saying I would never do this to a judge. What I said was I would \nrefuse to put an anonymous hold on any judge. I never have put an \nanonymous hold on a judge. If I wanted to delay for whatever reason a \nnomination, I state it on the floor as I am doing now, in the light of \nday, not the cloak of secrecy.\n  The portion of my speech about anonymous holds--like some speeches I \nmade in the years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000--were not heard on \nthe other side of the aisle. That is probably why they now misquote it. \nI am sure it is an inadvertent misquote. I think it is because they \ndidn't hear it. They certainly didn't hear it at the time because they \ncontinue to use the ``anonymous holds.'' It is a practice I put an end \nto when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. But when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate in years past they held up scores of judicial \nnominees of President Clinton, and never allowed them to come to a vote \nby ``anonymous holds'' of a single Republican Senator or more than one.\n  I am not surprised that they misquote me on the floor, because they \ndidn't hear my speech at that time. In this case, people should \nunderstand what was happening.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination was delayed by anonymous \nRepublican holds and was on the Senate calendar for months and months. \nShe was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee in early March of \n1998. But then\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\nher nomination was stalled without explanation or accountability on the \ncalendar without Senate action. Even after I made my speech criticizing \nanonymous holds and stating that I would never put on such an anonymous \nhold, her nomination continued to be delayed for several more months to \nthe very end of the session of Congress. It was actually delayed, I \nthink, for 7 months. When it finally came up, 29 Republican Senators \nvoted against confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the Second \nCircuit.\n  I went back and checked the Congressional Record. They are not \nrequired to, of course, but you would think after voting against a \njudge, or having anonymous holds on a judge for a long period, there \nwould be at least one or two words in the Congressional Record \nexplaining why this was done. They don't have any requirement to do \nthat, but I think it would have been nice. If they carry out an \nanonymous hold like that for all of those months, you might say, Why?\n  I mention this because there seems to be a lot being overlooked. When \nthat same Republican Senator quoted part of a colloquy between me and \nthe then-majority leader, Trent Lott, I suspect that he did not really \nrecall the discussion, or he would not have had it so wrong here on the \nfloor.\n  I will read again what Senator Lott, the Republican leader, said at \nthat time:\n\n       [T]here are not a lot of people saying: Give us more \n     Federal judges. They just are not. For us to be pontificating \n     about this and gnashing, how unfair, this appointment of more \n     Federal judges, It is just not there. . . . Some people might \n     argue that we have plenty of Federal judges to do the job. I \n     hope they will do that. I am saying to you, I am trying . . . \n     but getting more Federal judges is not what I came here to \n     do.\n\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer was not in the Senate at that \ntime. But he may recall Justice Ronnie White came from his State.\n  The nomination of Ted Stewart to the District Court in Utah was also \nvery controversial. A lot of the so-called ``liberal groups'' the \ndistinguished chairman is fond of excoriating around here opposed Mr. \nStewart. A lot of the same groups the distinguished senior Senator from \nUtah implies control things around here opposed Mr. Stewart.\n  I voted for Mr. Stewart. I was one of those Democrats who should not \nbe lumped together. In fact, a whole lot of Democratic Senators voted \nfor Mr. Stewart, even though he was strongly opposed by groups that are \nnormally aligned with Democratic interests, especially those who \nsupport a clean environment in this country.\n  Then there was, of course, the nomination of Justice Ronnie White. He \nalso was supported by every Democratic Senator. And every single \nRepublican, including those who had voted for Ronnie White in \ncommittee, came down on the floor and voted against him.\n  I do not recall anything like that ever happening on the Senate \nfloor.\n  His nomination was rejected by a party-line vote of Republics--it was \nquite unusual to vote down a district court nominee, especially one who \nhad been voted out by the Judiciary Committee. Some of the same \nRepublicans who voted for him before the committee voted against him on \nthis floor. This superb African American jurist was humiliated and \ndefeated.\n  It took several more months of hard work to obtain votes on the \nnomination of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon.\n  Again, these anonymous Republican holds held them up until March of \nthe following year 2000.\n  Again, as I said, I will always oppose such anonymous holds.\n  Even then, after obtaining a vote of Judge Paez's nomination to the \ncircuit court involving overcoming several procedural hurdles and \nseveral votes before we were finally able, after more than 4 years of \ntrying--4 years it sat here--this distinguished Hispanic jurist finally \ngot a vote. Then 39 Republicans voted against the nomination, including \na number of Republican Senators who were involved in yesterday's debate \nsaying it would be a terrible and unique precedent if we don't \nimmediately vote for a Hispanic who is nominated to the court of \nappeals, in this case, Mr. Estrada.\n  They were perfectly willing to block floor votes for years before. I \nam not sure what the difference is. They both have supporters.\n  I do recall the difference now. One was appointed by a Democratic \nPresident and one by a Republican President. Like I said, that seems to \nbe all the difference in the world.\n  In the debate, my Republican colleagues speak of the weight of the \nletter from the former Solicitors General and Acting Solicitor General. \nThey say this is definitive and assert that the Senate has no right to \nask these questions.\n  Immediately, the independent 100 Members of the Senate say, My gosh. \nThese guys who held these important staff positions at the Department \nof Justice are telling us we can't ask questions; that we should \nimmediately run for cover, and say, of course, we will not ask \nquestions.\n  I don't quite read the Constitution that way.\n  In fact, I frankly didn't get elected to the Senate and take my oath \nof office and decide at that point I will vote or take actions based \nupon what somebody who worked for the Attorney General tells me to do \nor not do as a Senator. I don't care which attorney general it might \nhave been, Republican or Democrat. It is not in the cards.\n  But I was concerned. I know of these former Solicitors General from \nboth Republican and Democratic administrations. For many of them, I was \nimpressed with their legal abilities. So I am struck with their \nletter's ignorance of the precedents. I do not know who wrote the \nletter, but one of the people who signed it was Robert Bork. But I \ndoubt he wrote it because his own nomination provides some of the \nstrongest precedent for the requests we are making.\n\n  I do not fault them for seeking to maximize the secrecy of executive \nbranch memoranda and deliberations, although I am surprised they are \nwilling to do that at a time when we have the most secretive \nadministration I have ever known out of the six administrations--I came \nhere right after the Nixon administration, so I cannot speak for the \nNixon administration. But this administration is certainly far more \nsecretive than the other ones I have served with before: the Ford, the \nCarter, the Reagan, the first Bush, and the Clinton administrations.\n  This letter states a policy preference and has been misinterpreted by \nsome as a statement of law, or privileged, which it is not. I want to \nemphasize that. They state what they think the policy should be. They \ndo not state what the law should be. Therein lies an enormous \ndifference. They are not writing this based on their legal knowledge, \nsaying this is the law. They are saying: This is what we think the \npolicy should be.\n  Well, I have always felt, on these kinds of issues, Senators should \nmake that policy. Especially we should make the policy of what we are \ngoing to ask for in confirmation hearings. That was done at the time of \nour nation's first leader, President George Washington in cooperation \nwith the Senate. I would note that in 1795, four years after the \nConstitution was adopted, the Senate defeated one of the judicial \nnominations of President Washington, that of John Rutledge and that \nvote was based on differences between many of the Senators and Justice \nRutledge regarding ideas and policies. The Senate's consideration of \njudicial nominees and their views and approach to the law has been done \nby every Senate since.\n  It is especially difficult to understand, hearing the sudden urge on \nthe other side of the aisle that: Oh, my gosh, we have to keep \neverything in the executive branch confidential. Well, Congress passed \nthe Presidential Records Act to require the opposite, that memoranda \nand writings of advisors to the President be made public.\n  Additionally, I would not that some of the same Senators made demand \nafter demand for internal documents of the Clinton administration over \nthe last several years. They were asking for things that had never been \nasked for before, such as information related to on-going \ninvestigations. In fact, I think the Republican-led Senate spent tens \nof millions of dollars--tens of millions of dollars--of the taxpayers' \nmoney asking for document after document, many of which were probably \nwere never read. I would be willing to bet some are still sitting in \nthe envelopes they were transmitted in. And it was done almost every \nday: Let's think\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\nof something else to ask for. And it was sent. And the taxpayers were \npaying for it.\n  Now, if you have something that is relevant to the core functions of \nthe Senate, especially the confirmation function, then it is \nappropriate to ask for it. This is especially so for the only positions \nin our whole system of government that are for life--these judgeships \nare lifetime appointments. The Senate cannot amend these decisions, \nlike a law, if we make a mistake.\n  The administration's assertion that the documents produced to the \ncommittee during the Bork nomination did not reveal internal \ndeliberations is way off the mark--way off the mark. When they say this \ndid not reveal internal deliberations, that is way off the mark. It is \nquite clear the Department provided the Senate with memoranda written \nto Mr. Bork by lower level attorneys, those who were in the exact same \ncapacity as Mr. Estrada, making recommendations about appeals in a \nvariety of cases.\n\n  For example, the Justice Department provided the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee with memoranda related to the Justice Department's legal \nanalysis of school integration cases, such as memoranda from Frank \nEasterbrook when he was an Assistant Solicitor General and Bork was \nSolicitor General. The Easterbrook legal memo and similar memos were \nshown as examples at Mr. Estrada's recent hearing as part of the large \nvolume of legal memoranda provided by the Reagan Justice Department and \nexamined by Senators and key staff.\n  Senator Dodd, in an excellent speech, referred to some of these \nmaterials last night in debate. Not all of the information disclosed \nwas previously placed in the Estrada hearing record, so I ask unanimous \nconsent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record a sample of the \ncorrespondence between Senator Biden, who was the then-chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, and the Justice Department, which demonstrates the \nsubstantial cooperation and the types of disclosures the Justice \nDepartment made to accommodate the Senate in past administrations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                 Office of Legislative Affairs\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Biden: This letter requests that the \n     Committee return to the Justice Department all copies of \n     documents produced by the Department in response to Committee \n     requests for records relating to the nomination of Robert \n     Bork to the Supreme Court. As Assistant Attorney General John \n     Bolton noted in an August 24, 1987, letter to you, many of \n     the documents provided the Committee, ``reflect or disclose \n     purely internal deliberations within the Executive Branch, \n     the work product of attorneys in connection with government \n     litigation or confidential legal advice received from or \n     provided to client agencies within the Executive Branch.'' We \n     provided these privileged documents to the Committee in order \n     to respond fully to the Committee's request and to expedite \n     the confirmation process.\n       Although the Committee's need for these documents has \n     ceased, their privileged nature remains. As we emphasized in \n     our August 24, 1987, letter, production of these documents to \n     the Committee did not constitute a general waiver of claims \n     of privilege. We therefore request that the Committee return \n     all copies of all documents provided by the Department to the \n     Committee, except documents that are clearly a matter of \n     public record (e.g., briefs and judicial opinions) or that \n     were specifically made a part of the record of the hearings.\n       Please contact me if you have any questions. Thank you for \n     your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thomas M.

Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Attached is one set of copies of \n     documents assembled by the Department in response to your \n     August 10, 1987 request for documents relating to the \n     nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court of the United \n     States, and provided in response to requests made to date by \n     Committee staff. These documents are being provided under the \n     conditions stated in my August 24, 1987 letter to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John R.

Please provide the requested \n     documents by August 24, 1987. If you have any questions about \n     this request, please contact the Committee staff director, \n     Diana Huffman, at 224-0747.\n       Thank you for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Joseph R.

This request is continuing in character and if \n     additional responsive documents come to your attention \n     following the date of production, please provide such \n     documents to the Committee promptly.\n       2.

I put that material in the Record because it stands in \nstark contrast to the total lack of cooperation by the current \noccupants of the Justice Department.\n  The administration, quite inappropriately, I believe, refuses the \nrequest of a coequal branch of Government. To quote a friend of mine, \none who went to the same law school I did, at about the same time: We \nare not potted plants up here. The Senate has demonstrated its role in \nthe confirmation of judges from the beginning of this country's \nhistory. After all, the Senate rejected some of President George \nWashington's and President Madison's judicial nominees. But let's go \nahead with what has happened here. It makes me wonder if there is some \nkind of huge disconnect at the administration, or whether they are \ngetting all their information based on some of the things that were \nwrongly stated on the Senate floor.\n  What happened first is, the administration claimed: We cannot send up \nthis material, these memos of Mr. Estrada because we never provided \ninternal legal memos in the past. Then, of course, we gave them \nevidence: Well, yes, previous administrations had. Then the \nadministration says: Whoops, well, those were different. They are \ndistinguishable. So then we show them evidence: No, it is exactly the \nsame kind of memoranda. And they say: Prove that you received memos \nthat contained confidential information written by attorneys. And they \nsay, we are still not going to accommodate you. We are still not going \nto come forth. They, in essence, are saying we are still going to \nstonewall you and we will continue to deny that any precedent exists.\n  I am reminded of the famous story of President Lincoln's cross-\nexamination in a case when he was a young lawyer. As the story goes, \nLincoln was cross-examining a witness about how a man, who was far away \nfrom the scene of a fight, could have seen what happened. And it went \nsomething like this.\n  Lincoln said: Isn't it true that you were across the road from where \nthe incident took place?\n  The answer was: Yes.\n  Then Lincoln said: Isn't it true that you are near-sighted?\n  The witness answered: Yes.\n  And then Lincoln said: Isn't it true that your view of the fight was \nblocked by trees?\n  The witness said: Yes.\n  So Lincoln said: Then, how can you sit there and testify under oath \nthat the defendant bit Mr. Smith?\n  The witness answered: Because I saw the defendant spit Mr. Smith's \near out of his mouth.\n  In our case, subsequent to Mr. Estrada's hearing, we learned that \nmost of the Bork appeal memos disclosed to the Senate were returned to \nthe Department the year after the nomination. The proof is in a letter \nfrom Acting Assistant Attorney General Thomas Boyd to Chairman Biden in \nMay 1988, which notes that:\n\n       [M]any of the documents provided to the Committee, \n     ``reflect or disclose purely internal deliberations within \n     the Executive Branch, the work product of attorneys in \n     connection with government litigation or confidential legal \n     advice received from or provided to client agencies within \n     the Executive Branch. We provided these privileged documents \n     to the Committee in order to respond fully to the Committee's \n     request and to expedite the confirmation process.''\n\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\n\n  Sound familiar? Well, the requests should be familiar. It is exactly \nwhat we requested last year. The difference is, during President \nReagan's administration, they responded. During this administration, \nthey say: There is no precedent for it.\n\n  So, frankly, this is the ``ear being spit out.'' The fact is, this \nletter ``spits out'' that the overly partisan current occupants of the \nJustice Department have sought to deny the Justice Department \npreviously provided such documents. Mr. President, those denials are \nfalse.\n  Surely, a copy of this letter is also in the Justice Department's \nfiles. If we had been able to get this letter earlier, even by the time \nof Mr. Estrada's hearing, we would have put it in the Record. It is \nobvious why the Justice Department probably did not want us to have it. \nBecause it conclusively demonstrates the precedent that documents like \nthe ones written by Mr. Estrada were provided to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in the past.\n  The Boyd letter conclusively demonstrates the precedent that \ndocuments like the ones written by Mr. Estrada were provided to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in the past. It must now be admitted beyond \ndispute that, as the Justice Department acknowledged back then, ``the \nwork product of attorneys in connection with government litigation or \nconfidential legal advice'' was provided to the Senate in connection \nwith past nominations.\n  I hope that the administration and its Republican supporters will \nfinally quit denying the precedent for the request and provide us with \nMr. Estrada's memoranda. Letters from the Justice Department itself \nfinally conclusively establish the precedent for our request.\n  The longstanding policy of the Justice Department, until now, and the \npolicy of prior administrations, including the Reagan and first Bush \nadministrations, has been a practice of accommodation with the Senate \nin providing access to materials requested in connection with \nnominations. This administration would rather deny the truth and long-\nstanding practices. At times it is as if this administration thinks it \nhas a blank slate and a blank check notwithstanding tradition, history, \nprecedent or the shared powers explicitly provided by our nation's \nConstitution.\n  There is part of a pattern of hostility by this administration to \nrequests for information by Congress acting pursuant to powers granted \nto it by the Constitution, regarding nominees and other important \noversight matters.\n  Yesterday, I joined with the distinguished Democratic Leader in a \nletter to the President setting forth background on the stonewalling of \nhis administration that has occurred with respect to this nomination \nand urging him to take action to help resolve the impasse. I thank the \nDemocratic Leader for taking this action and seeking accommodation \nbetween the two branches of our government. I have been seeking such \naccommodation for the last two years with respect to judicial \nnominations. I hope that we can now be more successful.\n  I would also note that the few court cases cited by the \nadministration about the general desirability of confidentiality for \ngovernment documents are dicta and not precedential or binding on the \nSenate.\n  One of the cases relied on by the administration is United States v. \nNixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), in which the Supreme Court ordered \nPresident Nixon to disclose his Watergate-related tape recordings of \nOval Office conversations with his closest personal and legal advisors. \nThe Supreme Court also noted in the Nixon case that it is quite \nunlikely ``that advisors will be moved to temper the candor of their \nremarks by the infrequent occasions of disclosure.'' 418 U.S. at 712.\n  Just as the Supreme Court observed in the Nixon case, it seems \nunlikely that Mr. Estrada was chilled from expressing his views in his \nmemos following the disclosure of memos written by attorneys at the \nDepartment in the decade prior to his service there in connection with \nthe Trott, Bork, Rehnquist, and Reynolds nominations. Ironically, \nmemoranda by Mr. Bork assessing President Nixon's authority to refuse \nto disclose information was one of documents provided to the Senate in \nconnection with the Bork nomination.\n  Other cases cited by the Justice Department in its second letter are \ninapplicable to the Senate or pre-date the Nixon decision. For example, \nNLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 151 (1975), is a case \nbrought under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) involving a \nstatutory-based claim of deliberative process privilege under FOIA, not \na request from the Congress. I wish this administration were more \nforthcoming in connection with FOIA requests, but this is not a FOIA \nrequest, nor does FOIA limit Congress' authority to seek information \nfrom the Executive Branch or its agencies. Indeed, 5 U.S.C. 552(d) \nexpressly provides that FOIA ``is not authority to withhold information \nfrom Congress.''\n  During the course of this debate Republican Senators have also spoken \nas if these materials are somehow protected by an attorney-client \nprivilege. First, I note that even the administration has not made that \nclaim. The administration's refusal to cooperation is not based on any \nclaim of a legal privilege, just recalcitrance. I believe I explained \nat Mr. Estrada's hearing some of the reasons a claim of attorney-client \nprivilege would be misplaced. Until this week, only the Washington Post \nhad gotten it wrong in asserting that privilege applies.\n  Unfortunately, Republican Senators are now taking up that chant. It \nis heartwarming to hear Republicans' devotion to concepts like the \nattorney-client privilege but it is that concept is inapplicable to the \nrequest for Mr. Estrada's writings.\n  As a legal matter, the Seventh, Eighth, and District of Columbia \nCircuits have ruled that government lawyers are not entitled to claim \nthe attorney-client privilege.\n  Moreover, in this setting the ``client'' is the government of which \nthe Congress is certainly a part.\n  This administration's own Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy \nViet Dinh flatly rejected the notion of such a privilege five years ago \nwhen he told Legal Times that a government lawyer's ``employer is not a \nsingle person but the United States of America.'' He said both the \n``United States of America'' and the ``government'' obviously include \nthe United States Senate, especially when it is fulfilling \nconstitutional responsibilities. As conservative law professor Ronald \nRotunda has noted, ``government lawyers work for the government, and \nnot the particular individual whose offices happen to be down the \nhall.'' He added that ``the government cannot plead attorney-client \nprivilege against itself.'' This is from the Legal Times of August 3, \n1998.\n  The attorney-client privilege is designed to encourage candor by the \nclient, not the attorney. For those who are not attorneys, I note that \nthe attorney-client privilege is designed for litigation in courts \nbetween private parties. It is a judge-made doctrine based on policy \nconsiderations to foster an effective adversary legal system. I am a \nstrong believer in our adversarial legal system and a strong supporter \nof the attorney-client privilege. It does not apply in these \ncircumstances.\n  Finally, there is ample precedent that the attorney-client privilege \ndoes not apply to requests by Congress. As Senator Fred Thompson, who \nchaired one of the many Republican investigations into the Clinton \nAdministration, noted: ``In case after case, the courts have concluded \nthat allowing it [the attorney-client privilege] to be used against \nCongress would be an impediment to Congress' obligation and duty to get \nto the truth and carry out its investigative and oversight \nresponsibilities.''\n  My good friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, has echoed that analysis. A \nfew years ago, he observed: ``The attorney-client privilege exists as \nonly a narrow exception to broad rules of disclosure. And the privilege \nexists only as a statutory creation, or by operation of State common \nlaw. No statute or Senate or House rule applies the attorney-client \nprivilege to Congress. In fact, both the Senate and the House have \nexplicitly refused to formally include the privilege in their rules.''\n  The Congressional Research Service has found that ``No court has ever \nquestioned the assertion of that prerogative'' and noted that the \nprivilege ``is not of constitutional dimensions, [and] is certainly not \nbinding on the Congress of the United States.''\n  I regret that so many of our Republican colleagues have chosen to \nseek\n\n[[Page S2258]]\n\ncomfort and concealment in a legal principle that has no application to \nthis matter. I think that the confusion started with a Washington Post \neditorial that got this matter all wrong and reflects a lack of \nfamiliarity with the history of nominations and the Senate's long-\nstanding view of the privilege. The Washington Post's editorials on \nthese matters has been prone to err in a number of ways and they remain \nfree to do so, but I am sorry so many were led astray on this and other \nmatters.\n  This Administration's policy argument for absolute secrecy of these \nmemoranda is undermined by other long-standing practices related to \nnominees. The Senate routinely receives confidential information about \nlifetime and term-appointed nominees by way of the FBI's background \ninvestigation of a nominee, which details their adult lives and many \nprivate matters. Thus, the Senate is not required to show a \nparticularized need for such private information which has long been \ngermane to a nominee's fitness for judicial office.\n  Moreover, the memos at issue do not involve national security. There \nare no state secrets in the documents Mr. Estrada has written requiring \nthat they be sealed from congressional view forever. The memos do not \nrelate to any on-going criminal investigation or to any matters that \nhave not likely already been disposed of by the courts long ago. His \nwritings are relevant to how he thinks, analyzes legal issues and makes \njudgement and, therefore, relevant to whether or not he should be \nconfirmed to the second highest court in the country. Moreover, as \nSenator Schumer noted in his letter, anytime one of these memos is \nwritten, the writer must assume, and even hope, that his or her views \nwill become the Department's official position. Thus, it is hard to \nbelieve the risk of disclosure on the remote chance that one might \nsomeday be selected for a judgeship would be chilling.\n  Further, as noted long ago by the Supreme Court in McGrain v. \nDaugherty, 273 U.S. 135 (1927), Congress has the power to inquire into \nthe administration of the Department of Justice--whether its functions \nare being properly discharged or neglected or misdirected, and \nparticularly whether the Attorney General and his assistants were \nperforming or neglecting their duties. Even Montesquieu, the architect \nof separation of powers, stated that ``The legislature should have the \nmeans of examining in what manner its laws have been executed by public \nofficials.'' In this case, whether Mr. Estrada was using his position \nas an Assistant Solicitor General to advance his personal political \nopinions or to defend faithfully the laws passed by Congress has been \ncalled into question.\n  In sum, there is ample historical precedent for the request made by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. This Administration's refusal to \ncooperate obstructs Senators from fulfilling their role of giving \nmeaningful advice regarding lifetime appointments and to give or \nwithhold consent. The advice and consent responsibility that the \nConstitution entrusts to the Senate is demeaned if the Administration \nrefuses to disclose information reasonably related to a nominee's \nfitness or integrity.\n  Public confidence in the fairness of the judiciary is eroded when the \nAdministration hides pertinent information about a nominee sought by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee in seeking to fulfill its role related \nto the appointment power that the Constitution confers jointly on the \nSenate and the President. The advice and consent clause of the \nConstitution is part of the Constitution's checks and balances in the \nlifetime appointment of individuals to a co-equal third branch of the \nfederal government, unaccountable to the normal democratic process. The \npublic's representatives in the Senate should have an opportunity to \nexamine the writings of Mr. Estrada in advance of entrusting him with a \njudicial role for life.\n  The influence of the courts over the lives of Americans demands that \nthe Senate exercise its checking responsibility carefully and only \nafter reviewing all relevant information.\n  I think it has to be admitted beyond dispute that, as the Justice \nDepartment acknowledged back then, ``the work product of attorneys in \nconnection with government litigation or confidential legal advice'' \nwas provided to the Senate in connection with past nominations. I hope \nthe administration and their supporters here in the Senate will finally \nquit denying the precedent for the request and provide us with Mr. \nEstrada's memoranda. Letters from the Justice Department itself finally \nand conclusively establish the precedent for our request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter, dated May 10, 1988, from \nActing Assistant Attorney General Thomas Boyd be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1988.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Biden: This letter requests that the \n     Committee return to the Justice Department all copies of \n     documents produced by the Department in response to Committee \n     requests for records relating to the nomination of Robert \n     Bork to the Supreme Court. As Assistant Attorney General John \n     Bolton noted in an August 24, 1987, letter to you, many of \n     the documents provided the Committee, ``reflect or disclose \n     purely internal deliberations within the Executive Branch, \n     the work product of attorneys in connection with government \n     litigation or confidential legal advice received from or \n     provided to client agencies within the Executive Branch.'' We \n     provided these privileged documents to the Committee in order \n     to respond fully to the Committee's request and to expedite \n     the confirmation process.\n       Although the Committee's need for these documents has \n     ceased, their privileged nature remains. As we emphasized in \n     our August 24, 1987, letter, production of these documents to \n     the Committee did not constitute a general waiver of claims \n     of privilege. We therefore request that the Committee return \n     all copies of all documents provided by the Department to the \n     Committee, except documents that are clearly a matter of \n     public record (e.g., briefs and judicial opinions) or that \n     were specifically made a part of the record of the hearings.\n       Please contact me if you have any questions. Thank you for \n     your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thomas M. Boyd,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is interesting to note that after I wrote the Attorney \nGeneral and Mr. Estrada in May 2002, when I requested Mr. Estrada's \nwritings, the administration didn't respond immediately. If they really \nbelieved in their own precedent, they would have come back and said: \nLook, we have a precedent against it. I think they realized there \nreally was no such precedent, and they were going to try to make one \nup. They took weeks to respond. They could have responded in a day \nbecause the precedent was so clear. Or if they simply wanted to say, \nwell, maybe all other Presidents did it that way, we are not going to \ndo it that way, they could have done that in just a matter of days. But \ninstead, it makes you wonder, did they go back and read those memoranda \nand say: Whoops, we don't want these to go before the Senate, they are \ntoo revealing?\n  Whatever it is, Mr. Estrada himself says: As far as I am concerned, \nyou can see them, and you can ask me questions about them.\n  The irony is, in all likelihood we would not be here today, having \nthis long debate on the Estrada nomination, if he had simply done that. \nIf the administration simply said: Look, Miguel Estrada is willing to \nhave his memoranda before the Senate Judiciary Committee and then to \nanswer questions about what he meant, we would not be here; we would \nnot be in the circumstance where he is asked, over the last 40 or 50 \nyears: Is there anything that you disagreed with that the Supreme Court \nsaid? During that time, the Supreme Court has overruled itself. No, \nnothing.\n  So we really have no idea what he thinks. They simply said: Look, we \nnominated somebody. We were not willing to allow the nominations to go \nforward when President Clinton nominated people here. We blocked them \nfor year after year after year, but take ours on faith.\n  Again, to the folks who made up a slogan I kind of liked, ``Trust, \nbut verify,'' we will trust but verify. As I said, we would not even be \nhere today, we would not be having this debate today, if this had been \ndone.\n  The longstanding policy of the Justice Department until now, the \npolicy of prior administrations, including\n\n[[Page S2259]]\n\nReagan and the first Bush administration, has been a practice of \naccommodation with the Senate in providing access to materials \nrequested in connection with nominations. But this administration wants \nto deny the truth and longstanding practices. You would think they \nbelieve they have a blank slate and a blank check notwithstanding \ntradition, history, and precedent or the shared powers explicitly \nprovided by our Nation's Constitution.\n  This goes beyond hubris. This goes to a sense of entitlement. It is a \n``l'etat, c'est moi'' attitude on the part of the administration. It is \nsaying: If we say it, it happens. If we want it, it is OK. It is almost \nlike the little kid on the playground who says: I want this one, I want \nthis one, I want this one, and I don't care what the playground rules \nare.\n  Well, this is a lot more than a playground. This is the U.S. Senate, \na place I love and revere and a place steeped in constitutional \nhistory, steeped in constitutional prerogatives; but even more so, one \nwhere we are called upon day after day to protect the Constitution of \nthe United States. I see a pattern of hostility by this administration \nto requests for information by Congress, even though Congress is \nactively pursuing the powers granted to it by the Constitution, \nregarding not only nominees but important oversight matters.\n\n  Yesterday, I joined with the distinguished Democratic leader in a \nletter to the President. We set forth the background of the \nstonewalling of this administration that has occurred with respect to \nthis nomination. We urged them to take action to help resolve the \nimpasse. I thank the Democratic leader for taking this action seeking \naccommodation between the two branches of our Government. I have been \nseeking such accommodation for the last 2 years with respect to \njudicial nominations. I hope we can be more successful.\n  I hope that now people will step back and say: Look, let's put this \non a more even keel. Let's have real hearings, not assembly line type \nhearings. Let's carry out our constitutional responsibilities. Let's go \nforward. That is the way I thought it should be when I came to the \nSenate 29 years ago. That is the way I think it should be now. I think \nthat is the way it could be. It is the way it was with both Republican \nand Democratic administrations.\n  I was not here at the time of the Nixon administration. I came \nshortly thereafter. I don't know if this kind of stonewalling is \nprecedent or not. In my experience, I would not know that. But I know \nit was not during the administrations of President Ford, President \nCarter, President Reagan, the first President Bush, or President \nClinton.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter Senator Daschle and \nI sent to the President on this matter, pointing out that the precedent \nfor what we have asked for was shown in the nominations of Robert Bork, \nWilliam Bradford Reynolds, Benjamin Civiletti, Stephen Trott, and \nWilliam Rehnquist, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2003.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing in reference to your \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit. Pursuant to the \n     Constitution, the Senate is to act as a co-equal participant \n     in the confirmation of judges to the Federal bench. Unlike \n     nominations made by a President for Executive Branch \n     appointments, judicial nominees are reviewed by the Senate \n     for appointment to lifetime positions in the Judicial Branch.\n       The Senate has often requested and received supplemental \n     documents when it is considering controversial nominations or \n     when evaluating a candidate with a limited public record. The \n     Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to your \n     Administration on May 15, 2002 to request such supplemental \n     documents to assist in Senate consideration of the Estrada \n     nomination. In particular, the request was made for appeal \n     recommendations, certiorari recommendations, and amicus \n     recommendations that Mr. Estrada worked on while at the \n     Department of Justice.\n       Prior Administrations have accommodated similar Senate \n     requests for such documents. Such documents were provided \n     during Senate consideration of the nominations of Robert H. \n     Bork, William Bradford Reynolds, Benjamin Civiletti, Stephen \n     Trott, and William H. Rehnquist.\n       Your Administration has refused to accommodate the Senate's \n     request for documents in connection with the Estrada \n     nomination. That refusal was a matter of inquiry at the \n     confirmation hearing held on this nomination on September 26, \n     2002. Following the hearing, Senator Schumer wrote to the \n     Attorney General on January 23, 2003, to follow up on the \n     request.\n       In addition to requests for documents, Senators frequently \n     question judicial nominees during their confirmation hearings \n     to determine their judicial philosophy, views and \n     temperament. For example, then-Senator John Ashcroft asked \n     nominees: ``Which judge has served as a model for the way you \n     would conduct yourself as a judge and why?'' Mr. Estrada \n     refused to answer a similar question.\n       During consideration of President Clinton's judicial \n     nominees, Republican Senators asked repeated questions \n     regarding nominees' judicial philosophy, views on legal \n     matters, and approaches to interpreting the Constitution. \n     They insisted on and received answers. During his \n     consideration before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. \n     Estrada failed to answer these kinds of questions. These \n     questions have not only been routinely asked by the Senate, \n     they have been routinely answered by other nominees--\n     including other nominees from your Administration.\n       For the Senate to make an informed decision about Mr. \n     Estrada's nomination, it is essential that we receive the \n     information requested and answers to these basic legal \n     questions. Specifically we ask:\n       1. that you instruct the Department of Justice to \n     accommodate the requests for documents immediately so that \n     the hearing process can be completed and the Senate can have \n     a more complete record on which to consider this nomination; \n     and\n       2. that Mr. Estrada answer the questions that he refused to \n     answer during his Judiciary Committee hearing to allow for a \n     credible review of his judicial philosophy and legal views.\n       We would appreciate your personal attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Daschle.\n     Patrick Leahy.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to this day after day \nafter day. It is clear this is a game. It is a bad game. If they don't \nlike the answers Mr. Estrada has given, vote against him. That is the \nremedy here. Don't filibuster. Don't explode this body into always \nhaving filibusters on any judge who may be controversial on one side or \nthe other. Vote against him. Talk against him, like we have had plenty \nof. Then you have an absolute right to vote against him if you want to.\n  Now, let me go back through some of the things we were talking about. \nOn May 15, 2002, Senator Leahy sent the following letter to Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft:\n\n       In connection with the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, I write \n     to request that the Department of Justice send to the \n     Judiciary Committee appeal recommendations, certiorari \n     recommendations, and amicus recommendations Mr. Estrada \n     worked on while at the Department of Justice. This should \n     assist the Committee in considering this nomination.\n\n  On June 5, in a letter from the Department of Justice, they answered \nthe then-Chairman Leahy's letter:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman:\n       This is in response to your letter dated May 15, 2002, \n     requesting appeal recommendations, certiorari \n     recommendations, and amicus recommendations that Miguel \n     Estrada worked on when he was employed at the Department of \n     Justice.\n       The categories of documents you have requested are among \n     the most highly privileged and deliberative documents \n     generated within the Department of Justice. The Solicitor \n     General must have the benefit of candid and confidential \n     advice in order to discharge his critical responsibility of \n     deciding what appeals the Government will take and what \n     positions the Government will adopt in pending litigation. \n     Attorneys like Mr. Estrada who serve as Assistants to the \n     Solicitor General are asked to render candid, unbiased, and \n     professional advice about the merits of potential appeals.\n       They do so by preparing exactly the kinds of recommendation \n     memoranda you have requested. These documents review the \n     substantive legal issues in a case, the broader \n     jurisprudential implications of the case, policy \n     considerations, the strength of the factual record, and the \n     overall likelihood of success on appeal.\n       If highly privileged and deliberative documents of this \n     kind are not shielded from disclosure, the Department will \n     face the grave danger that Assistants to the Solicitor \n     General, and others in comparable positions, will be chilled \n     in the future from providing the candid and independent \n     analysis that is essential to high-level decisionmaking. As \n     the unanimous Supreme Court recognized: ``Human experience \n     teaches that those who\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\n     expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper \n     candor with a concern for appearances and for their own \n     interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process.'' \n     United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 705 (1974). The Court \n     observed that ``the importance of this confidentiality is too \n     plain to require further discussion.'' Simply put, the \n     Department cannot function properly if our attorneys write \n     these kinds of documents with one eye focused on the effect \n     that their words, if made public, might have on their \n     qualification for future office.\n       For these reasons, the Department has a longstanding \n     policy--which has endured across administrations of both \n     parties--of declining to release publicly or make available \n     to Congress the kinds of documents you have requested.\n       We trust that you will appreciate the important \n     institutional interests that lead us to decline your request. \n     In our judgment, the Committee has had ample time and \n     alternative means for obtaining assessments of how Mr. \n     Estrada's performance as an Assistant to the Solicitor \n     General bears on the merits of his nomination. In particular, \n     you have been free to inquire of the Solicitors General under \n     whom Mr. Estrada served their views as to his qualifications \n     for the position to which he has been nominated.\n       On January 25, 2002, you promised a Committee hearing for \n     Mr. Estrada this year. So that the Committee can meet our \n     commitment, we would request that you contact me or Judge \n     Gonzales as soon as possible to discuss this matter if you \n     have any questions or concerns.\n\n  That is the letter from the Justice Department in response to the \nletter Senator Leahy sent on May 15. Apparently, at the hearing this \nissue was raised again, and the Department of Justice responded to \nChairman Leahy again on October 8, 2002:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman:\n       During the hearing on September 26, 2002, on the nomination \n     of Miguel A. Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit, you and Senator Schumer \n     restated your request that the Department of Justice disclose \n     certain confidential and privileged appeal, certiorari, and \n     amicus memoranda that Mr. Estrada authored when he was a \n     career lawyer in the Office of the Solicitor General.\n       As we indicated in our letter of June 5, 2002, we must \n     respectfully decline your request. The relevant historical, \n     policy, and legal considerations implicated by your request \n     demonstrate that disclosure of these memoranda from the \n     Office of the Solicitor General would undermine the integrity \n     of the decisionmaking process in that Office.\n       The Committee's request threatens the proper functioning of \n     the Office of the Solicitor General. Indeed, all seven living \n     former Solicitors General--from Archibald Cox to Seth P. \n     Waxman--have written to the Committee and explained that the \n     Committee's broad and unprecedented request would have a \n     debilitating effect on the ability of the United States to \n     represent itself in litigation. Their letter explained that, \n     as Solicitors General, their ``decisionmaking process \n     required the unbridled, open exchange of ideas--an exchange \n     that simply cannot take place if attorneys have reason to \n     fear that their private recommendations are not private at \n     all, but vulnerable to public disclosure.''\n\n  That letter is quite detailed, Mr. President. It goes on to make this \ncase as persuasively as it can, and it gives a number of charts that \nmake the case as well, all to no avail, apparently, because our \ncolleagues think this is a good issue to stop and stymie this Hispanic \nnominee.\n  Now, that was October 8. Not until after we noticed the markup for \nMr. Estrada on January 23, 2003, did Senator Schumer write to the \nHonorable John Ashcroft at the Attorney General's Office, again \nrequesting these matters. And then the Department of Justice responded \nimmediately. We received it on January 23. Jamie E. Brown, Acting \nAssistant Attorney General, explained that they cannot do this. I have \nbeen informed that never have they given up appeal recommendations, \namicus recommendations, and certiorari recommendations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record \nin that order.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This responds to your letter dated May \n     15, 2002, requesting appeal recommendations, certiorari \n     recommendations, and amicus recommendations that Miguel \n     Estrada worked on when he was employed at the Department of \n     Justice.\n       The categories of documents that you have requested are \n     among the most highly privileged and deliberative documents \n     generated within the Department of Justice.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: During the hearing on September 26, \n     2002, on the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \n     you and Senator Schumer restated your request that the \n     Department of Justice disclose certain confidential and \n     privileged appeal, certiorari, and amicus memoranda that Mr. \n     Estrada authored when he was a career lawyer in the Office of \n     the Solicitor General.\n       As we indicated in our letter of June 5, 2002, we must \n     respectfully decline your request. The relevant historical, \n     policy, and legal considerations implicated by your request \n     demonstrate that disclosure of these memoranda from the \n     Office of the Solicitor General would undermine the integrity \n     of the decisionmaking process in that Office.\n       The Committee's request threatens the proper functioning of \n     the Office of the Solicitor General. Indeed, all seven living \n     former Solicitors General--from Archibald Cox to Seth P. \n     Waxman--have written to the Committee and explained that the \n     Committee's broad and unprecedented request would have a \n     debilitating effect on the ability of the United States to \n     represent itself in litigation. Their letter explained that, \n     as Solicitors General, their ``decisionmaking process \n     required the unbridled, open exchange of ideas--an exchange \n     that simply cannot take place if attorneys have reason to \n     fear that their private recommendations are not private at \n     all, but vulnerable to public disclosure.'' Thus, ``[a]ny \n     attempt to intrude into the Office's highly privileged \n     deliberations would come at the cost of the Solicitor \n     General's ability to defend vigorously the United States' \n     litigation interests--a cost that also would be borne by \n     Congress itself.''\n       Longstanding historical Senate practice reinforces the \n     position of the former Solicitors General that confidential, \n     deliberative documents from the Office of Solicitor General \n     have been, and should remain, confidential during \n     confirmation hearings. As the attached charts demonstrate, \n     since the beginning of the Carter Administration in 1977, the \n     Senate has approved 67 United States Court of Appeals \n     nominees who previously had worked in the Department of \n     Justice. Those 67 nominees--of whom 38 had no prior judicial \n     experience--include eight former lawyers with the Office of \n     the Solicitor General. Our review of each of these 67 \n     nominees' hearing records establishes that in none of\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\n     these cases did the Department of Justice produce internal \n     deliberative materials created by the nominee while a \n     Department lawyer. In fact, we could find no nominee for whom \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee even requested that the \n     Department produce such materials. The Committee's request \n     with respect to Mr. Estrada therefore is unprecedented.\n       Of particular relevance are the appellate-court nominees \n     who previously had been Assistants to the Solicitor General \n     or Deputy Solicitors General, and had not served as judges as \n     the time of their nomination--the same position Mr. Estrada \n     occupies now. The nominees, nominated by Presidents of both \n     political parties and confirmed by Senates controlled by both \n     political parties, are:\n       Samuel A. Alito Jr. (Assistant to the Solicitor General, \n     1981-85; confirmed to the Third Circuit, 1990);\n       Danny J. Boggs (Assistant to the Solicitor General, 1973-\n     75; confirmed to the Sixth Circuit, 1986);\n       William C. Bryson (Assistant to the Solicitor General, \n     1978-79; Deputy Solicitor General, 1986-94; confirmed to the \n     Federal Circuit, 1994);\n       Frank H. Easterbrook (Assistant to the Solicitor General, \n     1974-77; Deputy Solicitor General, 1978-79; confirmed to the \n     Seventh Circuit, 1985);\n       Daniel M. Friedman (Assistant to the Solicitor General, \n     1959-68; Deputy Solicitor General, 1968-78; confirmed to the \n     appellate division of the Court of Claims (later the Federal \n     Circuit), 1982);\n       Richard A. Posner (Assistant to the Solicitor General, \n     1965-67; confirmed to the Seventh Circuit, 1981); and\n       A. Raymond Randolph (Deputy Solicitor General, 1975-77; \n     confirmed to the D.C. Circuit, 1990).\n       In none of these cases did the Department of Justice \n     provide to the Committee the nominees' appeal, certiorari, or \n     amicus recommendations. And in none of these cases did the \n     Committee request that the Department do so.\n       The policy considerations implicated by the Committee's \n     request underscore the strength of the Department's position \n     and demonstrate that previous Senate Judiciary Committees \n     have recognized the essential, long-term interest of the \n     United States in protecting the integrity of such memoranda. \n     The need to ensure the integrity of the process by which the \n     Solicitor General makes litigation decisions for the United \n     States is extraordinarily important. As the former Solicitors \n     General explained, the interest in receiving honest, candid \n     assessments of possible litigation positions, agency \n     interests, and Supreme Court opinions would be severely \n     compromised by disclosure in this context. It is important \n     to add, furthermore, that memoranda written by Assistants \n     to the Solicitor General present legal arguments \n     supporting the litigation position of the United States, \n     not their personal views. These memoranda seek to \n     determine the legal arguments that are appropriate in \n     government briefs, not the legal or policy preferences of \n     their author.\n       Furthermore, the committee's need to assess a nominee's \n     performance, intellect, and integrity can be accommodated in \n     ways other than introducing into the deliberative process of \n     the Office of the Solicitor General. For example, the \n     Committee can review the nominee's written briefs and oral \n     arguments, consider the opinions of others who served in the \n     Office at the same time, and examine the nominee's written \n     performance reviews. In Mr. Estrada's case, for example, \n     there is a substantial body of information about his tenure \n     in the Office of the solicitor General. Former Solicitor \n     General Seth Waxman, who supervised Mr. Estrada, has written \n     to the Committee in support of his nomination. Mr. Waxman \n     wrote: ``During the time Mr. Estrada and I worked together, \n     he was a model of professionalism and competence. In no way \n     did I ever discern that the recommendations Mr. Estrada made \n     or the analyses he propounded were colored in any way by his \n     personal views--or indeed that they reflected anything other \n     than the long-term interests of the United States.''\n       Moreover, 14 of Mr. Estrada's former colleagues in the \n     Office of the Solicitor General have written the Committee to \n     emphasize his ability, collegiality, and integrity: ``We also \n     know Miguel to be a delightful and charming colleague, \n     someone who can engage in open, honest, and respectful \n     discussion of legal issues with others, regardless of their \n     ideological perspectives. Based on our experience as his \n     colleagues in the Solicitor General's office, we are \n     confident that he possesses the temperament, character, and \n     qualities of fairness and respect necessary to be an \n     exemplary judge. In combination, Miguel's exceptional legal \n     ability and talent, his character and integrity, and his deep \n     and varied experience as a public servant and in private \n     practice make him an excellent candidate for service on the \n     federal bench.''\n       Finally, Mr. Estrada has sent the Judiciary Committee \n     copies of his performance evaluations from his tenure in the \n     Office. These documents indicate that Mr. Estrada's \n     supervisors gave him ratings of ``outstanding''--the highest \n     possible score--in every category for every evaluation \n     period.\n       It bears emphasis that the long-standing historical \n     practice, policy considerations and views of the former \n     Solicitors General are fully supported by applicable legal \n     principles. At the outset, it is important to note that the \n     memoranda sought by the Committee are indisputably within the \n     scope of the deliberative process, attorney-client, and \n     attorney working-product privileges. The Supreme Court has \n     recognized ``the valid need for protection of communications \n     between high Government officials and those who advise and \n     assist them in the performance of their manifold duties.'' \n     Houchins v. KQED, 438 U.S. 1, 35 n.27 (1978). Indeed, the \n     Court has explained that ``the importance of this \n     confidentiality is too plain to require further discussion. \n     Human experience teaches that those who expect public \n     dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a \n     concern for appearances and for their own interests to the \n     detriment of the decisionmaking process.'' Id. (internal \n     quotation omitted). The deliberative process privileges's \n     ultimate purpose is to prevent injury to the quality of \n     agency decisions by allowing government officials freedom to \n     debate alternative approaches in private. NLRB v. Sears, \n     Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 151 (1975). Based on these \n     principles, courts have long recognized the Executive \n     Branch's authority to protect the integrity of documents and \n     other materials which would reveal advisory opinions, \n     recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a \n     process by which governmental decisions and policies are \n     formulated. See In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 737 (D.C. \n     Cir. 1997).\n       As a matter of law and tradition, these privileges can be \n     overcome only when Congress establishes a ``demonstrably \n     critical'' need for the requested information. Senate Select \n     Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, 498 \n     F.2d 725, 731 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (en banc). It is insufficient \n     for the requested material merely to ``have some arguable \n     relevance'' to appropriate Congressional function. Id. at \n     733. In assessing whether Congress' possesses a \n     ``demonstrably critical'' need for the material in question, \n     one crucial consideration is whether Congress can obtain \n     reasonably equivalent information from alternative sources \n     that would satisfy its legitimate needs. In this instance, we \n     again note that the Committee has full access to Mr. \n     Estrada's briefs and oral arguments, to the information \n     provided by Mr. Waxman, to the letter from former colleagues \n     in the Solicitor General's office, and to his performance \n     reviews. The Committee also is free to contact any of Mr. \n     Estrada's former supervisors and colleagues in the Office of \n     the Solicitor General to seek further information about Mr. \n     Estrada's temperament, fairness, analytical skills and \n     abilities or any other matters the Committee appropriately \n     deems relevant to its inquiry. Because the Committee has \n     adequate sources of information about Mr. Estrada, among \n     other reasons, it cannot establish the ``demonstrably \n     critical'' need for the deliberative materials in question.\n       None of the seven examples cited during Mr. Estrada's \n     hearing as precedent for the Committee's request--the \n     nominations of Judge Frank Easterbrook to the Seventh \n     Circuit, Judge Robert Bork and Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist to the Supreme Court, Benjamin Civiletti to be \n     Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, William \n     Bradford Reynolds to be Associate Attorney General, Judge \n     Stephen Trott to the Ninth Circuit, and Jeffrey Holmstead to \n     be Assistant Administrator at the Environmental Protection \n     Agency--supports the Committee's request in this matter.\n       Of the seven cited nominees, the hearings of only two--\n     Judge Bork and Judge Easterbrook--involved documents from \n     their service in the Office of Solicitor General. Senator \n     Schumer placed into Mr. Estrada's hearing record a single, \n     two-page amicus recommendation memorandum that Judge \n     Easterbrook authored as an Assistant to the Solicitor \n     General. The official record of Judge Easterbrook's \n     confirmation hearing contains no references to this document, \n     and based on a comprehensive review of the Department's \n     files, we do not believe that the Department authorized its \n     release in connection with Judge Easterbrook's nomination. \n     Senator Schumer's possession of this memorandum does not \n     suggest that the Department waived applicable privileges and \n     authorized its disclosure in connection with Judge \n     Easterbrook's or any other nomination.\n       The hearing record of Judge Bork's nomination to the \n     Supreme Court demonstrates that the Committee received access \n     to a limited number of documents related to three specific \n     subjects of heightened interest to the Committee, two of \n     which were related to Judge Bork's involvement in Watergate-\n     related issues and triggered specific concerns by the \n     Committee. The vast majority of memoranda authored or \n     received by Judge Bork when he served as Solicitor General \n     were neither sought nor produced. And the limited category of \n     documents that were produced to the Committee did not reveal \n     the internal deliberative recommendations or analysis of \n     Assistants to the Solicitor General regarding appeal, \n     certiorari, or amicus recommendations in pending cases.\n       The remaining five nominations cited at the hearing \n     similarly do not justify the disclosure of deliberative \n     material authored by Mr. Estrada. None of the limited \n     documents disclosed in the hearings for those five \n     nominations involved deliberative memoranda from the Office \n     of the Solicitor General. The Committee with respect to those \n     five nominations requested specific documents primarily \n     related to allegations of misconduct or malfeasance \n     identified by the Committee. Moreover, as noted above, with \n     respect to\n\n[[Page S2262]]\n\n     the nomination of Judge Trott, the Committee requested \n     documents wholly unrelated to Judge Trott's service with the \n     Department. Again, the vast majority of deliberative \n     memoranda authored or received by these nominees where never \n     sought or received by the Committee. In sum, the existence of \n     a few isolated examples where the Executive Branch on \n     occasion accommodated a Committee's targeted requests for \n     very specific information does not in any way alter the \n     fundamental and long-standing principle that memoranda from \n     Office of Solicitor General--and deliberative Department of \n     Justice materials more broadly--must remain protected in the \n     confirmation context so as to maintain the integrity of the \n     Executive Branch's decisionmaking process.\n       In conclusion, we emphasize that the Department of Justice \n     appreciates and profoundly respects the Judiciary Committee's \n     legitimate need to evaluate Mr. Estrada's qualifications for \n     the federal bench. We again suggest, however, that the \n     information currently available is more than adequate to \n     allow the Committee to determine whether Mr. Estrada is \n     qualified to be a federal judge.\n       Thank you for considering the Department's views on this \n     matter. Mr. Estrada's nomination for a position on an \n     important federal court of appeals has now been pending for \n     518 days. There is no disagreement about the fact that he is \n     a talented, experienced and exceptionally well-qualified \n     nominee with strong and widespread bipartisan support. In \n     fact, after an intensive investigation, the American Bar \n     Association found Mr. Estrada to be unanimously well-\n     qualified for a judgeship on the District of Columbia \n     Circuit. We sincerely hope that the Committee and the Senate \n     will approve Mr. Estrada's nomination before the close of the \n     107th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel J. Bryant,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Jan. 23, 2003.\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Schumer: I am responding to your letter dated \n     January 23, 2003, in which you once again requested that the \n     Department disclose the confidential and privileged appeal, \n     certiorari and amicus memoranda that Miguel Estrada authored \n     when he was a career lawyer in the Office of the Solicitor \n     General. You continue to insist that disclosure of this \n     sensitive material is necessary to allow you adequately to \n     address Mr. Estrada's nomination to the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit--a nomination \n     that has been pending for some 624 days. As you know, Mr. \n     Estrada has received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating \n     from the American Bar Association, the ABA's highest rating.\n       We addressed fully the assertions made in your most recent \n     correspondence in our previous letters to you dated June 5, \n     2002, and October 8, 2002 (attached herewith). Our previous \n     explanations remain equally applicable today, and we \n     therefore must again respectfully decline your request. As we \n     have explained, the relevant historical, policy and legal \n     considerations implicated by your request establish that \n     disclosure of these memoranda from the Office of Solicitor \n     General would undermine the integrity of the decision making \n     process in that Office. Notwithstanding our previous letters, \n     several specific items in your letter merit discussion.\n       At Mr. Estrada's hearing, you asserted that the Department \n     disclosed memoranda written by Judge Easterbrook in \n     connection with his confirmation hearing. In response to that \n     claim, as we noted in our letter of October 8, 2002, we \n     comprehensively reviewed the Department's files and the \n     public record of Judge Easterbrook's confirmation hearing and \n     we found absolutely no evidence that the Department \n     authorized the release of these memoranda in connection with \n     Judge Easterbrook's nomination. Your most recent letter now \n     asserts that the Easterbrook documents ``apparently'' were \n     provided to the Committee in connection with Judge Bork's \n     nomination. However, the public record of Judge Bork's \n     confirmation hearings contains no mention of the Easterbrook \n     memoranda you reference. As we explained previously, your \n     mere possession of these documents does not suggest that the \n     Department waived applicable privileges nor authorized their \n     disclosure in connection with either nomination.\n       You also suggest in your letter that the Administration's \n     decision to disclose legal memoranda from the White House \n     Counsel's Office in connection with the nomination of Jeffrey \n     Holmstead to serve as Assistant Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency serves as precedent for \n     disclosing Mr. Estrada's highly privileged work product. As \n     you may be aware, the White House initially declined to \n     provide all of Mr. Holmstead's files as requested by the \n     Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on the basis \n     of the deliberative process, attorney-client and work product \n     privileges. In response, the Environment Committee, based on \n     its particularized concerns and allegation of misconduct \n     regarding one specific subject, requested a small subset of \n     documents related only to that matter. Because of the \n     specificity of the Environment Committee's concerns, the \n     White House permitted the Committee to review that limited \n     subset of materials, which answered the allegation in \n     question. This example, if anything, further demonstrates the \n     overbreadth and impropriety of the current request--a request \n     that some have characterized as a fishing expedition \n     requesting all documents authored by Mr. Estrada about all \n     subjects during his entire tenure in the Office.\n       Finally, we respectfully submit that, despite your view to \n     the contrary, your request threatens the proper functioning \n     of the Office of the Solicitor General. All seven living \n     former Solicitors General, including Archibald Cox, Drew \n     Days, Walter Dellinger and Seth Waxman, have written to the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee and explained the debilitating \n     impact your request would have on the ability of the Office \n     to represent the United States in litigation. The letter--\n     authored by distinguished lawyers of both parties--noted that \n     their ``decisionmaking process required the unbridled, open \n     exchange of ideas--an exchange that simply cannot take place \n     if attorneys have reason to fear that their private \n     recommendations are not private at all, but vulnerable to \n     public disclosure.'' While we respect your right to disagree \n     with these seven former Solicitors General, we must defer to \n     their considered judgments about the impact of disclosure \n     based on their collective experience of decades heading the \n     Office. Thus, we respectfully adhere to our previous decision \n     to protect these highly privileged documents from disclosure.\n       Thank you for considering the Department's views on this \n     matter. As we have noted previously, the public record is \n     more than adequate for the Committee to evaluate Mr. \n     Estrada's qualifications to be a Circuit Judge on the D.C. \n     Circuit. We look forward to Mr. Estrada's prompt \n     consideration by the Committee and confirmation by the full \n     Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jamie E. Brown,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to make one or two other points, and \nthen I understand Senator Kyl is here and I hope he can be heard. I ask \nunanimous consent that he be recognized after me.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. All right. Here we are in the middle of an unprecedented \nfilibuster. We have heard a lot of arguments and many repeated \narguments. We have heard Mr. Estrada ``has not answered the Senators' \nquestions.'' Well, he has. They asked question after question at the \nhearing--one that they conducted and they controlled. Any Senator who \nwas not satisfied, and had additional questions, had the opportunity to \nsend additional questions. Well, they did. Two Senators--only two of \nthem--sent Mr. Estrada followup questions. Senators Durbin and Kennedy \nasked multiple questions. Mr. Estrada answered these, and answered them \nfully.\n  Here is what is unfair. If they don't like the answers, as I have \nsaid, my Democratic colleagues have a remedy; they can vote against \nhim. That is their right. If that is what they want to do, that is the \nproper exercise of their constitutional duty. But to simply deny the \nSenate a vote is unfair to the nominee, unfair to this body, unfair to \nthe President, and unfair to a majority of Senators who want to vote \nfor this man and exercise their constitutional duty under article II, \nsection 2. This is an abuse of the debate privileges of this body. This \nis simply an abuse by the minority. It is nothing more than what some \nwould call the tyranny of the minority. It is the first time in the \nhistory of this country that an appeals court nominee has been \nfilibustered. It is a doggone shame the first Hispanic ever nominated \nto the Circuit Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia happens to \nbe the nominee here. This is against our constitutional duty and \nagainst the spirit of what we are elected to do. We are supposed to \nadvise and consent. Consent means Senators can vote against or they can \nvote for. It doesn't mean advise and filibuster. It doesn't mean advise \nand obstruct.\n  I will say it again. The Democrats have asked their questions and \nthey have gotten their answers. If they don't like the answers, they \ncan vote against the nominee. But don't continue to obstruct. It is \nsimply not fair.\n  Mr. President, I think any fair observer who looks at the transcript \nof this hearing, and looks at those questions and answers, will have to \nadmit he answered their questions. Admittedly, I suspect he did not \nanswer them the way they wanted him to. That is, they could not dig up \nany dirt on him. So what are they doing now? Trying to\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\nsee if, through a fishing expedition, they can find some documents \nwhere they can. That is offensive. To ask for confidential, privileged \ndocuments from the Solicitor General's Office in spite of the warning \nof seven former Solicitors General, four of whom are leading Democrat \nattorneys who vociferously say you should not do that, that would be \nvery harmful and detrimental to the process. They have ignored those \nrecommendations.\n  Any fair observer who looks at these questions and answers will have \nto say he answered their questions, maybe not the way they wanted him \nto, but he answered them as a deliberative person would, and as most \nother nominees have answered the same type of questions. He answered \nthem in a very intelligent, worthwhile fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I wish to expand on what the Senator from Utah was \njust talking about. To put this in context, I remind my colleagues we \nare talking about the nomination of a very distinguished lawyer, Miguel \nEstrada, by President Bush to serve on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  There have been two primary objections recently raised by Members of \nthe other side of the aisle to this nomination. The first includes a \nrecitation of a long list of nominees of previous Presidents--I presume \nprimarily President Clinton--who allegedly were not considered by the \nRepublicans. I do not have the information. It has not been given to \nme, so I cannot vouch for its authenticity. But if that is the basis \nfor denying a vote to Mr. Estrada, then it is nothing more than \nretribution or spite.\n  I cannot believe that is the motivation of any of my colleagues on \nthe other side. I refuse to believe that. So of what relevance is it \nthat in previous Congresses some other President's nominee was or was \nnot given a vote? What is the relevance to this individual, Miguel \nEstrada, who, by everyone's admission, is an extraordinarily well \nqualified lawyer? It has no relevance at all.\n  The other line of thought is that he has not answered questions, and \nthat is what Senator Hatch was just talking about. He answered every \nquestion that was asked of him. He was in a hearing from 10:06 a.m. \nuntil 5:25 p.m. There were other candidates on the panel with him, but \nhardly any questions were asked of them. Almost all of the questions \nwere asked of Miguel Estrada. He answered them all, until there were \nnot any more to be asked.\n  Then there was the questionnaire. Senator Hatch noted the questions \nthat have been asked by Senators in writing, in addition to the others. \nThere was the questionnaire from the Judiciary Committee with 25 pages \nof answers. They are all right here. I will not suggest they be printed \nin the Record because I presume they already have. Every question was \nanswered fully and satisfactorily, as far as I am concerned.\n  I think one of them is especially interesting. It used to be there \nwas not a litmus test for judges. When President Reagan was nominating \njudges, some people on the other side thought President Reagan was \nasking these nominees their opinions on how they might rule on a case. \nThey said that was a litmus test and that would be wrong. They were \nwrong. He never had such a litmus test. But the committee has had a \nquestion in its file ever since--and I think even before then--that has \nbeen asked of every single nominee, and this is one of the questions to \nwhich Miguel Estrada responded.\n  Let me read the question and his answer. The question is: Has anyone \ninvolved in the process of selecting you as a judicial nominee \ndiscussed with you any specific case, legal issue, or question in a \nmanner that could reasonably be interpreted as asking you how you would \nrule on such case, issue, or question? If so, please explain fully.\n  Answer: No.\n  Mr. President, that is just about all he got in the hearing by the \nmembers of the other side of the aisle in the Judiciary Committee on \nhow he would rule and what he felt about certain specific cases, legal \nissues, or questions. Specific cases were mentioned by name. Specific \nhypothetical questions were asked of him. Apparently, it is not OK for \nthe President to find out how a candidate might feel about an issue, \nbut Senators, by golly, we have the right and, in fact, it is so \nimportant to us, or to some of the body, that we are going to deny a \nnominee a vote even; we are going to deny the other Senators to have \nthe opportunity to vote yes or no if we did not like the way he \nanswered one of those questions.\n\n  Senator Hatch is right; it is not that he did not answer the \nquestions. It is that some people did not like his answers to the \nquestions. If so, vote no, but do not deny everyone else the \nopportunity to vote, and that is what is going on here. It is called a \nfilibuster.\n  Our friends on the Democratic side have acknowledged that is exactly \nwhat they are engaged in: a filibuster of a judge. That is \nfundamentally wrong. It destroys the comity between the three branches \nof Government. It seeks to modify the majority vote confirmation \nprocess to an extra-majority requirement. It is going to poison the \nconsideration of nominees of every President from here on, Democrat or \nRepublican. This is one of those issues which, when once let out, you \ncan never bring back; the horse will have been out of the barn.\n  Never in the history of the Senate has a partisan filibuster \nsucceeded in preventing the confirmation of a judge. That is what is at \nstake here. Of course, also at stake is the confirmation of a very \ndecent, very fine, very forthright, and highly qualified candidate for \njudge.\n  There was one other criticism I noticed early on, but I have not \nheard it recently, and that is he had no prior judicial experience. \nSenator Hatch pointed out the literally scores of Federal judges who \nbecame a judge when they were a lawyer. Not everybody can be born a \njudge, you see. First, you have to be a lawyer, and then somebody has \nto appoint you judge. So not everybody has experience as a judge when \nthey are asked to be a judge.\n  Current members of the U.S. Supreme Court, in fact, five out of the \nnine members of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the court to which Mr. \nEstrada is being nominated, were not judges before they were nominated.\n  Mr. Estrada is a Hispanic lawyer. Are we going to create a new bar \nfor minority lawyers? You have to be a judge before you can be elevated \nto the next level of the court? Not very many minority lawyers have \nbeen appointed or nominated as judges. President Bush is nominating a \nlot of them, that is true, but they are not judges now; they are \nlawyers. Are we going to create a bar that says if you are not already \na judge, you cannot become a judge in the next level of the court?\n  I do not want to see us setting a glass ceiling for minorities just \nbecause not as many of them have gotten to be judges. I think that is a \nvery pernicious argument made with respect to Miguel Estrada. Five of \nthe nine members of the court were not judges before they were \nnominated to serve. Why does it matter with respect to Miguel Estrada? \nI did not hear arguments made from the other side with respect to those \nnominees, so why with regard to Miguel Estrada? It is not right.\n  I quoted yesterday, when the Senator from Vermont was on the floor, \nhis own words, so I feel it appropriate to mention them again. He \nhimself, the former chairman, now ranking member, of the Judiciary \nCommittee said what many of the other leaders on the other side of the \naisle have said: That filibustering a judge is wrong. And the Senator \nfrom Vermont said he would oppose--strongly oppose, I believe were his \nwords--any filibuster of a judge regardless of whether he supported the \nnominee. You can always vote yes or no, but you should at least vote to \ninvoke cloture.\n  Madam President, I will give you an example. Twice I voted to invoke \ncloture so we could come to a vote on two of President Clinton's \nnominees. I supported one; I opposed the other. That is our right. I \nhave good reasons for opposing the judge I opposed, but I believed my \ncolleagues needed or had the right to vote on both of the candidates, \nand so I voted for cloture in both cases. That is the same point the \nSenator from Vermont made earlier: That we should vote for cloture and \nhave an up-or-down vote.\n  I will later bring to the floor the literally scores of statements by \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\nover the years who have made the point over and over that filibustering \na judge is wrong, that they would oppose it regardless of how they felt \nabout the nominee, and that they would vote to invoke cloture.\n  What has changed with Miguel Estrada? Why is he different? Why all of \na sudden has their strongly held opinion, which was expressed before, \nchanged? It is not that my colleagues are not consistent. Obviously, \nthey want to be consistent. So it must be something else. It must be \nthat in this nominee they see something very bad. They must see a \nreason why we should not even be allowed to vote on the nominee. It is \nso bad with Miguel Estrada that they are not willing to put it to a \nvote. They have to prevent the vote from occurring.\n  What is it about Miguel Estrada that is so dangerous or so bad? If my \ncolleagues say it is not about Miguel Estrada, it is the process, he \nwould not answer the questions, Senator Hatch and I have already \nresponded to that. He answered every question he was asked. Any more \nquestions?\n  As Senator Hatch said, the problem is they do not necessarily like \nall the answers. That is their right. We do not all agree with each \nother. That is why we have votes and the majority wins.\n  I get back to the question, Why is it different with Miguel Estrada? \nThere were 30 questions asked in the hearing that was held, and he \nanswered them all. Maybe they did not like the answers. So vote no. But \nwhy would the other side deny the right of the Senators to cast a vote \non the nominee?\n  At the end of the day, the American people are going to look at this \nand wonder what is going on, what is this all about. Why will a \nminority of the Senate not agree to let the others vote? Is it because \nthe candidate is not well qualified? No. This candidate had the highest \nrating that the American Bar Association can give a candidate.\n  Is it that he does not have any experience? No. He is one of the most \nexperienced lawyers in the country. In fact, he has argued at least 15 \ncases to the U.S. Supreme Court. I practiced law for 20 years and only \nwent to the Supreme Court three times, which is pretty good. Most \nlawyers never get there. Fifteen times he has argued cases.\n  He answered every question that was asked of him. He has been \nstrongly recommended by members of the bench and bar all over the \ncountry, Democrats and Republicans, including members of the former \nDemocratic administration.\n  There has been a question raised about when he was an Assistant \nSolicitor General and was providing advice to his seniors, should his \nconfidential memos be released to the public? For the first time, our \ncolleagues on the other side say, oh, yes, we want to see all of that.\n  Now, I would kind of like to see the staff memos going to the \nSenators on the other side. Would that be fair? Would that be right? \nNo, it really would not. Much as I would like to see what kind of \nadvice they are getting, that would not be right.\n  What about someday when very highly qualified staff of some of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to be nominated for \nthe court? That happens actually fairly frequently. Staff of the \nJudiciary Committee have been nominated to various courts. In fact, one \nof them serves no less than on the U.S. Supreme Court. How about asking \nfor the memos that he sent to his boss advising his boss on various \nissues prior to his confirmation? What would we get there? I think we \nwould get pushed back by Members saying, wait a minute, I was asking \nfor his personal advice. I was asking for his judgment. I was not \nasking him for what he necessarily believed personally, and what he \ntold me cannot be taken as something he personally believed but rather \nwhat he thought was the best advice for me on this particular issue. \nThat is why our employees are protected from having to disclose all of \nthe information they give us as their best judgment on different \nissues, because we are not asking them necessarily what they believe in \ntheir head or their heart. We are asking them for what the law is on \nthis, what their recommendation is as to what I should do on this, \nknowing my views, not theirs.\n\n  So to ask a young lawyer in the Solicitor General's Office to \ndisclose all of the advice that he gave his bosses is nothing more than \nan unprecedented fishing expedition.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, is this the \nprecedent that they want to create? When they seek to have one of their \nstaff members nominated to a high court, do they expect to see a \nrequest for all of the memos that this staff person gave to them \nbecause they just might be useful in opposing the nomination? Maybe he \nsaid something that we could pick apart somehow or another.\n  That is what is going on, and that is why four Democratic Solicitors \nGeneral and three Republican Solicitors General, those who are living \ntoday, all wrote a letter unanimously saying this should not be done \nand all of them would have recommended against it.\n  I happened to work for one of the Solicitors General who is no longer \nalive. One of the things he told me over and over again was that this \nis an office considered by some to be the tenth Justice on the Court. \nThe Solicitor General is literally almost a member of the Court in a \nsense because of the objectivity and forthrightness with which he or \nshe represents the views of the Government before the Court.\n  The Court often solicits a brief from the Solicitor General saying, \nwe have heard from both sides in this case but we would like to hear \nfrom the lawyer for the Government, the Solicitor General, who is \nsupposed to be a very honest, forthright, and objective person. That is \nthe office in which Miguel Estrada was working.\n  If we ever get to the point where the decisions made by the Solicitor \nGeneral, based upon the advice from the lawyers that work for him, do \nnot represent the best objective advice, do not represent the best \ntruth and the proper reading of the law as they can bring forth but, \nrather, now must take into consideration political considerations that \narise from the fact that these memos and this advice would be disclosed \npublicly, the Solicitor General is no longer going to be deemed the \n``tenth Justice.''\n  The Government is no longer going to be solicited for its advice to \nthe Court on these important matters because the consideration would \nbe, well, what did they have to consider politically since the whole \nworld is going to read these memos and is going to know what the advice \nwas that was given. It does not work that way. It cannot. That is why \nit would be wrong.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side know that it would be wrong. \nThey know they are never going to get the memos. They know they should \nnot get the memoranda. But because they can ask for it knowing that it \nis not going to come, they have an excuse to be able to say, gee, we do \nnot have all the information we need.\n  I do not think that is the motivation of any of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle because I think they realize this is not \nsomething that historically has been requested and should be requested.\n  So when you parse out all of the different objections to Miguel \nEstrada, it all boils down to abstract process and, from some of the \noutside groups anyway, retribution. It has nothing to do with his \nqualifications. It seems to me that common decency and fairness would \ncause each one of the 100 of us to look deep within ourselves and say \nmaybe we vote yes, maybe we vote no on his nomination, but we should \nnot deny him a vote. That is partisanship and negativity and \nobstructionism that is not worthy of the Senate. So we should not do \nthat.\n\n  We should agree to let this nominee be voted on, cast the vote we \nbelieve is appropriate, and then move on with the Nation's business. At \na time when we may well be on the brink of engaging in military \nconflict, and the President has a great many issues on his agenda to \ndeal with in that regard, I think it is unseemly for the Senate to be \nholding up, filibustering, one of his highly qualified nominees to the \nDC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  As the Senator from Nevada said earlier today, everything has been \nsaid, it is just that everybody has not said it. Fine. Come on down and \nsay it so we can get on with the vote, confirm Judge Miguel Estrada, \nand move on with the Nation's business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if this were a matter of retribution, it \nwould have started a long time ago.\n  Senator Daschle came to the floor after we took the majority in the \nSenate and said that as it related to judicial nominations this was not \npayback time; we were not going to treat the then-minority, the \nRepublicans, as we were treated when we were in the minority. To show \nthat we were true to our word, we approved 100 nominees during the \nshort time we had the majority of the Senate.\n  I read into the Record earlier today the scores of judicial nominees \nwho did not receive hearings, who waited and never got a vote on their \nnominations. They are out practicing law someplace. This is not \nretribution.\n\n  Madam President, once in a while I try to come up with something that \nhas not been said on the Senate floor during the last several days. My \nfriend from Arizona said: Everything has been said, but not everyone \nhas said it. I have come up with something that has not been said, in \nresponse to what my friend from Utah and others have said about this \nABA rating that Estrada has. The Republicans thought so much of the ABA \nrating that when they had the majority, they decided to do away with \nit. But now they have decided it is a good thing.\n  It is true, Estrada received a well-qualified rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association. I think everyone acknowledges that the ABA \nshould not completely supplant the Senate's role. Those on the other \nside have indicated the ABA rating of Mr. Estrada should be afforded \ngreat weight. I think it should be afforded some weight. Some have \nimplied it should take the ABA's word for it when it comes to Estrada \nand simply limit our role in reviewing his record because he got a \nwell-qualified rating from the ABA.\n  The American Bar Association rating is a useful tool for the Senate. \nBut that is all it is, a tool. It is not a replacement for the Senate \nexercising its own independent judgment regarding a nominee's \nsuitability for the second highest court in the land. There are good \nreasons for that. The best reason is the Constitution, Mr. President.\n  I am sorry, I referred to the Presiding Officer as a ``Mister.'' I \nhave the greatest respect for the Senator from North Carolina, having \none of the most distinguished records of any Senator who has come to \nthe Senate, having served in so many different Cabinet positions that \nthey are difficult to name; and, in addition, the highly visible role \nthe Senator from North Carolina has held in different administrations. \nShe has been head of one of the greatest organizations in the history \nof the world, the American Red Cross. I know who is presiding, and I \nwas just reading from my notes and apologize for referring to the \nSenator as ``Mr. President.''\n  The best reason we do not agree with the majority is the \nConstitution. The Constitution assigns the role of evaluating a nominee \nto the Senate--not to the American Bar Association. In addition, if you \nlook at the ABA process, it is far from perfect. The ABA delegates the \nreview of potential nominees to one individual member of the ABA \ncommittee for each circuit. In effect, these nominations that the \nPresident gives us, no matter what party, go to one lawyer in the ABA, \nand that lawyer makes a recommendation. The ABA delegates that review \nto one individual who nominates each nominee and appoints to the ABA a \nrecommended rating of that nominee's qualifications.\n  In this instance, a man by the name of Fred Fielding was in charge of \nevaluating potential nominees for the DC Circuit at the time Miguel \nEstrada was under consideration by the White House. In this role, Mr. \nFielding was in charge of evaluating Mr. Estrada's qualification and \nwas in charge of recommending a rating to the ABA. He recommended well-\nqualified. The ABA places heavy reliance upon the recommendation of \npeople such as Mr. Fielding and approved Fielding's recommendation \nunanimously.\n  There have been some concerns about how this ABA process works and \nhow it will work in this case. In this case, Mr. Fielding, at the same \ntime he was evaluating DC Circuit Court nominees such as Miguel \nEstrada, continued to be heavily involved in partisan politics. He was \ncounsel to the Republican National Committee for the Republican \nNational Convention of 2000 and served on the Bush-Cheney transition \nteam in 2000. At the same time he was serving on the ABA committee that \nevaluated DC nominees, Mr. Fielding cofounded, with C. Boyden Gray, \nsomething called the Committee for Justice.\n\n  We all know C. Boyden Gray has been a long-time, very partisan \nRepublican. There is nothing wrong with that. But that is a fact of \nlife. This organization was founded to help the White House with the \npublic relations effort to pack the Federal bench with extreme judges. \nThey also founded it to run ads to intimidate Democrats from exercising \ntheir constitutional duty to scrutinize the President's judicial \nnominees. Ads are now run to that effect, saying Senate Democrats are \nreally bad. The ads are paid for by the Committee for Justice, which is \nthis front that has been established by Fred Fielding and Boyden Gray. \nTheir ads label Members of this Chamber as ``liberal extremists'' and \n``anti-Hispanic'' even though the Hispanic Caucus has said Miguel \nEstrada should not be placed in the DC Circuit.\n  These ads run by this organization that is led by Fielding and Gray \nare unfortunate. It is a right that Fielding and Gray have to engage in \nthese activities to mislead the American people. They have that right. \nBut it does call into question whether someone so heavily steeped in \npartisan activities can objectively and impartially evaluate nominees' \nqualifications to the second highest court in the land.\n  This man, Fred Fielding, was the person who gave Estrada the \nrecommendation while he was doing this. He was forming a committee he \ncalls Committee for Justice, with Boyden Gray, another partisan \nRepublican, and the purpose was to pack the bench with right-wing \nconservative judges. They also raised money so that if someone \ndisagreed with them, they would run ads and intimidate them into \nagreeing with them. It does call into question whether someone so \nheavily steeped in partisan activities can objectively and impartially \nevaluate the qualifications of the nominees of the second highest court \nin the land.\n  The Senate is not privy to Mr. Estrada's ABA report, and we have no \nway to evaluate how Mr. Fielding arrived at his recommendation, but I \nthink at the very least his partisan activities at the time he was \ncharged with independently evaluating Mr. Estrada create the appearance \nof a conflict of interest and should embarrass the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  People expect the ABA reviews to be conducted by independent, \nnonpartisan individuals, not by partisans who are the President's foot \nsoldiers in the effort to pack the Federal courts. The circumstances of \nEstrada's ABA evaluation are very serious--very serious. These \ncircumstances underscore the need for the Senate to independently \nevaluate Mr. Estrada's record.\n  It would be somewhat shallow for people to say that this man, \nFielding, who evaluated this judge to be, was fair and independent. I \nsaid the ABA should be embarrassed. What we are talking about here is \nEstrada. This has made an independent review impossible. I am not \nwilling to delegate my constitutional duty to Mr. Fielding, the \ncofounder of a group designed to attack Members of this body who do not \nagree with him.\n  Earlier today, I had a chart here that outlined Mr. Estrada's \nassistance to this body so we could come up with answers to Judiciary \nCommittee questions. Some people called in and said the chart was small \nand they could not read it. I want to make sure they can read this \nchart. It is titled ``Miguel Estrada's answers to the Judiciary \nCommittee's questions.'' Here are his answers.\n  There weren't any. Those from the other side can come here and talk \nand show us visual aids about all the answers given to this committee \nthat fill volumes when, in fact, as Senator Durbin so well described, \nhis answers were evasive.\n\n       Mr. Estrada, give us the name of a Supreme Court Justice \n     that you would like to be.\n       I don't have an opinion.\n       Give us a case you disagree with.\n       I don't have an opinion.\n\n  These were his answers to the Judiciary Committee's questions.\n  I had some other charts here, and they said the writing was too \nsmall.\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\nHere is one about Miguel Estrada's legal memoranda. Here is the \ninformation we have regarding Miguel Estrada's legal memoranda. The \nwriting this morning was too small. But here is what it says:\n\n       Miguel Estrada's legal memoranda.\n\n  Here is what we have: Nothing.\n  My friend from Arizona said this would be chilling; why would we want \nto set a precedent like this?\n  It has been set in the past. We have had Chief Justice Rehnquist, for \nbeginners. When he came before this body and we wanted to look at a \nmemo, we got it. I don't have all the names here, but we know Civiletti \nand Roberts and others--it has happened on other occasions. This is no \ndangerous, misleading, scary precedent.\n  We have, by virtue of the Constitution of the United States, an \nobligation to make sure that we advise and consent to the nomination of \nthe President. Article II, section 2, says that is our obligation, and \nthat is what we are doing. We have an obligation that is in the depths \nof the Constitution to do just that.\n  If they, the majority, believe this man is as good as they say he is, \nlet us share in the information, let us look at his legal memoranda, \nand let us also have him answer questions.\n  You would think we would want to know, as part of our constitutional \nduties, what a person's legal philosophy is. As the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, and I this morning indicated in an exchange, Mr. \nDurbin, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois, he said to Miguel Estrada: Give us the name of a case in \nthe Supreme Court that you disagreed with.\n  As Senator Durbin and I said: You know, we have been to law school. I \nwill bet it is not too hard of a press to come up with a case about \nwhich you think the U.S. Supreme Court was wrong. How about Dred Scott? \nMaybe Dred Scott was wrong.\n  Not him. He wouldn't tell us. No.\n\n       I have no opinion on that.\n\n  Miguel Estrada's legal philosophy--that is it. And because that is \nit, this blank, we are going to make a decision? No.\n  The majority leader is the one here who has to make a decision. He \ncan go on like we are today, tonight, tomorrow. In fact, I read in a \npublication here that one of the Republican leaders says:\n\n       If [Democrats] want to stay through the weekend, we'll stay \n     through the weekend.\n\n  Boy, is that a threat that just chills me. We may have to work here \nover the weekend? That would be terrible. Is that supposed to take away \nour constitutional duties, because they are going to make us work? I \nwork whether I work here or go home.\n  The leader has to make a choice: Are they going to pull this \nnomination or do they think enough of this man to give us his legal \nmemoranda and have him answer questions? Or he could do something that \nis done a lot around here: File cloture. See if he can stop the debate.\n  As I have said before, we are in harmony over here. We believe what \nwe are doing is principled and right. No matter how many times the \nother side says there is no problem, all they have to do is see what is \ngoing on here. There is a problem. If they want to resolve that \nproblem, all the cards are in their hands and they can decide how they \nwant to handle it. Otherwise, if they want us to stay here, we will \nstay in quorum calls or we will talk.\n  I have suggested to some of the Senators here if we get past the \nmorning hour when we have to be fairly germane to what is being talked \nabout, I think it would be an excellent time, as the Senator from West \nVirginia did yesterday, I think we should have a little discussion \nabout what is going on in the world. We are very close to going to war. \nThat is what I am told. I think it would be very important to the \npeople of Nevada to have a discussion about that. I think we are going \nto win the war, but are we going to win the peace in Iraq? That should \nbe a subject. If they want to keep us here all weekend, we could talk \nabout that at some length.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question without losing the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Are we likely to be in session this weekend?\n  Mr. REID. That is a decision they have to make. I am just reading \nfrom one of the publications. One of the Republican leaders said they \nare really going to get us on this. They are not filing cloture, but \nwhat they are going to do is talk all night tonight and all night \ntomorrow night, to get a vote on the Estrada nomination by the weekend.\n  Let me just say to everyone within the sound of my voice, that will \nnot get them a vote on Estrada. We have told them what we believe is \nappropriate.\n  People may disagree with us. This is the Senate. We have certain \nrules. We are not dealing from under the deck. We are not holding any \ncards up our sleeves. We have said openly what we are doing. We are not \ngoing to allow a vote on this until we get the information we want. So \nit is up to them. If they want to threaten us, we could also--we could \ntalk about the war, as the distinguished Senator from West Virginia did \nyesterday.\n  I think it is also important to think about this economic plan that \nhas been suggested, the one the President has put forward that the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve says is not a good plan. The chairman \nof the Ways and Means Committee in the House says it is not a good \nplan. We could talk and elaborate on how some of the Republicans feel \nabout their own plan. That would take a little bit of time.\n  We could talk about the President's Medicare fix, which the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives said is a really bad idea.\n  We can talk about a lot of things. This is the Senate rules. We do \nnot have to talk about Miguel Estrada. I said to everyone yesterday and \nI have said it today, everything has been said about Miguel Estrada, \nfor and against him. But not everyone has said it. So we can be here, \nwe can continue rehashing Miguel Estrada.\n  But the President said--I think I am quoting almost verbatim when he \nwas told there is a filibuster--the game is over.\n\n  I don't know what that means. That is a term he used a lot. He said \nthe game is over in Iraq. The game is over on Estrada. This is not a \ngame; this is something we are doing based upon principle.\n  I think, for the good of the country, unless they are going to give \nus the information we want, this nomination should be pulled. Then we \ncan get on to other things that I think are very pressing that we \nshould get on to.\n  I want to make sure I was right. I want to make sure I said this \nright.\n\n       Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch . . . \n     scoffed the Democrats' demand for more information about \n     Estrada.\n\n  I said the President said: The game is over.\n  Senator Hatch said that. He is quoting what the President said on \nother things.\n\n       That game is over.\n\n  The game is over--this is not a game. This is not something that was \narrived at in a short period of time. In fact, the Democratic leader \nwaited a number of days before the decision was made, after he \nconferred literally with every Democratic Senator about how he felt \nabout this. This is not an arbitrary decision made by the Democratic \nleader. This is a decision made by Senator Daschle after having \nconferred with every Democratic Senator, on more than one occasion in \nmost instances. That is what the body over here desired to do, and that \nis what we are doing. We hope everyone understands this is not a game. \nWe are very serious about what we are doing. We believe what we are \ndoing is principled.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Joe Meadows\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, this past Saturday my longtime, good \nfriend, and former staff member, Joe Meadows, passed away.\n  Joe Meadows was a dedicated, hard-working, conscientious, sincere, \nand loyal individual. As the mail clerk in my office in the Hart \nBuilding, he managed the mailroom for me. He did his\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\njob effectively and efficiently. And everyone else on the staff liked \nhim.\n  One couldn't help but like Joe Meadows. From time to time, when I \nwent into his section of the office, I would find Joe Meadows with a \nhandful of papers, letters, correspondence, and files in one hand. And \nwith his glasses down over his nose, he would look up over his glasses.\n\n  He was a wonderful man. He rarely talked about it, this quiet, soft-\nspoken, hard-working, unassuming man. He was also one of the best \ncountry fiddle players in the United States. He was a bluegrass \nmusician, born in a small coal town in southern West Virginia, on the \nlast day of 1934.\n  Joe never learned to read a note of music.\n  Does the distinguished Senator from New York have memories concerning \nthe year 1934?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator yielding. I \nsay to the Senator, my memories are those my parents told me.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, the Senator, I take it, was not around in 1934?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I was not.\n  Mr. BYRD. OK. Well, I was a high school senior in 1934. I graduated \nthat year. And we were hearing talk, in those days, about a gadget that \nwould allow one to see a person as that person spoke or would allow one \nto see a person who played the violin as the violin was being played. \nThat was a few years right after the invention of the television. \nTelevision was invented in 1926. And so I am talking about 1934, just 8 \nyears after television was invented. Eight years after television was \ninvented, 1934.\n  Oh, we heard about this gadget, as I say. It was coming and would be \non the market in a few years. My, what a change that made. 1934; well, \nthe last day of 1934, Joe Meadows was born. He never learned to read a \nsheet of music, but he could really play it. He could make that fiddle \ncry. He could make it scream. He did have neighbors and a father who \nplayed the fiddle.\n  He had an extraordinary gift for music: Joe Meadows from the hills of \nsouthern West Virginia. He is one of the finest bluegrass musicians I \never heard. Like many lads in southern West Virginia, including myself, \nJoe Meadows grew up listening to the Grand Ole Opry on the radio. The \nGrand Ole Opry, I can remember the times when that was all we had to \nlisten to on Saturday night--the Grand Ole Opry.\n  Yes, I can remember the Solemn Old Judge and Deford Bailey. Deford \nBailey played that harmonica. Oh, he could make that harmonica scream. \nHe could make that harmonica play ``Freight Train Blues,'' Deford \nBailey. And there was Sam and Kirk McGee. There was Arthur Smith and \nHis Dixieliners: ``Going on down that Dixie line, walking in my \nsleep''--Arthur Smith and His Dixieliners. He played ``The \nMockingbird.'' He could make that mockingbird sing on that violin.\n  But Joe Meadows could do anything that Arthur Smith could do, and \nbetter.\n  The Grand Ole Opry, that is all we had in those days. On Saturday \nnights we would square dance and listen to the Grand Ole Opry. There \nwas the Fruit Jar Drinkers. That was kind of a lousy band. I probably \nshouldn't say that. But I did not think as much of the Fruit Jar \nDrinkers as I did the Dixieliners, by any means. And Roy Acuff used to \nsing ``That Great Speckled Bird'' Saturday nights. Saturday nights, \n1934.\n  I graduated from high school in 1934. I liked a pretty, pretty girl, \ntoo. She was not in my class. She was in the next class behind me, and \nshe was the daughter of a coal miner. And that coal miner played a \nfiddle. His name was Fred James.\n  I took a liking to that daughter of the coal miner. And I tell you, \nyou young ladies, and young men as well, who are pages here, I tell you \nhow I courted my girl, my sweetheart, how I won her hand in marriage.\n\n  There was another boy in my class at Mark Twain High School in 1934. \nHis name was Julius Takach. His father had a grocery store at Ury, what \nwe called Cooktown, about 3 miles south of Stotesbury where I lived. \nAnd Julius Takach would, every morning, come to school with his pockets \nfilled with that candy and chewing gum, bubble gum, and so on, from his \nfather's store.\n  Now, I tell you, I made it my business to be the first to greet \nJulius at the schoolhouse door upon his arrival every day because he \nwould give me some of that candy and chewing gum.\n  I tell you, it was something to be able to present your girl, your \nsweetheart, a piece of bubble gum. And I never let her know that I did \nnot buy that, I did not purchase that gum or candy. I did not let her \nknow it was given to me, but it was given to me by Julius Takach.\n  I would meet her when the classes changed, and I would give her that \ncandy and chewing gum. Boy, what a hit I thought I was, giving that \npretty girl that candy and chewing gum.\n  Well, now, 65 years and almost 9 months after I married that pretty \ngirl, I am here to tell these young men who are pages, that is the way \nyou court your girl, with another boy's bubble gum.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my friend and leader from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Will the Congressional Record please note that there was laughter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the reporter kindly note there was laughter again in \nthe Congressional Record. We have to make that Congressional Record \ncome alive.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My colleague from West Virginia, if he might yield----\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Is making everything come alive in this Chamber. We have \nnot had a happier moment in a long time. And I very much appreciate the \nstories he is telling. I was going to say, I guess we all ought to take \nthis up, because 65 years of marriage to Erma--and we all hope and pray \nshe is in good health again; and I hope she is--is something we should \nall pay very good attention to.\n  Now, I don't know, these days, if the young ladies will just accept \nbubble gum. You might have to do a little more than that, maybe a whole \nbasket of candy or something. But it is good for us to know.\n  I did not want to interrupt my colleague. I just, in terms of the \nscheduling, ask if it might be all right to ask unanimous consent that \nafter the Senator from West Virginia is finished I be recognized for \nthe time that I might need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, if I may continue, I try to remember \ngreat speeches. One of the best speeches I ever heard was made by our \ncolleague from West Virginia when he came to the floor, it must have \nbeen about a year and a half ago, and talked, with as much love as he \nhas for his employee who has passed and almost as much love as for his \nwife, about the beauties of coming to West Virginia on a vacation. It \nwas one of the finest, nicest speeches I ever heard. I will never \nforget it, and I think this one is going to be just as memorable. I \nlook forward to hearing my friend continue. I thank him for his \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New York for his observations. I am very grateful to him.\n  Like many lads in southern West Virginia, including myself, Joe \nMeadows grew up listening to the Grand Ole Opry on radio--that was back \nin the days of the Great Depression--as well as ``Farm and Fun Time'' \nand other radio programs that featured country and bluegrass music. And \nJoe Meadows absorbed it all. His ear was fixed on and naturally attuned \nto the fiddle playing. Joe listened. Joe learned. And later, Joe \nperformed what he had heard. At the age of 16, Joe Meadows began \nperforming with Melvin and Ray, the Goins Brothers, and from there he \nwent on to tour with and recorded with the greatest names in country \nand bluegrass music including Jim and Jesse, the Stanley Brothers, and \nthe legendary Bill Monroe and his Blue Grass Boys.\n  Joe Meadows' musical career included 25 years on the road as a \nprofessional fiddle player and a 7-year run at the Grand Ole Opry. He \nhad toured Europe four times and Japan once where he was incredibly \nwell received. Before I stopped playing the fiddle, Joe Meadows and I \nwould sometimes sit down on weekends and play our fiddles together. We \nusually taped our sessions, and then we listened to our recordings \ntogether to see how we could improve our\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\nplaying. Well, he couldn't improve his playing much, but I had plenty \nof room to improve my own. I always hoped to be as smooth in handling \nthat bow, that fiddle bow as Joe was. He had complete control of that \nfiddle bow. I don't think I ever got there, but he never stopped trying \nto help me.\n  Joe Meadows was not only naturally endowed with a strong and supple \nbow arm, the good Lord blessed him with a great pair of fiddler hands.\n  I never have had the pleasure to observe anyone whom I liked to \nlisten to better than I liked Joe Meadows. He had nimble, quick \nfingers, and he used them beautifully.\n  The bluegrass and mountain music and old-time fiddling world has lost \na great musician. I have lost a good friend. West Virginia has lost a \ngood and gracious son.\n  My wife Erma and I extend our deepest condolences to Joe Meadows' \nfamily and to his many friends.\n\n     Let fate do her worst.\n     There are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past\n     That she cannot destroy.\n\n     They come in the nighttime\n     Of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features\n     That joy used to wear.\n\n     Long, long be my heart\n     With such memories filled,\n     Like the vase in which roses\n     Have once been distilled.\n\n     You may break, you may shatter\n     The vase, if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses\n     Will hang, 'round it still.\n\n\n                          On the Brink of War\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, to contemplate war is to think about the \nmost horrible of human experience. On this February day, as this Nation \nstands at the brink of battle, every American on some level must be \ncontemplating the horrors of war.\n  My wife says to me at night: Do you think we ought to get some of \nthose large bottles, the large jugs, and fill them with water? She \nsays: Go up to the attic and see if we don't have two or three there. I \nbelieve we have two or three there.\n  And so I went up to the attic last evening and came back to report to \nher that, no, we didn't have any large jugs of water, but we had some \nsmall ones, perhaps some gallon jugs filled with water. And she talked \nabout buying up a few things, groceries and canned goods to put away.\n  I would suspect that kind of conversation is going on in many towns \nacross this great, broad land of ours. And yet this Chamber is for the \nmost part ominously, dreadfully silent. You can hear a pin drop. \nListen. You can hear a pin drop. There is no debate. There is no \ndiscussion. There is no attempt to lay out for the Nation the pros and \ncons of this particular war. There is nothing.\n  What would Gunning Bedford of Delaware think about it? What would \nJohn Dickinson of Delaware think about it? What would George Read think \nabout it? What would they say?\n  We stand passively mute in the Senate today, paralyzed by our own \nuncertainty, seemingly stunned by the sheer turmoil of events. Only on \nthe editorial pages of some of our newspapers is there much substantive \ndiscussion concerning the prudence or the imprudence of engaging in \nthis particular war. I can imagine hearing the walls of this Chamber \nring just before the great war between the States, a war that tore this \nNation asunder and out of which the great State of West Virginia was \nborn.\n  But today we hear nothing, almost nothing, by way of debate. This is \nno small conflagration that we contemplate. It is not going to be a \nvideo game. It may last a day or 6 days. God created Earth, and man, \nthe stars, the planets, and the Moon in 6 days. This war may last 6 \ndays. It may last 6 weeks. It could last longer. This is no small \nconflagration that we contemplate. This is no simple attempt to defang \na villain. No, this coming battle, if it materializes, represents a \nturning point in U.S. foreign policy and possibly a turning point in \nthe recent history of the world.\n  This Nation is about to embark upon the first test of a revolutionary \ndoctrine applied in an extraordinary way, at an unfortunate time--the \ndoctrine of preemption, no small matter--the idea that the United \nStates or any other nation can legitimately attack a nation that is not \nimminently threatening but which may be threatening in the future.\n  The idea that the United States may attack a sovereign government \nbecause of a dislike for a particular regime is a radical, new twist on \nthe traditional idea of self-defense. It appears to be in contravention \nof international law and the U.N. Charter. And it is being tested at a \ntime of worldwide terrorism, making many countries around the globe \nwonder if they will soon be on our hit list, or some other nation's hit \nlist.\n  High-level administration figures recently refused to take nuclear \nweapons off the table when discussing a possible attack on Iraq. What \ncould be more destabilizing? What could be more world shattering? What \ncould be more future shattering? What could be more unwise than this \nkind of uncertainty, particularly in a world where globalism has tied \nthe vital economic and security interests of so many nations so closely \ntogether?\n  There are huge cracks emerging in our time-honored alliances. One \nwonders what is going to happen, and about what is happening to the \nUnited Nations. One should pause to reflect on what is happening there \nat the United Nations, formed 54 years ago. And we say: If you are not \nwith us, you are against us. That is a pretty hard rule to lay down to \nthe United Nations. If you are not with us, you are against us. If you \ndon't see it our way, take the highway. We say to Germany and we say to \nFrance--both of whom have been around longer than we--if you don't see \nit our way, we will just brush you to the side.\n  Do we fail to think about a possible moment down the road, a bit \nfurther on, when we may wish to have Germany and France working with us \nand thinking with us, standing with us, because there is a larger \nspecter, at least in my mind, looming behind the specter of Saddam \nHussein and Iraq. There looms a larger specter, that of North Korea, \nwhich has one or two nuclear weapons now, and others within reach \nwithin a few weeks. So there are huge cracks, I say, emerging in our \ntime-honored alliances, and U.S. intentions are suddenly subject to \ndamaging worldwide speculation.\n  Anti-Americanism based on mistrust, misinformation, suspicion, and \nalarming rhetoric from U.S. leaders is fracturing the once solid \nalliance against global terrorism which existed after September 11, \n2001.\n  Here at home, people are warned of imminent terrorist attacks, with \nlittle guidance as to when or where such attacks might occur. Family \nmembers are being called to active duty, with no idea of the duration \nof their stay away from their hearthside, away from their homes, away \nfrom their loved ones, with no idea of the duration of their stay or \nwhat horrors they may have to face, perhaps in the near future. \nCommunities are being left with less than adequate police and fire \nprotection, while we are being told that a terrorist attack may be \nimminent. What about those communities like little Sophia, WV?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy the Senator has taken the floor today. We have \nspent most of our time discussing other matters. But this is a \ncritically important matter in West Virginia and Illinois.\n  I ask the Senator, as a matter of record, if he would kindly recount, \nsince September 11, the efforts he has personally made, as well as \nspeaking on behalf of this side of the aisle in the caucus, to try to \nbring together the necessary resources and funds so that we can be \nprepared to deal with acts of terrorism against the United States. We \nwere just alerted this weekend that we were on something called the \norange alert. The Senator noted that his wife asked what does this mean \nin terms of water and protecting our families and our houses.\n  Would the Senator be kind enough to tell us for the record, as we \nreflect on whether we are prepared to deal with terrorism, what we have \ntried to do--unsuccessfully--since September 11 to respond to this \nchallenge?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the very able and distinguished \nSenator from Illinois who is a graduate of the other body where I \nbelieve he served on the Appropriations Committee.\n  He serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee. I need only respond\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\nin a brief way at this point to the incisive question which the \ndistinguished Senator has asked. I refer him to the Congressional \nRecord upon several occasions last year when I said to the Senate that \nI was bringing to the floor, or said to the Appropriations Committee, \nthat I was bringing an amendment up dealing with homeland security, and \nI shall do that again, hopefully before this week is over.\n  Let me say briefly in response to the able Senator, time and time \nagain the Senator has worked with me and with every other Senator on \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, Republicans and Democrats alike, \nto report measures from the Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously \nthat provided moneys for homeland security.\n  I remember our providing $2.5 billion--$2.5 billion--for homeland \nsecurity. We designated it in the committee as an emergency item, and \nall that remained to be done--all that remained to be done--in order to \nhave that $2.5 billion immediately flow to the policemen, the law \nenforcement officers, the firefighters, the health emergency personnel \nall over this country, all that needed to be done was for the President \nof the United States to attach his signature and likewise designate \nthat $2.5 billion as an emergency.\n  How little to ask. But how much it would have meant to the first \nresponders in the many towns and cities and rural communities in \nIllinois, in North Carolina, in West Virginia, and cities and hamlets \nall over this country if the President had but condescended in that \nmoment to sign his name on that item, making it an emergency item.\n  The law requires that for an item to be declared an emergency item, \nboth the Congress and the President have to designate the item as an \nemergency. Congress did its part, and, in that case, that involved $2.5 \nbillion. The President literally gave the back of his hand to that \neffort on the part of the elected representatives of the American \npeople in this Chamber and on that committee. He gave the back of his \nhand to that effort on the part of Congress to provide $2.5 billion for \nthe local responders and people in the health laboratories all over \nthis country, for border security, airport security, port security, and \nall of the many facets that are involved in homeland security. He \nturned his back on that effort.\n  Then last year, I believe in November of this past year when we had \nthe omnibus appropriations bill before the Senate, I offered an \namendment, a $5 billion amendment, an amendment making $5 billion \navailable for homeland security. Did the administration support that \namendment? No, the administration fought it, and the amendment went \ndown in flames, as it were, on the floor of the Senate on virtually a \nparty-line vote.\n  That $5 billion would have gone a long way, would have been out there \ntoday when we have this orange alert scaring the American people--I am \nnot saying it is not appropriate to have an orange alert, but we have \nseen alert after alert after alert, and in spite of the alerts that \nhave been so often set forth in this country by the administration's \nown people, the administration, the President, have turned their backs \non these efforts of the Senate Appropriations Committee by unanimous \nvotes, including the Republicans on the committee, to provide ample \nmoneys for homeland defense.\n\n  Again, having lost the $5 billion, I came back with an amendment \nproviding for $3 billion. We slimmed down--you can go to the store and \nget the Slim Fast at the Giant. I go to the store and do the shopping \nfor my wife. She does not need Slim Fast, but I sometimes get Slim \nFast. Well, we slimmed fast that $5 billion and brought it down to $3 \nbillion, thinking we would pick up some votes with the administration's \nsupport.\n  Did we get any more votes? No, the administration was against the $3 \nbillion, and today they are telling us all, we better be on watch day \nand night.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Senator is probably preeminent in \nthis Chamber in his knowledge of history, and he certainly knows the \nhistory leading up to World War II when a Member of the House of \nCommons by the name of Winston Churchill took to the floor week after \nweek, month after month, year after year, warning the people of England \nthat the looming crisis, the rise of Nazism and fascism and their \nfailure to prepare. William Manchester's famous biography of that \nperiod of Winston Churchill's life is entitled ``Alone'' because he \nstood alone warning the people of England of the crisis that was to \ncome.\n  I say to my colleague from the State of West Virginia, his role in \nthis crisis facing America has been Churchillian in that he has taken \nthe leadership in the Senate time and again to warn us of a looming \ncrisis. I ask him if he agrees with most people that to have an orange \nalert and to tell mothers and fathers across America to put aside some \nbottles of water, buy some duct tape and plastic sheeting, and prepare \nfor the crisis of terrorism is not enough; that we as a nation should \nhave taken this looming crisis seriously long ago?\n  I believe I know the answer to this question, but, Madam President, I \nthank my colleague from West Virginia for his leadership. I thank him \nfor standing on this floor and reminding us that there is still an \nunfulfilled agenda, and that if we face terrorism, we have to be honest \nwith the American people. We have tried in the Senate, but we have \nfailed. We are not as prepared as we should be to face this threat.\n  I ask the Senator from West Virginia--I am not going to take any more \ntime from his great comments--if he would comment on the Churchill \nanalogy.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is preeminently correct. His mention of William \nManchester reminds me of that great book, ``The Glory and the Dream'' \nby William Manchester who wrote about the Great Depression. In fact, \nHerbert Hoover was the first President to have a telephone on his desk \nin the White House. ``The Glory and the Dream.''\n  Yes, we have had time to prepare. In many respects, we have failed. \nOur committee on which the distinguished Senator from Illinois sits \nconducted hearings and requested that the Homeland Security Director, \nformer Gov. Tom Ridge, appear before the Appropriations Committee to \ntestify concerning the needs of homeland security in this country. Did \nhe come? He probably would have come but his boss, the President, said, \nno, he shall not come. So we conducted 5 days of hearings on homeland \nsecurity in those early months of 2002. As a result, we brought to the \nfloor legislation based on the testimony that had been adduced from \nwitnesses from all over this country--mayors, Governors, and first \nresponders.\n\n  This legislation, to a large extent, was pretty much sneered at--it \nis hard to respond in any other way--by the administration. Based on \nthe testimony of those witnesses, we tried time and again to bring to \nthe Senate and pass legislation that would provide for the needs of \nthose local responders, the people at the local level, in the effort to \nprevent terrorist attacks and in the effort to deal with terrorist \nattacks once they occurred. We got no help from this administration.\n  Did the people out there know it? Some of us attempted to tell the \nAmerican people about these efforts, but the press has not picked up on \nit very well. Communities are being left with less than adequate police \nand fire protection. Other essential services are also shortstaffed. \nThe mood of the Nation is grim, is the only way I know how to put it. \nThe economy is stumbling. Economic growth is worse than it has been in \n50 years. Fuel prices are rising and may soon spike higher.\n  This administration, now in power for a little over 2 years, must be \njudged on its record. I believe that record is dismal. In that scant 2 \nyears, this administration has squandered a large projected surplus of \nsome $5.6 trillion. How much is that? That is $5,600 for every minute \nsince Jesus Christ was born.\n  Let me say that again. In that scant 2 years--I am talking about the \nlast 2 years--of this administration's record, this administration has \nsquandered a large projected surplus of some $5.6 trillion over the \nnext decade and taken us to projected deficits as far as the human eye \ncan see. This administration's domestic policy has put many of our \nStates, including my own, in a dire\n\n[[Page S2270]]\n\nfinancial condition, underfunding scores of essential programs for the \npeople, the people out there who are watching through those electronic \nlenses.\n  This administration has fostered policies that have slowed economic \ngrowth. This administration has ignored urgent matters such as the \ncrisis in health care for our elderly. This administration has been \nslow to provide adequate funding for homeland security. The \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and I have been \ntalking about that.\n  This administration has been reluctant to better protect our long and \nporous borders to the north and to the south, and to the east and to \nthe west, where the great oceans form the borders.\n  In foreign policy, this administration has failed to find Osama bin \nLaden. In fact, yesterday we heard from him again marshaling his forces \nand urging them to kill, kill, kill.\n  This administration has split traditional alliances, possibly \ncrippling for all time international order, crippling entities such as \nthe United Nations and NATO. This administration has called into \nquestion the traditional worldwide perception of the United States as \nbeing a well-intentioned peacemaking, peace loving, peacekeeping \nnation.\n  This administration has turned the patient art of diplomacy on its \nhead. It has turned the patient art of diplomacy into threats, \nlabeling, and name calling of the sort that reflects quite poorly on \nthe intelligence and sensitivity of our leaders and which will have \nconsequences for years to come, calling heads of state pygmies, \nlabeling whole countries as evil--as though we are not evil, as though \nthere is no country that is not evil--denigrating powerful European \nallies as irrelevant. These types of crude insensitivities can do our \ngreat Nation no good.\n\n  We may have massive military might, and we have, but remember we have \nhad massive military might before. How many millions of men marched to \nthe drums of war only 60 years ago? Thirteen million American men under \narms, was it? Millions.\n  While we may have massive military might today, we cannot fight a \nglobal war on terrorism alone. We need the cooperation and the \nfriendship of our time-honored allies, as well as the newer found \nfriends whom we can attract with our wealth. Our awesome military \nmachine will do us little good if we suffer another devastating attack \non our homeland which severely damages this economy.\n  Our military manpower is already stretched thin, and they are taking \nthem from our States every day. Yesterday, I talked to the Senate about \nthe vacancies, about the empty seats at the dinner tables in the homes \nof many West Virginians, because of the National Guard and Reserve \ndepartures every day from the State of West Virginia. Yes, there they \ncome. They are law enforcement officers. They are State troopers. They \nare road builders. They are doctors. They are teachers. They are Sunday \nschool teachers. These are the men and women who keep the lights \nburning when the snows fall and darkness comes. But on whom will we \ndepend when these men and women are gone to foreign lands to fight a \nwar if a war faces us here at home, a different kind of war.\n\n  Our awesome military machine will do us little good if we suffer \nanother devastating attack on our homeland which severely damages our \neconomy.\n  As I say, our military forces are already being stretched thin and we \nwill need the augmenting support of those nations that can supply troop \nstrength, not just sign letters cheering us on.\n  The war in Afghanistan has cost us $37 billion so far. Yes, we bombed \nthose caves. We ran them into the holes, but they could not hide. We \nran them out of the holes, and we ran behind them to get them. But \nthere is evidence that terrorism may already be starting to regain its \nhold in that region. We have not found Bin Laden, and unless we secure \nthe peace in Afghanistan, the dark dens of terrorism may yet again \nflourish in that remote and devastated land.\n  Pakistan, as well, is at risk of destabilizing forces. This \nadministration has not finished the first war against terrorism, and \nyet it is eager to embark on another conflict with perils much greater \nthan those in Afghanistan. Is our attention span that short? Have we \nnot learned that after winning the war, one must also secure the peace?\n  Yet we hear little, precious little, about the aftermath of war in \nIraq. In the absence of plans, speculation abroad is rife. Will we \nseize Iraq's oil fields, becoming an occupying power which controls the \nprice and supply of that nation's oil for the foreseeable future? There \nare some who think so.\n  To whom do we propose to hand the reins of power in Iraq after Saddam \nHussein? Will our war inflame the Muslim world, resulting in \ndevastating attacks on Israel? Will Israel retaliate with its own very \npotent nuclear arsenal? What are we about to unleash here? The genie is \ngetting out of the bottle. Can it ever be put back? Will the Jordanian \nand Saudi Arabian Governments be toppled by radicals, bolstered by \nIran, which has much closer ties to terrorism than Iraq? Could a \ndisruption of the world's oil supply lead to a worldwide recession? Has \nour senselessly bellicose language and our callous disregard for the \ninterests and opinions of other nations increased the global race to \njoin the nuclear club and make proliferation an even more lucrative \npractice for nations which need the income?\n  In only the space of 2 short years, this reckless and arrogant \nadministration has initiated policies which may reap disastrous \nconsequences for years.\n  We have heard it asked, Are you better off today than you were 4 \nyears ago? The question can be shortened: Are we better off than we \nwere 2 years ago?\n  One can understand the anger and the shock of any President after the \nsavage attacks of September 11. One can appreciate the frustration of \nhaving only a shadow to chase and an amorphous, fleeting enemy on which \nit is nearly impossible to exact retribution. But to turn one's \nfrustration and anger into the kind of extremely destabilizing and \ndangerous foreign policy debacle that the world is currently witnessing \nis inexcusable from any administration charged with the awesome power \nand responsibility of guiding the destiny of the greatest superpower on \nthe planet.\n  Frankly, many of the pronouncements made by this administration are \noutrageous. There is no other word. Yet this Chamber is hauntingly \nsilent--silent. What would John Langdon of New Hampshire say about \nthat? What would Nicholas Gilman of New Hampshire say about that? What \nwould Rufus King and Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts say? What would \nAlexander Hamilton, who signed the Constitution, from the State of New \nYork, say about the silence in this Chamber? What would Dr. Samuel \nJohnson of Connecticut say about the silence in this Chamber? What \nwould William Paterson or William Livingston or David Brearley or \nJonathan Dayton of New Jersey, the signers of the Constitution, have to \nsay about the silence in this Senate which they created? What would \nBenjamin Franklin, Thomas Mifflin, James Wilson, Robert Morris, of \nPennsylvania, have to say? What would Thomas FitzSimons or Gouverneur \nMorris, who signed the Constitution on behalf of the State of \nPennsylvania, have to say about the silence that rings and reverberates \nfrom these walls today, the silence with respect to the war on which we \nare about to enter? What would they have to say? What would their \ncomments be? Gunning Bedford, George Read of Delaware, Daniel Carroll, \nDan of St. Thomas Jenifer of Maryland. These and more.\n  What would these signers of the Constitution have to say about this \nSenate which they created when they note the silence, that is \ndeafening, that emanates from that Chamber on the great subject, the \ngreat issue of war and peace? Nothing. Nothing is being said except by \na few souls. Yet this Chamber is hauntingly silent--hauntingly silent \non what is possibly the eve of horrific infliction of death and \ndestruction on the population of the nation of Iraq. Think about that.\n\n  Oh, I know Saddam Hussein is the person who is primarily responsible. \nBut how about us? How about ourselves?\n  Yes, there are going to be old men dying. There will be women dying. \nThere will be children, little boys and girls dying if this war goes \nforward in Iraq. And American men and women will die, too.\n  Iraq has a population, I might add, of which over 50 percent is under \nage 15.\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\nOver 50 percent of the population in Iraq is under age 15. What is said \nabout that? This Chamber is silent--silent. When it is possibly only \ndays before we send thousands of our own citizens to face unimagined \nhorrors of chemical and biological warfare, this Chamber is silent. The \nrafters should ring. The press galleries should be filled. Senators \nshould be at their seats listening to questions being asked about this \nwar, questions to which the American people out there have a right to \nexpect answers. The American people are longing for information and \nthey are not getting it. This Chamber is silent. On the eve of what \ncould possibly be a vicious terrorist attack in retaliation for our \nattack on Iraq, it is business as usual here in the Senate, and \nbusiness as usual means it is pretty quiet. There is not much going on \nin the Senate. Business as usual.\n  Oh, I know it may be scare talk to talk about what may happen in the \nevent of a terrorist attack. But when the Twin Towers fell, it wasn't \nscare talk. When hundreds of local firefighters and police officers, \nlaw enforcement officers died as the walls of the Twin Towers came \ntumbling down, it wasn't scare talk. It wasn't scare talk.\n  We are truly sleepwalking through history. In my heart of hearts I \npray that this great Nation and its good and trusting citizens are not \nin for a rudest of awakenings. To engage in war is always to pick a \nwild card. And war must always be a last resort, not a first choice.\n  But I truly must question the judgment of any President who can say \nthat a massive unprovoked military attack on a nation which is over 50 \npercent children is in the highest moral traditions of our country. \nThis war is not necessary at this time. Pressure appears to be having a \ngood result in Iraq. Our mistake was to put ourselves in a corner so \nquickly. Our challenge is now to find a graceful way out of a box of \nour own making. Perhaps--just perhaps--there is still a way, if we \nallow more time.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum--I withdraw that suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I believe Senator Schumer is scheduled to \nspeak. I understand he is not now going to claim his time. If I may, I \nwould like to speak about Miguel Estrada. I appreciate the Senator from \nWest Virginia and his effort to present his perspective. I find myself \nwanting not to be silent, though, in response. He has a perspective \nthat is not one I share with respect to President Bush and the job he \nis doing as our Commander in Chief and as the leader of the free world. \nSo before I speak about Miguel Estrada, I would like to remain not \nsilent.\n  When I was elected to this body in 1996 I was given membership on the \nSenate Budget Committee. Being given membership on that committee, I \nremember President Clinton presented his first budget. We were coming \nthrough a period of great deficits and President Clinton projected \ndeficits for as far as the eye could see. But something happened to our \neconomy, something entirely unrelated to Government, something entirely \nunrelated to the Clinton administration. We saw what has happened \nperiodically in the great civilizations, and that is a speculative \nbubble, irrational exuberance, and we saw the stock market surge with \nstock values wholly unrelated to their book values.\n\n  We began to witness a great bubble. That is when Alan Greenspan and \nothers said there is irrational exuberance. We have a problem. They \nbegan pulling back on the money supply, and by the time George W. Bush \ntook his oath of office, this country was in a full blown recession. He \ninherited this. For a colleague to suggest that this President has run \nthis economy into the ground is belied by the facts and it is belied by \nthe common sense of the American people who do not blame this President \nfor the condition of this economy that he inherited and they, in fact, \nappreciate the fact that he is doing something about it and trying to \ndo what the Federal Government can, with the levers available to it, to \nhelp put people back to work, to grow the economy, to say to the \ncountry, to say to the Congress: You know, the economy is tough. When \nthe economy is tough, families have to tighten their belts, and \nCongress should do the same with the Government budget so we can leave \nmore money at home so people can spend it to pursue their dreams, to \nbalance their economies because when they do that, we are more likely \nto see employers reemploying people.\n  I must tell you, like my friend from Wisconsin, before I came to this \nbody I was in the business of meeting a payroll. It was always a source \nof frustration to me to hear politicians from mighty places say that \nthey were responsible for creating jobs, that they were somehow \nresponsible for the condition of the private sector economy. We are \ncitizens of a nation that has a free market economy, not centrally \nplanned. I have always been upset, whether from Republican or \nDemocratic politicians, when there is the claim that somehow we in the \npublic sector create jobs.\n  It is false. It is a lie. So when I hear speeches saying that \nPresident Clinton is to blame for it, or President Bush is to blame for \nit, I say baloney because, as long as I have been in public life, I \nhave seen us do various things with the levers available to us to try \nto help the economy, to take credit for it. But you know what. We \ncan't. And may we never be able to because if we do, we will have \nadopted the ways of western socialist societies, of Western Europe, and \nthese are failing models. These are not models designed to reemploy \npeople and to give them opportunity and hope.\n  I sit on this side of the aisle for, frankly, one major reason. I \nbelieve in free enterprise. I do not believe in creeping socialism. I \nbelieve if you are interested in social justice you will pursue those \npolicies that leave more money at home and give people a chance to \nreemploy folks and to produce products, to provide services that other \npeople want to buy.\n  So when I hear a statement like I have just heard, with all due \nrespect to a great man in this Chamber, I think it simply disregards \nthe nature of the economic system we are in. I say that as a \nbusinessman before I was a Senator. So I thank President Clinton for \ndoing the best job he could. I thank President Bush for doing the best \njob he could. But in the middle of the administration there was a stock \nmarket bubble that neither of them created for which we are now trying \nto deal with the consequences of the bursting of that bubble.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Madam President, on the issue of Iraq, I think every American feels \ndisquiet about the fact that we are actually contemplating going on the \noffense because we are trying to provide for the defense of the \nAmerican people.\n  I don't think President Bush relishes going to war. But I will tell \nyou that I am glad he does not check our national security with the \nFrench or the Chinese or some international body which is, at the core, \nanti-American and anti-Semitic. I am grateful we have a President who \ngoes to such bodies and makes America's case and stays engaged but \nnever loses sight of the fact that America's interests are best \ndetermined by Americans.\n  I have never believed there was a sharp line of coordination between \nall the Islamic terrorist groups and Islamic states. But I am not so \nnaive to believe that this is not a loose confederation of terrorism--a \nloose confederacy that has as its purpose the murder of Jews and \nAmericans and other minorities who do not share their religious faith.\n  It takes foolish people to look at all the money moving around and \nall of the ammunition being bought and all of the murder being \ncommitted to say we just have to wait for them to hit us again.\n  I thank God for a President who is willing to say: I am going to \nprotect the American people, and I am going to go where the facts lead \nus. And even if it says we have to play defense by going on offense we \nare going to do that.\n  I don't believe we are going to Iraq out of reasons of oil. I believe \nwe are going there for the security of the American people. Who can \nlike the situation in the Middle East now? Perhaps there is a prospect \nof a better future. Perhaps there is a prospect of democracy that takes \nroot in the middle of Arabia on the border of Persia that may \nultimately figure out how to find\n\n[[Page S2272]]\n\npeace with their Jewish neighbors. We have no prospect of that in the \ncurrent arrangement.\n  When I hear motives described of this President that his response to \n9/11 is somehow failed, I think maybe they are going to different \nbriefings than I am. Maybe they are seeing different facts than I see. \nI don't understand the charges that were just made here. The charge was \nmade that we are being silenced. I diverted from my Miguel Estrada \nspeech because, frankly, I don't want to be silent if that is what \npeople actually believe here because it is wrong. I want to make clear \nmy opposition to it.\n\n  Madam President, when I came to this body, I promised the people of \nOregon that while I have values I refuse to check at the door, I would \nnot have a single-issue litmus test when it came to judicial nominees.\n  I remember very vividly our phones ringing off the hook with calls \nfrom conservative people in my State who were very upset at all the \nClinton nominees for whom I voted. But I wanted to keep my word that I \nwould not have a single-issue litmus test. I was going to focus on \nwhether President Clinton's nominees were qualified and for some reason \nnot disqualified by personal conduct or ethics.\n  So with that, I can think of only one exception when a nomination was \ndefeated on the floor of this body at the request of the two Senators \nof that State.\n  I voted time and time again for President Clinton's nominees who \nprobably in most cases had different views than I did. I remember \nspecifically the nomination of Richard Paez of California which the \nRepublicans held up for some time. But some of us pushed on this side \nto get him confirmed.\n  I remember the nomination of Marsha Berzon, another Ninth Circuit \nnominee. The conservatives couldn't stand her. Some of us pushed \nthrough and got her confirmed and voted for her because we didn't want \nto happen in this place what is happening now in the case of Miguel \nEstrada.\n  I was trained in the law. As a lawyer, I have to tell you that I am \nenvious of the credentials of Miguel Estrada. I will bet in all the \ntime I serve here, few nominees will come to this place who are better \nprepared and better credentialed than Miguel Estrada. Yet it has come \nto this? A filibuster? Not for the Supreme Court but for an appeals \ncourt--an important one for sure but not even the highest court. We are \nin the midst of a filibuster.\n  But consider what an Horatio Alger story is Miguel Estrada when it \ncomes to American law. This man came to this country, from Honduras, at \nthe age of 17, speaking little English. He went to Columbia University. \nHe graduated there magna cum laude. Then he went to Harvard Law School \nand he graduated there as the editor in chief of the Harvard Law \nReview, Order of the Coif. Then he went on to clerkship for United \nStates Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n  You cannot get better credentials than this.\n  He then served as Assistant Solicitor General of the United States \nunder both the Bush and Clinton administrations, earning high praise \nfrom colleagues, including President Clinton's Solicitor General, Seth \nWaxman, under whom he served.\n  By the way, I also note that he argued the Government's case against \nthe abortion clinic demonstrators. He upheld the law.\n  He has the unanimous high rating by the American Bar Association as \n``very well-qualified''--its highest rating. That used to be the gold \nstandard for the Democratic conference for people coming through the \nJudiciary Committee to this floor.\n  He enjoys broad support from Hispanic communities, including the U.S. \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic National Bar Association, \nand the Washington Post, of all papers, which editorialized that this \nconfirmation should be an ``easy call''. But it is not. It is all \nbollixed up. Charges have been raised against Miguel Estrada that he is \nway out of the mainstream. When you ask for evidence of that, I find \nnone forthcoming. They say he has no judicial experience. Well, I have \ntold you what his legal training is, as well as his legal practice at \nGibson, Dunn & Crutcher, a great law firm in California.\n\n  I would note that five of the eight current judges on the District of \nColumbia Circuit had no prior judicial experience before they served on \nit. But, clearly, that doesn't cut it.\n  I noted before that he has the highest rating of the American Bar \nAssociation. Some have said: Well, but he defended antigang laws. These \nare known as antiloitering laws. But I would point out that he did that \nwhen he was hired by Chicago's Solicitor, at the request of Democratic \nMayor Richard Daley, to defend their constitutionality. There is no \npartisan conspiracy in this. They wanted a good lawyer to defend it. \nThis is a man who has argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. No \njudicial experience? That doesn't hold up.\n  Some have said he didn't answer all the questions.\n  I can tell you I fear that what we are doing in this Chamber by the \nprocess that began with Robert Bork is setting a standard that if you \nprovide the opposition with your views and your records, you give them \nammunition to shoot you--at least politically speaking--in this place.\n  I come back to my belief that what this really is is the victory of \nsingle-issue politics. I regret that.\n  My friend from Nevada holds the same view I do on single issue. He is \nevidence that his party has had a big enough part to include people who \nmay--I emphasize ``may''--have a view as to the sanctity of life that \nis out of the mainstream, if you will.\n  You see, Miguel Estrada has never told us what his views are. Maybe \nthat is what is wrong here. Maybe if he would come and pledge \nallegiance to Roe v. Wade all this opposition would go away. But I want \nto lament that our process has come down to single issue litmus tests. \nI do not think it should.\n  See, Miguel Estrada has said what should be said in the case of \nabortion, issues coming before appellate courts. He has said: I will \nfollow the law. I understand stare decisis. And I am not going to be \nout there trying to make new law. That is what he should say.\n  What he has not said I think is feared on that side; and that is, \ncoming from a Latin American part of our hemisphere, that he has a \nCatholic background, that he has a heritage, a tradition that \nsanctifies human life. And they are worried about that.\n  Yet I have to say I think a lot of the American people worry about \nthat. I, for one, who describes myself as pro-life, understand \ncompletely that it is unlikely in our lifetime that early rights to \nchoose will ever be abridged by this place or by the Court. But I think \nAmericans generally are increasingly discomforted by late-term \nabortions.\n  You have but to see the General Electric advertisement about seeing \nthis couple looking at their unborn child in utero and the \ninexpressible joy they feel at the anticipation of the child's birth. \nAnd to think: Well, this unborn child is of no consequence--it is of \nenormous consequence.\n  I think there is a fear there that Miguel Estrada may have some of \nthose beliefs. We do not know that. And, frankly, I think he has said \nwhat is right and that is: I will enforce the law.\n  Madam President, I, for one, say, without reservation, Miguel Estrada \nhas my vote. And I think for the good of our institutions, some of our \ncolleagues on the other side ought to remember that some of us pushed \nthrough a lot of President Clinton's nominees with whom we had \ndifferences because we were fearful of going down the road of single \nissue litmus tests for judicial nominees, because if we go there, we \nare ratcheting up to a different level, and it will be to the lament of \nthis country and its judicial processes because we will leave too many \nplaces and seats vacant on the bench, and that will mean justice \ndelayed. And justice delayed means justice denied. I urge his \nconfirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Wisconsin yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. KOHL. I will.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized following \nthe presentation by the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S2273]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to express my concerns about \nthe nomination of Miguel Estrada. Once a nominee is confirmed by the \nSenate, these men and women serve lifetime appointments, unanswerable \nto Congress, the President, or the people. They become the guardians of \nour liberties, of our Constitution, and of our civil rights. Our duty \nto advise and consent is the only check we will ever have on the \nqualifications and fitness of those chosen to serve as Federal judges.\n  In considering judicial nominees, we can review their credentials, \ntheir professional record, their writings, and the recommendations of \ntheir colleagues. But to truly evaluate a nominee's fitness, especially \none with no judicial record, we are dependent on the nominee to \ncandidly share with us their opinions, their judicial philosophy, and \ntheir approach to interpreting the Constitution during the give and \ntake of a confirmation hearing.\n  The need for forthright testimony is especially crucial in the case \nof Mr. Estrada, given the minimal public record we have to evaluate \nhim. He has never served as a judge and, therefore, unlike many \nappellate court nominees, has no judicial opinions to review. He has \nvirtually no professional writings for us to read. And although he has \nargued before the Supreme Court, he has rebutted any attempt we made to \nattach his personal views to the positions he advocated in those cases. \nTherefore, we were dependent on his testimony from his confirmation \nhearing. But this testimony gave us precious little on which to \nevaluate him.\n  Instead, we have been told that Mr. Estrada is bright, capable, and \nqualified. His proponents say ``trust us, he will make a good judge.'' \nTrust is not enough; trust leaves too much to doubt. When considering a \nnominee, we do not owe the benefit of the doubt to the nominee but, \nrather, to the courts, the Constitution, and to our civil liberties.\n  A judicial confirmation hearing is not an intrusive exercise. We do \nnot ask nominees to comment on pending cases or to speculate on \nunlikely facts. Rather, we only ask them to help us reach a level of \ncomfort with them as potential judges. Without candid and honest \ntestimony by the nominee our advice and consent process is meaningless.\n  Unfortunately, at his confirmation hearing, Miguel Estrada refused to \nanswer question after question regarding his views and judicial \nphilosophy. Mr. Estrada even went so far as to refuse, when asked by \nSenator Schumer, to name a single Supreme Court decision of which he \nwas critical in the last 40 years. I myself have asked that very same \nquestion of many nominees, and every one had an answer--until now. This \nis not an isolated example. Senator Feinstein asked him to state \nwhether he believed Roe v. Wade was correctly decided, and Mr. Estrada \nrefused to do so.\n  He refused to provide responsive information to my own questions on a \nvariety of topics, ranging from his views on two recent Federal court \nopinions striking down the Federal death penalty, to the Government's \nrole in protecting the environment, and to the use of ``protective \norders'' mandating court secrecy in products liability cases. This \npattern of evasiveness and avoidance falls far short of what we need to \nevaluate a candidate's fitness to serve a lifetime appointment on the \nDC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The importance of the court to which Mr. Estrada has been nominated \nmakes his efforts to hide his views from us all the more serious. The \nDC Circuit, a court second in importance only to the Supreme Court, is \nunique among the Federal courts of appeals as the court that reviews \ndecisions of the executive branch and the independent agencies. The \nrules and regulations reviewed by this court are felt by all Americans \nevery single day. If you work, your safety is protected by rules issued \nby the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. When we drink \nwater and breathe the air, we are protected by rules issued by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. When we shop and watch advertisements, \nwe are protected from fraud and deceit by the Federal Trade Commission. \nAnd when we see our cable, phone, and internet bills, we can be sure \nthat the Federal Commerce Commission played an important role. The \ndecisions of the D.C. Circuit on these and many other subjects have a \nreal and immediate impact on the lives of all Americans.\n  My decision to oppose this nomination in the Judiciary Committee was \nnot taken lightly. I have done so only six times in my more than 14 \nyears of service in the Senate, and I do so reluctantly in the case of \nMr. Estrada. We recognize that Mr. Estrada is a talented attorney who \nhas compiled an impressive record of achievement, and that he is to be \ncommended for devoting a substantial portion of his professional career \nto public service.\n  My decision to support the need for a filibuster on this nomination \nis also not taken lightly. We take this step reluctantly, and with the \nfull understanding that we are left with no other choice. Our \nconstitutional responsibility to advise and consent has been \ncompromised by a process that has provided us with no opportunity to \nlearn anything about this nominee. If we permit Mr. Estrada's \nnomination to proceed, we have provided future nominees a roadmap to \nevade questions and hide who they are. This would be a disservice to \nthe people we were elected to represent.\n  We cannot support Mr. Estrada's nomination to the DC Circuit in the \nface of his unwillingness to candidly share his views, his approach and \nhis judicial philosophy. If no further information is provided about \nMr. Estrada, then I will be forced to oppose his nomination.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to my colleague from Wisconsin, \nwho serves on the Judiciary Committee, on the nomination of Mr. Estrada \nto the DC Circuit Court. I also listened to my colleague from Oregon \nand others who have spoken today.\n  Mr. Estrada has had his name submitted to the Senate by the \nPresident, acting under article II of the Constitution. And the \nPresident has the right to send nominations for lifetime appointments \nto the judiciary to the Senate for advice and consent. It is the \nSenate's responsibility to evaluate the President's nominees and \ndetermine whether to vote to confirm those nominees and provide someone \na lifetime tenure on one of the Federal courts.\n  That advice and consent is not in any way subordinate to the \nPresident's right of sending a nomination. We both have constitutional \nobligations. One is for the President to select and send nominations to \nthe Senate. The other is for the Senate to evaluate and provide its \nadvice and consent.\n  The DC Circuit Court is the second highest court in the land. It is \nvery important that for a lifetime appointment, we decide carefully \nwhether we want to confirm a nominee sent to us by the President. Most \nof us would not know the nominees personally. That is certainly the \ncase in this circumstance. I don't know Mr. Estrada personally.\n  I have been to one hearing where he appeared. I was there for only a \nbrief period because a candidate for a Federal judgeship in North \nDakota was being heard at that time. This was a nomination of President \nBush's. I was pleased to be there to support President Bush's \nnomination and to support the candidate whose name had been sent to us. \nI went down to the hearing and supported Mr. Hovland's candidacy. I am \nproud to say he is now a Federal judge in the West District of North \nDakota. He is going to be a credit to the bench. He will be a wonderful \nFederal judge. I was very pleased to support President Bush in sending \nthis nomination to the Senate.\n  On that day when he was also testifying, Mr. Estrada was there. That \nis the only time I have seen him. I was there for only a couple \nquestions, and I don't know a great deal about him but have read a lot \nabout him since.\n  It is the case with respect to Mr. Estrada's appearance before the \ncommittee and also the interviews and discussions prior to his \nappearance before the Judiciary Committee, that Mr. Estrada decided he \nwould not answer some basic questions put to him by Members of the \nSenate. Members of the committee were asking some pretty basic \nquestions. Tell us a bit about your judicial philosophy, because you\n\n[[Page S2274]]\n\ndon't have experience as a judge and you have not served as a judge at \nany level in the judiciary system. Tell us about how you see this job. \nEvaluate for us some of the decisions that have been made over time by \nthe Supreme Court, and so on. Mr. Estrada essentially said, I don't \ncare to do that.\n  Contrast that for a moment, for example, with Dan Hovland who is now \na Federal judge in the West District of North Dakota. He was asked: \nWhat three U.S. Supreme Court cases can you identify that you disagree \nwith? This is Mr. Hovland. He said: Well, Behrens v. Peltier, 1996; a \n2002 case, Thompson v. Western States Medical Center; and then, of \ncourse, the case I suspect most would cite, Korematsu v. the United \nStates. That is, of course, the case in which the Supreme Court \naffirmed the conviction of a person of Japanese ancestry for a \nviolation of a curfew order solely because of the individual's \nancestry.\n\n  I think now most would view that Supreme Court decision as a profound \nmistake. Mr. Hovland did. He was asked a simple question. He gave a \nstraightforward answer. He said: Here is my notion of three Supreme \nCourt decisions with which I would disagree. It gave Members a bit of \nan insight into who Mr. Hovland was, what he thinks. That was helpful.\n  The same question was asked, for example, of Freda Wolfson: What \nthree U.S. Supreme Court cases can you identify that you disagree with. \nPlessey v. Ferguson, that would come to mind almost immediately for \neveryone. They held that the State statute requiring passenger \nrailroads to provide separate but equal accommodations for African \nAmericans and Caucasians did not violate the 13th or 14th amendments. \nIt seems to me that is probably an obvious case one would disagree \nwith.\n  Yet questions of that type were asked repeatedly of Mr. Estrada, and \nhe said he just wouldn't offer an opinion, wouldn't answer the \nquestions. So then the members of the committee said: Well, you served \nin the Solicitor's Office at the Justice Department. Could we be \nprovided with the memoranda written there, the advice you were \noffering, to get some insight into how you feel about these issues, how \nyou reason, how you think?\n  He said, no, those are confidential. Those should not be released.\n  Well, they have been released in the past. On other occasions \ncandidates have indicated they wanted those papers released. They were \nreleased. It gave the committee, when making a lifetime appointment, \nsome better judgment about how this person thinks, how this person \nreasons, what approach this person takes to dealing with some of these \nquestions. Mr. Estrada said, no, he couldn't do that.\n  What has happened with this nomination, a circuit court nomination is \nthat, both the President's administration and the candidate himself, \nMr. Estrada, have said: I don't intend to answer questions, and I don't \nintend to make the information available with respect to what I was \ndoing as assistant in the Solicitor's Office.\n  If that is the case, Mr. Estrada is then a blank sheet. What are we \nto make of Mr. Estrada? Who is he? How does he think? How does he \nreason? Would he be a good judge? This is, after all, a lifetime \nappointment. This isn't an appointment for 5 years, 10 years, or 20 \nyears. We are being asked by the President to take Mr. Estrada's \nnomination and say, yes, we will put him on this Circuit court forever, \nfor his entire life, and we have no right to get answers to basic \nquestions, to understand a bit about the philosophy of Mr. Estrada, a \nbit about his approach, his thinking. We have no right to that?\n  I have been astounded to hear some colleagues on the floor say: You \nhave a responsibility to approve this nomination. No, we have a \nresponsibility under the Constitution to advise and consent. The \nPresident has a responsibility to send us a nomination. We have a \nresponsibility to evaluate it and make a decision. Is this someone who \nshould be given a lifetime appointment or not? That is our judgment. \nThat judgment doesn't rest with others. It rests with us.\n  I would like very much for Mr. Estrada to give us the information \nrequested. My colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have repeatedly \nrequested this information. I would like very much to see the \ninformation. It is entirely possible I would see all of this \ninformation, understand a bit more about Mr. Estrada, and decide to \nsupport his nomination. I don't know. I would like to see the \ninformation and make a judgment.\n  I believe I have voted for virtually all the nominations the \nPresident has sent to Congress with respect to judgeships. I would hope \nto be able to support this and others as well. But I don't intend to \ndecide that we should force the Senate to vote for a lifetime \nappointment for a candidate on the DC Circuit Court who tells us \nnothing about himself.\n  He seems to suggest, I am here for a job interview, but I will not \ntell you anything about me. That would be a job interview that would \nlast a very short time. It ought to last a very short time here. When \nMr. Estrada and the administration provide the information that is \nrequested, then, in my judgment, this Congress has a responsibility to \nconsider it, and consider it with great seriousness because this is, \nafter all, a Federal judgeship, not just a district judgeship, but a \ncircuit court judgeship of DC, which is the second highest court in the \nland.\n  Judge Scalia once said--and I am not prone to quoting him often:\n\n       Indeed, even if it were possible to select judges who \n     didn't have preconceived views on legal issues, it would \n     hardly be desirable to do so.\n\n  What are the preconceived views on legal issues of Mr. Estrada? Does \nanyone know? Does anyone who has spoken in support of this nomination \nknow? Can you answer that question? The answer is no one in this \nChamber knows; no one in the Chamber can answer the question because \nMr. Estrada and the administration say you are not entitled to know.\n  They are wrong. The Constitution requires us to know. It says we are \nentitled to know. I don't believe we ought to vote on this nomination \nuntil we have received the information requested. When we do, I think \nwe should vote on this nomination. But until then, in my judgment, this \nis not a problem of our making, this is not something someone from the \nother side should shoehorn over here. This is a problem the \nadministration and Mr. Estrada created by deciding on a strategy that, \nif we allow to continue, would essentially say to the Senate, you \nconsider us for lifetime appointments and we won't give you any \ninformation about ourselves as we ask for that consideration.\n  There are reciprocal obligations here--ours, the President's, and the \nnominee's. We will and should meet ours as soon as others have met \ntheirs. The first test of that is to send the names of qualified people \nto the Senate for judgeships. Mr. Estrada may well be very well \nqualified. The ABA says he is well qualified. The second obligation on \nthe part of those who send his nomination to us is for the candidate \nhimself, or herself, to make themselves available to the Senate, answer \nquestions, and allow us to evaluate whether this is the kind of person \nwe want to provide a lifetime appointment to on the Federal bench. That \nhasn't been the case at this point.\n  With respect to this nominee, we are waiting; but we should not vote, \nand no one in this Chamber ought to pressure others to vote until we \nhave the basic information we have requested. What is so secret about \nall of this? What is there we should not know? Is there anyone \nqualified to serve on the second highest court of the land who doesn't \nhave some basic views on past Supreme Court decisions--especially some \nof the controversial ones--they might explore with us in order to give \nus some evaluation of how they think and reason, what kind of \ncapability they have to sit on the bench? If such a nominee is sent to \nthe Senate, that nominee ought not ever be confirmed.\n  I don't believe that is the case with Mr. Estrada. I think he has \nviews on all of these issues. He certainly could tell us his views \nabout Supreme Court decisions with which he would disagree and why, so \nwe could develop some notion of his reasoning. He just refuses to do \nthat. I don't know why. I assume if this is the case with this \ncandidate and the Senate says that is fine, we will see future nominees \nrefuse to answer anything; our advice and consent will become a \nrubberstamp; and we will not ask people to give us basic information. \nThen the next candidate will do\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\nexactly the same thing and we won't have a constitutional \nresponsibility at all here in the Senate. We will say, all right, \nwhatever it is you decide to give us, we will take, or whatever you \ndecide to withhold, we will accept.\n\n  I am not willing to do that. Why not the materials from the \nSolicitor's Office? It has been done in other nominations. Why not now? \nWhy won't the candidate answer basic questions? Again, I come here not \nas a member of the committee and as someone who has a preconceived \nnotion that Mr. Estrada would not do a good job. I don't know. And no \none else in the Senate knows. There is nobody in the Senate who can \nstand up and say Mr. Estrada has answered these questions for us, \nbecause he has refused to answer the questions for all Senators. Some \nin the Senate might be perfectly comfortable deciding the \nconstitutional role granted us in this process of lifetime appointments \non the judiciary is not very important. But I am not among them.\n\n\n                The State of Foreign and Domestic Policy\n\n  Mr. President, let me speak for a moment, while I have the floor, \nabout a couple of other issues that are happening that I think are very \nimportant. I know others want to come and speak about the nomination. I \nwant to talk for a moment about what has been happening in our country \nwith respect to foreign policy and domestic policy.\n  In recent days, we have had the following occur: We wake up in the \nmorning and turn on the television programs. The lead story is, as it \nhas always been in recent weeks, days, and months, the war with Iraq. \nWhen is it going to happen? How is it going to happen? When is it going \nto start? Who is going to support it? Who is going to be involved? \nEvery week, day, and month.\n  As a result, this economy of ours, which desperately needs certainty, \npredictability about the future--and this economy, in my judgment, is \nin a stall, serious trouble--is not going to come out of its problems \nunless we stop every day the lead news story being about war. I am not \nsuggesting Iraq is not a problem; it is. Saddam Hussein is a bad guy. \nNorth Korea is a problem--a bigger problem than Iraq, I might say. \nTerrorism is a bigger problem than both of them. We have a situation in \nwhich we have to deal with all three. I understand that. But the other \nday we get an orange alert in the country, the second highest alert for \nterrorist activity in our country, the terrorist threat. Today, I \nunderstand we have hardware stores that are out of duct tape. Why? \nBecause yesterday they said we are on orange alert, under the threat of \nterrorist attack, and we need people to go out and buy gas masks and \nplastic sheeting and duct tape. So the hardware stores in our country \nare being cleared out of duct tape. Why? People are concerned about the \npotential of a terrorist attack in our country.\n  North Korea. Apparently, we read in the news--I have not heard it in \nclassified briefings because we have not had any--that trucks are \nleaving a facility in North Korea, potentially with spent fuel rods, \nwhich will, in the not-too-distant future, be turned into weapons-grade \nplutonium, probably sold to a terrorist; and it is not out of the \nquestion that 18 or 24 months from now a terrorist will have a nuclear \nweapon with which to hold hostage an American city.\n  Is that a frightening thought? You bet your life it is. So what \nconsumes our attention today? Iraq. Saddam Hussein. Oh, but today is a \nbit different in that Osama bin Laden also shows up. He is out there. \nThe other day Osama ``been forgotten'' is what I called him, because \nyou don't hear about him anymore from the administration. They cannot \nfind him, don't know where he is. I have flown over those mountains; it \nwas about a year ago. You can look down and see where the caves are, \nwhere Osama bin Laden and his band of murderers plotted the murder of \ninnocent Americans, thousands of them. And so men and women wearing \nAmerica's uniform went into Afghanistan, kicked the Taliban out, ran \nthe al-Qaida up into the hills. But Osama bin Laden was not found. Al-\nQaida still lives. The head of the CIA said a couple of months ago that \nthe terrorist threat against this country is as serious now as it has \never been since September 11. What of terrorism? What do we make of \nNorth Korea? What about Bin Laden? And, yes, what about Iraq?\n\n  We have had a single track playing now for month after month about \nthe country of Iraq. I want to see regime change in Iraq. I want to see \nSaddam Hussein displaced. My preference, by far, is that the free world \nin unison says to this man: You leave, you disarm, or you are going to \nbe disarmed, and you are going to be replaced. I would hope very much \nthe entire free world says that to Mr. Saddam Hussein, but I also hope \nthat we understand in this country--the President and, yes, his key \nadvisers understand--that there are more threats and, in my judgment, \nat this moment, more serious threats with respect to North Korea and \nthe development of additional nuclear weapons that could possibly go \ninto the hands of terrorists very quickly; more serious threats with \nrespect to al-Qaida which still lives, and Osama bin Laden, who is \nstill broadcasting to those who follow him, which is also a very \nserious threat to this country and to the free world.\n  We need to understand that we face very serious problems, and it is \nnot just Iraq. Inattention to some parts of our foreign policy, in my \njudgment, have contributed to this. I understand North Korea has lied \nto us. I understand that. But deciding not to talk to them? It is not \nan option.\n  There are only two options dealing with a problem that serious. One \nis military. We are not going to do that. The second is diplomacy, and \nthat means we talk. We talk and we talk and we talk, and we try to work \nthrough these issues.\n  With respect to al-Qaida and terrorism, the fact we do not mention \nit, the fact no one will talk about it, the fact it is not something \nthe Defense Department, the State Department, or others want to talk \nmuch about does not mean it has gone away. It is as serious today, \nperhaps more so, than ever, and we have a responsibility to deal with \nit. I worry a great deal about these terrorist issues and the terrorist \nthreat against our country.\n  My point is not to say somehow the attention to Iraq is misplaced. It \nis to say that the sole attention to Iraq at the expense of, in my \njudgment, a more serious threat from North Korea, the sole attention to \nIraq at the expense of attention to al-Qaida and the growth and the \ncontinuation of a very serious threat of terrorist attacks is unwise, \nin my judgment. It makes no sense.\n  We have a responsibility to protect the national interests of this \ncountry, and I will and always have supported our President as we \nproceed to do that, but I think it is important with respect to not \nonly advice and consent on judgeships, but providing advice on issues \nas we perceive threats to this country, it is important for some of us \nto speak up to say: Mr. President, you are right, Saddam Hussein is a \nbad guy, but you are wrong to not pay attention to North Korea and the \nwar on terrorism with equal vigor and equal strength.\n  Frankly, no one can take a look at what has happened in the last 6, \n8, 10 months and judge there has been that kind of balance. My hope is \nthat in the coming days we will see greater balance dealing with this \nterrorist threat and also the threat of North Korea producing more \nnuclear weapons and potentially moving those nuclear weapons into the \nhands of terrorists who the next time they threaten us will do so with \na nuclear weapon.\n\n  God forbid we will face a world in which a nuclear weapon is used as \nan act of terrorism, not killing 3,000 people but 300,000 people or 1 \nmillion people.\n  If ever we wonder about these issues, we have a world in which there \nis somewhere, we think, around 30,000 nuclear weapons. We do not know \nexactly. With theater weapons, strategic weapons, somewhere around \n25,000 to 30,000 nuclear weapons, one of which, just one, missing or in \nthe hands of terrorists will cause chaos. The explosion of one will be \ndevastating, and the genie will be out of the bottle.\n  Pakistan and India have nuclear weapons, and the other day they were \nshooting at each other over Kashmir. Dangerous? You bet your life that \nis dangerous.\n  We have a responsibility, especially in the shadow of the terrorist \nthreat against this country, in the shadow of what is now happening in \nNorth Korea and the potential of the spread of nuclear weapons, we have \na responsibility\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\nto decide that job No. 1 is protecting ourselves against the terrorist \nthreat and then trying to find ways to reduce the number of nuclear \nweapons in this world.\n  I have kept in my desk for some long while a couple of items I have \nalways used to remind us of what this job is about.\n  This little piece of metal, if I may show by consent, Mr. President, \nthis little piece of metal is from a backfire bomber. This bomber was a \nSoviet bomber. It used to be flown by Soviet aircrews hauling bombs \nthat presumably would threaten the United States of America. It was at \na Soviet airbase in Ukraine when it was destroyed.\n  How was this bomber destroyed? Did we shoot it down? No, this bomber \nwas destroyed with a saw, a large circular metal saw. We sawed the \nwings off a Soviet bomber, and we paid for it under Senate \nappropriations.\n  We destroyed a bomber, not through hostile action but under what is \ncalled threat reduction. We destroyed missiles. We took off the nuclear \nwarheads. In the Ukraine, where there was once a missile with a nuclear \nwarhead aimed at the United States of America, there is now no missile, \nno nuclear warhead, and sunflowers are now planted on that ground. Is \nthat progress? Boy, I think so.\n  This is ground up copper from a Russian submarine that I assume at \none point or another was lingering off the east coast of the United \nStates with missiles in its tubes armed with nuclear warheads. But we \ndid not sink that submarine. This is copper wire ground up from a \nsubmarine that was taken apart under the Threat Reduction Program.\n  Senator Lugar, who is a real champion of this issue, and former \nSenator Nunn were the first to start the funding by which we actually \npaid to destroy weapons of our adversaries with whom we had agreements \non nuclear weapons reductions and the reduction of delivery systems.\n  We sawed the wings off a bomber; a submarine, we simply took it apart \nand ground up the copper wire. Is that progress? I think it is. If we \ndo not in this country assume world leadership in stopping the spread \nof nuclear weapons and reducing the stockpiles of nuclear weapons, our \nchildren and grandchildren will almost certainly see a future in which \nnuclear weapons are used.\n  It is our job, our responsibility to be a world leader in this area. \nThere are some who seem not to understand or care about that \nresponsibility. We have some right now in this town talking about \ndesigning new nuclear weapons. Let's design a nuclear weapon, a \ndesigner nuclear weapon, that will be a cave buster. Hard to get into \ncaves? Let's design a little new nuclear weapon to drop on a cave \nsomeplace.\n  Apparently, after the al-Qaida situation in which they hold up in \ncaves, we have some people thinking they can create designer nuclear \nweapons. Once that thinking starts, the thinking that you can use \nnuclear weapons in circumstances such as that, others will say: We can \nuse nuclear weapons. Once the thinking starts that you can use \npreemptive strikes against countries because you are worried what they \nmight do later, other countries will say: We can do preemptive strikes.\n  I worry a lot about where we are headed with the multiple policies \nwith respect to weapons programs. I think we ought to be strong. I have \nsupported many weapons programs, but I also believe, with respect to \nnuclear weapons, we must lead the world. We must stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons. We must reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons all \naround the world. It is our job. It is our responsibility. We are the \nworld leader. We are the ones.\n\n\n                           Economic Policies\n\n  These are challenging, difficult, tricky times. Every one of us in \nthis Chamber wants this President to succeed. We want our country to \nsucceed. I do not want us to have foreign policy failures. I do not \nwant us to have an economy that is in trouble. I want this President to \nsucceed. I am a Democrat. He is a Republican. It is in my interest and \nour country's interest for him to do well. It is also in our interest, \nwhere we have differences of opinion, differences on policies, for us \nto bring out those differences and debate them aggressively.\n  There is an old saying that when everyone in the room is thinking the \nsame thing, no one is thinking very much. I know some do not like that. \nThere are some who think if questions are raised these days, shame on \nyou. But with the challenges we have in both domestic and foreign \npolicy, we ought to have questions flying from every direction in every \ncorner and every philosophy of this Chamber and then pick the best of \nthose ideas and suggestions.\n  There is a tendency for each side to want the other to lose these \ndays, and so instead of getting the best of each, we get the worst of \nboth, and that does not serve the interests of this country, whether it \nis foreign policy challenges, which I just discussed, or the challenges \nin economic policy which I am going to talk about for a moment. We \nreally need to understand that there is not only one way to address \nthese. On some occasions, there are wrongheaded ideas, things that will \nmake things worse with the economy or with foreign policy. There are \nsome good ideas, some brilliant ideas, some in the middle. Our job is \nto select from the range of alternatives and to work with this \nPresident.\n  I will talk for a moment about the challenge with respect to the \neconomy. I know there are others who want to speak. I started by \ntalking about the Estrada nomination, but I do want to take a moment to \ntalk about the foreign policy and the economic policies that I think \nare significant challenges as well.\n  Yesterday, Mr. Greenspan came to the Congress and I think he poured a \n5-gallon pail of cold water on President Bush's fiscal policy \nproposals. I am thankful for that because the President is proposing, \nin the face of the largest budget deficits in history by far, more tax \ncuts, the bulk of which will help upper income taxpayers. I do not \nthink that is what we need to do for the economy.\n  As I said earlier, this economy is not going to grow if every day, in \nevery way, the lead story is about war, as it has been every day and \nevery week and every month for some long while. This economy does not \ngrow when that happens. The price of oil increases. People are \nuncertain about the future, and they manifest that uncertainty by what \nthey do. So we need to get through this.\n  When we get through it, the question is: How is a jump start provided \nto this ship of state of ours? How is this economy provided a boost? \nThe President says what we need to do is more tax cuts. He said what we \nought to do is exempt dividends from taxation.\n  That is interesting. Certainly, if one were discussing tax reform, if \nthat were the subject, they would have that as part of their \ndiscussions, no question about that. Of course, that is not the subject \nat the moment. The subject at the moment is, should we do an economic \nstimulus package? So the President takes the opportunity to say let's \nexempt dividends.\n  I am wondering why exempting taxation from dividend checks has a \npriority over exempting taxation from work, such as paychecks. Dividend \nchecks should be exempt; paychecks should be taxable? Is that a value \nsystem that says let's tax work and exempt investment? If so, does that \nmake sense? I do not know. I do not know how one chooses that approach.\n  I will talk now about where we are and how we have gotten to this \npoint. Mitch Daniels, who runs the fiscal policy program at the White \nHouse--he is at the Office of Management and Budget--has been the \nprognosticator of where we have been and what we have been doing.\n  On March 2, 2001, which is not quite 2 years ago, he said:\n\n       It has become clear that this new era of large surpluses is \n     more dangerous to the taxpayer than the preceding era of \n     large deficits.\n\n  So Mr. Daniels was gnawing at his fingernails worried about these \nlarge surpluses: Woe are we; the surpluses are going to kill us. He \nsaid these big surpluses are a big problem. That was about 2 years ago.\n  Then about a year and a half ago, he said:\n\n       We're going to have an enormous surplus, $160 billion or \n     more.\n\n  So he must have gotten his crystal ball at a Dollar Store, I guess, \nbecause in November--that is, about 15 months ago--he said:\n\n       It is, regrettably, my conclusion that we are unlikely to \n     return to balance in Federal accounts before, possibly, \n     fiscal year 2005.\n\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\n\n  What happened in that short period of time? Well, we ran into a \nrecession. I stood at this desk when they were proposing their $1.7 \ntrillion tax cut and said: How can you be so certain? Maybe we will not \nhave surpluses. Maybe we will run into some problems. Guess what we ran \nsmack into. A recession, a September 11 terrorist attack, a war against \nterrorists, the largest corporate scandals in the history of this \ncountry, the tech bubble burst, the stock market pancake, and all of \nthose surpluses that Mr. Daniels was worried about turned to big \ndeficits.\n\n  Did that change Mr. Daniels' mind about what we ought to do with the \neconomy? Oh, no. He has only one speed in his transmission. In \nJanuary--just a year ago--he said:\n\n       We project effective balance in 2004.\n\n  So he is still using that same crystal ball. A month later he says:\n\n       Despite everything, the outlook is promising for balance in \n     the year after next and for a return to large surpluses \n     thereafter.\n\n  That was 1 year ago. Still predicting, Mr. Daniels says:\n\n       Despite simultaneous war, recession and emergency, we are \n     in a position to fund the requirements of victory, plus a \n     stimulus package, and still be near balance.\n\n  That was 1 year ago.\n  March 27--11 months ago: The U.S. budget is in an extremely good \nposition, Daniels said, adding that:\n\n       OMB expected the fiscal year 2002 budget deficit to be \n     about $50 billion.\n\n  This is a guy who was excessively worried about having surpluses that \nwere too large. I assume he was not sleeping; he was worried about \nlarge surpluses. A year later, he is saying it is only going to be a \n$50 billion deficit. That will be the smallest recession deficit in \nmodern times.\n  But then we come to February 2003, the same man, same crystal ball \napparently, same prognosticator:\n\n       Our projections, which incorporate extraordinarily \n     conservative revenue estimates, see deficits peaking this \n     year, heading back thereafter.\n\n  Now let me show the chart of Mr. Daniels. In 2002, he predicted our \nsurplus would be $283 billion. We did not have a surplus. We had a \ndeficit of $159 billion. In 2003, he predicted we would have a surplus \nof $334 billion. We did not have a surplus. We had a deficit of $304 \nbillion. In 2004, he predicts a $387 billion surplus. He missed it by \nwell over half a trillion dollars.\n  I do not know what to make of this. This is the guy who is driving \nthe stage, with apparently 8 or 10 runaway horses, and does not have \nthe foggiest idea what is happening in this economy. He says we are \ngoing to have big surpluses--that is his biggest fear--turns them into \nthe largest deficits in this country's history and says: Oh, by the \nway, I can solve that. Let's do more tax cuts, the bulk of which will \ngo to upper income people, and let's decide to keep taxing work but we \nwill start exempting investment--a value system that is curious to me. \nWhy would work be taxed and investment be exempted? Is work less worthy \nthan investment?\n  Yesterday, we had 10 Nobel laureates in the field of economics, along \nwith 400 economists, who put an ad in the New York Times, I believe it \nwas--it could have been the Washington Post--saying that this proposed \nfiscal policy is going to lead to bigger deficits and bigger problems; \nit is going to saddle our children and their children with the burdens \nthat we create, and it makes no sense at all. It certainly will not \nstimulate or jump start this economy.\n  This country is a strong, resilient country. It will overcome bad \npolicies from Democrats and Republicans, and it has had plenty in two \ncenturies. It has also been benefited by good policies, by visionaries \nwho had the strength and the endurance to stick to those good policies \nthat they knew would allow this country to grow, that they knew would \ninvest in working families, they knew would give investors and \nentrepreneurs an opportunity. This country is a great place, but it \nfaces very serious challenges at the moment. Those challenges will not \nbe resolved--domestic and foreign policy--by having our heads in the \nsand. Al-Qaida and terrorism is a very serious abiding threat in this \ncountry right now.\n\n  The fact is, homeland security is not adequately funded and everybody \nknows it. But no one will admit it. North Korea is a bigger problem \nthan Iraq and everyone understands and no one will admit it. Yes, Iraq \nis a problem, but it is not the only problem. It does not even lead the \nlist with respect to North Korea and the issue of terrorism.\n  Having said all that, against that backdrop of foreign policy \nchallenges as aggressive and difficult as we have seen in some long \ntime in this country, we have an economy that is sputtering and has \nlost strength. It will not gain strength by deciding to borrow more \nmoney and add to the Federal budget deficit and do it for the purpose \nof reducing the tax burden of those at the upper income levels.\n  Upper income people are wonderful people who do a lot for this \ncountry. But should a proposal, when we are up to our neck in Federal \ndebt--should a proposal that gives an $80,000 average tax cut to the \nAmerican who earns $1 million a year be a priority in this country?\n  Yesterday, I was at a hearing and I was told by the Secretary of the \nInterior: By the way, we will close, we will zero fund a school called \nthe United Tribes Technical College. It is a wonderful school, 32 years \nin existence. Native Americans from across the country, some 40 States, \ngo to school there. It gives them a chance in life. These schools are \nvery important. Why are we going to defund it? Why doesn't the \nadministration want to fund it? It is a matter of choices. I asked, \nWhat choices? Exempting dividends? Or funding an Indian school that \ndoes wonderful things for people who want to advance their education?\n  These are the choices. Yet there are too many wrong choices being \nmade.\n  My hope is as we confront these economic challenges and foreign \npolicy challenges, this country will succeed. We have survived a lot. \nThis country has been through a lot. We have survived a Great \nDepression. We beat back the oppressive forces of fascism and Hitler. \nThis country has achieved what no other country in the world has \nachieved. But it is not because it has made bad choices, it is because \nit made good choices.\n  The question is, What are those good choices? They do not come from \none location. They come from all corners of this Chamber, all corners \nof this country. They come from, yes, the executive branch, but they \ncome from the legislative branch, as well. It does no service to our \ncountry to not have an aggressive, vigorous debate about these issues.\n  Let me finish where I started. I don't particularly enjoy coming to \nthe floor of the Senate saying we ought not vote at this point on Mr. \nEstrada. That is of Mr. Estrada's doing, not ours. That is of the White \nHouse's doing, not ours. When they ask us to give someone a lifetime \nappointment to the Federal bench, and then say to us we have no right \nto receive answers to basic questions asked--questions asked and \nanswered by other candidates--we have no right to those answers, then \nwe have a responsibility to say, well, advise and consent does not mean \nthat we rubberstamp anything sent down to the Congress. It means it is \nan obligation of ours to evaluate. Is this person worthy of being on \nthe Federal bench? How do they reason? How do they think? How do they \napproach this job?\n  I mentioned when we asked questions, or my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee asked questions of Mr. Estrada, he said he would \nnot answer them. Those same questions were asked of Mr. Hovland. He is \nnow a district judge. He answered. Questions were asked of Freda \nWolfson. She answered the questions. Ed Kinkeade answered the \nquestions. Linda Rae Reade answered the questions. All are Federal \njudges now because they came to the Congress, not expecting and \ndemanding to be approved, just presenting themselves as the President \nhas done through nomination, to say, here I am; now, Members of the \nSenate, your job is to give advice and consent and to vote on this \nnomination. I am willing to answer questions. Here I am. Here is who I \nam. Ask me questions. I will answer them.\n  Mr. Estrada's approach was different. He said: Here I am. But I will \nonly tell you my name and you get a chance to look at me, but I will \nnot answer your questions. We cannot allow that to\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\nhappen. If it happens on this nomination, it will happen on the next \nnomination.\n  What we have said to Mr. Estrada is, answer the questions. We have \nsubmitted a list of things he refused to answer that others have \nroutinely answered. We said: Release the information from your term \nworking in the Solicitor's office. Others have done that. Mr. Estrada \nis not a judge so we do not have much of a record to go on regarding \nhow he thinks and how he approaches his responsibilities.\n  He should, and I hope he will, decide to meet the basic requirements \nof providing information to the Senate. When he does that, in my \njudgment, I think we ought to proceed. Until he does, in my judgment, \nwe ought not proceed under any circumstance.\n  Our job is to give advice and consent on a lifetime appointment. \nAnyone who treats that lightly does not understand the responsibility \nunder article II of the Constitution.\n  Let me finish by saying I take no pleasure in saying that Mr. Estrada \nhas additional requirements in front of him. But it is he himself who \nhas visited that upon this Senate. Had he answered the questions and \nprovided the information, we would not be in this situation. But we are \nin this situation of requiring this nominee, before he is voted upon, \nto provide the basic information that we have requested in \nconsideration of whether he ought to receive a lifetime appointment on \nthe second highest court in this country. If and when he provides that \ninformation, I will be happy to vote and make a judgment on Miguel \nEstrada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise first of all in support of the \nEstrada nomination and to say a word or two about it. Mr. Estrada's \nqualifications are excellent. I reviewed them the other day and it \nstruck me that the man is so smart it is almost scary: Harvard Law \nSchool, Phi Beta Kappa graduate, clerk of the court of appeals, clerked \non the Supreme Court, argued numerous cases before the Supreme Court.\n  I clerked on a court of appeals, and I mean no disrespect to the \nmembers of the Federal judiciary when I say I wish every Judge had Mr. \nEstrada's qualifications when he or she went on the bench. Mr. Estrada \nis competent, qualified, honest, and he deserves to be on the court of \nappeals.\n  I regret the filibuster that is currently underway to prevent his \nconfirmation. It is unfair to him. It is bad for the country. Worst of \nall, it introduces a note of discord into the Senate that makes me \ndiscouraged about our ability to do the other things we need to do for \nthis country--to pull together behind a prescription drug plan, behind \na jobs bill, behind a strong defense that will protect our men and \nwomen in uniform, protect our country, create jobs in Missouri and \naround the country. It will also inhibit our ability to accomplish what \nwe need to do in health care for small business.\n\n\n                          Heath Care Insurance\n\n  I will take a few minutes and talk now about what could be the most \nsignificant measure that we could pass to expand the cause of access to \nhealth insurance for people who work for small businesses in this \ncountry.\n  I chaired the Small Business Committee in the House for two terms, \nand from the time I did that, I made it my point to interact with small \nbusiness people around the country and especially around Missouri. They \nhave a number of problems they are confronting: Taxes are too high; in \nmany cases they face regulations that do not make any sense, that \ninhibit them and hurt them and burden them and accomplish nothing in \nterms of environmental quality or worker safety or any of the social \ngoals we want to achieve. Many small businesses have difficulty getting \naccess to the capital they need to grow, to expand, to create jobs.\n  Those are all problems. We need to work on all those problems. But \nthe No. 1 problem facing small business in this country today is the \nrising cost of health insurance premiums. I have seen it all over the \nState of Missouri. I have been in places in Cape Girardeau, in \nColumbia, in Joplin, where small business owners report to me premium \nincreases of 25 percent in 1 year or premiums doubling over 3 years. \nThe effects of this are incalculable. Small business people cannot \ncompete effectively for employees. They have to buy poor quality health \ninsurance, and in some cases have to drop their health insurance \naltogether, or else the high premiums suck up money they want to put in \nwage increases or to expand the business. The high premiums are \ntremendously unfair to them, very bad for the country and, most \nimportantly, very bad for the people who work for small businesses. Of \nthe 41 million people in the United States who are uninsured today, \nalmost two-thirds of them own a small business or work for a small \nbusiness or are dependents of somebody who owns a small business. The \nimpact on them is enormous.\n\n  And think of the impact on the rest of the health care system. Just \nbecause these folks are uninsured doesn't mean they don't get sick. At \na certain point, when they get sick enough they go to the emergency \nroom or they go to the hospital. Since, those costs are currently \nunsponsored, they have to be shifted to the rest of the population or \nhospitals have to eat those costs. What a difference it would make to \nthe people of this country and the small business sector and to the \neconomy if we could introduce and pass a measure that would help cover \nfolks who currently are uninsured. We can do that.\n  I have talked about the bad news. The good news is that we have an \nidea that can fix this problem very substantially. It is an idea that \npassed in the House of Representatives two terms in a row. It is time \ntested. It is supported on a bipartisan basis in the House. It has the \nbroad support of the small business community. It would not cost the \ntaxpayers of this country a dime. I am talking about association health \nplans.\n  Let me explain what association health plans are. The best way to \nthink of them is that they would simply empower small businesspeople of \nwhatever kind to get health insurance on the same terms that big \ncompanies already can. AHPs would reduce the cost of health insurance \nto small businesses by 10 percent to 20 percent. This is how they would \nwork. We need to pass a law empowering or enabling the major trade \nassociations, the Farm Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce, the NFIB, the \nmedical associations, to sponsor ERISA health care plans, including \nself insured plans, the same way big companies can.\n  Then, if you joined the trade association, the association would have \nto offer you coverage under the plans. They would have to offer it to \nyou. They would have to carry you. So if you were a small business you \ncould join the trade association and it would be as if you were \nbecoming a little division of a big company. It would be as if your \nsmall business had been bought by a bigger company and all of a sudden \nyou were part of a large national pool of people without having to pay \nthe marketing costs or the profit margins of big insurance companies, \nand with much reduced administrative costs. One of the big reasons \nsmall businesses have to pay more for health insurance is that the \nadministrative cost for small businesses is so much greater.\n  As I said, this would not cost the taxpayers a dime. It is not a \nGovernment program. It just allows small businesses to pool together to \nhelp themselves and their employees. It is not a revolutionary change, \nbut the impact would be revolutionary on people who work for small \nbusiness who would have access to health insurance. The number of \nuninsured would be reduced by millions of people.\n\n  We have gone years without really good news in the health care \nsector, and association health plans have the potential to be that good \nnews. As I said, the bill has a history already, at least in the House. \nIt was introduced first in the 104th Congress 6 or 7 years ago by my \ngood friend, then-Congressman Harris Fawell. We passed it twice 2 years \nrunning in the House. It had strong bipartisan support. I think the \nbill when we introduced it originally in the House had 85 Republicans \nand 25 Democrats, including the ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee in the House. It has very strong support already in this \nbody. I am pleased to say the chair of the Small Business Committee, \nMs. Snowe, is a strong supporter. Senator Bond is a strong supporter.\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\n  There is simply no reason why we cannot pass this bill. There is \nnothing in this bill that implicates any of the great philosophical \ndivisions that separate the two parties on other kinds of issues. The \nbill is in the mainstream of both political parties. It would make a \nhuge difference for America, for small business, and for the people who \nare uninsured, and we simply ought to get it done.\n  That is the kind of thing I am looking forward to working on in the \nSenate. Let us have an up or down vote on the Estrada nomination and \nthen move forward together.\n  We have to be able to create jobs. We have to do something about the \nhealth care situation in this country. We have to attend to the \nnational defense. We should confirm the President's qualified nominees \nsuch as Mr. Estrada and then move on and pass this necessary measure \nfor small business and for the people of the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The senior Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, it is a great pleasure today to be able to \nwelcome my new colleague from Missouri to this body. I think he will \nfind, since we are not limited to 1 minute on this side of the Capitol, \nthat remarks are not nearly as concise as they would be in the other \nbody. But certainly his experience there will be of great value.\n  I have been proud and pleased to know Jim Talent and his wonderful \nfamily for many years in the State of Missouri. I knew him when he \nserved as the Republican leader in the legislature. I worked with him \nclosely when he was the chairman of the Small Business Committee in the \nHouse. There was a time when the State of Missouri had double duty in \nsmall business and it was a pleasure to work with him then.\n  I also know his children and his wonderful wife, Brenda. They are a \ngreat family. They make a great team. This fall I got to see a lot of \nthem. They give him the courage and the support he needs to do an \nexcellent job.\n  We also were very saddened that his father, who meant so much to him, \ndid not live to see him achieve this victory in the end of the \ncampaign. He lost his father and, while it was quite a blow to him, he \npersevered. It was a mark of the man that he came through these very \ndifficult times.\n  I know this body will benefit from Jim Talent's contributions. He has \nbeen a champion for association health plans, which I think are \nessential for enabling small businesses to participate in the \ncompetitive marketplace, to secure health insurance for employees and \ntheir families. Jim has championed this idea on the House side. I know \nit is a top priority of the President and the Secretary of Labor, and \nit is good to have him leading this charge in the Senate now, along \nwith Chairman Snowe and the other members of the Small Business \nCommittee and people who are supportive of small business in the \nSenate.\n  Obviously, as has been said, the benefit of an AHP, or association \nhealth plan, is by allowing small businesses with similar interests \nacross State lines, across the country, to come together in one pool; \nthey can gain the efficiencies of purchasing in volume; They can gain \nthe advantages of administering overhead, which can be spread across \nmany businesses. For the same reason that you pay less for soda in cans \nif you buy it by the case, or multiple cases, than if you buy it one at \na time, buying health care is much the same. No. 1, you get \nefficiencies of scale. You also have an opportunity to spread the \nrisks. Those who have taken time to study health care know that the \nbroader the pool, the broader the actuarial component is, the more \nreasonable the limits will be.\n  I see my colleague from Massachusetts is ready to take the floor.\n  Mr. TALENT. Will the Senator yield for just a moment? I certainly \nwill not delay the Senator from Massachusetts. He has been very kind in \nallowing me to speak, but I wanted to thank the Senator for his kind \nremarks about me and many kindnesses to me, and especially coming out \non the floor. I also want to say, because I see the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Utah, \nhow impressed I have been and how much I feel welcomed by the many \nsenior Members of this body who took a moment to come over on their own \nand say hello to me. I am just grateful for that. It is a real mark of \nthe congeniality of the Senate. I appreciate it.\n\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Missouri for yielding.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague. I appreciate the indulgence of the \nMembers on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, if I may ask my colleague from \nMassachusetts for a moment of privilege, I want to personally praise my \ncolleague from Missouri for his maiden speech today and for the \nexcellent job he has been doing ever since he began here. I just wish \nwe had him on the Judiciary Committee as well because we know the great \nlawyer he is, and we also know about the terrific experiences he has \nhad over in the House and also in private practice.\n  I just want him to know how much we appreciate having him in the \nSenate and how proud I am of him every day.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I join with my colleagues in drawing \nattention to the remarks of our new colleague from Missouri speaking on \nthe issue of health insurance, the uninsured and the challenges which \nare out there for the small business community. This is, as he has very \nwell stated, an extraordinary problem for the reasons he has outlined.\n  It is amazing to me that the small businesses in this country \ncontinue to try to provide coverage. As we know, in his State as well \nas mine, they are all paying about 30 percent more in terms of the \npremiums than larger companies, and in many instances they have a rapid \nturnover in terms of the companies that are available to them.\n  This really is an extremely significant part of the whole crisis in \nterms of the uninsured. There are a number of different proposals to \nwhich we will have a chance to give focus. But I certainly welcome the \nfact that he selected as his maiden speech the whole issue and question \nabout the uninsured and the challenges that businesses, and small \nbusinesses, face. We may have some difference in just how to deal with \nthe issue, but I certainly look forward to working with him and others \nto see how we can make progress.\n  I thank him for his statement and for the fact that he is focusing on \nan issue that is of such importance to our fellow citizens; that is, \nthe question of the uninsured and how we are going to continue to \nprovide insurance for small businesses.\n  Madam President, one of our most important responsibilities as \nSenators is the confirmation of federal judges. These are lifetime \nappointments. Long after we have served our Senate terms, the judges \nnominated by the President will continue to interpret the Constitution \nand federal laws. A President's nominees are an enduring legacy that \nwill affect the life of our country and the lives of our constituents \nfor many years to come.\n\n  The important work we do in Congress to improve health care, reform \npublic schools, protect workers rights, and ensure enforcement of civil \nrights means less if we fail to fulfill our responsibility to provide \nthe best possible advice and consent on judicial nominations. Tough \nenvironmental laws mean little to a community that can't enforce them \nin our federal courts. Civil rights laws are undercut if there are no \nremedies for disabled men and women. Fair labor laws are only words on \npaper if we confirm judges who ignore them.\n  For all of these reasons, we must carefully review the qualifications \nof federal judges, particularly nominees to the DC Circuit. Because the \nsupreme Court hears relatively few cases, the appellate courts are \nfrequently the courts of last resort for millions of Americans. And, of \nthose appellate courts, the DC Circuit is one of the most important. It \nhas a unique and prominent role among the Federal courts, especially in \ninterpreting administrative law, and it has exclusive jurisdiction over \nmany laws affecting the workplace, the environment, civil rights, and \nconsumer protection. For the most vulnerable among us, the DC circuit \nis often the final stop on the road to justice.\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\n  Given its location and jurisdiction, the D.C. Circuit has often \ndecided important cases involving separation of powers, the role of the \nfederal government, the responsibilities of Federal officials, and the \nauthority of Federal agencies. In the 1960s and 1970s, the DC Circuit \nhad a significant role in broadening public access to agency and \njudicial proceedings, expanding civil rights guarantees, overseeing \nadministrative agencies, protecting the public interest in \ncommunications regulation, and strengthening environmental protections.\n  In the 1980s, however, the DC Circuit changed dramatically because of \nthe appointment of conservative judges. As its composition changed, it \nbecame a move conservative and activist court--striking down civil \nrights and constitutional protections, encouraging deregulation, \nclosing the doors of the courts to many citizens, favoring employers \nover workers, and undermining federal protection of the environment.\n  In the 1960s and 1970s, the DC Circuit expanded public access to \nadministrative proceedings and protected the interests of the public \nagainst big business. For example, the court enabled more plaintiffs to \nchallenge agency decisions. It held that a religious group--as members \nof the listening public--could oppose the license renewal of a \ntelevisionstation accused of racial and religious discrimination. It \nheld that an organization of welfare recipients was entitled to \nintervene in proceedings before a Federal agency. No longer would these \nagencies be able to ignore the interests of those they were supposed to \nprotect.\n  But in the 1980s, with the ascent of conservative appointees, the DC \nCircuit began denying access to the courts. It held that a labor union \ncould not challenge the denial of benefits to its members--a decision \nlater overturned by the Supreme Court. It held that environmental \ngroups are not qualified to seek review of EPA Standards under the \nClean Air Act. These decisions are characteristic of the DC Circuit's \nflip-flop in the 1980s. After decades of landmark decisions allowing \neffective implementation of important laws and principles, the DC \nCircuit is now creating precedents on labor rights, civil rights, and \nthe environment that will set back these basic principles for years to \ncome.\n  In the 1970s and early 1980s, the DC Circuit advanced the cause of \nenvironmental protection. In this period, the court interpreted the \nClean Air Act in ways consistent with Congress' intent. In Lead \nIndustries Associations v. EPA, the court held that the EPA cannot \nconsider economic costs to industry in setting air quality standards, \nbecause Congress had made health the paramount concern in setting these \nstandards.\n  Decisions in leaded gasoline cases also significantly advanced the \neffort to reduce air pollution and protect people--particularly \nchildren in cities, from the harmful effects of automobile exhaust. In \naddition, the court took strict action when it upheld the ban on the \nmanufacturer and sale of the pesticides DDT, heptachlor and chlordane.\n  But in the mid-1980s, conservative judges on the DC Circuit began \ncutting off access to the courts for environmentalists and injected an \nanti-environmental point of view into decision after decision, \nregardless of even Supreme Court precedents. In American Trucking \nAssociations v. EPA in 1999, the DC Circuit issued a harsh decision \ndenying the EPA the authority to establish health standards for smog \nand soot. That decision was unanimously reversed by the Supreme Court. \nIn another notorious decision, Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a \ngreat Oregon v. Babbitt, it struck down habitat protections for \nendangered species. This decision also was reversed by the Supreme \nCourt.\n  When Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act, it guaranteed \nworkers the rights to join a union without discrimination or reprisal \nby employers, and to bargain with employers over the terms and \nconditions of employment. The National Labor Relations Board interprets \nand enforces the act and reviews appeals of decisions by administrative \nlaw judges. NLRB decisions are appealable to the circuit court, where \nthe unfair labor practice is alleged to have occurred, or here the \nemployer resides or transacts business, or in the DC Circuit. As a \nresult, the DC Circuit is always available as a forum to challenge \ndecisions of the board.\n  In 1980, the DC Circuit fully enforced the board's decision 83 \npercent of the time, and at least partly enforced the board's decision \nin all the other cases. By the year 2000, when the court had a 5-to-4 \nRepublican majority, including a solid majority of Reagan/Bush \nappointees, the DC Circuit enforced in full only 57 percent of NLRB \ncases and enforced at least part of the board's decisions just 70 \npercent of the time. These enforcement statistics put the DC Circuit \nsignificantly below the national average of an 83.4 percent enforcement \nrate for the board in all the courts of appeals.\n  Given these statistics, it is not surprising that the DC Circuit has \nbecome the circuit of choice for employers trying to overturn NLRB \ndecisions. In 1980, the DC Circuit heard only 3 percent of the NLRB \nappeals heard by the circuit courts. The DC Circuit ranked next to last \nof all the circuits. Only the Tenth Circuit heard fewer cases.\n  As the Reagan/Bush effect on the DC Circuit took hold, the court \nbecame increasingly attractive to industries, and the court;'s share of \nNLRB cases steadily rose. By the year 2000, the DC Circuit ranked first \namong all circuit courts in the percentage of NLRB cases herd by those \ncourts. Almost one in five cases--18 percent--were filed in the DC \nCircuit, and employers brought by far the largest number of these \ncases.\n  The DC Circuit's willingness to overturn National Labor Relations \nBoard decision is deeply troubling because of the precedents being \nestablished. In Freund Baking Co. v. NLRB, it reversed the NLRB and set \naside a union election because the court felt that a wage and hour \nlawsuit brought on behalf of several workers shortly before the \nelection interfered with a fair election.\n  In Macmillan Publishing. Co. v. NLRB, the board had overturned a \nunion representation election, finding that a company prevented a fair \nelection by distributing a leaflet telling employees to vote against \nthe union or risk losing a previously announced wage increase. The DC \nCircuit reversed the board's action.\n  The DC Circuit's hostility to the NLRB, to the detriment of workers \nand their unions, is also illustrated in other cases dominated by \nReagan Bush appointees. In International Paper Co. v. NLRB, the court \noverturned the board's decision and held that the company's permanent \nsubcontracting of employees' job during a lockout was an unfair labor \npractice. In Detroit Typographical Union v. NLRB, the court overturned \nthe NLRB's determination that Detroit News and Free Press had committed \nan unfair labor practice when it unilaterally implemented a merit pay \nproposal immediately prior to the beginning of a 19-month strike by \nnewspaper employees. In Pall Corp. v. NLRB, the court overturned the \nboard's determination that it was an unfair labor practice for an \nemployer to unilaterally revoke a contract provision on ways for the \nunion to obtain recognition at other facilities.\n  The DC Circuit also vacated a decision by the board to include \nhandicapped workers at a Goodwill production facility in the same \nbargaining unit as other employees. The court held that the handicapped \nworkers were not employees. And in C.C. Eastern v. NLRB and North \nAmerican Van Lines v. NLRB, the court overturned the board's ruling \nthat truck drivers are employees. Instead, the court held that the \ndrivers are independent contractors unprotected by the National Labor \nRelations Act.\n  Immediately after Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct of 1970, the DC Circuit issued major decisions that protected \nworkers from job-related hazards. The DC Circuit issued a landmark \nruling in United Steelworkers of America v. Marshall, which upheld \nOSHA's standard on lead in the workplace. This case continues to be \nimportant, because it upheld basic principles and protections that the \nagency went on to use in many other workplace safety standards.\n  The DC Circuit also held the OSHA Administrator to a high standard in \nimplementing the law. In 1983, the court ordered OSHA to expedite \nrulemaking on ethylene oxide, a highly toxic substance used to \nsterilize medical equipment. In a subsequent case,\n\n[[Page S2281]]\n\nthe court sent an ethylene oxide standard back to OSHA for failure to \nadopt a short-term exposure limit that would have made the standard \nmore protective.\n  In 1987, after unacceptable delay by OSHA, the court ordered the \nagency to issue a field sanitation standard requiring toilets and \ndrinking water for farmworkers, to protect them from disease.\n  Today however, employees no longer see the DC Circuit as a court in \nwhich to bring worker safety and health actions. Despite the court's \nearlier willingness to hold OSHA to its statutory mandate to protect \nworkers, workers are turning elsewhere for relief, and big business is \ncounting on the DC Circuit for assistance. It is no accident that the \nNational Association of Manufacturers and other trade associations who \nfiled a lawsuit to overturn OSHA's ergonomics standard chose the DC \nCircuit to bring their petitions for review.\n  In decades past, the DC Circuit was in the forefront of upholding \nFederal protections for minorities and women. One of the most notable \ncases on racial discrimination was a 1969 decision upholding measures \nto end the overcrowding and segregation of schools in the District of \nColumbia. In another important decision, the court held that a written \nexamination had a disparate impact on African Americans applying for \npositions in the police department. The court held that unless the test \nhad sufficient relationship to job performance, it violated the \nConstitution.\n  The DC Circuit also contributed important precedents for women \nseeking justice and equality. In Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, female \nflight attendants were assigned to the all-female ``stewardess'' \nclassification, while men who performed essentially the same job were \npaid more and called ``pursers.'' The female flight attendants sued \nNorthwest Airlines for sex discrimination. The district court held that \nNortheast Airlines had violated Federal law, and the DC Circuit upheld \nthe argument that the Equal Pay Act extended to identical jobs, and \nheld that it required equal pay for ``substantially equal'' jobs.\n  This principle was emphasized in Thompson v. Sawyer, involving a \nclaim of sex discrimination by employees of the Government Printing \nOffice. The court held that jobs may be ``substantially equal,'' even \nit they involve work on different machines or equipment, as long as the \nskills, effort, responsibility and working conditions are the same.\n  All of these decisions are advancing the cause of equal pay for women \nin the workplace, enormously important decisions. Because of these \ndecisions, we see further compliance by other companies, knowing that \nthis is the law and it has to be respected.\n  In the late 1970s and mid 1980s, in the area of sexual harassment, \nthe court held in a series of cases that sexual harassment in the \nworkplace violates title VII even when there has been no loss of \ntangible job benefits. The court also held an employer can be held \nliable for sexual harassment by a supervisor, even if the employee is \nunaware of the supervisor's actions.\n  These cases were all important steps on civil rights, enormously \nimportant to the kinds of conditions in the workplace, particularly for \nwomen on equal pay and also in terms of the issues on sexual \nharassment. This was major progress in decisions made by the DC \nCircuit.\n  People say: Why are we so concerned about this particular nominee? I \nhave been trying to review for the Senate, this afternoon, these \nvarious areas. Whether we are talking about the environment, whether we \nare talking about worker safety, whether we are talking about issues on \nwomen's rights--equal pay, freedom from harassment--all of these \njudgments and decisions that have been made by the DC Circuit have \nadvanced the cause of greater protection and greater equality for the \ncitizens in the workplace.\n  These cases were all important steps on civil rights. But when more \nconservative judges were appointed, the tide began to change. In 1973, \nthe DC Circuit had required the Federal Government to take steps to end \nsegregation in educational institutions receiving Federal funds. But a \ndecade later, by a 6-to-4 vote, the DC Circuit held in Adams v. \nRichardson that the plaintiffs could not obtain judicial review of the \nFederal Government's settlement with higher education institutions, \ndespite the Government's abandonment of its own desegregation criteria.\n  The workers and the firms affected by such decisions are well aware \nthat the DC Court of Appeals is a powerful court. This fact is not lost \non the current administration. For over two decades, Republican \nadministrations have worked diligently to reshape this court and other \ncourts. Current judicial nominees are clearly being chosen for their \nideological beliefs.\n  None of us should have any doubt that the Bush administration is \nintensely pursing this goal today.\n  The President's nominees to the circuit courts are among the most \nconservative lawyers and judges in the country. This administration is \ndoing all it can to reshape the Federal judiciary for a generation or \nmore to come in its own conservative image. In doing so, the \nadministration is undermining the enforcement of important \nenvironmental, labor, worker safety, immigration, and civil rights laws \nwhile advancing harsh new policies.\n  If this administration has its way, we will soon be drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge, developing and exploiting wetlands and \nwaterways protected by the Clean Water Act, and undermining policies \nthat protect our environment.\n  If this administration has its way, employees will have fewer labor \nand workplace protections. If this administration has its way, we will \nsee the continued erosion of civil rights laws.\n  It is obvious that Mr. Estrada has been nominated to a court that is \noverturning important precedents and moving farther and farther to the \nright--a court that disregards congressional intent and the letter and \nspirit of the law it has a duty to respect--courts like the current \nadministration, more interested in serving big business than in serving \njustice.\n  As I reviewed just briefly why this nominee is so important, we get \nasked why is this particular nominee so important? As I mentioned, it \nis the DC Circuit. It is making and has made these judgments time and \ntime again in protecting individuals and the environment and protecting \nworkers. We have seen a significant shift in recent times. What we are \ntrying to find out is what the nominee's views are in the general areas \nI have mentioned in which this court has such important jurisdiction.\n  We could get no answers on the issue of workers rights, no answers on \nthe issue of civil rights, no answers on the issue of the environment, \nno answers on the issue of the broad sweep of different questions that \ncome in terms of administrative agencies and the importance, what kind \nof precedence, what kind of latitude they give to administrative \nagencies. No, we are not entitled to those answers at all. Absolutely \nnone. We just are denied any kind of opportunity to hear any response \nas to a court of this importance. We are entitled to hear the nominee, \nnot for his specific outcomes of a particular case but to show an \nunderstanding and a grasp and an awareness of the importance of the \nlaws and a sense of the type of commitment he has in terms of \nfundamental constitutional protections.\n  I urge my colleagues to heed the warnings of the many Latino \norganizations and leaders who have raised concerns about Mr. Estrada's \nnomination. As 52 Latino labor leaders have written:\n\n       America's working families look to the federal courts to \n     protect our rights at work, to stop unfair labor practices by \n     employers, and to ensure that employers respect laws \n     regarding fair pay and equal treatment on the job.\n       Of all the federal courts, none--other than the U.S. \n     Supreme Court--is more important to working people than the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. \n     It is in this court that the legal rights of working people \n     are won and lost. After a careful review of Mr. Estrada's \n     record, on behalf of the working families of America, we have \n     decided to oppose the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n\n  These concerns are shared by the United Steelworkers of America, the \nUAW, Community Rights Counsel, Defenders of Wildlife, Earth Justice, \nthe Endangered Species Coalition, the Environmental Defense Fund, the \nEnvironmental Working Group, Friends of the Earth, the Sierra Club, the \nWilderness Society, the Mexican American\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\nLegal Defense Fund, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus, and many \nother organizations.\n  Earlier today we had meetings with the leaders of the Hispanic \nCaucus. They reviewed with us how they have interviewed various \nnominees over recent years, how they were able to get some kind of a \nsense, and the degree of support they had given to many other nominees \nwho they had a particular interest in, who had a Hispanic background, \nand how they interviewed this nominee.\n  I will take some time tomorrow to review in some detail with the \nSenate their conclusions and their observations. They are the ones who \nspeak for the Hispanic community. They are the ones who understand the \nhopes and dreams of so many of our Hispanic brothers and sisters. They \nare the ones who have, through life experience, a keen awareness and \nunderstanding about the importance of justice.\n  But some of the statements they made this afternoon, which I found so \ncompelling, were the fact that when the dust settles on the Presidency, \nwhether it is one party or the other, when the final action is taken in \nthe appropriations and the legislative branch, the one place the \nHispanics have historically been able to look to and have a sense of \nconfidence has been the American judicial system. They consider it \nsacrosanct in terms of the types of challenges they are facing daily in \nour society. They challenge us to preserve that kind of equality.\n  They reviewed in careful detail, not just for us but for Americans, \nin the form of our meeting this afternoon with the press exactly why \nthey are so strongly opposed to this nominee.\n  I stand with these groups and the millions of Americans they \nrepresent and urge the Senate to reject the nomination.\n\n\n                           Education Funding\n\n  Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from New Mexico. I would \nlike to, if I may, proceed for about 3 or 4 more minutes on a different \nsubject, but one I know he is very much interested in. I think it is \nimportant to bring to the attention of the Senate. That is the outcome \nof the omnibus 2003 budget in the area of education.\n  We are going to have the final budget conference report in the next \nseveral hours, but there are a number of parts of it that effectively \nhave been closed. It is important, since it affects the families in \nthis country who are concerned about education, that we take a moment \nto review the positive outcome that has taken place in the omnibus 2003 \nbudget that marks a victory for parents and teachers and principals and \nschoolchildren across the Nation.\n  When the omnibus 2003 spending bill is reported out of conference \nlater tonight, it will include an education budget increase that is \neight times President Bush's request. For the second time in 4 weeks \nthe Congress will reject President Bush's inadequate education budget \nand insist on increased resources to carry out school reform. And for \nthe second time in 4 weeks, Republicans and Democrats in Congress will \nreject the administration's ongoing drive to divert scarce public \nschool funding to private school vouchers.\n  I see the Senator from Maine who, with our friend and colleague from \nConnecticut, during the authorization spoke so eloquently about the \nimportance of funding of title I. We made important progress in \nincluding approximately 500,000 more children who would be eligible for \ntitle I as the result of the omnibus bill.\n  The final year budget which effectively will provide resources that \nwill be available to the school systems this spring will provide 3.2 \nbillion in education over the previous year and 2.8 billion over \nPresident Bush's budget. Title I, the key school reform program, the No \nChild Left Behind, would be increased by $1.4 billion, helping half a \nmillion more needy children to be fully served. In my State of \nMassachusetts, 46,000 more children will be served. IDEA will increase \nby $1.4 billion, putting us a step closer toward fully funding the \nprogram as promised. My own State of Massachusetts will see a $32 \nmillion increase in special education funding.\n  Support for improved teaching quality and reducing class size will \nincrease by $100 million--not nearly enough, but we are going in the \nright direction. We will improve the quality of 24,000 more teachers \nacross the country. Programs that help English language learners master \nEnglish will increase by $25 million and will help 37,000 more children \nlearn English.\n  We have made strong steps toward meeting the promises of full funding \noutlined in No Child Left Behind and NIDA. But it is not enough. \nTeachers and students need more support. Teacher shortages are getting \nworse, class sizes are increasing, State deficits are skyrocketing. So \nwe have a good deal of work to do. But as a result of the decisions \nthat have been made recently in the Senate and in the conference \nreport, there is some good news on the way.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from New Mexico for permitting me to \nfinish.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me first thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts for his eloquent statement on the Estrada nomination and \nalso his other statement about the level of funding for education \ncontained in the omnibus appropriations bill. I know how hard he has \nworked on that issue for many years. I commend him for the progress \nthat has been made, and I agree with him that much more progress needs \nto be made.\n  I want to say a few words about the Estrada nomination and also talk \nabout another aspect of the President's proposed budget to us, with \nwhich I have found serious concern.\n  First, on the Estrada nomination for the DC Court of Appeals, Miguel \nEstrada has been nominated for that position, and, frankly, the concern \nI bring to this issue is that many of my good friends and people whom I \nrespect in the House of Representatives, in the Hispanic Caucus, have \nindicated that they oppose his nomination. When I said many, I should \nhave said all. They had quite a discussion and quite a period of \ninvestigation of this nomination, and they concluded unanimously that \nthe Hispanic Caucus of the House of Representatives would oppose the \nnomination. I have been contacted by several members of that caucus and \nurged to resist the nomination in the Senate. As I say, I have not \ntaken the time to look into it in detail myself, but I have great \nrespect for these gentlemen and women who have worked hard on this \nissue, and their strong opposition is of concern to me.\n  I am also concerned that not a single Democratic member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee determined to support the nominee after hearing the \nnominee's answers to questions before the committee. I share my \ncolleagues' concerns as expressed by many of those members on the \nJudiciary Committee that we simply do not have enough information about \nthis nominee at this time to cast an informed vote. During his \nconfirmation hearing, he was not willing to answer many basic questions \nthat were propounded to him. He was evasive when asked about his \njudicial philosophy. He refused to provide samples of his work from the \ntime he served in the Solicitor General's Office. There have been \nrequests for information made that, in my view, have been reasonable.\n\n  As I understand it, the chairman and ranking Democrat on the \nJudiciary Committee and Senator Daschle are continuing to request \nadditional information before any vote is cast on that nomination.\n  Some have attempted to turn this debate into a debate about the \nnominee's ethnicity. I don't believe that is the issue. I have \nsupported many Hispanic candidates. In my State, I had the great honor \nto recommend to President Clinton, our previous President, and he in \nfact appointed a Hispanic nominee to our Federal court in New Mexico. \nBut that support was based on having a full record regarding the \ncandidate's qualifications in each case. We do not have a full record \nas to this nominee at this point. I hope when we attain it, then we can \nmove forward with the vote at sometime in the future.\n\n\n                    The President's Pension Proposal\n\n  Madam President, I want to talk for a few minutes about a set of \nproposals the administration has made related to pension coverage that \nI think are of serious concern. You might say, where does that fit into \nthe other major issues being discussed here? As I see it,\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\nthe President has presented his new budget to the Congress, and part of \nthat budget involves reductions in revenue. Now, the portion of those \nreductions in revenue that has been focused on most is the stimulus \npackage, the recommended elimination of the tax on dividends from \nstock, the recommendations to accelerate the anticipated changes in the \nincome tax rates; all of that has been what people have focused on.\n  There are other parts of what the President has proposed to us which \nare also deeply troubling. I think it is time we begin to focus on \nthose. The President has made some recommendations that I think carry \nwith them some great danger.\n  Let me address the first chart called ``Passed and Proposed Tax \nCuts.'' This chart makes the obvious point that, in 2001, Congress \npassed a major tax cut bill which, over a 10-year period, was estimated \nto reduce revenue to the Government by $1.35 trillion. That is a very \nlarge tax cut. At the time, there was great fanfare by those who \nsupported it that this was the largest tax cut in our Nation's history. \nIt reduced individual tax rates; it repealed, essentially, a temporary \nestate tax, increased contribution limits to retirement plans.\n  Two weeks ago, Congress received the President's proposed budget for \nthis year. That budget says we should add to the $1.35 trillion and the \n2002 stimulus bill a new tax cut, a new series of tax cuts that add up \nto $1.46 trillion. People say that is not the right figure. The figure \ndiscussed here is 670-some-odd billion dollars; that is what it is \ngoing to cost, not $1.46 trillion. But I refer you to the budget \ndocuments that were presented to the Congress. We had a hearing in the \nFinance Committee the other day with our new Secretary of the Treasury. \nI asked him about this. He said: I am not sure that is the right \nnumber. We read it back to him out of his own budget documents. That is \nthe right number. It includes the stimulus package, but it also \nincludes the CARE Act, MSA expansion and permanency, and the proposal \nrelated to pensions.\n\n  Let me talk about the pension-related provisions for a few minutes. \nIn my view, these pension-related provisions that the President is now \nurging on the Congress could have a devastating effect on retirements \nand the ability of workers to save for their retirement. These \nproposals mark a dangerous and irresponsible shift away from existing \npolicies that are intended to encourage retirement saving by all of our \nworkers in employer-provided plans.\n  The proposal the President has made is to deemphasize employer-\nprovided plans and essentially take away the incentives for \ncontinuation of those plans and, instead, shift to a system where \neveryone is left to fend for himself or herself. In my view, this would \nbenefit only those in our society who need help the least. The \nPresident's proposal is based on the creation of two new super-IRAs: \nThere is the RSA, Retirement Savings Account, and the LSA. Each of \nthese would allow individuals to set aside $15,000 a year in the two \ntogether for favorable tax treatments. Those with additional resources \nwould be able to set aside an additional $75,000 a year for other \nfamily members who could set up their own LSA; so if you had two or \nthree children, or a spouse, you could certainly do it for them as \nwell. While some would benefit from this type of arrangement, the vast \nmajority of Americans would be unable to find the resources to save on \ntheir own.\n  The creation of these new accounts negates the tax advantages \ncurrently available only for employer-provided plans. The likely result \nis that without these current tax advantages, employers will simply \nstop offering their plans. It will no longer be economical, and it will \nno longer be the most efficient way to meet their own retirement needs.\n  About 80 years ago, Congress began to offer employers preferential \ntax treatment if they would help their employees to pay into pension \nplans. Then, as now, the Congress appreciated the need to get the \nemployer involved in the employee's retirement savings. In doing so, we \ncreated a series of nondiscrimination rules to guarantee that employers \nprovide benefits to all employees, not just those who are the top level \nemployees.\n  We have seen many examples in recent months, beginning with the Enron \nscandal and then in the case of WorldCom, and many others, where top \nindividuals in corporate structures have benefited extremely well, \nwhile the average worker has been left unassisted.\n  We have put in place in the tax law a requirement that there not be \ndiscrimination in pension coverage. We also created a series of tax \nincentives that encouraged employees to set aside their own funds in \nthese same accounts. The combination of incentives for employers and \nincentives for employees have always been premised on the employer \noffering the employees a plan in which that employee could save.\n  Over the years, we have made significant changes and adaptations to \nthe system. The primary goal has been to encourage employer-provided \nplans and to encourage employers to assist employees in this very \nimportant financial goal that employees need to have.\n  The President's current proposal, in my view, dramatically ends this \npolicy, ends this effort to encourage employers to help employees save \nfor their retirement. At a time when we are facing huge funding \ndeficits in Social Security, it seems to me reckless to be considering \nremoving the underpinnings and the stability of our current private \nretirement system.\n  Our current private retirement system has many defects, and I would \nbe the first to point those out, and I have pointed them out many \ntimes. But to take away what we currently have in the way of a private \nretirement system and the incentives that underpin that system at this \ntime I think would be very wrongheaded.\n  There is a rational basis for encouraging employer-provided plans. \nLet me show this chart which gives some statistics. This is a \nDepartment of Labor chart. It shows that for all workers for 1999, the \ncoverage for all private sector workers was 44 percent. That is, 44 \npercent of private sector workers in the country had some kind of \npension plan. In those firms where the employer sponsored a plan, it \nwas substantially higher. It was 58 percent. The participation when the \nemployer sponsored a plan was 75 percent for all workers.\n  The point of this is clearly that employee participation increases \nwhen employers are sponsoring a plan. We have the very same thing as \nFederal workers. The Federal Government says that if we wish to put \naway funds for retirement, the Federal Government, through the Thrift \nSavings Plan, will match the contribution that Federal workers make up \nto a certain percentage. I think it is 5 percent, in that range.\n  This is very similar to the kind of employee plan that many have--a \nmatching plan. Some employers say they will match dollar for dollar; \nsome say they will match 50 cents for each dollar the employee puts in. \nThe main point is, workers will take advantage of employer retirement \nplans when those plans are offered.\n\n  This chart demonstrates one other point, and that is, when you get \ndown to minority representation, the percentage of minority workers who \nare covered by pension plans is substantially less than the percentage \nin the population as a whole, and there is only 27 percent in the case \nof Hispanic workers, but it goes up dramatically where the employer is \nsponsoring the plan. It goes from 27 percent to 68 percent. So employer \nsponsoring of plans is a very substantial factor in causing people to \nsave for their retirement.\n  The administration, in my view, should be focusing on ways to \nencourage more employers, particularly small businesses--in my State, \nmost employers are small businesses--to offer their employees plans. We \nshould not be giving employers reasons not to offer those plans or to \ndiscontinue plans they have historically offered.\n  Last year, Edward N. Wolf of the Economic Policy Institute presented \na report entitled ``Retirement Insecurity: The Income Shortfalls \nAwaiting the Soon to Retire.'' That report demonstrated the shift away \nfrom defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans over the last \n30 years, and we have seen that shift. It demonstrated that shift has \nnot, in fact, improved our Nation's coverage rate, as it was advertised \nto do. Instead, it has reduced the overall retirement wealth for\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\nthe bulk of the workers in this country.\n  The primary reason the companies have shifted to these defined \ncontribution plans--and defined contribution plan, of course, is \nnothing except a plan which specifies how much will be put in rather \nthan specifying how much a benefit the retiree will finally receive as \na result of a plan--but the primary reason companies shifted to these \ndefined contribution plans is that under these plans, the employees \nmake the majority of the contributions. The employee is the one who \nbears the risk about what happens to the funds invested in that plan. \nThis reduces the employer's cost. It makes it far more attractive to \nthe employer than a traditional pension plan.\n  The President's proposal takes it one step further, and it shifts us \none step further away from employer participation in retirement \nsavings. In many cases, the small business employer would be able to \nsave more themselves with the new IRA, so they could put away $7,500, \nthey could put away $7,500 for their wife, and they would be able to \nprovide certain higher income employees with matches, for the \nemployees' savings as well, without running afoul of any current \ndiscrimination rules.\n  Since IRAs are not covered by discrimination rules or by ERISA, the \nemployer could pick and choose which employees they want to provide \nmatches to; they could provide those matches in the form of bonuses, or \nwhatever. That is not allowed under current rules and, in my view, \nshould not be allowed. If an employer wanted, they could even \ncontribute to family members, to shareholders, or to other nonworkers \nand avoid making contributions to the average worker working for that \ncompany.\n  I think, for good reason, Congress has always opposed the creation of \nthis kind of mechanism which would open the possibility for \ndiscriminatory treatment among workers. The President's proposal, in my \nview, opens the floodgate to a whole range of new abuses of this kind.\n  At the same time, coverage rates have remained flat and as employers \nhave shifted toward defined contribution plans, the retirement income \nof retirees, and those near retirement, have decreased as compared to \ntheir current incomes. This is not new information to a great many \nolder Americans.\n  In 1989, roughly 30 percent of households were projected as living on \nless than half of their preretirement income. If we look a decade \nlater, by 1998 this number had increased to 42 \\1/2\\ percent. For \nAfrican Americans and Hispanics, the numbers are significantly worse. \nIn 1989, there was 43 \\1/2\\ percent who lived on less than half of \ntheir preretirement income. By 1998, that had grown to over 50 \npercent--53 percent.\n  The Wolf report demonstrates that only those with retirement wealth \nin excess of a million dollars saw their retirement wealth increase in \n1999. This chart shows every other class of retiree. It starts with \nthose with incomes of less than $25,000; $25,000 to $50,000; $50,000 to \n$100,000; $100,000 to $250,000; $250,000 to $500,000; $500,000 to \n$999,999; and then over a million.\n  Between the period of 1983 and 1998, the changes in retirement wealth \nhave been negative. There has been a reduction in retirement wealth for \nevery single group in our society with the exception of those who \nearned over a million dollars a year. That is the unfortunate reality \nwe face in this country.\n  The President's proposal would speed up this wealth gap immeasurably \nby forcing workers to solely fund their own retirement savings. For \nexample, under the President's proposal, a wealthy executive would be \nable to save almost $50,000 a year with tax preferences for a family of \nfour, and meanwhile workers living paycheck to paycheck would likely be \nunable to set aside any significant amount for retirement.\n  Clearly, what will be good for the top floor will not be good at the \nshop floor level. This is not the first time Congress has looked at \nIRAs. In 1986, as part of the major tax reform we did then, we created \nwhat we call the active participation rules that are still in place \ntoday. These rules limit those who can participate in an IRA based on \nincome. The reasons for the rules are simple: Data clearly indicated \nthe only people taking advantage of IRAs at that time were upper income \npeople who also had employer-provided plans.\n  Congress realized then, as we still appreciate now, that IRAs are not \nutilized by lower income workers. The President is proposing to \nessentially replace the current retirement system with IRAs, and \nthereby ensuring lower paid workers are not saving for retirement.\n  According to the 1999 IRS statistics, that means less than 5 percent \nof income earners who made less than $50,000 a year were, in fact, \nputting funds into an IRA. That means 95 percent of those earning \n$50,000 or less did not put a single dollar into an IRA. The majority \nof working families clearly do not need or benefit from expanding IRAs \nas the President would have us do.\n  A shift toward this type of savings away from employer-provided plans \nwill not help the majority of our workers.\n  This final chart indicates, using Department of Treasury data from \n1999, it is clear we still have a great distance to go. Based on the \ndata reflected on this chart, the lowest 40 percent of income earners \nreceive roughly 2 percent of the tax benefits currently provided under \nour Tax Code.\n  That is the lowest 20 percent, and the second 20 percent, added \ntogether, get about 2 percent. The lowest 60 percent receive a little \nless than 12 percent of those benefits. At the same time, the top 10 \npercent receive 43 percent of the benefits and the top 1 percent get \napproximately 10 percent of those benefits.\n  The President's proposal, as I understand it, would significantly \nshift the Government-provided tax benefits to the upper income \ncategories, as only those with disposable income would be able to \nparticipate. Unfortunately, this proposal we have been given makes it \nmore cost effective and less administratively burdensome for employees \nto fund their own retirement outside of the qualified plan. So the \nresult is most workers will find themselves without an employer-\nprovided plan that provides salary deferrals and oftentimes significant \nemployer contributions. Instead, most workers will have to put aside \ntheir own funds each paycheck, either without a tax benefit or the \nreceipt of a tax benefit that does not come until the end of the tax \nyear.\n  Sadly, for many American families, there are not enough resources \navailable for them to pay all of their expenses and still do what the \nPresident has in mind.\n  I do not know what all of the motivations were behind this proposal. \nBefore we move ahead, I very much hope we can look at it in great depth \nduring hearings in the Finance Committee. As far as I can tell, it is \ndesigned to provide tax incentives for additional savings by those who \nneed them the least, and it certainly would have the effect of \nundercutting the employer-sponsored retirement system we have long \ntried to strengthen.\n  As I indicated earlier, I am one of the first to admit the current \nemployer-sponsored retirement system we have is not adequate and needs \nto be strengthened, but eliminating the private retirement system we \nhave and undermining the incentives for employers to maintain that \nsystem is not the solution to the problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it seems to me if the Democrats are going \nto filibuster, they ought to give some reasons for their filibuster. \nThey have said they are going to filibuster, for the first time in the \nhistory of this country, a Federal circuit court nominee, and the first \nHispanic nominated to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia.\n  Where are they? We have had all kinds of talks on foreign policy, on \nrunning down the President's financial plans, running down his foreign \npolicy. I heard one Senator today talk about the real problem is North \nKorea. Of course, it is a real problem. So is Iraq. So is Osama bin \nLaden.\n  These are the people who watched me in the middle of the 1990s be the \nfirst one to tell President Clinton he better get on Osama bin Laden \nbecause he is going to kill Americans. I actually was the first to \nbring that forth.\n  I have been on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence twice. \nThey\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\ndid nothing, and now they are moaning and groaning because we have \ninherited a problem that has existed for a long time. Because nothing \nwas done? Now they are saying, well, we should be concerned about North \nKorea. Yes, we should be. We should be concerned about everything.\n  It does not take many brains to realize a lot of the finances that \ncome for the terrorist movement throughout the Middle East and \nthroughout the world come from Iraq. They have supported virtually \neverybody. The Egyptian Islamic Jihad, that is where Al-Zawahri comes \nfrom. He is No. 2 to Osama bin Laden. That is where they have gotten a \nlot of their money. They support the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. They \nsupport virtually every Islamic terrorist group around. Now we are \nsupposed to just stand back because some of the Democrats think we \nought to concentrate our efforts on North Korea. Of course, we are \nconcentrating our efforts there. The President is doing everything he \nshould do. It is not quite the same. Those people are hemmed in by \nChina, who they have to have just for food, and it is not in China's \nbest interest to allow North Korea to have this kind of power and be \nable to irresponsibly use it. Nor is it in the interest of anybody in \nthe Asian community, and it is certainly not in our interest. We have \ntop people working on that and controlling it.\n  It is hard to control wild men, and we have to really look hard to \nfind one worse than Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein has used weapons of \nmass destruction against his own people. Imagine what he would do to us \nif he could.\n  My colleagues on the other side know as much as I know about it, or \nat least they should, and that is before the first session of \ninspections, Saddam Hussein came that close to having a nuclear \ndevice. You think he is not trying to do that now, and in his country, \nthe size of California, do you think it is hard for him to secrete his \nweapons of mass destruction? He can hide those in a million different \nways. This is a joke.\n\n  We have to fight terrorism. We have to fight these types of people on \nall sides. And we are. This administration is doing everything it can, \nand it really needs to have a little less bellyaching and a little less \ncriticism, a little less partisanship than what we are getting \nsometimes around here.\n  I heard other Senators get on this floor and say this court--to go \nback to Miguel Estrada--the first Hispanic nominated to the circuit \ncourt of appeals in this country who is being filibustered by people \nwho, throughout the years, have said we would never filibuster when \nthey had the Presidency, we would never use that type of a tactic. Here \nthey are, using it. It is hypocritical. It is wrong. It is unfair. It \nis establishing a precedent that could hurt this country immeasurably. \nWe could only have the least common denominator on the Federal courts \nif some on the other side got their way. To do it against the first \nHispanic nominated to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia is particularly reprehensible, especially since he has every \nqualification a person needs to fulfill this responsibility.\n  The White House and the general counsel's office have been working \novertime day and night to answer all the questions these people have \nasked over and over that are ridiculous in nature. They have made \nMiguel Estrada available for any Democrat who wants to talk to him. The \nDemocrats conducted the hearing. It was all day, which is extraordinary \nin and of itself. They controlled every aspect of that hearing. They \nasked the questions that they wanted to ask. He did not answer some of \nthem the way they would have preferred. Then they could have defeated \nhim for sure. That is not his job to try to please the Democrats or me \nor anybody else. His job is to tell the truth, which is what he did. \nAnd he had an obligation to tell the truth without saying how he would \nvote on any given issue, or otherwise he would have to recuse himself \nafter he gets on the bench and be less effective.\n  Some of the arguments we have had around here are ridiculous. The \nvery people who are griping about getting these confidential privileged \nmemoranda down at the Solicitor General's Office ignore the fact that \nof the seven former current living Solicitors General, four of them are \nDemocrats in the Solicitor's Office. Three reviewed Miguel Estrada's \nmemoranda.\n  How far do we go with these ridiculous arguments, these unfair \narguments, these discriminatory and prejudicial arguments, against a \nperson who has every qualification to be on this court? There is only \none reason they are fighting like this. They think Republicans are \ngoing to back down. Or that the President will back down. He will not \nback down.\n  I don't think most Democrats feel the way some of the radicals over \nthere do. There are some people with reasonable minds over there. I \nthink most of them. I respect everyone on the other side, but I have to \ntell you, some of them are listening to the most radical people on \ntheir side in bringing this filibuster and going against one of the \nbest nominees in history.\n  I have been on the Judiciary Committee almost 30 years, 27 years now. \nThere are very few who you would rate at the level with Miguel Estrada. \nEvery Hispanic in this country ought to be proud of it. I am calling on \nevery Hispanic in the country, whether Democrat, Independent, \nRepublican, whether you are liberal, moderate or conservative, you \nbetter start calling the Democrats and let them know this is not fair, \nthis is not right. It is abysmal. Some would say abominable. I think I \nwould be one of those.\n\n  I have seen some unfair things here from time to time, and this is a \ntough body, there is no question. Sometimes we do some dumb things, but \nI have never seen anything more unfair than what is happening here. \nWith Senators hiding behind this, I think, phony request for documents \nthey know they should not have a right to have and then try to \nrepresent on the floor that the few cases where somebody leaked \ndocuments to them, that were not recommendations for appeals, \nrecommendations for amicus curiae briefs, recommendations for \ncertiorari, none of them were, but some were leaked from the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office by partisan Democrats and they have some of these.\n  They have not seen fit to let us have copies of them, other than what \nthey are putting in the Record. We have asked for them, but they did \nnot have time to give them to us. The one case they can show where the \nDepartment really did give some documentation was in the case of Robert \nBork. The Department produced some documents concerning Bork's firing \nof Archibald Cox. It was a specialty situation. But they were not \ndocuments of recommendations of employees in the Solicitor General's \nOffice concerning appeals, concerning certiorari appeals, and \nconcerning amicus curiae briefs.\n  This is one of the phoniest excuses I have ever heard. Keep in mind, \nfour of their former Solicitors General, Democrat Solicitors General, \nare on Miguel Estrada's side. And three of them reviewed every one of \nthose documents. That is not good enough for them? They know the \nadministration cannot give in to these requests because if they did, \nevery time anybody is nominated from any part of the Justice Department \nthey would have to get confidential memoranda.\n  The executive branch does have some rights. I know that some on the \nother side do not believe that, but they do. They have some rights to \nhave their confidential documents remain confidential so they can get \nthe best advice they possibly can to represent this country, as the \nexecutive branch should. This is one of the worst arguments I have ever \nheard on the floor of the Senate. And it is all done for political \npurposes because they believe that this Hispanic man, a Republican--\nwhich is very tough for them to take, who they believe to be \nconservative--he is certainly probably moderate to conservative--I just \nknow he is qualified. Everything about him says he is qualified. All of \nhis experience tells me he is qualified. The fact he led the class at \nHarvard Law School says he is qualified. The fact he was one of the \nleaders of the class at Columbia University says he is qualified. The \nfact that he served Amalya Kearse, a Carter appointee, and she praised \nhim says he is qualified. The fact he served for a Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court, Anthony Kennedy, says he is qualified.\n  But now the administration, in response to these ridiculous claims \nand these ridiculous statements made on the floor of the Senate, has \nnow sent a\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\n15-page, single-spaced letter that basically covers every one of these \nstupid claims that have been raised.\n  I guess maybe I should not say that. Anyone can raise any claim, \nwhether it is stupid or otherwise, on the floor, and every Senator can \nask even the dumbest questions of nominees if they want. That does not \nmean nominees have to answer them. It does not mean they have to answer \nthem the way they want to--the dumb questioners, that is. We have all \ndone that from time to time, and we all fit into that category, maybe, \nfrom time to time, but not consistently.\n  There is nothing more than prejudice going on here; nothing more than \nunfairness going on here; nothing more than a double standard going on \nhere; nothing more than trying to trip up the President of the United \nStates and make his life even more miserable than it is every day with \nNorth Korea, with Iraq, with all the other problems we have in this \nworld, including France, Germany, and Belgium, which are acting \ndisgracefully and deserve the condemnation of the world for their \ncontinuous disgraceful disruptions of the unity of our NATO allies and \nfor their refusal to back Turkey, our ally who has stood up when others \nhave not stood up. We don't need them. We will back Turkey, and we \nshould back Turkey.\n\n  What gets me is we are in the middle of a filibuster of a Federal \njudge, when the Constitution says we should give advice and consent, \nnot advice and obstruction, not advice and a filibuster, not advice and \nunfairness.\n  I have to admit there were some on our side who treated President \nClinton in a shabby fashion. Not very many, but there were a few. I \nremember as a young Senator I criticized President Carter pretty \nstrongly one day. Later, I was on a 3-hour television show with him, \nsitting right beside him. We had plenty of time to discuss and talk, \nand I apologized. I said I really feel badly; I felt I didn't treat you \nfairly. He leaned over and smiled and said, Orrin, I never knew you did \nit. He said, you were so fair in so many other ways, I didn't notice \nany unfairness. That is typical of what a fine, gracious man he is.\n  Bill Clinton has plenty of faults, we all know that, like all the \nrest of us. Maybe not like all the rest of us, but we all have faults, \nwe will put it that way. And sometimes he wasn't treated as fairly as \nhe should have been, but I sure tried to do so. I certainly did with \nregard to his judicial nominees. I will tell you one thing, we never, \never filibustered a Clinton nominee, not once. There were some cloture \nvotes, but it wasn't part of a filibuster; it was more to move the \nSenate along. And nobody can claim anybody on our side actually \nfilibustered a Federal judge, which is a disgraceful thing to do.\n  I have to say I care a great deal for all of my colleagues in this \nbody. These are 100 of the greatest people on Earth. I care for my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side. But where are they? Why aren't they \ntelling us why? Why don't they give us a reason that is a good reason \nfor being against Miguel Estrada, with all of the qualifications he \nhas? Why couldn't they treat us the way they wanted us to treat their \ncircuit court nominees, which I made sure we treated right. Why can't \nthey be decent to this Hispanic nominee, the first ever nominated to \nthe Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, one of the \nmost important courts? Why is it that Senators from the Democrat side \nget on the floor and act as if, because a person is conservative, that \nperson is not going to do what is right under the law; that person is \nnot going to make sure the law is fulfilled; that person is not going \nto make sure the principle of stare decisis or prior precedent is \nfollowed? Miguel Estrada says he will, and he's an honest man. He will.\n  Why is it they think only liberal ideas are any good? I kind of \nadmire people who think only their point of view is correct and \neverybody else is wrong. But I have to tell you, some of the greatest \njudges in our country's history are conservatives. Some of the greatest \njudges are liberals. And some of the worst are liberals--and \nconservatives. Miguel Estrada would make one of the best, and he is the \nAmerican dream personified. He would open the doors for many Hispanic \npeople, not just in the Federal judiciary but in so many other ways \nthroughout this society because he will set an example that will be \nexemplary for all of us to observe. He should have a chance to sit on \nthis court and should not have to go through this type of unfair \ntreatment.\n  No nominee to the Federal court should have to go through a \nfilibuster. But, if the Democrats are going to filibuster, why don't \nthey get over here and filibuster? Why don't they tell us the reasons \nwhy? If you look at their reasons, there is not a bit of substance to \nany of them.\n  I ask unanimous consent the most recent letter of the White House, \nthis 15-page single-space typewritten letter I think answers every \nDemocrat concern, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, February 12, 2003.\n       Dear Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy: On behalf of \n     President Bush, I write in response to your letter to the \n     President dated February 11, 2003. In the letter, you renew \n     your previous request for confidential Department of Justice \n     memoranda in which Mr. Estrada provided appeal, certiorari, \n     and amicus recommendations while he was a career attorney in \n     the Office of Solicitor General for four years in the Clinton \n     Administration and one year in the George H.W. Bush \n     Administration. You also request that Mr. Estrada answer \n     certain questions beyond the extensive questions that he \n     already answered appropriately and forthrightly during his \n     Committee hearing and in follow-up written responses.\n       We respect the Senate's constitutional role in the \n     confirmation process, and we agree that the Senate must make \n     an informed judgment consistent with its traditional role and \n     practices. However, your requests have no persuasive support \n     in the history and precedent of judicial appointments. \n     Indeed, the relevant history and precedent convincingly \n     demonstrate that a new and shifting standard is being applied \n     to Miguel Estrada.\n       First, as the Department of Justice explained in its \n     letters of June 5, 2002, October 8, 2002, and January 23, \n     2003, all living former Solicitors General (four Democrats \n     and three Republicans) have strongly opposed your request for \n     Solicitor General memoranda and stated that it would \n     sacrifice and compromise the ability of the Justice \n     Department to effectively represent the United States in \n     court. Even more telling, we are informed that the Senate has \n     not requested memos such as these for any of the 67 appeals \n     court nominees since 1977 who had previously worked in the \n     Justice Department (including the seven nominees who had \n     previously worked in the Solicitor General's office). The few \n     isolated examples you have cited--in which targeted requests \n     for particular documents about specific issues were \n     accommodated for nominees to positions other than the U.S. \n     Courts of Appeals--similarly do not support your request \n     here.\n       Second, as explained more fully below with respect to your \n     request that Mr. Estrada answer additional questions, the \n     only specific question identified in your letter refers to \n     his judicial role models. You claim that Mr. Estrada refused \n     to answer a question on this topic. In fact, in his written \n     responses to Senator Durbin's question on this precise \n     subject that Mr. Estrada submitted three months ago, he cited \n     Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Lewis Powell, and Judge \n     Amalya Kearse as judges he admires (he clerked for Justice \n     Kennedy and Judge Kearse, and he further pointed out, of \n     course, that he would seek to resolve cases as he analyzed \n     them ``without any preconception about how some other judge \n     might approach the question.'' Your letter to the President \n     ignores Mr. Estrada's answer to this question. In any event, \n     beyond this one query, your letter does not pose any \n     additional questions to him. Additionally, neither of you has \n     posed any written questions to Mr. Estrada in the more than \n     three months since his all-day Committee hearing. Since the \n     hearing, Mr. Estrada also has met (and continues to meet) \n     with numerous Democrat Senators interested in learning more \n     about his record. Finally, as I will explain below, Mr. \n     Estrada forthrightly answered numerous questions about his \n     judicial approach and views in a manner that matches or \n     greatly exceeds answers demanded of previous appeals court \n     nominees.\n       With respect, it appears that a double standard is being \n     applied to Miguel Estrada. That is highly unfair \n     inappropriate, particularly for this well-qualified and well-\n     respected nominee.\n       I will turn now in more detail to the various issues raised \n     by your letter. I will address them at some length given the \n     importance of this issue and the nature of your requests.\n\n\n       I. Miguel Estrada's Qualifications and Bipartisan Support\n\n       Miguel Estrada is an extraordinarily qualified judicial \n     nominee. The American Bar Association, which Senators Leahy \n     and Schumer have referred to as the ``gold standard,'' \n     unanimously rated Estrada ``well qualified'' for the D.C. \n     Circuit, the ABA's highest possible rating. The ABA rating \n     was entirely appropriate in light of Mr. Estrada's superb \n     record as Assistant to the Solicitor General\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\n     in the Clinton and George H.W. Bush Administrations, as a \n     federal prosecutor in New York, as a law clerk to Justice \n     Kennedy, and in performing significant pro bono work.\n       Some who are misinformed have seized on Mr. Estrada's lack \n     of prior judicial experience, but five of the eight judges \n     currently serving on the D.C. Circuit had no prior judicial \n     experience, including two appointees of President Clinton and \n     one appointee of President Carter. Miguel Estrada has tried \n     numerous cases before federal juries, argued many cases in \n     the federal appeals courts, and argued 15 cases before the \n     Supreme Court of the United States. That is a record that few \n     judicial nominees can match. And few lawyers, whatever their \n     ideology or philosophy, have volunteered to represent a death \n     row inmate pro bono before the Supreme Court as did Miguel \n     Estrada.\n       Mr. Estrada's excellent legal qualifications are all the \n     more extraordinary given his personal history. Simply put, \n     Miguel Estrada is an American success story. He came to this \n     country at age 17 from Honduras speaking little English. \n     Through hard work and dedicated service to the United States, \n     Miguel Estrada has risen to the very pinnacle of the legal \n     profession. If confirmed, he would be the first Hispanic \n     judge to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit. Given his record, his background, and his integrity, \n     it is no surprise that Miguel Estrada is strongly supported \n     by the vast majority of national Hispanic organizations. The \n     League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), for \n     example, wrote to Senator Leahy to urge Mr. Estrada's \n     confirmation and explain that he ``is truly one of the rising \n     stars in the Hispanic community and a role model for our \n     youth.'' A group of 19 Hispanic organizations, including \n     LULAC and the Hispanic National Bar Association, recently \n     wrote to the Senate urging ``on behalf of an overwhelming \n     majority of Hispanics in this country'' that ``both parties \n     in the U.S. Senate . . . put partisan politics aside so that \n     Hispanics are no longer denied representation in one of the \n     most prestigious courts in the land.''\n       The current effort to filibuster Mr. Estrada's nomination \n     is particularly unjustified given that those who have worked \n     with Miguel--including prominent Democrat lawyers whom \n     you know well--strongly support his confirmation. For \n     example, Ron Klain, who served as a high-ranking adviser \n     to former Vice President Gore and former Chief Counsel to \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote: ``Miguel is a \n     person of outstanding character, tremendous intellect, and \n     with a deep commitment to the faithful application of \n     precedent. . . . [T]he challenges that he has overcome in \n     his life have made him genuinely compassionate, genuinely \n     concerned for others, and genuinely devoted to helping \n     those in need.''\n       President Clinton's Solicitor General, Seth Waxman, wrote: \n     ``During the time Mr. Estrada and I worked together, he was a \n     model of professionalism and competence. . . . In no way did \n     I ever discern that the recommendations Mr. Estrada made or \n     the analyses he propounded were colored in any way by his \n     personal views--or indeed that they reflected any \n     consideration other than the long-term interests of the \n     United States. I have great respect both for Mr. Estrada's \n     intellect and for his integrity.\n       A bipartisan group of 14 former colleagues in the Office of \n     the Solicitor General at the U.S. Department of Justice \n     wrote: ``We hold varying ideological views and affiliations \n     that range across the political spectrum, but we are \n     unanimous in our conviction that Miguel would be a fair and \n     honest judge who would decide cases in accordance with the \n     applicable legal principles and precedents, not on the basis \n     of personal preferences or political viewpoints.'' One former \n     colleague, Richard Seamon, wrote that he is a pro-choice, \n     lifelong Democrat with self-described ``liberal views on most \n     issues'' who said he would ``consider it a disgrace'' if Mr. \n     Estrada is not confirmed.\n       Similarly, Leonard Joy, head of the Federal Defender \n     Division of the Legal Aid Society of New York, wrote that \n     ``Miguel would make an excellent Circuit Court Judge. He is \n     as fine a lawyer as I have met and, on top of all his \n     intellectual abilities and judgment he would bring to bear, \n     he would bring a desirable diversity to the Court. I heartily \n     recommend him.''\n       Beyond the extensive personal testimony from those who \n     worked side-by-side with him for many years, the performance \n     reviews of Miguel for the years that he worked in the Office \n     of Solicitor General gave him the highest possible rating of \n     ``outstanding'' in every possible category. The reviews \n     stated that Miguel:\n       ``states the operative facts and applicable law completely \n     and persuasively, with record citations, and in conformance \n     with court and office rules, and with concern for fairness, \n     clarity, simplicity, and conciseness.''\n       ``[i]s extremely knowledgeable of resource materials and \n     uses them expertly; acting independently, goes directly to \n     point of the matter and gives reliable, accurate, responsive \n     information in communicating position to others.''\n       ``[a]ll dealings, oral and written, with the courts, \n     clients, and others are conducted in a diplomatic, \n     cooperative, and candid manner.''\n       ``[a]ll briefs, motions or memoranda reviewed consistently \n     reflect no policies at variance with Departmental or \n     Governmental policies, or fails to discuss and analyze \n     relevant authorities.''\n       ``[i]s constantly sought for advice and counsel. Inspires \n     co-workers by example.''\n       In the two years that Miguel Estrada and Paul Bender worked \n     together, Mr. Bender signed those reviews. These employment \n     reviews thus call into serious question some press reports \n     containing a negative comment from Mr. Bender about Mr. \n     Estrada's temperament (which is the only negative comment \n     made by anyone who actually knows Mr. Estrada). Just as \n     important, President Clinton's Solicitor General Seth Waxman \n     expressly refuted Mr. Bender's statement.\n       In sum, based on his experience, his intellect, his \n     integrity, and his bipartisan support, Miguel Estrada should \n     be confirmed promptly.\n\n\n                         II. The Senate's Role\n\n       President Bush nominated Miguel Estrada nearly two years \n     ago on May 9, 2001. As explained above, he is well-qualified \n     and well-respected. By any traditional measure that the \n     Senate has used to evaluate appeals court nominees, Miguel \n     Estrada should have been confirmed long ago. Your letter and \n     public statements indicate, however, that you are applying \n     both a new standard and new tactics to this particular \n     nominee.\n       As to the standard, the Senate has a very important role in \n     the process, but the Senate's traditional approach to appeals \n     court nominees, and the approach envisioned by the \n     Constitution's Framers, is far different from the standard \n     that you now seek to apply. Senator Biden stated the \n     traditional approach in 1997: ``Any person who is nominated \n     for the district or circuit court who, in fact, any Senator \n     believes will be a person of their word and follow stare \n     decisis, it does not matter to me what their ideology is, as \n     long as they are in a position where they are in the general \n     mainstream of American political life, and they have not \n     committed crimes of moral turpitude, and have not, in fact, \n     acted in a way that would shed a negative light on the \n     court.'' Congressional Record, March 19, 1997. Alexander \n     Hamilton explained that the purpose of Senate confirmation is \n     to prevent appointment of ``unfit characters from State \n     prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, \n     or from a view to popularity.'' Federalist No. 76. It was \n     anticipated that the Senate's approval would not often be \n     refused unless there were ``special and strong reasons for \n     the refusal.'' No. 76.\n       As to tactics, you have indicated that some Senate \n     Democrats intend to filibuster to prevent a vote on this \n     nominee. As you know, there has never been a successful \n     filibuster of a court of appeals nominee. Only a few years \n     ago, Senator Leahy and other Democrat Senators expressly \n     agreed with then-Governor Bush that every judicial nominee \n     was entitled to an up-or-down floor vote within a reasonable \n     time. On October 3, 2000, for example, Senator Leahy stated:\n       Governor Bush and I, while we disagree on some issues, have \n     one very significant issue on which we agree. He gave a \n     speech a while back and criticized what has happened in the \n     Senate where confirmations are held up not because somebody \n     votes down a nominee but because they cannot ever get a vote. \n     Governor Bush said: You have the nominee. Hold the hearing. \n     Then, within 60 days, vote them up or vote them down. Don't \n     leave them in limbo. Frankly, that is what we are paid to do \n     in this body. We are paid to vote either yes or no--not vote \n     maybe. When we hold a nominee up by not allowing them a vote \n     and not taking any action one way or the other, we are not \n     only voting `maybe,' but we are doing a terrible \n     disservice to the man or woman to whom we do this.\n       Senator Daschle similarly stated on October 5, 1999, that \n     ``[t]he Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry \n     it should vote him up or vote him down. An up or down vote, \n     that is all we seek for Berzon and Paez. And after years of \n     waiting, they deserve at least that much.''\n       In his East Room speech on October 30, 2002, President Bush \n     reiterated that every judicial nominee deserves a timely up-\n     or-down floor vote in the Senate, no matter who is President \n     or which party controls the Senate. Contrary to President \n     Bush's attempts at permanent reform to bring order to the \n     process, your current effort to employ a filibuster and block \n     an up-or-down vote on the Estrada nomination may \n     significantly exacerbate the cycle of bitterness and \n     recrimination that President Bush has sought to resolve on a \n     bipartisan basis. We fear that the damage caused by a \n     filibuster could take many years to undo. To continue on this \n     path would also be, in Senator Leahy's words, ``a terrible \n     disservice'' to Mr. Estrada. We urge you to reconsider this \n     extraordinary action, to end the filibuster of Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination, and to allow the full Senate to vote up or down.\n\n\n         III. Request for Confidential Solicitor General Memos\n\n       You have suggested that Mr. Estrada's background, \n     experience, and support are insufficient to assess his \n     suitability for the D.C. Circuit. You have renewed your \n     request for Solicitor General memos authored by Mr. Estrada. \n     But every living former Solicitor General signed joint letter \n     to the Senate opposing your request. The letter was signed by \n     Democrats Archibald Cox, Walter Dellinger, Drew Days, and \n     Seth Waxman. They stated: ``Any attempt to intrude into the \n     Office's highly privileged deliberations would come at the \n     cost of the Solicitor General's ability to defend vigorously \n     the United States' litigation interests--a cost that also\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\n     would be borne by Congress itself. . . . Although we \n     profoundly respect the Senate's duty to evaluate Mr. \n     Estrada's fitness for the federal judiciary, we do not think \n     that the confidentiality and integrity of internal \n     deliberations should be sacrificed in the process.''\n       It bears mention that the interest asserted here is that of \n     the United States, not the personal interest of Mr. Estrada. \n     Indeed, Mr. Estrada himself testified that ``I have not \n     opposed the release of those records. . . . I am \n     exceptionally proud of every piece of legal work that I have \n     done in my life. If it were up to me as a private citizen, I \n     would be more than proud to have you look at everything that \n     I have done for the government or for a private client.''\n       The history of Senate confirmations of nominees who had \n     previously worked in the Department of Justice makes clear \n     that an unfair double standard is being applied to Miguel \n     Estrada's nomination. Since the beginning of the Carter \n     Administration in 1977, the Senate has approved 67 United \n     States Court of Appeals nominees who previously had worked in \n     the Department of Justice. Of those 67 nominees, 38 had no \n     prior judicial experience, like Miguel Estrada. The \n     Department of Justice's review of those nomination records \n     disclosed that in none of those cases did the Department of \n     Justice produce internal deliberative materials created \n     by the Department. In fact, the Department's review \n     disclosed that the Senate did not even request such \n     materials for a single one of these 67 nominees.\n       Of this group of 67 nominees, seven were nominees who had \n     worked as a Deputy Solicitor General or Assistant to the \n     Solicitor General. These seven nominees, nominated by \n     Presidents of each party and confirmed by Senates controlled \n     by each party, included Samuel Alito, Danny Boggs, William \n     Bryson, Frank Easterbrook, Daniel Friedman, Richard Posner, \n     and Raymond Randolph.\n       The five isolated historical examples you have cited do not \n     support your current request. In each of those five cases, \n     the Committee made a targeted request for specific \n     information primarily related to allegations of misconduct or \n     malfeasance identified by the Committee. Even in those \n     isolated cases, the vast majority of deliberative memoranda \n     written by those nominees were neither requested nor \n     produced. With respect to Judge Bork's nomination, for \n     example, the Committee received access to certain particular \n     memoranda (many related to Judge Bork's involvement in \n     Watergate-related issues). The vast majority of memoranda \n     authored by Judge Bork were never received. With respect to \n     Judge Trott, the Committee requested documents unrelated to \n     Judge Trott's service to the Department. So, too, in the \n     three other examples you cite, the Committee requested \n     specific documents primarily related to allegations of \n     misconduct or malfeasance identified by the Committee. Of \n     course, no such allegations have been made in the case of Mr. \n     Estrada.\n       In sum, the examples you have cited only highlight the lack \n     of precedent for the current request. As the Justice \n     Department has explained to you previously, the existence of \n     a few isolated examples where the Executive Branch on \n     occasion accommodated a Committee's targeted requests for \n     very specific information primarily related to allegations of \n     misconduct does not in any way alter the fundamental and \n     long-standing principle that memos from the Office of \n     Solicitor General--and deliberative Department of Justice \n     memoranda more broadly--must remain protected in the \n     confirmation context so as to maintain the integrity of the \n     Executive Branch's decisionmaking process. That is a \n     fundamental principle that has been followed irrespective of \n     the party that controls the White House and the Senate.\n       Your continued requests for these memoranda have provoked a \n     foreseeable and inevitable conflict that, in turn, has been \n     cited as a basis for obstructing a vote on Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination. Respectfully, the conflict is unnecessary because \n     your desire to assess the nominee can be readily accommodated \n     in many ways other than intruding into and severely damaging \n     the deliberative process of the Office of Solicitor General. \n     For example, you can review Mr. Estrada's written briefs and \n     oral arguments both as an attorney for the United Stats and \n     in private practice. As you know, those documents are \n     publicly available and easily accessible; that said, we would \n     be pleased to facilitate your access to them. (Mr. Estrada's \n     hearing transcript suggests that no Democrat Member of the \n     Committee had read Mr. Estrada's many dozens of Solicitor \n     General merits briefs, certiorari petitions, and opposition \n     briefs or the transcripts of his 14 oral arguments when he \n     represented the United States.) You also may consider the \n     opinions of others who served in the Office at the same time \n     (discussed above) and examine the nominee's written \n     performance reviews (also discussed above). There is more \n     than ample information for you to assess Mr. Estrada's \n     qualifications and suitability for the DC Circuit based on \n     the traditional standards the Senate has employed.\n       It also is important to recognize that political appointees \n     of President Clinton have read virtually all of the memoranda \n     in question--namely, the Democrat Solicitors General Drew \n     Days, Walter Dellinger, and Seth Waxman. None of those three \n     highly respected Democrat lawyers has expressed any concern \n     whatever about Mr. Estrada's nomination. Indeed, Mr. Waxman \n     wrote a letter of strong support, and Mr. Days made public \n     statements in support of Mr. Estrada.\n       In sum, the historical record and past precedent \n     convincingly demonstrate that this request creates and \n     applies an unfair double standard to Miguel Estrada.\n\n\n      IV. Request that Miguel Estrada Answer Additional Questions\n\n       Your letter also suggests that Miguel Estrada should answer \n     certain questions that he allegedly did not answer in his \n     hearing. To begin with, we do not know what your specific \n     questions are. In addition, this request frankly comes as a \n     surprise given that (i) Senator Schumer chaired the hearing \n     on Mr. Estrada, (ii) the hearing lasted an entire day, (iii) \n     Senators at the all-day hearing asked numerous far-reaching \n     questions that Mr. Estrada answered forthrightly and \n     appropriately, and (iv) only two of the 10 Democrat Senators \n     then on the Committee even submitted any follow-up written \n     questions, and they submitted only a few questions (in marked \n     contrast to other nominees who received voluminous follow-up \n     questions).\n       It also bears mention that Mr. Estrada has personally met \n     with a large number of Democrat Senators, including Senators \n     Landrieu, Lincoln, Bill Nelson, Ben Nelson, Leahy, Feinstein, \n     Kohl, and Breaux; is scheduled to meet with Senator Carper; \n     and would be pleased to meet with additional Senators.\n       The only specific question your letter identifies refers to \n     Mr. Estrada's judicial role models, and you claim that he \n     refused to answer a question on this topic. In fact, in Mr. \n     Estrada's written responses to senator Durbin's question on \n     this precise subject, Mr. Estrada cited Justice Anthony \n     Kennedy, Justice Lewis Powell, and Judge Amalya Kearse as \n     judges he admires and he further pointed out, of course, that \n     he would seek to resolve cases as he analyzed them ``without \n     any preconception about how some other judge might approach \n     the question.''\n       In our judgment, moreover, Mr. Estrada answered the \n     Committee's questions in a manner that was both entirely \n     appropriate and entirely consistent with the approach that \n     judicial nominees of Presidents of both parties have taken \n     for many years. Your suggestions to the contrary do not \n     square with the hearing record or traditional practice.\n\n\n              A. Judicial Ethics and Traditional Practice\n\n       In assessing your request that Miguel Estrada did not \n     answer appropriate questions, we begin with rules of judicial \n     ethics that govern prospective nominees. Canon 5A(3)(d) \n     provides that prospective judges ``shall not .  .  . make \n     statements that commit or appear to commit the candidate with \n     respect to cases, controversies or issues that are likely to \n     come before the court'' (emphasis added). Justice Thurgood \n     Marshall made the point well in 1967 when asked about the \n     Fifth Amendment: ``I do not think you want me to be in a \n     position of giving you a statement on the Fifth Amendment \n     and then, if I am confirmed and sit on the Court, when a \n     Fifth Amendment case comes up, I will have to disqualify \n     myself.'' Lloyd Cutler, who served as Counsel to President \n     Carter and President Clinton, has stated that ``candidates \n     should decline to reply when efforts are made to find out \n     how they would decide a particular case.''\n       In 1968, in the context of the Justice Abe Fortas' \n     nomination to be Chief Justice, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee similarly stated: ``Although recognizing the \n     constitutional dilemma which appears to exist when the Senate \n     is asked to advise and consent on a judicial nominee without \n     examining him on legal questions, the Committee is of the \n     view that Justice Fortas wisely and correctly declined to \n     answer questions in this area. To require a Justice to state \n     his views on legal questions or to discuss his past decisions \n     before the Committee would threaten the independence of the \n     judiciary and the integrity of the judicial system itself. It \n     would also impinge on the constitutional doctrine of \n     separation of powers among the three branches of Government \n     as required by the Constitution.'' S. Exec. Rep. No. 8, 90th \n     Cong. 2d Sess. 5 (1968).\n       Even in the context of a Supreme Court confirmation \n     hearing, Senator Kennedy defended Sandra Day O'Connor's \n     refusal to discuss her views on abortion: ``It is offensive \n     to suggest that a potential Justice of the Supreme Court must \n     pass some presumed test of judicial philosophy. It is even \n     more offensive to suggest that a potential justice must pass \n     the litmus test of any single-issue interest group.'' \n     Nomination of Sandra O'Connor: Hearings Before the Senate \n     Comm. on the Judiciary on the Nomiantion of Judge Sandra Day \n     O'Connor of Arizona to Serve as an Associate Justice of the \n     Supreme Court of the United States, 97th Cong. 6 (1981) \n     (statement of Sen. Kennedy).\n       Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg likewise declined to answer \n     certain questions: ``Because I am and hope to continue to be \n     a judge, it would be wrong for me to say or to preview in \n     this legislative chamber how I would cast mly vote on \n     questions the Supreme Court may be called upon to decide. \n     Were I to rehearse here what I would say and how I would \n     reason on such questions, I would act injudiciously.'' \n     Similarly, Justice John Paul Stevens stated in his hearing: \n     ``I really don't thinkk I should discuss this subject \n     generally, Senator. I don't mean to be unresponsive but in \n     all candor I must say that there have been many times in my \n     experience in the last five years where I found that my first \n     reaction to a problem was not the same as the reaction I had \n     when I had the responsibility of decisions and I think that \n     if I were to make comments that were not carefully\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\n     thought through they might be given significance that they \n     really did not merit.''\n       Justice Ginsberg described the traditional practice in a \n     case decided last year: ``In the context of the federal \n     system, how a prospective nominee for the bench would resolve \n     particular contentious issues would certainly be `on \n     interest' to the President and the Senate. . . . But in \n     accord with a longstanding norm, every Member of this Court \n     declined to furnish such information to the Senate, and \n     presumably to the President as well.'' Republican Party of \n     Minnesota v. White, 122 S. Ct. 2528, 2552 n.1 (2002) \n     (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). Justice Ginsburg \n     added that this adherence to this ``longstanding norm'' was \n     ``crucial to the health of the Federal Judiciary.'' Id. In \n     his majority opinion, Justice Scalia did not take issue with \n     that description and added: ``Nor do we assert that \n     candidates for judicial office should be compelled to \n     announce their views on disputed legal issues.'' Id. at \n     2539 n. 11 (emphasis in original).\n       In some recent hearings, including Mr. Estrada's, Senator \n     Schumer has asked that nominees identify particular Supreme \n     Court cases of the last few decades with which they disagree. \n     But the problems with such a question and answer were well \n     stated by Justice Stephen Breyer. As Justice Breyer put it, \n     ``Until [an issue] comes up, I don't really think it through \n     with the depth that it would require. . . . So often, when \n     you decide a matter for real, in a court or elsewhere, it \n     turns out to be very different after you've become informed \n     and think it through for real than what you would have said \n     at a cocktail party answering a question.'' 34 U.C. Davis L. \n     Rev. 425, 462.\n       Senator Schumer also has asked nominees how they would have \n     ruled in particular Supreme Court cases. Again, a double \n     standard is being applied. The nominees of President Clinton \n     did not answer such questions. For example, Richard Tallman, \n     a nominee with no prior judicial service who would now serve \n     on the Ninth Circuit, not only would not answer how he would \n     have ruled as a judge in Roe v. Wade--but even how he would \n     have ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson, the infamous case that \n     upheld the discredited and shameful ``separate but equal'' \n     doctrine. So, too, in the hearing on President Clinton's \n     nomination of Judges Barry and Fisher, Senator Smith asked \n     whether the nominees would have voted for a constitutional \n     right to abortion before Roe v. Wade. Chairman Hatch \n     interrupted Senator Smith to say ``that is not a fair \n     question to these two nominees because regardless of what \n     happened pre-1973, they have to abide by what has happened \n     post-1973 and the current precedents that the Supreme Court \n     has.''\n\n\n                      b. answers by miguel estrada\n\n       Miguel Estrada answered the Committee's questions \n     forthrightly and appropriately. Indeed, Miguel Estrada was \n     more expansive than many judicial nominees traditionally have \n     been in Senate hearings, and he was asked a far broader range \n     of questions than many previous appeals court nominees were \n     asked. We will catalogue here a select sample of his answers.\n     Unenumerated rights, privacy, and abortion\n       When asked by Senator Edwards about the Constitution's \n     protection for rights not enumerated in the Constitution, Mr. \n     Estrada replied: ``I recognize that the Supreme Court has \n     said [on] numerous occasion in the area of privacy and \n     elsewhere that there are unenumerated rights in the \n     Constitution, and I have no view of any sort, whether legal \n     or personal, that would hinder me from applying those rulings \n     by the court. But I think the court has been quite clear that \n     there are a number of unenumerated rights in the \n     Constitution. In the main, the court has recognized them as \n     being inherent in the right of substantive due process and \n     the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.''\n       When asked by Senator Feinstein whether the Constitution \n     encompasses a right to privacy and abortion, Mr. Estrada \n     responded, ``The Supreme Court has so held, and I have not \n     view of any nature whatsoever, whether it be legal, \n     philosophical, moral, or any other type of view that would \n     keep me from applying that case law faithfully.'' When \n     asked whether Roe v. Wade was ``settled law,'' Mr. Estrada \n     replied, ``I believe so.''\n     General Approach to Judging\n       When asked by Senator Edwards about judicial review, Mr. \n     Estrada explained: ``Courts take the laws that have been \n     passed by you and give you the benefit of understanding that \n     you take the same oath that they do to uphold the \n     Constitution, and therefore they take the laws with the \n     presumption that they are constitutional. It is the \n     affirmative burden of the plaintiff to show that you have \n     gone beyond your oath. If they come into court, then it is \n     appropriate for courts to undertake to listen to the legal \n     arguments--why it is that the legislature went beyond [its] \n     role as a legislat[ure] and invaded the Constitution.''\n       Mr. Estrada stated to Senator Edwards that there are 200 \n     years of Supreme Court precedent and that it is not the case \n     that ``the appropriate conduct for courts is to be guided \n     solely by the bare text of the Constitution because that is \n     not the legal system that we have.''\n       When asked by Senator Edwards whether he was a strict \n     constructionist, Mr. Estrada replied that he was ``a fair \n     constructionist''--meaning that ``I don't think that it \n     should be the goal of courts to be strict or lax. The goal of \n     courts is to get it right. . . . It is not necessarily the \n     case in my mind that, for example, all parts of the \n     Constitution are suitable for the same type of interpretative \n     analysis. . . [T]he Constitution says, for example, that you \n     must be 35 years old to be our chief executive. . . . There \n     are areas of the Constitution that are more open-ended. And \n     you adverted to one, like the substantive component of the \n     due process clause, where there are other methods of \n     interpretation that are not quite so obvious that the court \n     has brought to bear to try to bring forth what the \n     appropriate answer should be.''\n       When Senator Kohl asked him about environmental statutes, \n     for example, Mr. Estrada explained that those statutes to \n     court ``with a strong presumption of constitutionality.''\n       In response to Senator Leahy, Mr. Estrada described the \n     most important attributes of a judge: ``The most important \n     quality for a judge, in my view Senator Leahy, is to have an \n     appropriate process for decisionmaking. That entails having \n     on open mind. It entails listening to the parties, reading \n     their briefs, going back beyond those briefs and doing all of \n     the legwork needed to ascertain who is right in his or her \n     claims as to what the law says and what the facts [are]. In a \n     court of appeals court, where judges sit in panels of three, \n     it is important to engage in deliberation and give ear to the \n     view so colleagues who may have come to different \n     conclusions. And in sum, to be committed to judging as a \n     process that is intended to give us the right answer, not to \n     a result. And I can give you my level best solemn assurance \n     that I firmly think I do have those qualities or else I would \n     not have accepted the nomination.''\n       In response to Senator Durbin, Miguel Estrada stated that \n     ``the Constitution, like other legal texts, should be \n     construed reasonably and fairly, to give effect to all that \n     its text contains.''\n       Mr. Estrada indicated to Senator Durbin that he admired the \n     judges for whom he clerked, Justice Kennedy and Judge Kearse, \n     as well as Justice Lewis Powell.\n       Mr. Estrada stated to Senator Durbin that ``I can \n     absolutely assure the Committee that I will follow binding \n     Supreme Court precedent until and unless such precedent has \n     been displaced by subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court \n     itself.''\n       In response to Senator Grassley, Mr. Estrada stated: ``When \n     facing a problem for which there is not a decisive precedent \n     from a higher court, my cardinal rule would be to seize aid \n     from anyplace where I could get it. Depending on the nature \n     of the problem, that would include related case law in other \n     areas that higher courts had dealt with that had had some \n     insights to teach with respect to the problem at hand. I \n     could include the history of the enactment, including in the \n     case of a statute legislative history. It could include the \n     custom and practice under any predecessor statute or \n     document. It could include the views of academics to the \n     extent that they purport to analyze what the law is instead \n     of--instead of prescribing what it should be. And in sum, as \n     Chief Justice Marshall once said, to attempt not to overlook \n     anything from which aid might be derived.''\n       In response to Senator Sessions, Estrada stated: ``I am \n     very firmly of the view that although we all have views on a \n     number of subjects from A to Z, the first duty of a judge is \n     to self-consciously put that aside and look at each case by \n     starting withholding judgment with an open mind and listen to \n     the parties. So I think that the job of a judge is to put all \n     of that aside, and to the best of his human capacity to give \n     a judgment based solely on the arguments and the law.''\n       In response to Senator Sessions, Mr. Estrada stated that \n     ``I will follow binding case law in every case . . . I may \n     have a personal, moral, philosophical view on the subject \n     matter. But I undertake to you that I would put all that \n     aside and decide cases in accordance with binding case law \n     and even in accordance with the case law that is not binding \n     but seems constructive on the area, without any influence \n     whatsoever from any personal view I may have about the \n     subject matter.''\n     Miranda/Stare Decisis\n       Mr. Estrada stated that United States v. Dickerson--a case \n     raising the question whether Miranda should be overruled--\n     reflected a ``reasonable application of the doctrine of stare \n     decisis. In my view, it is rarely appropriate for the Supreme \n     Court to overturn one of its own precedents.''\n     Affirmative Action\n       With respect to affirmative action, Mr. Estrada responded \n     to Senator Kennedy that ``any policy views I might have as a \n     private citizen on the subject of affirmative action would \n     not enter into how I would approach any case that comes \n     before me as a judge. Under controlling Supreme Court \n     authority, particularly Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, \n     515 U.S. 200 (1995), if a government program creates a racial \n     classification, it will be subject to strict scrutiny. \n     Whether the program survives that sort of scrutiny will often \n     involve a highly contextual and face-specific inquiry into \n     the nature of the justifications asserted by the government \n     and the fit between those justifications and the \n     classification at issue. Adarand and similar cases provide \n     the framework that I would be required to apply, and would \n     apply, in considering these issues as a judge.''\n       Asked by Senator Leahy about the strict scrutiny test, Mr. \n     Estrada replied, ``the Supreme Court in the Adarand case \n     stated, as a general rule, that the consideration of race is \n     subject to strict scrutiny. That means\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\n     that though it may be used in some cases, it has to be \n     justified by a compelling state interest. And with respect to \n     the particular context, there must be a fairly fact-bound \n     individual assessment of the fit between the interest that is \n     being asserted and the category being used. That is just \n     another way of saying that it is a very fact-intensive \n     analysis in the context of a specific program and in the \n     context of the justifications that are being offered in \n     support of the program.''\n     Congressional Authority\n       With respect to the outer limits of Congress' power to \n     confer authority on other governmental bodies, Miguel \n     responded to Senator Kennedy that the Supreme Court has said \n     that ``particular factual context is significant in analyzing \n     the appropriateness of a particular delegation. . . . Of \n     course, the fact that the Supreme Court only rarely has \n     struck down statutes on this ground suggests that the Court \n     has been quite deferential to congressional judgments about \n     the types of delegations that reasonably might be needed to \n     carry on the business of government.''\n       When Senator Kohl asked Mr. Estrada about the 1995 Lopez \n     case concerning the scope of Congress' power to regulate, Mr. \n     Estrada pointed out that he had argued in a companion case \n     ``for a very expansive view of the power to Congress to pass \n     statutes under the Commerce Clause and have them be upheld by \n     the court. . . . Lopez has given us guidance on when it is \n     appropriate for the court to exercise the commerce power. It \n     is binding law and I would follow it.''\n     Ethnicity\n       With respect to fact that the President had noted Miguel's \n     ethnicity, Miguel responded to Senator Kennedy: ``The \n     President is the leader of a large and diverse country, and \n     it is accordingly appropriate for him, in exercising his \n     constitutional nomination and appointment powers, to select \n     qualified individuals who reflect the breadth and diversity \n     of our Nation.''\n       With respect to the Democrat Congressional Hispanic \n     Caucus's criticism of him, Miguel responded to Senator \n     Kennedy that ``I strongly disagree, however, with the \n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus' view that I lack an \n     understanding of the role and importance of courts in \n     protecting the legal rights of minorities, of the values and \n     mores of Latino culture, or the significance of role models \n     for minority communities.''\n     Racial Discrimination\n       With respect to race discrimination, Mr. Estrada stated in \n     response to Senator Kennedy: ``I take a backseat to no one in \n     my abhorrence of race discrimination in law enforcement or \n     anything else.''\n       Senator Feingold asked Mr. Estrada whether he believed that \n     racial profiling and racially motivated law enforcement \n     misconduct are problems in this country today. Mr. Estrada \n     replied, ``I am--I will once again emphasize I'm unalterably \n     opposed to any sort of race discrimination in law \n     enforcement, Senator, whether it's called racial profiling or \n     anything else. . . . I know full well that we have real \n     problems with discrimination in our day and age.''\n       Senator Leahy asked Mr. Estrada about whether statistical \n     evidence of discriminatory impact is relevant in establishing \n     discrimination. Mr. Estrada replied: ``I am not a specialist \n     in this area of the law, Senator Leahy, but I am aware that \n     there is a line of cases, beginning with the Supreme Court's \n     decision in Griggs, that suggests that in appropriate cases \n     that [such evidence] may be appropriate. . . . I do \n     understand that there is a major area of law that deals with \n     how you prove and try disparate-impact cases.''\n     Congressional Authority to Regulate Firearms\n       Senator Feinstein asked whether Congress may legislate in \n     the area of dangerous firearms, and Mr. Estrada responded \n     that the Supreme Court had ruled that ``if the government \n     were to prove that the firearm had at any time in its \n     lifetime been in interstate commerce even if that had nothing \n     to do with the crime at issue, that that would be an adequate \n     basis for the exercise of Congress' power.''\n     Right to Counsel\n       Senator Edwards asked about Gideon v. Wainwright, the \n     Supreme Court case guaranteeing the right to counsel for poor \n     defendants who could not afford counsel. Although Senator \n     Edwards appeared to question the reasoning in that landmark \n     case, Mr. Estrada responded that ``I frankly have always \n     taken it as a given that that's--the ruling in the case.''\n\n\n               C. Answers by President Clinton's Nominees\n\n       Your criticism of Miguel Estrada's testimony creates a \n     double standard. You did not require nominees of President \n     Clinton to answer questions of this sort (keeping in mind \n     that you have not identified what your additional questions \n     to Mr. Estrada are). President Clinton's appeals court \n     nominees routinely testified without discussing their views \n     of specific issues or cases. A few select examples, including \n     of several nominees who had no prior judicial experience, \n     illustrate the point. (Please note that these are isolated \n     examples; there are many more we can provide if necessary.)\n       Merrick Garland (no prior judicial experience). In the \n     nomination of Merrick Garland to the DC Circuit, Senator \n     Specter asked him: ``Do you favor, as a personal matter, \n     capital punishment?'' Judge Garland replied only that he \n     would follow Supreme Court precedent: ``This is really a \n     matter of settled law now. The Court has held that capital \n     punishment is constitutional and lower courts are to \n     follow that rule.'' Senator Specter also asked him about \n     his views of the independent counsel statute's \n     constitutionality, and Judge Garland responded: ``Well, \n     that, too, the Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olson upheld \n     as constitutional, and, of course, I would follow that \n     ruling.'' Judge Garland did not provide his personal view \n     of either subject.\n       Judith Rogers. In the hearing on Judge Judith Rogers' \n     nomination to the D.C. Circuit, Judge Rogers was asked by \n     Senator Cohen about the debate over an evolving Constitution. \n     Judge Rogers responded: ``My obligation as an appellate judge \n     is to apply precedent. Some of the debates which I have heard \n     and to which I think you may be alluding are interesting, but \n     as an appellate judge, my obligation is to apply precedent. \n     And so the interpretations of the Constitution by the U.S. \n     Supreme Court would be binding on me.'' She then was asked \n     how she would rule in the absence of precedent and responded: \n     ``When I was taking my master's in judicial process at the \n     University of Virginia Law School, one of the points \n     emphasized was the growth of our common law system based on \n     the English common law judge system. And my opinions, I think \n     if you look at them, reflect that where I am presented with a \n     question of first impression that I look to the language of \n     whatever provision we are addressing, that I look to whatever \n     debates are available, that I look to the interpretations by \n     other Federal courts, that I look to the interpretations of \n     other State courts, and it may be necessary, as well, to look \n     at the interpretations suggested by commentators. And within \n     that framework, which I consider to be a discipline, that I \n     would reach a view in a case of first impression.'' Finally, \n     Judge Rogers was asked her view of the three-strikes law and \n     stated: ``As an appellate judge, my obligation is to enforce \n     the laws that Congress passes, or, where I am now, that the \n     District of Columbia Council passes.'' Judge Rogers did not \n     provide her personal view of these subjects.\n       Marsha Berzon (no prior judicial experience). Senator Smith \n     asked her views on Roe v. Wade and whether ``an unborn child \n     is a human being.'' Judge Berzon stated: ``[M]y role as a \n     judge is not to further anything that I personally believe or \n     don't believe, and I think that is the strength of our system \n     and the strength of our appellate system. The Supreme Court \n     has been quite definitive quite recently about the applicable \n     standard, and I absolutely pledge to you that I will follow \n     that standard as it exists now, and if it is changed, I will \n     follow that standard. And my personal views in this area, as \n     in any other, will have absolutely no effect.'' When Senator \n     Smith probed about their personal views on abortion and Roe \n     v. Wade, Chairman Hatch interrupted: ``I don't know how they \n     can say much more than that at this point in this meeting.''\n       Richard Tallman (no prior judicial experience). In response \n     to written questions, Judge Tallman explained that \n     ``[j]udicial nominees are limited by judicial ethical \n     considerations from answering any question in a manner that \n     would call for an `advisory opinion' as the courts have \n     defined it or that in effect ask a nominee to suggest how he \n     or she would rule on an issue that could foreseeably require \n     his or her attention in a future case or controversy after \n     confirmation.'' He was asked how he would have ruled in \n     Plessy v. Ferguson. He stated: ``It is entirely conjectural \n     as to what I would have done without having the opportunity \n     to thoroughly review the record presented on appeal, the \n     briefs and arguments of counsel, and supporting legal \n     authorities that were applicable at that time.'' He gave the \n     same response when asked how he would have ruled on Roe v. \n     Wade. When asked his personal view on abortion, he wrote: ``I \n     hold no personal views that would prevent me from doing my \n     judicial duty to follow the precedent set down by the \n     Supreme Court.'' He gave the same answer about the death \n     penalty.\n       Kim Wardlaw. In the hearing on Judge Kim Wardlaw's \n     nomination to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Wardlaw was asked \n     about the constitutionality of affirmative action. She stated \n     (in an answer similar to Miguel Estrada's answer to the same \n     question): ``The Supreme Court has held that racial \n     classifications are unconstitutional unless they are narrowly \n     tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest.''\n       Maryanne Trump Barry. In the hearing on Judge Maryanne \n     Trump Barry's nomination too the Third Circuit, Senator Smith \n     asked for her personal opinion on whether ``an unborn child \n     at any stage of the pregnancy is a human being.'' Judge Barry \n     responded: ``Casey is the law that I would look at. If I had \n     a personal opinion--and I am not suggesting that I do--it is \n     irrelevant because I must look to the law which binds me.''\n       Raymond Fisher. In the hearing on Judge Raymond Fisher's \n     nomination to the Ninth Circuit, Senator Sessions asked Judge \n     Fisher's own personal views on whether the death penalty was \n     constitutional. Judge Fisher responded that ``My view, \n     Senator, is that, as you indicated, the Supreme Court has \n     ruled that the death penalty is constitutional. As a lower \n     appellate court judge, that is the law that I am governed by. \n     I don't want in my judicial career, should I be fortunate \n     enough to have one, to inject my personal opinions into \n     whether or not I follow the law. I believe that the precedent \n     of the Supreme Court is binding and that is what my function \n     is.''\n\n\n                             V. Conclusion\n\n       Miguel Estrada is a well-qualified and well-respected \n     judicial nominee who has very\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\n     strong bipartisan support. Based on our reading of history, \n     we believe that you have ample information about this nominee \n     and have had more than enough time to consider questions \n     about his qualifications and suitability. We urge you to stop \n     the unfair treatment, end the filibuster, allow an up-or-down \n     vote, and vote to confirm Mr. Estrada.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Alberto R. Gonzales\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to my \nfriend and colleague from Utah. I have the highest respect for him. I \nmust confess, in listening to him, though, it brought to mind that \nwonderful old saw about trial lawyers. You know: If the facts aren't on \nyour side, argue the law. If the law isn't on your side, argue the \nfacts. If neither the facts nor the law are on your side, pound the \ntable and hope nobody notices. From my perspective, that is exactly \nwhat we have been hearing from our friends on the other side with \nrespect to this very important matter that is not just about a \nnomination but about the role and responsibility of the Senate under \nour Constitution.\n  I rise today to expand on the points I made yesterday because, after \nfurther reflection and careful thought about this body's constitutional \nobligations to provide advice and consent on judicial nominations, I \nbelieve there are even greater reasons for us to focus during this time \non that responsibility.\n  There has been, clearly, a debate going on about the role of the \nSenate in judicial nominations, and many of my friends on the other \nside have made the point that their view is the Senate defers to the \nexecutive when it comes to judicial nominees. That would certainly be a \nsurprise to the 42nd President of the United States, that that is the \nposition of my friends on the other side.\n  Furthermore, there are those who argue the Senate's role is to give \nadvice and consent, but that does not encompass an inquiry into a \nnominee's judicial philosophy.\n  I, for one, believe on both of those grounds our colleagues are \nmistaken. I have done some further research and inquiry into what is it \nwe mean when we open up our Constitution and we look at article II, \nsection 2 and we see these words, ``advice and consent.'' Given the \nextraordinary brilliance and the economic use of words in the \nConstitution, I assume every word means something. Each word was \nbattled over. Each word was poured over. A lot of effort went into \ncoming up with those words that would help to guide our infant Nation. \nSo I take advice and consent very seriously.\n  It is particularly important to recognize I am not alone in viewing \nthis obligation with seriousness. From the very beginning of our \ncountry it has been a concern. It was one of those elements in the \nbalance of power that was so carefully constructed among our three \nbranches of Government. It is something I think we ignore at our peril.\n  What is it we are talking about? Again, I sometimes wonder what our \nfriends and fellow countrymen who might be watching this debate, as \nthey look for something perhaps more interesting or exciting on their \ntelevisions, stop and think if they see one of us talking about advice \nand consent, or talking about our Constitution. Article II, section 2 \nstates that:\n\n       The President . . . shall nominate, and by and with the \n     Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . judges \n     of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \n     States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided \n     for and which shall be established by law. . . .\n\n  That is what the Constitution tells us. It is our obligation, as it \nhas been ever since this body was formed, to determine what that means \nand how we apply it. The Framers of our Constitution did not envision \nthe Senate's power of advice and consent to be a mere formality. In \nfact, at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the power of judicial \nappointment was a subject of enthusiastic debate.\n  The first proposal that came from delegates to the Convention was \nthat the choice of Federal judges should be left to the Senate alone--\nthat it would be this body, acting on its own, that would appoint \njudges to the bench.\n  Then a competing proposal was put forth arguing that, no, the \nPresident should nominate and appoint judges and that the Senate should \nhave only the power to reject or approve those candidates.\n  But what was it after the debate that our Founders decided was the \nAmerican way? How did they conclude what was the proper balance between \nthese competing positions? Clearly, the adopted language was a \ncompromise. And, equally clearly, those who agreed to that compromise \ndid not view our role--the Senate's role--as insignificant or \ndeferential. In fact, Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 76 writes \nthat the Senate's participation in the judicial nomination process was \nessential in order ``to promote a judicious choice of men''--of course, \nhe would say men and women were he writing today--``for filling the \noffices of the Union.'' He further stated that the Senate's advise and \nconsent role serves as ``a considerable and salutary restraint upon the \nconduct'' of the President.\n  There is plenty of evidence that exists which demonstrates what the \nFramers intended with respect to the advice and consent clause. This \nclause added formation and, in all of the decades since, contemplated a \nstrong and decisive Senate role that would serve to advise and consent \nwith respect to the President's nominees--or, to put it another way, \nwould serve to balance the power of the President's nominating \nauthority by Senate legislative power.\n  This strong role that the Constitution granted the Senate has only \ngrown stronger in the years following the adoption of our Constitution. \nWe know very well that members of both parties have historically \nexpected judicial nominees to be fully candid and forthright with any \ninformation that Senators deem relevant. The Republicans are acting as \nthough the questions we are asking and the opposition which we are \npresenting to the process that has been adopted and the responses--or, \nI should say nonresponses--of the nominee are unprecedented. But I have \nto just point to recent history. We don't have to go back to the \nFederalist Papers. We don't have to go back to the 19th century. We \nonly have to go back a few years to find many instances in which my \nfriends on the other side did not rest until they had satisfied \nthemselves with the information provided by nominees sent up by a \nDemocratic President.\n  A June 22, 1998, floor statement by Senator Hatch demonstrates that \nthe advise and consent obligation is indeed a strong one. Here is what \nhe said:\n\n       While the debate about vacancy rates on our Federal courts \n     is not unimportant, it remains more important that the Senate \n     perform its advice and consent function thoroughly and \n     responsibly. Federal judges serve for life and perform an \n     important constitutional function without direct \n     accountability to the people. Accordingly, the Senate should \n     never move too quickly on nominations before it.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. I think Senator Hatch was right in 1998.\n  He also stated that he had ``no problem with those who want to review \n. . . nominees with great specificity.''\n  That is all we are asking for. But we can't review this nominee with \ngreat specificity because he has become kind of an emblem of \nnonspecificity with nonanswers and nonresponses.\n  It is really hard to imagine someone being considered for the \nimportant position that he would hold for life telling Senators who \ninquired that he really didn't have anything to say about any Supreme \nCourt decision in the history of the Court.\n  Of course, my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, has also \nreminded us that:\n\n       Yes, the President has a right to make nominations to the \n     Federal bench of his choice. However, we--namely, the \n     Senate--have a role in that process. We should, and we do, \n     take it very seriously. We should not give a man or a woman \n     life tenure if there is some problem with his or her \n     background, whether academically or ethically, or if there is \n     a problem with a series of decisions or positions they have \n     taken.\n\n  Of course, we don't know whether there is any problem with respect to \nthis nominee's decisions. He has never been a judge, and we have no \nidea what his positions are on anything.\n  It is hard to imagine that any Member of this body could, as some of \nmy colleagues on the other side have been saying over the last days, \nsay that we really do not have to worry too much\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\nabout this advice and consent clause because the Senate plays only a \nminor role in the nomination process. I would be more than happy to \nprovide a list of citations and references so that any Senator who has \nbeen led to believe that would know it is not the case.\n  In fact, one of the very best descriptions of what advise and consent \nmeans in the Constitution that I have able to find comes from a very \nwell respected former Republican Senator from Maryland, Mr. Charles \nMcC. Mathias. In 1987, Senator Mathias submitted an essay that was \npublished in the University of Chicago Law Review, a very prestigious \npublication. The essay is entitled ``Advice and Consent: The Role of \nthe United States Senate in the Judicial Selection Process.'' This I \nwould commend to all of my colleagues because the debate we are having \ntoday is not just about one nominee. And it is not just about one \nPresident or one political party. It is about how we fulfill our \nconstitutional obligations. Senator Mathias has it just right.\n  Among the important points he makes are the following:\n\n       Among all the responsibilities of a United States Senator, \n     none is more important than the duty to participate in the \n     process of selecting judges and justices to serve on the \n     Federal courts.\n\n  Senator Mathias goes on:\n\n       The Senate's duty in this sphere is extraordinary. Most \n     other senatorial decisions are subject to revision, either by \n     the Congress itself or by the executive branch. Statutes can \n     be amended, budgets rewritten, appropriations deferred or \n     rescinded, but a judicial nomination is different. When the \n     Framers of the Constitution decided that Federal judges shall \n     hold their offices during good behavior, and may be removed \n     only by the rarely utilized process of impeachment, they \n     guarantee respect for the principle of judicial independent.\n\n  Senator Mathias goes on to point out:\n  It will no longer provide--Their decision also meant, however, that \nthe vote to confirm a judicial nominee must express the Senate's \nconfidence in the nominee's ability to decide the burning legal \ncontroversy not only of the day but of future decades as well. The \nConstitution gives the Senate the consent power, not as a mechanical \nformality but as an integral part of the structure of government . . . \nIf the Senate does not take its role seriously, it will lose its \neffectiveness as, in Hamilton's words--\n\n       ``a considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct'' \n     of the President.\n\n  Senator Mathias points out what should be obvious to us all. A \nnominee should:\n\n       [E]merge from the nomination process knowing that the \n     president and the Senate have confidence that he will preside \n     with only one unalterable loyalty, to the Constitution, and \n     with only purpose, to assure the individual standing before \n     him a judgment based upon the law of the land.\n\n  Senator Mathias makes another very critical point in his University \nof Chicago Law Review article about the advice and consent clause. He \nsays:\n\n       The Senate must be convinced that a nominee is impeccably \n     competent. But competence alone is not sufficient. It is not \n     enough that a nominee be skilled in legal argument and \n     knowledgeable about legal doctrine, and that . . . he be able \n     to write clearly and forcefully.\n       A candidate for the federal bench must, as Hamilton wrote \n     in Federalist No. 78; ``unite the requisite integrity with \n     the requisite knowledge.'' The nominee also must exhibit a \n     strength of character and a range of vision that will help \n     [him] look beyond the world that exists on the day on which \n     [he] is nominated. . . .\n       [T]he full senate should have the opportunity to consider \n     each nomination on a complete record. . . .[Senators] should \n     have the opportunity to review the transcripts of hearings \n     and to solicit other advice on the merits of the issue before \n     voting.\n       The goal of these procedures is not to second-guess the \n     judgment of the president in submitting the nomination to the \n     Senate, but to ensure that the factors underlying that \n     judgment are sufficiently disclosed to permit the Senate to \n     make an informed and independent evaluation of the \n     president's choice.\n\n  That is really the nub of what we are concerned about.\n  Listen to the words of a former Republican Senator who served with \ngreat distinction in this body:\n\n       The goal . . . is not to second-guess the judgment of the \n     president . . . but to ensure that the factors underlying \n     that judgment are sufficiently disclosed to permit the Senate \n     to make an informed and independent evaluation of the \n     president's choice.\n\n  Senator Mathias concludes:\n\n       For when the Senate carries out its function of advice and \n     consent, its first loyalty must be not to the political \n     parties, nor to the president, but to the people and the \n     constitution they have established.\n\n  It is not only former Senators who have understood this and would be \nastonished at the amnesia that seems to have descended upon us about \nwhat the debate among the Framers was, about what the settled law and \nunderstanding of the Constitution was, about what distinguished \nSenators who served in this body always believed it to be. But this is \nthe weight of all of the legal and academic analysis of the clause that \nhas been done over so many years.\n  One of the most effective and thorough analyses of the advise and \nconsent obligation is found in a joint statement by Philip Kurland from \nthe University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe from Harvard, dated June \n1, 1986, entitled: ``Joint Statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee \non the Role of Advice and Consent in Judicial Nominations,'' submitted \nto the Judiciary Committee. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 1, 1986.\n     To the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n       The United States Senate has too often been confused and \n     uncertain about its role in approving Federal judicial \n     nominees. The Constitution entrusts the power to appoint the \n     member of the third branch of the National Government not to \n     the executive branch nor to the legislature, but to both \n     political branches together: the President nominates, but the \n     Senate must confirm. Providing ``advice and consent'' on \n     judicial nominations, therefore, is no mere senatorial \n     courtesy but a constitutional duty of fundamental importance \n     to the maintenance of our tripartite system of government.\n       Those who wrote the Constitution certainly did not envision \n     the Senate's power of ``advice and consent'' to be a \n     formality. The allocation of the appointment power was the \n     subject of keen debate at the Constitutional Convention of \n     1787, which initially proposed a draft that left the choice \n     of Federal judges to the Senate alone. The adopted language \n     was a compromise, and it is clear that those who agreed to \n     the compromise did not view the Senate's role as merely \n     ceremonial or ritualistic.\n       The reasons that the Framers contemplated a strong Senate \n     role in the process of judicial appointments are plain. It \n     must be remembered that Federal judges are not, like the \n     President's cabinet, to serve the will of the Chief \n     Executive, but officers appointed for life to a separate and \n     independent branch of government. If those appointed to these \n     lifetime judicial posts should ultimately prove unequal to \n     the task or unsuited to the role, they cannot be dismissed. \n     Impeachment by the House and trial by the Senate is the only \n     constitutionally authorized method of removing unfit judges, \n     and the great difficulty of such a process makes it usable \n     only in situations of outrageous misconduct. The only \n     practical opportunity to consider the merits of a judicial \n     candidate, therefore, is before that appointment is made. It \n     thus becomes not only appropriate, but obligatory, that the \n     Senate pass on judicial nominees with greater scrutiny than \n     it reviews the President's choices for his own subordinates.\n       Whatever the philosophy of government or theory of law, the \n     demands that the Nation makes on its Federal judges are \n     indisputably great. The Federal courts play an increasingly \n     critical part in American government. The men and women of \n     the Federal bench must possess open minds that are capable of \n     grasping sophisticated legal analysis, and that can grapple \n     intelligently with fundamental constitutional issues. To \n     Federal judges is given the task of policing the boundaries \n     between State and Federal government, of giving principled \n     articulation to the content of the basic human rights \n     protected by the Constitution, of enforcing the myriad and \n     complex Federal statutes and regulations, and of overseeing \n     complicated commercial and criminal litigation. Senators \n     therefore have a duty, both to the Constitution and to the \n     Nation's citizens, businesses, and public and private \n     institutions to ensure that the President's nominees have the \n     experience, the talent, the intellectual acumen, and the \n     fairness of mind to perform their functions and, particularly \n     in the case of appellate judges, to contribute lucidly to a \n     body of legal precedents that can enlighten and guide trial \n     courts, litigants, and those who must try to enlighten and \n     guide trial courts, litigants, and those who must try to \n     anticipate what courts will do.\n       Candidates for the Federal bench should meet a higher \n     standard than that required for most government officers. A \n     career marked by integrity, capacity, wisdom, and commitment \n     is the minimal qualification. If it is not readily apparent \n     that a candidate is truly distinguished, the burden should be \n     on the President to demonstrate the merits of the nominee. A \n     nominee's entire record--professional achievements, public \n     service, academic credentials, appellate briefs or other \n     legal writings, scholarly or other publications--should be \n     reviewed carefully to screen out the merely competent, and \n     certainly, the\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\n     simply mediocre. Respect for the institution of the Federal \n     courts--and for the onerous responsibilities of the Federal \n     bench--requires nothing less.\n       The responsibility of appointment to the independent \n     judiciary was divided between the White House and the Senate \n     in part to avoid burdening the Federal courts with candidates \n     selected solely to satisfy criteria unrelated to judicial \n     excellence. The President is certainly entitled to prefer \n     loyal supporters and like-minded thinkers in choosing among \n     the exceptionally qualified; but no President has a right to \n     treat Federal judgeships as mere patronage appointments \n     simply to reward friends or to assure a judiciary packed with \n     ``true believers.'' And the Senate is surely not required to \n     defer to the appointment of men and women whose most salient \n     qualification is their location in a particular partisan \n     line-up or their devotion to a particular cluster of \n     political or philosophical views.\n       The Senate has the further obligation to assure itself that \n     a nominee's substantive views of law are within the broad \n     bounds of acceptability in American public life and not on \n     its lunatic fringes--whether left or right. The Republic may \n     demand--and its Senators ought therefore to ensure--that is \n     life-tenured judiciary does not disdain the Bill of Rights or \n     the Fourteenth Amendment's command for equal protection of \n     the laws and due process.\n       The absence of evidence of a nominee's lack of adherence to \n     constitutional values should not be deemed a sufficient \n     ground for confirmation. When dealing with a lifetime \n     appointment to the Federal bench, rather than the trial of a \n     criminal defendant, one's doubts as to a candidate's \n     commitment to the Bill of Rights or to constitutionally \n     commanded equality must be resolved in favor of the \n     Constitution rather than the candidate.\n       None of this is to say that the Senate, any more than the \n     President, is justified in using litmus tests that seek out a \n     candidate's unswerving commitment to upholding or reversing a \n     particular * * * dealing with * * * vised than the \n     confirmation of ``single-issue'' nominees who appear to have \n     been selected solely on the basis of their aversion to or \n     endorsement of one particular line of legal doctrine.\n       Finally, the Senate must realize that, in the appointment \n     process, the power of nomination belongs to the President \n     alone. Senators are not entitled to a ``short list'' of their \n     own. Therefore, it is not a sufficient objection to an \n     otherwise legally distinguished and constitutionally \n     acceptable nominee that a Senator would prefer someone from a \n     different part of the legal profession or a different part of \n     the country, or someone of a different race, gender, or \n     ideology. But neither is a confirmation vote in order \n     whenever the best that can be said of a nominee is that he \n     has spent some time in law or public life and is untainted by \n     any major scandal. Even at levels below that of the Supreme \n     Court, where the need for exceptional distinction should be \n     beyond debate, the Nation has a right to expect more than \n     minimum qualifications and probable fitness from its Federal \n     judges. And it has a right to insist that the Senate, \n     whatever the practice of the past decade or two, recall the \n     Framers' vision of its solemn duty to provide advice and \n     consent, rather than perfunctory obeisance, to the will of \n     the President.\n                                                Philip B. Kurland.\n                                                 William R. Kenan,\n           Distinguished Service Professor, University of Chicago.\n                                                Laurence H. Tribe.\n                                              Ralph S. Tyler, Jr.,\n              Professor of Constitutional Law, Harvard University.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Professors Kurland and Tribe, joined by Professors \nWilliam R. Kenan and Ralph S. Tyler, wrote that:\n\n       [P]roviding ``advice and consent'' on judicial nominations \n     . . . is no mere senatorial courtesy but a constitutional \n     duty of fundamental importance to the maintenance of our \n     tripartite system of government.\n\n  Now, that is a mouthful that really says a lot. This little clause--\njust three words--is so important to our tripartite; namely, our three \nbranches--executive, legislative, and judicial--of Government. Well, it \nis. That is why we advocate it, not at our peril--we will come and go--\nbut at the peril of undermining this extraordinary, brilliant \nconstruction of the United States, a tripartite form of Government, \nkept in equilibrium by a balance of power.\n  That is a heavy responsibility, to think of giving up advise and \nconsent, giving up the Senate's constitutional duty because, as this \nstatement goes on to say:\n\n       The reasons that the Framers contemplated a strong Senate \n     role in the process of judicial appointments are plain. It \n     must be remembered that Federal judges are not, like the \n     president's cabinet, to serve the will of the Chief \n     Executive, but officers appointed for life to a separate and \n     independent branch of government.\n       If those appointed to these lifetime judicial posts should \n     ultimately prove unequal to the task or unsuited to the role, \n     they cannot be dismissed.\n       Impeachment by the House and trial by the Senate is the \n     only constitutionally authorized method of removing unfit \n     judges, and the great difficulty of such a process makes it \n     usable only in situations of outrageous misconduct. The only \n     practical opportunity to consider the merits of a judicial \n     candidate, therefore, is before that appointment is made. It \n     thus becomes not only appropriate, but obligatory, that the \n     Senate pass on judicial nominees with greater scrutiny than \n     it reviews the president's choices for his own subordinates.\n       Whatever the philosophy of government or theory of law, the \n     demands that the Nation makes on its federal judges are \n     indisputably great. The federal courts play an increasingly \n     critical part in American government.\n       To federal judges is given the task of policing the \n     boundaries between state and federal government, of giving \n     principled articulation to the content of the basic human \n     rights protected by the constitution, of enforcing the myriad \n     and complex federal statutes and regulations, and of \n     overseeing complicated commercial and criminal litigation.\n       Senators therefore have a duty, both to the constitution \n     and to the Nation's citizens [who sent us here] to ensure \n     that the president's nominees have the experience, the \n     talent, the intellectual acumen, and the fairness of mind to \n     perform their functions, and, particularly in the case of \n     appellate judges, to contribute lucidly to a body of legal \n     precedents that guide [our] courts. . . .\n       The Senate has the further obligation to assure itself that \n     a nominee's substantive views of law are within the broad \n     bounds of acceptability in American public life and not on \n     its lunatic fringes--whether left or right. The Republic may \n     demand--and its Senators ought therefore to ensure--that its \n     life-tenured judiciary does not disdain the Bill of Rights or \n     the Fourteenth Amendment's command for equal protection of \n     the laws and due process.\n\n  Even in the absence of evidence of a nominee's lack of adherence to \nconstitutional values, it is something that we have to take seriously. \nWe have to be assured, we have to be reassured, that when we cast our \nvotes, we are doing so in the best interests of our Constitution and \nour country.\n  It has been clear in the debate so far that the Constitution has \nbecome something of a political football. There are those who--when the \nshoe was on the other foot and the occupant of the White House was of \nanother party--were certainly more than ready to ask any question and \nto raise any objection that they could possibly imagine.\n  I listened, with great interest, to my good friend from Utah say, \nwith great conviction: We never, ever filibustered a judge.\n  That may be technically true, but the reason is because they wouldn't \ngive nominees hearings. They wouldn't give nominees votes, and they \nwould not bring them to the floor where they possibly could be \nfilibustered. It is somewhat surprising to hear that argument being \nmade with a straight face.\n  In the years between 1995 and 2000, the Judiciary Committee refused \nto hold hearings or to permit votes for more than 50 judicial nominees \nsubmitted by President Clinton. Some nominees waited years for a \nhearing. Some nominees waited years for a vote. One such nominee, a \nHispanic judge, Judge Paez, waited more than 1,500 days. Others waited \nmore than 1,500 days, never received the courtesy of a hearing, never \nreceived the courtesy of a vote.\n  So here we are, and we are being somehow taken to task because the \nother side never filibustered. But they controlled the committee. They \ndidn't have to filibuster. They just let nominees languish, twist in \nthe wind, and eventually disappear. I didn't approve of that. I thought \nthat was unfair to a lot of very decent Americans of tremendous \nintellectual, academic, and legal experience and qualifications.\n  What we are doing now is trying to do the work of the Judiciary \nCommittee. The Judiciary Committee would not stand for the prerogatives \nof this body and insist the nominee answer questions, provide \ninformation, require the administration to come forward forthrightly \nand give the documents and the other background material that was \nrequested. The only way we can exercise our constitutional duty to \nadvise and consent is to raise these issues here in the Chamber.\n  I want to put this into the context of why this would be important to \nanybody outside the Senate. Again, I imagine people trying to make \nsense of all of this, trying to figure out what it is all about. In \nfact, it is about the people themselves. Senators come and go. \nPresidents come and go. The Constitution, we hope, not only stays but \nprevails. The Constitution, which set up this genius form of \ngovernment, unlike anything that any group of human\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\nbeings have ever devised for themselves, is our underpinning. It is our \nbedrock.\n  The interpretation of it can change from time to time. That is as it \nshould be. That is part of the genius of our Constitution--that it was \nan organic, growing document to take into account a nation that started \nout primarily agrarian and now is in the midst of the information \nrevolution. We couldn't even imagine thinking we had to live and work \nand govern ourselves in the same way as our predecessors did 200 plus \nyears ago. But the values don't change. The balance of power that is \nfundamental to our tripartite system of government doesn't change. \nHuman beings may fly through the air in airplanes rather than traverse \nfrom place to place on horseback, but fundamental human nature doesn't \nchange.\n  The reason we have a balance of power is because the Framers were \nabsolutely the best psychologists who ever came together in any place \nin the world. They knew, as they revolted against a king and a royal \nsystem, that they were setting up the potential for self-government. \nThey recognized in order for self-government to work, you had to be \nrealistic about human beings. You couldn't be too optimistic. You \ncouldn't be too pessimistic. You had to get it just right, kind of like \nGoldie Locks. If you were too optimistic about human nature, you would \ncertainly be disappointed. If you were too pessimistic about human \nnature, you wouldn't have enough hope to get up and move forward and \ntry to solve problems.\n\n  So the Framers had to get it right. And did they ever get it right. \nThey understood completely that we had to restrain ourselves, that we \nhad to have systems that protect against runaway executive power, \nrunaway legislative power, runaway judicial power. They had it \nabsolutely right.\n  The advice and consent clause is part of how they got it right. I \ndon't care if you are Republican or Democrat, if you served in the \nSenate in the 19th or 20th or 21st century, they got it right.\n  What we are saying is we don't want to second-guess the Framers. We \ndon't want to substitute our judgment for theirs. We want to do what we \nare expected to do by the Constitution.\n  We wouldn't even be here having this debate if the constitutional \nresponsibility had been fulfilled in the Judiciary Committee. I have \nlistened to my colleagues talk about all of the paper that has been \nsubmitted and all of the time that has been taken to pass this nominee \nthrough the Judiciary Committee. But they know as well as we that many \nof the critical questions were never answered. Many of the essential \ndocuments that would give us insight into the attitudes and the beliefs \nand the philosophy of this nominee were never produced and that, in \neffect, we are asked to basically abdicate our advise and consent \nresponsibility, to turn our back on the Constitution and to do what we \nare told to do.\n  That is not what the decision was when the debate took place among \nour Framers. If you look at the Federalist papers, if you look at all \nof the commentary in the many years since, this was a solemn duty that \nwas given to the Senate.\n  When people say: Why are you debating this, I think there are a \nnumber of reasons. First, because it seems to those of us who are \ndebating, it is our duty. It is our responsibility. We read the \nConstitution. We read what people said about it at the time it was \nwritten, what people have said about it recently. We read what our \ncolleagues have said about it, when the shoe was on the other foot, and \nwe have to conclude we are fulfilling our constitutional \nresponsibility.\n  I went back and looked at the Congressional Record at some of the \ncomments some of my friends on the other side have made in the past \nabout what we should do when it comes to advising and consenting. I \nagree with what they said. When the shoe was on the other foot and it \nwas a Democratic President sending judicial nominees, the same speeches \nwere said on the other side of the floor, which strikes me as \ndefinitive, conclusive proof of what this is all about.\n  For example, Senator Smith, March 9, 2000:\n\n       The Constitution gave the Senate the advise and consent \n     role. We are supposed to advise the President and consent, if \n     we think the judge should be put on the court. We do not get \n     very much opportunity to advise because the President just \n     sends these nominations up here. He does not seek our advice. \n     And then we are asked to consent. It seems as if the Senate \n     should be a rubber stamp, that we should just approve every \n     judge that comes down the line and not do anything about the \n     advise and consent role.\n\n  I agree 100 percent with what Senator Smith then said:\n\n       That is not the way that I read the Constitution. I believe \n     that is wrong. We have an obligation under the Constitution \n     to review these judges very carefully.\n\n  In that same vein, Senator Smith on another day, the same month, \nMarch 7, 2000, went on to explicate this important responsibility. I \nwish all of us would listen to it. I think this is exactly right. He \nsaid:\n\n       I think the constitutional process is very clear, that the \n     Senate has the right and the responsibility under the \n     Constitution to advise and consent.\n       That is exactly what I intend to do in my role as a Senator \n     as it pertains to the two nominees before us. The issue, \n     though, is whether it is OK to block judicial nominees. We \n     have heard from a couple of my colleagues in the last few \n     moments that it isn't OK to block judicial nominees, as if \n     there was something unconstitutional about it. There is \n     thinking by some that we should not start down this path of \n     blocking a judicial nominee whom we do not think is a good \n     nominee for the Court because it may come back to haunt us at \n     some point when and if a Republican should be elected to the \n     Presidency.\n\n  Senator Smith goes on:\n\n       Let me say, with all due respect to my colleagues, I am not \n     starting down any new path. I am going to be very specific \n     and prove exactly my point that we are not starting down a \n     new path of blocking a judicial nominee. That path is well \n     worn. We are following a path; we are not starting down any \n     new path.\n\n  I could not say it better myself. In fact, I wish I had said it as \nwell. But it is not only Senator Smith, it is also Senator Hatch, on \nJanuary 28, 1998:\n\n       Conducting a fair confirmation process, however, does not \n     mean granting the President carte blanche in filling the \n     Federal judiciary. It means assuring that those who are \n     confirmed will uphold the Constitution and abide by the rule \n     of law.\n\n  Senator Hatch, October 3, 2000:\n\n       The President has broad discretion, as we know, to nominate \n     whomever he chooses for Federal judicial vacancies. The \n     Senate, in its role, has a constitutional duty to offer its \n     advice and consent on judicial nominations. Each Senator, of \n     course, has his or her own criteria for offering this advice \n     and this consent on lifetime appointments. The Judiciary \n     Committee, though, is where many of the initial concerns \n     about nominees are raised and arise. All of this information \n     is, of course, available to every member of the Judiciary \n     Committee and must be thoroughly reviewed before the nominee \n     is granted a hearing by the committee. If questions about a \n     nominee's background or qualifications arise, further inquiry \n     may be necessary. Obviously, this is a long process, as it \n     must be. After all, these are lifetime appointments.\n\n  Senator Hatch, May 23, 1997:\n\n       The primary criteria in this process is not how many \n     vacancies need to be filled, but whether President Clinton, \n     or whoever the President is--whether their nominees are \n     qualified to serve on the bench and will not, upon receiving \n     their judicial commission, spend a lifetime, a career, \n     rendering politically motivated activist decisions.\n\n  Then Senator Hatch goes on to say something else I agree with 100 \npercent:\n\n       The Senate has an obligation to the American people to \n     thoroughly review the records of all nominees it receives to \n     ensure that they are capable and qualified to serve as \n     Federal judges.\n\n  Listen to that specific point that Senator Hatch made back in 1997: \nThere has to be a thorough inquiry and the Senate has to determine \nwhether a nominee would, upon receiving their judicial commission, \nspend a lifetime, a career, rendering politically motivated, activist \ndecisions. That is really the nub of what we are looking to determine.\n  There is more than sufficient concern that the nominee before us \nwould do just that. And the reason why the administration will not, and \nmaybe perchance cannot provide the information requested, is because to \ndo so would make abundantly clear that this is a nominee on a mission, \nthat this is a nominee who will do exactly what Senator Hatch warned \nabout when the shoe was on the other foot; namely, render politically \nmotivated, activist decisions.\n\n  Now, there may be some on the other side who believe they would agree \nwith these politically motivated activist decisions, so bring it on. \nBut I don't\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\nthink that is our responsibility. Our responsibility is to know ahead \nof time. The American people don't get to interview and vote on these \nnominees. If some nominee overturns, when he or she is on the bench, \nfundamental worker protections for people who work hard and play by the \nrules of what they are supposed to do at work, that affects the lives \nof millions of Americans. If someone decides they don't like the \nViolence Against Women Act, or they don't believe there is a right to \nprivacy embedded in the Constitution, that affects millions of \nAmericans.\n  So I think it is imperative that we listen to what our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle said during the 1990s. All of this concern \nabout advice and consent, all of this caution about rushing to judgment \nand voting--slow it down, do a thorough review, don't move too quickly. \nIn fact, don't even give people hearings or a vote in committee. It is \nimperative that now we try to get back to that balance of power that \nthe Constitution established.\n  Turning down nominations for a judgeship is something that goes back \nto the beginning of our Republic. It is not as though this is the first \ntime we have ever had this debate. We have had many nominees rejected, \nstarting with one of President Washington's nominees. John Rutledge was \nnominated in 1795 by President Washington. Why was he turned down? He \nwas thought to be well qualified. He had quite an experience that could \ncertainly be impressive when examined. He was a member of the \nFederalist Party, which should certainly ring a bell with my colleagues \non the other side. But he was turned down because of his political \nviews.\n  The idea that somehow the political views and positions of a nominee \nfor a lifetime appointment are off limits to the Senate has no basis in \nfact, history, or law. The very first nominee in 1795 by probably the \nmost popular President that we have ever had, because he was the \nfirst--and lucky for him he didn't have to be compared to other people \nand given all of the difficulties that our subsequent Presidents have \nfaced--but President Washington's nominee was rejected because of the \npolitical positions he had taken.\n  Of course, that was not the only early nominee to be rejected. \nPresident Madison nominated Alexander Wolcott in 1811. He was rejected.\n  He was rejected. President Jackson nominated Roger Brook Taney in \n1835. He was rejected the first time. He came back a year later and was \naccepted. There are many such situations.\n  It is revising history to claim that we cannot inquire into someone's \nopinions. If we are going to put someone on the bench who does not \nbelieve there is a right to privacy in the Constitution, which would \nperhaps lead to the overturning of many decisions that protect people's \nprivacy in the sanctity of their home or with respect to their bodies, \nwe should know that. That person might still be nominated and \nconfirmed, but the American people have a right to know who these \npeople are who are being nominated because they are going to be making \ndecisions that affect the daily lives of Americans.\n  When you nominate a stealth candidate, when you send him up to the \nJudiciary Committee and tell him to dodge and duck and divert and do \nnot answer a straight question with a straight answer, is it any wonder \nthat people get a little suspicious and maybe say: Wait a minute; if \nthis man will not even come and tell us what Supreme Court decision he \nagrees with, going back to Marbury v. Madison, and he says he cannot \nname one; How about one with which you disagree? Well, I can't name \nthat either; that does not pass the smell test, I am sorry. That is a \nwitness who has been well coached and told: Don't rock any boats, don't \nanswer any questions, don't reveal your true opinions. Just try to get \nthrough the process.\n  That is why we need an advice and consent clause in the Constitution, \nand that is why the Framers put it there. It very well may be if he \nanswered the questions forthrightly, if he said: My favorite Supreme \nCourt decision is Marbury v. Madison, my least favorite is--pick one \nout of thousands--we would say: We do not agree with you, but OK. But \nhe will not do that.\n  You have to ask yourself: Why won't he do that? Certainly given the \nkinds of questions that were asked of nominees during the 1990s that \nwent into all kinds of areas--their associations, the meetings they \nattended, how they even voted--it is hard to understand why this \nnominee cannot be expected to answer pertinent questions about the law, \nabout his opinions concerning Supreme Court decisions.\n  The fact he refuses to do so, or has been ordered not to do so, \nfundamentally defies the constitutional duty of this body to advise and \nconsent.\n  I know there are those who have argued that there is already an \nadequate amount of information in the record that should be taken at \nface value. That is hard to do. That is hard to do because, in the \nabsence of a willingness to answer pertinent, relevant questions, many \nof us do not believe the nominee has sufficiently subjected himself to \nthe process that this body has established to permit Senators to make \nan informed decision.\n  If we go back and look at the reams of material that I reviewed to \ndetermine what was the basis for the advice and consent clause, I think \nthat is obvious to us all it is there for a purpose. We ignore it at \nour peril. We have a duty to abide by it.\n  I again urge my friends and colleagues on the other side to read the \nextensive description of the advice and consent clause and the role of \nthe Senate in the judicial selection process by former Republican \nSenator Charles McC. Mathias.\n  When my friends and colleagues raise the issue that somehow this is \nfocused on a particular nominee, for whatever reason, I think that does \na disservice to the seriousness of our concerns because it was this \nnominee who would not answer the questions. It was this nominee who did \nnot provide the materials.\n\n  My very alert counsel has just reminded me that when Justice Taney \nwas first rejected after being nominated by President Jackson in 1835 \nand then was renominated and confirmed in 1836, he went on to write one \nof the most discredited, racist, despicable opinions in the history of \nour court. Judge Taney was the author of the Dred Scott decision. Maybe \nthe country would have been better off and saved a whole lot of misery \nif the Senate had delayed action and had never confirmed him when he \nwas renominated. We just never know. We have to do the best we can \ngiven our own human limitations and idiosyncrasies based on the \ninformation available.\n  There are some, and I respect their opinion, on both sides of the \naisle who say: If the President sends somebody up, I am voting for it, \nno questions asked. That is how I believe the Constitution is to be \ninterpreted, as far as I am concerned.\n  With all due respect, I think that is an abdication of \nresponsibility.\n  For most of us, we try to get behind the nomination. We try to \nunderstand, not just the academic or legal background which can be \ndescribed by where you worked, who you worked for, what clients you \nhad, what cases you tried or argued, but if that is all we did, we \ncould put that into a computer. We would not need the Senate. We would \ncomputerize that decision. That is not what we are supposed to do. We \nare supposed to get behind the statistics, under the resume to satisfy \nourselves that the person we give this lifetime job to is motivated by \nonly one reason: to render justice to the best of his ability no matter \nwho the parties are, no matter what the outcome of the matter may be, \nnot to serve a political philosophy or ideology, not to serve a \npolitical party or even a President but to really do the hard work of \njustice.\n  It is a hard job, it is a really hard job and especially today. There \nare so many factors at work in our society, so many difficult decisions \nto be made about how we keep this wonderful, precious democracy of ours \nmoving forward that judges have a very tough job. It is not for the \ncasual or the indolent. It is for people who really care, will work \nhard, and will follow the law, the Constitution, and their conscience.\n  We are judging not just a legal resume. We are judging a potential \njudge. We are asking ourselves: Will everyone who appears before this \ncourt get the benefit of a fair rendering of justice?\n  Until we can satisfactorily answer that question about this nominee, \nwe cannot move forward. We should not move forward. We should follow \nthe words of our colleagues when the shoe was on the other foot and it \nwas a\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\nnominee from a Democratic President that caused questions and concerns \non the other side.\n  I personally think that was overdone, and that many good, decent \npeople who would have made fine judges were denied the right to go \nforward, but it was done in the name of the Constitution. It was done \nunder the rubric of advise and consent.\n  It is a little hard to understand how my friends on the other side \ncan, with straight faces, say that is not what it means at all. How \ndare we question this nominee. How can we ask for more information? \nBecause that is what we think our duty is, just as at a previous time \nthose on the other side thought it their duty.\n  It is difficult to explain how the Constitution's interpretation \ncould flip so quickly. I do not think that is good for the \nConstitution. I do not think that is good for this body. I do not think \nit is good for the judiciary. Most of all, I do not think it is good \nfor our country. I think no matter who is in the White House, no matter \nwho is in the Senate, we ought to do our level best to fulfill the \nduties the Constitution places upon us. That is what I am attempting to \ndo to the best of my ability. I know that is what all of my colleagues \nattempt to do.\n  When we face a moment such as this, which seems fraught with so much \nmeaning not only with respect to a nominee and not only with respect to \nthe judiciary but to that fundamental balance of power, we have to be \ncareful. We will live with the precedents that are set.\n  Lord Acton had it right when he said, power corrupts and absolute \npower corrupts absolutely.\n  We must have those checks and balances. We must keep that fabulous, \nunbelievable genius of our Framers alive. I hope we can see some \nattention being paid to the legitimate questions and concerns that are \nbeing raised about this nominee and about this process and about the \nConstitution we revere and serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today and join my colleagues in \nsupporting the confirmation of Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit Court \nof Appeals. We have heard more information on this man than anyone I \ncan remember in recent times. There is not much about this gentleman or \nthis situation that has not been said thus far on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The history of this man I can relate to. I kind of started out on my \nown about that age, but I will never attain the level of society and \ndedication he has. He did it the hard way, by his own bootstraps. He is \na graduate of Harvard Law School, near the top of his class. We also \nknow he is a very successful appellate lawyer who argued 15 cases \nbefore the United States Supreme Court. We know he has been rated well \nqualified by his own colleagues in the American Bar Association.\n  I find it interesting, as the case is trying to be made, that \nsomebody is being denied their constitutional rights, the \nconstitutional right of advice and consent. I tell the American people, \nno Senator is being denied access to this floor. No Senator is being \ndenied the ability to come to this floor and make his or her case \neither in support or opposition to the confirmation of Miguel Estrada. \nEveryone is free to do so and is afforded the opportunity to discuss \nthe merits of one side or the other. Nobody is being denied that. It is \npretty simple, and I think the American people understand that. Come \ndown and make your case. If you did not make it the first time, come \nback the second time, come back as many times as you like to respond.\n  No one has been denied anything dealing with the merits of this man \nMiguel Estrada. Come down and make your case. Then vote. It is very \nsimple. There is nothing hard to understand about that.\n  If a good case is made, there may be 51 votes. Folks will vote for \nyou and you have won, and we will say congratulations. Nobody is being \ndenied that.\n  We see quite a lot of dust being kicked up to fuzz up and confuse the \nissue. The issue is Miguel Estrada. That is what it is about. He has \nbeen nominated to occupy a seat on the DC Court of Appeals.\n  I am not an attorney, never been hinged with that title, but I too \nget to vote. I too get to look at information, both positive and \nsometimes negative, about this man. He will be the first Hispanic to \nserve on the DC Court of Appeals, and I applaud President Bush for \nnominating a candidate of this quality and this integrity.\n  He is a living example of an American attaining what he terms as his \nAmerican dream. Right now he is being denied a vote. That seems sort of \nstrange to me. He deserves an up-or-down vote, and at the end of that \nwe will count them up and we will move on.\n  Why should I, a Senator from Montana, be interested in a nominee to \nthe DC Court of Appeals? Well, so many cases are argued before this \ncourt that have to do with the management of public lands and the \nmanagement of our national parks. Because I am from a public lands \nState, it matters a great deal that the laws of the land are properly \njudged and adjudicated. Every piece of information that I have been \nable to read or listen to or watch tells me he understands one little \nword in the English language that is very important to each and every \none of us. The word is ``fair,'' dedicated to the study of both sides \nof any issue and then relating that to the law or the Constitution of \nthe United States and making judgments.\n\n  That is pretty simple. We make things a lot more difficult than they \nshould be. I have seen the big thick book that the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee had, all the questions he was asked, the responses. \nWhat else is there to know about this man that has not been revealed? \nInstead, we hear ``deny,'' when not one person in the United States as \na Member has been denied access to this floor.\n  Cases that have to do with public lands have great ramifications for \nMontana. Therefore, not only will I think he will be fair, judicial, \nand constitutional, but I believe it is also important to fill this \nvacancy. Right now, we see declarations of emergencies in so many of \nour appellate courts that we are seeing justice delayed, justice \ndenied.\n  So what do we see happening today? It is written in the Constitution \nabout our rights not being denied, but we sure see a little bit of \nobstructing and delaying in the confirmation process. We will not even \nbe denied a vote. Every Senator will come down and cast his vote.\n  He was rated the highest rating of the American Bar Association. Yet \nwe have heard it argued that he does not have the right qualifications \nto serve the court and therefore make a decision that we are going to \ntalk the nomination to death. The Senate is a better body than that. \nBeing around politicians a lot, being talked to death happens to be the \nworst death in the world.\n  So, is he qualified? You bet he is. Does he meet the limits on some \nfolks? Maybe not. Does he meet their litmus test, maybe a personal \nlitmus test? Maybe not. But there were people who disagreed with us \nwhen we ran for office and no one was denied the vote. If we had to go \nthrough this process just to get elected to the Senate by our \nconstituency, we might not ever get here; we would be talked to death \nat home.\n  We are not going to talk about his background. We are going to talk \nabout this American. No, he did not start here, but this American has \napplied his talents and his intellect to become an appellate judge. I \nam proud of this man. Nowhere else do we see an example of who we are \nand why we are Americans.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURNS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator makes his point about having a right to a \nvote. The argument has been made previously that we need advice and \nconsent, but we never vote. The Senator is aware that on a filibuster \nit takes 60 votes, and on an up-or-down vote it takes a majority, 51 \nvotes; is that correct?\n  Mr. BURNS. That is the way I understand it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Constitution is right on advice and consent, and we \ncan debate forever about that, what that means. Basically, it means \nwhat any Senators believe it means; is that right? They can vote on any \nbasis they want?\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. That is my interpretation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Constitution says: The President shall have the \npower, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make \ntreaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur; and he \nshall nominate and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall \nappoint ambassadors, judges, and other court officers.\n  It did not say what the vote was, so since the founding of our \ndocument, we managed that to be a majority. Where it needed a \nsupermajority--more than 51 votes in this case--more than a simple \nmajority, it set it out, two-thirds.\n  So wouldn't the Senator agree that a fair reading of the Constitution \nwould indicate our Founders contemplated that the vote here would be a \nsimple majority required for confirmation?\n  Mr. BURNS. You are asking a man who is not trained in the legal \ndisciplines.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. But the Senator is most trained in common sense.\n  Mr. BURNS. I say that the majority, 50 plus 1, would be all it takes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And that is what we have done.\n  Is the Senator aware in his tenure in this Senate that we have ever \nhad a filibuster maintained on a Federal judge?\n  Mr. BURNS. That is something else that sort of confused me the way \nyou put your argument, but I am wondering why we are raising the bar \nfor this nominee. Is that what we are doing here? Are we saying he has \nto stand a more difficult test than all others in the past or all \nothers will be asked in the future?\n  I go back to that other old word, I say to my friend from Alabama: \n``Fair.'' I guess that is all we ask, fairness. Everything I have read \nand everything I have heard tells me that this man is qualified to sit \nat any other man's fire. And I would tell you they don't come with a \nhigher recommendation than that. But let's not ask this man to be \nsubjected to a higher bar than has been asked of every other American--\nnot this American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise this evening to discuss the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, and to \nexpress grave concerns that we are being asked to vote on a lifetime \nappointment with very little information on this nominee. There are \nmany who have raised concerns about that very point. Let me share one \nletter that has been written, from the American Association of \nUniversity Women.\n\n       We believe the information available regarding Mr. \n     Estrada's record raises serious concerns about whether he \n     should be given the enormous honor and responsibility of a \n     lifetime appointment to this Nation's second most powerful \n     Federal court. We strongly urge the members of the Judiciary \n     Committee to conduct a thorough investigation of his record, \n     including the areas of concern we have outlined, and to \n     refrain from passing judgment on his nomination until that \n     inquiry and the record is complete.\n\n  Let me begin by saying the DC Circuit Court of Appeals is, in fact, \nan extremely important court in our Nation. It is very important to the \npeople I represent in Michigan and to the people that we all represent. \nIt is, in fact, considered the Nation's second most important court, \nsecond only to the U.S. Supreme Court. This court has exclusive \njurisdiction over a broad array of important Federal regulations that \naffect people in their lives every single day--environmental \nprotection, our civil rights, human rights, consumer protections, \nworkplace statutes--items that touch our lives. We have the right to \nknow what someone's views are in general, and philosophy in general, as \nthat person is being considered for this high court.\n  In addition, its judges are often nominated to serve on the U.S. \nSupreme Court, which is another reason why this is a particularly \nimportant nomination, and a particularly important decision for all of \nus in the Senate. Three of the current members of the Supreme Court, \nJustice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, all \npreviously served on the DC Circuit. So that is why this is \nparticularly important and we should take the time necessary to make \nsure that the right decisions are made.\n  Despite the importance of the DC Circuit Court, the administration is \ntrying very hard to prevent the Senate from making an informed \ndecision--an informed decision on Mr. Estrada. Mr. Estrada has no \njudicial experience, nor is he a distinguished scholar or professor, \nwhich means he lacks any real public record. That is not disparaging in \nterms of a comment as to his intellect, but it is a question of public \nrecord which we can review as to his views and philosophies.\n  He has spent the bulk of his career in the Solicitor General's Office \nand in private practice. This makes it extraordinarily difficult for us \nto fairly evaluate him, and it makes his legal memos and other work \nproduct absolutely critical for this evaluation.\n  The Senate has a constitutional obligation to advise and consent on a \nFederal judicial nominee. This is a responsibility I take very \nseriously, as do my Senate colleagues, I know, from both sides of the \naisle. I might just remind us that as we read in our U.S. history \nbooks, there was a major debate as to how to decide the nominees and \nthe members who would sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. At one point, our \nFramers said the President should decide alone. At another point they \nsaid the Senate should be the one that has the absolute right to decide \nwho should be on this all powerful, important court that affects our \nlives so much. In the end they compromised, as they did in much of the \ndiscussions and the final decisions as to the framing of our \nGovernment. They said we believe this is so important there needs to be \na check and balance, so we need to have both the Senate and the \nPresident involved. The President will nominate but the Senate will \nhave the responsibility of reviewing and consenting to the nomination. \nThat is the process that we are involved in right now.\n\n  I might also say that we have confirmed over 100 judges since \nPresident Bush has come into his Presidency, and just on Monday night \nwe had three votes. One was a Hispanic judge. We moved forward in this \nprocess. But when we find someone comes to the Judiciary Committee and \nwhen he is asked to provide copies of his memos and information, when \nhe basically says no, or I'll just think about it, that makes it very \ndifficult for an informed decision to be made.\n  Unlike other nominations that come before the Senate, such as \nambassadorships or executive nominees, Federal judicial nominations, \nagain, are lifetime appointments. I think it is so important to repeat \nthat over and over again. I have, in fact, supported the confirmation \nof individuals, other nominees of the President for his Cabinet who \ncertainly would not have been my personal first choice. But the \nPresident has the right to select his Cabinet--certainly within reason; \nhas the right to select his Cabinet, the people who will work with him \nduring the 4 years that he is in office.\n  That is not what this is about. This is about someone who will, in \nfact, make decisions that will affect us, not for 3 or 4 years, but for \n30 or 40 years, through numerous Presidents, making it even more \nimportant that we are not a rubberstamp. The U.S. Senate has a very \nimportant role to play.\n  As a part of this important responsibility, my Democratic colleagues \non the Judiciary Committee have tried to obtain information, legal \nmemos Mr. Estrada wrote while serving in the Justice Department. The \nJustice Department has refused to provide these documents which \npresumably would show Mr. Estrada's constitutional analysis of cases. \nThis is very important. The constitutional analysis of statutes--\nwhatever his philosophies and beliefs--would give us insight into his \njudicial reasoning, not on a particular case but his reasoning. \nUnfortunately, as I indicated before, he has not been forthcoming to \nthe committee. In fact, he has refused to answer the most basic \nquestions before the committee.\n  During his nomination hearing, Mr. Estrada refused to answer \nquestions regarding his judicial philosophy or his views on important \nSupreme Court cases, including Roe v. Wade. He even refused to name any \nSupreme Court case with which he disagreed. This refusal to provide \nnecessary information is absolutely unprecedented. Past administrations \nand the current administration have disclosed legal memos and other \ninformation in connection with both judicial and executive nominees.\n  For example, in previous administrations the Senate has requested and \nthe\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\nJustice Department has provided similar memos, written by Justice \nDepartment attorneys, including the writings of Supreme Court Justice \nWilliam Rehnquist, the Ninth Circuit Nominee Stephen Trott, Supreme \nCourt nominee Robert Bork, Assistant Attorney General nominee William \nBradford Reynolds, and Attorney General nominee Benjamin Civiletti, \namong others.\n  This breaks with a longstanding practice of cooperation between the \nJustice Department and the Senate in providing access to necessary \nmaterials for nominations.\n\n  The administration also has provided such memos for another nominee. \nThe Bush administration has provided the Senate with legal memos \nwritten by Jeffrey Holmstead, an attorney with the White House \nCounsel's Office, during the consideration of his nomination as \nAssistant Administrator at the EPA. This was for a term appointment, in \ncontrast to a lifetime appointment, which is certainly much more \nsignificant.\n  I am also concerned that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare applying a different standard for nominees who are nominated by a \nRepublican President than by a Democratic President. During the Clinton \nadministration, and under Chairman Hatch, nominees were required to \nproduce volumes of information. For example, Judge Richard Paez was \nasked to provide documentation of every instance during his tenure as a \njudge where he deviated downward from a sentencing guideline--every \ninstance.\n  Marsha Berzon, a Tenth Circuit nominee, was required to provide the \nminutes from every California ACLU meeting that occurred while she was \na member of that organization, regardless of whether she even attended \nthe meeting.\n  Why was the bar placed so high for these Clinton nominees but there \nis such a hard push by my colleagues to confirm a nominee from whom we \nhave no information? Why is there such a strong resistance by the \nadministration to allow the Senate the opportunity to learn more about \nthis nominee's writings and opinions? That is what this debate is all \nabout.\n  I might just say that when I am asked what is the philosophy, what is \nthe judicial reasoning of this particular nominee, I would have to say \nthis--these are the answers to the questions that Miguel Estrada gave \nto the Judiciary Committee: An absolute blank slate. Not one answer to \none question. How can that give us the opportunity to determine whether \nor not this is a nominee we wish to support?\n  Finally, I am extremely disappointed by how some of my colleagues \nacross the aisle have tried to make this an issue of race. I believe \nracial diversity in our judicial system is extremely important. I wish \nmy Republican colleagues had made the same impassioned speeches during \nthe Clinton administration when 10 of more than 30 Hispanic nominees \nwere delayed or blocked from receiving hearings or votes by members of \ntheir caucus. I wish my colleagues had been outraged when Ronnie \nWhite's nomination languished for 2\\1/2\\ years and then was rejected on \nthe Senate floor on a party-line vote. I wish my colleagues had stood \nup for racial diversity when the President filed their brief opposing \nthe University of Michigan's admissions policy to help create racial \ndiversity in our law schools and our other colleges and schools at the \nuniversity.\n  The Senate needs to apply the same level of scrutiny and the same \nstandards regardless of a nominee's race or the politics of the \nadministrations that nominated them.\n  Until we are given these memos that are a part of Mr. Estrada's \nrecord, we are not going to hold judicial nominees to the same \nstandards and the same basic principles of fairness. It is time to do \nthat--to give us a true opportunity.\n  I might also add that 100 percent of the Hispanic Caucus of the House \nof Representatives have joined with us asking that we oppose or \nwithhold judgment--that we not proceed with this vote until we have the \ninformation. These are individuals who have expressed grave concerns. \nThey do not support moving forward. One-hundred percent of the Hispanic \nCaucus of the House from all around the country joined with more than \n30 different organizations expressing grave concern.\n  I think that says to us we need to take the time that is necessary \nand we need to receive information so that we can make an appropriate \njudgment.\n  I will take just a moment to change topics.\n  I ask while moving from one important topic to another to take just a \nmoment to speak to a bill I have introduced today regarding the growing \nimportation of waste problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know the Senator would like to talk \nabout another subject. But what is the pending business we are on now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Estrada \nnomination.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will, regretfully, have to object to proceeding to \nanother subject. That is a subject we are here to talk about, and I \nhave some remarks I want to make. So I would object.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I have been given the floor, as I \nunderstand it, for 30 minutes. And I appreciate the fact that we have a \ntopic in front of us. At this point, it is my understanding that it is \nnot the Senator's prerogative to object to my being on the floor and to \nbe able to speak for a moment, along with this important topic, to a \nbill I introduced about waste coming into the United States and taking \na moment to do that. It is my understanding that under the normal \nprocesses of the Senate, I would have the opportunity to take a moment \nto do that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator wouldn't take long, if she wants to ban \nimportation of some of that Canadian lumber, I will join with her. I \nyield to the Senator, if she is not going to be too long then.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                     Importation of Canadian Waste\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to have an opportunity this evening--\nrealizing we have an important topic on the floor--to speak on the \nrecord about an important topic that affects many of our States, and \nMichigan is certainly one of them.\n  There is a growing problem of Canadian waste shipments to Michigan \nand other States. In 2001, Michigan imported almost 3.6 million tons of \nmunicipal solid waste--more than double the amount that was imported in \n1999. This gives Michigan, unfortunately, the undue distinction of \nbeing the third largest dumping ground of waste in the United States.\n  My colleagues may be surprised to know that the biggest source of \nthis waste is not another State but, in fact, Canada. And more than \nhalf the waste that was shipped to Michigan in 2001 was from Ontario, \nCanada, where these imports, unfortunately, are growing rapidly. In \nfact, on January 1, 2003, another Ontario landfill closed its doors, \nand the city of Toronto is shipping two-thirds to all of its trash--1.9 \nmillion tons--to a Michigan landfill. This deal could last up to 20 \nyears. I think it is important for a statement to be made for the \nrecord as we move forward with this legislation that it is time to do \nsomething about it.\n  Not only does this waste dramatically decrease our own ability to \nhave a landfill capacity, but it also has a negative effect on the \nenvironment and on public health. Frankly, right now, I am particularly \nconcerned about the fact that this is a homeland security issue for us. \nWe now have our citizens at high alert. We are telling them to prepare \nthemselves with duct tape, with plastics, and with water for their \nhomes. There is a high degree of concern about the possibility of a \nterrorist attack.\n  Yet on Monday, I was able to go to Port Huron, MI, and look at an \ninternational bridge where we have trucks coming over bumper to \nbumper--over 130 different semi-trailer trucks--from Ontario, Canada, \nto Michigan every day that have solid waste in them from Canada, waste \nthat is not thoroughly inspected. I think this is a serious issue as it \nrelates to homeland security. These trucks are going through the \nneighborhoods and on into Michigan. And the same is happening in a \nnumber of other States.\n  I have joined with colleagues--first with Senator Levin and \nCongressman\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\nDingell--to introduce legislation to enforce an agreement that was made \nbetween Canada and the United States back in 1986 that would give \nnotice to the EPA--30-day notice--and the ability to reject waste \ncoming into this country. That is not being enforced now. I support \ntheir efforts to enforce this provision with the EPA. But I think we \nhave to go a step further now and stop these shipments until we can get \nthe agreement enforced and have the EPA step up and receive notice on \nthese shipments coming into the States.\n  I believe the State of Michigan should be able to tell the EPA that \nthey don't want this trash in Michigan and that the EPA should honor \nthat and be able to reject those shipments coming in from Canada. We \nneed to act now. This is a serious environmental issue and a public \nhealth and homeland security issue.\n  I urge my colleagues and invite my colleagues to join me in \nlegislation that will stop the shipments and give us the opportunity to \nenforce this agreement that has been on the books long term so that we \ncan send a very strong message that we are not interested in Canadian \ntrash coming into Michigan or any other State that does not wish to \nhave it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is really frustrating. I know Senator \nHatch last night expressed his frustration about arguments that are \nmade that are just not factual.\n  I know the Senator, as she finished her remarks eloquently, as she \ndoes, was not at the Judiciary Committee hearing which I attended on \nMiguel Estrada. The hearings started at 9 in the morning and went until \n5 in the afternoon. There are hundreds of pages of transcript of that \ntestimony that he gave answering every question I think with the proper \nnuance each and every time on question after question after question.\n  Remember, the questions they were asking were during the time the \nDemocrats controlled the majority in the Senate and Senator Leahy was \nthe chairman. He could have kept them there as long as he wanted. There \nis no record that indicates Miguel Estrada said: Stop the hearing; I \ndon't want to answer any more questions. He was never asked to come \nback to answer any more questions. The record was kept open, and \nSenators were allowed to submit written questions in addition. Two \nSenators did that--Senator Schumer and Senator Kennedy. Those were \nanswered by Mr. Estrada.\n  He has answered question after question after question. It is not \ntrue that he did not answer one question. He answered hundreds of \nquestions. He answered them accurately and with skill and with good \njudgment.\n  It was said earlier in the debate that he would not answer the \nquestion of whether or not he was a strict constructionist. I thought \nthat was interesting. Somebody said that was an example of a question \nhe would not answer.\n  I remember the answer that he gave because I thought it was special, \nreally indicative of his brilliance and insight into the law.\n\n       Senator Edwards. Are you a strict constructionist?\n       Mr. Estrada. I am a fair constructionist, I think.\n       Senator Edwards. Do you consider yourself a strict \n     constructionist?\n       Mr. Estrada. I consider myself a fair constructionist. I \n     mean, that is to say, I don't think that it should be the \n     goal of courts to be strict or lax. The goal of courts is to \n     get it right. And that may be in some cases to interpret the \n     text as it is written because other consideration of every \n     element of help that there is to give the text meaning tells \n     us that that is what the lawmaker intended. But it may be \n     inappropriate to give it a more general construction. I think \n     we can have laws and constitutional text of both types. It is \n     not necessarily the case in my mind that, for example, all \n     parts of the Constitution are suitable for the same type of \n     interpretive analysis.\n\n  A very insightful, thoughtful answer.\n\n       Senator Edwards. Excuse me. I am sorry. I didn't mean to \n     interrupt you.\n       Mr. Estrada. No, no.\n       Senator Edwards. Were you finished?\n       Mr. Estrada. The example I was going to give is, you know, \n     the Constitution says, for example, that you must be 35 years \n     old in order to be our Chief Executive. There is not a lot of \n     hard study that has to go into figuring out whether somebody \n     is in compliance with the 35-year-old requirement. You can \n     read it and say I am 40 and I can run.\n       There are areas of the Constitution that are more open-\n     ended, and you averted to one, like the substantive component \n     of the due process clauses, where there are other methods of \n     interpretation that are not quite so obvious that the Court \n     has brought to bear to try to bring forth what the \n     appropriate answer should be.\n\n  I thought that was a very rich, very mature answer to that question \nand was a good example of the way he answered the questions.\n  He was asked about his position on Roe v. Wade. He made it absolutely \nclear that he considered it the law of the land and he would follow \nthat law. And he cited Casey as being further explication of Roe v. \nWade, and he would follow that. So I think that is important for us to \nthink about.\n  People say he refused to allow himself to be questioned about a \njudicial philosophy. I do not understand it that way at all. He refused \nto allow himself to be pressured into considering questions that he \nmight have to deal with on the bench or questions he had not fully \nresearched. And that is what he should do.\n  If you are before a Senate committee, and you are asked what your \nopinion is on the right of privacy or some due process clause, and you \nexpress that, and then you get on the bench, are you obligated, since \nyou were under oath when you were at that committee, to follow it? What \nif, once you get on the bench, and you receive highly sophisticated and \nhigh-quality legal briefs that convince you you were wrong, what does \nthe judge do then? Judges should not opine on matters that are going to \ncome before them in the future. So he answered the questions \nconsistently, and over and over and over again.\n\n  They say: ``We have a right to advise and consent. The constitution \nallows that.'' And it does say that. This Senate--and every Senator--\ncan vote for or against a nominee on any basis they choose--a proper or \nimproper basis. It is their right. Nobody can control me on how I vote \non this floor.\n  But what ought we do? How ought we handle matters of confirmation?\n  Let's be truthful. The reality is that, in the past, there has been a \npreference given, a presumption given to the President's nominees. They \nwere able to come before the Senate or submit documents or just have \ntheir names submitted, and generally they have been confirmed. It is \npart of the cooperation, unwritten courtesies, collegiality and \ntradition of the Senate, that the President's nominees would be \nconfirmed, where possible. And if there is a serious objection, that \nshould be raised.\n  My concern in the matter of Miguel Estrada is, for the first time--\nmaybe this century maybe ever--a court of appeals nominee is facing a \nconfirmation process that would require not a majority of votes in the \nSenate but a supermajority--60 votes--to be confirmed. That is \nsomething we have not done before. It is not something we should \nproceed with.\n  The Constitution, in article II, section 2, says:\n\n       [The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice \n     and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-\n     thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, \n     and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall \n     appoint Ambassadors . . . Judges of the supreme Court, and \n     all other Officers. . . .\n  The Constitution does not say what the vote should be, but it has \nbeen fully understood it meant a majority because when a supermajority \nof two-thirds was required, the Constitution spelled it out explicitly.\n  So the reason many of us on this side, who have been involved and \nhave studied the confirmation process, are deeply concerned by what is \nhappening here is because we are changing the ground rules in an \nextraordinary way. We are saying now--without any real basis, without \nany statement of wrongdoing by this nominee, any proof whatsoever that \nhe is extreme or will not follow the law--they are now asserting this \nyoung Hispanic, outstanding lawyer has to have 60 votes to be \nconfirmed, not 51. That is not right. I urge the Members of this body, \nI plead with the Members of this body: Do not do this. This knife cuts \nboth ways.\n  Are we setting a precedent we are going to follow as long as this \nSenate exists? If you do not like a nominee, and 40 people get \ntogether, they can block that nominee? That was not done\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\nwhen President Clinton was President. There was not a filibuster of a \nPresident Clinton nominee. There was not a blocking of any of the \nnominees in committee.\n  Last year, when the Democrats had the majority in the Judiciary \nCommittee, they blocked two nominees in committee on a straight party-\nline vote, both of whom would have been confirmed, it was clear, from \nnews reports, had they reached the floor. They killed them in \ncommittee. I thought they had, but that may not be the case today. That \nwas a rachetting up of the process. They said: Well, you held up \nPresident Clinton's nominees.\n  Let me tell you what the facts are there. In the 8 years that \nPresident Clinton was President, he had confirmed 377 Federal judges. \nOne of his nominees was voted down. That nominee was opposed by the \nNational Sheriffs Association, law enforcement groups, and both Home \nState Senators. It is the only one that was voted down. Not one was \nkilled in committee on a party-line vote. Not one was filibustered.\n  So I just say, that it is not true that President Clinton's nominees \nreceived unfair scrutiny. Yes, they were asked questions, but they were \nasked responsible questions. And they were consistently confirmed in \nlarge numbers.\n  They said: Well, some of them did not get through. The fact is, when \nPresident Clinton left office, he had nominated 41 judges who had not \nbeen cleared. He confirmed 377, but 41 had not cleared.\n  When former President Bush left office in 1992, there were 54 judges \nwhich the Democratic majority Senate had not confirmed.\n  So it is a total falsehood to suggest the Clinton nominees were \nmistreated when they came through here. They got a higher percentage of \nthem confirmed than did former President Bush's nominees. They were not \nfilibustered, and they were not blocked in committee. I feel very \nstrongly about that.\n  It has been said that you Republicans said advise and consent is not \na rubberstamp and you had a right to raise questions and vote against \nnominees.\n  I agree with that. We all have that right. We can vote against them. \nWe have a right to debate them. We have a right to ask questions. If we \nare not satisfied with those answers, we have an obligation to vote no. \nWe should vote no. But wait a minute. What if we don't allow them to \nhave a vote? Is that what we are saying? We are going to vote to not \nallow a vote? I am not at all pleased with that.\n  One person suggested we are dealing with judges from the lunatic \nfringes. That was a quote made earlier. This nominee cannot possibly be \nconsidered a lunatic fringe nominee. This nominee unanimously was rated \nwell qualified by the American Bar Association. The ABA goes out and \ninvestigates these nominees. They ask what cases they have handled. \nThey then make a list of the lawyers on the other side of the cases, \nand they go out and interview the lawyers. They interview the judges \nwho tried the cases. They don't give out well-qualified ratings that \noften. It is rare to get a unanimously well-qualified rating.\n  How can we say Miguel Estrada is somehow out of the mainstream or a \nlunatic fringe nominee when the gold standard, as one of my Democratic \ncolleagues said, the ABA, rated him well qualified with their highest \npossible rating? It can't be done.\n  He went to Harvard. He was editor of the Law Review and spent 5 years \nin the Department of Justice Office of Solicitor General under the \nClinton administration. Under the Clinton administration he was \nevaluated repeatedly by his supervisors, and he was given the highest \npossible evaluation you could give an attorney in the Department of \nJustice every year, the top rating.\n  Is this some sort of incapable stealth candidate we don't know \nanything about? No, sir. Not so.\n  One of our Senators talked about the Constitution as a changing \ndocument and that from time to time we just change it. I think that is \ndangerous. Our liberties are bound up in that document. If we say we \nhave a right to change its meaning from time to time, according to the \nlength of the chancellor's foot, according to how a judge may feel on a \ngiven day, our liberties have been eroded.\n  I remember Professor Van Alstyne at Duke, a constitutional scholar, \nsaid: If you love this Constitution and you really respect the \nConstitution, you will interpret it as it is written. You don't \ninterpret it as you wish it were. If you do that, you don't respect the \ndocument. You undermine the document and the power that it has had for \ngeneration after generation to protect our liberties and order.\n  They say: You are just pounding on the table over there, Republicans. \nYou have no argument whatsoever.\n  That is not true. Mr. Estrada has one of the highest recommendations, \nwith one of the greatest backgrounds of any nominee I have ever seen \ncome before this Senate. I was in the committee and I heard his \ntestimony. It was absolutely superb, one of the finest testimonies I \nhave seen. He was responsive, intelligent, quiet, thoughtful, courteous \nto the questioners, at times when he should not have been. I was very \nimpressed with him.\n  Some think maybe the opposition to this young conservative Hispanic \nis because, who knows, President Bush might want to put him on the \nSupreme Court. I will just say this: I saw him testify. I read his \nrecord and background. He would make an outstanding Supreme Court \nJustice, a great Supreme Court Justice. He has integrity and legal \nthought processes that are superb. I am very pleased with him.\n\n  They throw out these charges. I just happen to know some of them \nbecause I have been involved in the hearings. They said one judge was \nasked to give all his downward departures in criminal cases. What a \njudge sentences in a criminal case is a public document. It is part of \nthe public record. A downward departure means the judge has violated \nthe sentencing guidelines. But when he does that, he has to write a \nspecial opinion to justify why he downward-departed and gave the \ncriminal defendant less than the statutory minimum and sentencing \nguidelines would require him to get as a sentence. I don't think that \nwas an extreme thing to ask.\n  What they are asking this nominee to do is reveal internal memoranda \nhe wrote while he was a member of the Clinton administration to his \nfellow colleagues as they discussed how to handle complex legal \nmatters. Every single living Solicitor General has said that this \nshould not be done. There are seven of those, and four of them are \nDemocrats. They have said: No, we do not want our attorneys' work \nproduct, our internal memoranda popped up every time somebody wants to \ndo it. If members of our staff think they can't express an honest \nopinion in my law office as Solicitor General, then they are being \nchilled, if they are going to bring it out some day and say, you can't \nbe a Federal judge because as a young lawyer you wrote a memorandum \nthat didn't make sense.\n  Also they want the free and open discussion they get from the members \nof their staff. That would be reduced if these memoranda should be put \nforward.\n  I ask my colleagues: Should those documents be produced? Is that \nsomething we have to do here? Is that a good policy for America to say \nthat from henceforth, now and forever, every member of the Department \nof Justice, every member of a law firm who wrote internal memoranda, \nthey have to produce all of those before they can be confirmed? That is \na dangerous precedent we ought not to follow.\n  They say: Well, there are some examples in which that happened. The \nSenator from Connecticut had some documents and had a letter from the \nDepartment of Justice asking for them back. He said: That proves they \nhad to exist because they asked for them back.\n  I asked him about it. He introduced them into evidence. I read them. \nWell, it was the Bork confirmation. There were allegations about \nWatergate and those kind of things, and they were asking questions \nbefore they wanted to put him on the court about specific concerns that \nBork may have acted improperly in a series of positions and events. So \nthey asked for those documents, and at some point they turned them \nover.\n  That is not the routine thing. There has not been a single suggestion \nMiguel Estrada has done anything to implicate\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\nhimself in a Watergate type matter. He was a lower echelon attorney in \nthe Solicitor General's office of President Bill Clinton. They have not \nsuggested he would do anything corrupt. They have not suggested any \nparticular issue he took some extreme view on that somehow we have to \nhave this document.\n  They want a fishing expedition. Not so. We ought not do that. I urge \nmy colleagues, I plead with my colleagues, do not do this. We ought not \nto do it. It is not right we would do that.\n  Well, the junior Senator from New York said that power corrupts, and \nsomehow that moving this nominee, who almost sat here for 2 years--\nmoving forward and having a hearing and all, is somehow corrupt or some \nsort of corrupt thing--to ask for a vote and insist we have a vote, \nthat is corrupt.\n  Well, I say this: All of us have responsibilities to use our power \nresponsibly. We ought not abuse that power. Abuse of power is a form of \ncorruption. But, may not the minority be corrupt if they use the rules \nand procedures of this Senate to work a transformation of the \ntraditions of this Senate, to block a nominee by requiring that they \nnow have to have 60 votes instead of a majority? Could that be a form \nof corruption? I suggest it may be. Why? Because hard left attack \ngroups insist and jerk their chain and demand that they vote no, so \nthey just fall in line with that kind of thinking. I am not happy with \nthat.\n  I don't believe this nominee deserves this kind of delay. I believe \nhe deserves a vote. I believe there is not one bit of evidence that has \ncome into this record that indicates he has any failings that would \ndisqualify him from the federal judiciary. I think we ought to give him \na vote. They asked a nominee how he voted on some issue. I remember \nthat. Somebody asked that question. The nominee didn't answer it, and I \nthink it was said that he should not answer it. He never answered it, \nand he was confirmed. They are saying if you don't produce \nconfidential, internal Department of Justice memoranda, we are not \ngoing to confirm you.\n  Well, what is this all about? I remember quite a number of years ago, \nthere was a ``Meet the Press'' program and Hodding Carter, who used to \nbe assistant to President Carter, was asked about judges and \nnominations when President Reagan was in office. He made this comment. \nHe said: The truth is, we liberals have been asking the Federal courts \nto do for us that which we can no longer win at the ballot box.\n  If you cannot win the issue at the ballot box and you can get an \nactivist judge on the bench, maybe you can just file a lawsuit and they \nwill rule your way. Maybe they will just reinterpret the meaning of the \nConstitution or statute and give it some new meaning and just use the \nlaw to effect a political agenda.\n  That is not right. When judges are given lifetime appointments, you \nneed judges who are faithful to the Constitution and the statutes. That \nis what Miguel Estrada's judicial philosophy is. That is what it is. It \nis a hostility to use the law for other matters. He believes in giving \nthe law a fair construction, as he said to Senator Edwards. He asked a \nlittle bit about it, and Senator Edwards pursued the matter a little \nlater. He said: Well, President Bush said that he believes in strict \nconstruction. You say you believe in fair construction, and Mr. Estrada \nreplied that he had not talked to President Bush about it. He said: You \nasked me my opinion. My opinion is fair construction. Mr. President, \nthat is an independent and wise answer.\n  So we have seen courts do things that are really bizarre in America \ntoday. We have seen the courts be utilized as a tool to further \nagendas. Many decisions that we have seen rendered fly in the face of \nlogic. We had judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rule that \n``under God'' should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance. We have \nhad one judge in Vermont--he had a good name, Sessions--whom we \nconfirmed. He is Senator Leahy's friend and was his campaign manager. \nIt wasn't long after Judge Sessions got on the bench that he declared \nthe Federal death penalty unconstitutional. We have heard Senators talk \nabout Berzon and Paez having some difficulties. But I would say that \nperhaps they should have had some difficulties. Since they have been \naffirmed just a few years ago, after taking their positions on the \nFederal bench in California, they both have participated in separate \nopinions declaring the California ``three strikes and you are out'' law \nunconstitutional. This law has been the basis of tens of thousands of \nconvictions of defendants and has helped drive the crime rate down. Yet \nthey said they thought it was cruel and unusual punishment to have a \nmandatory penalty--really an odd and extreme view.\n\n  I felt very strongly that both of those nominees were going to be \nactivist judges, were not going to be bound by the law, and I voted \nagainst them; but they both were confirmed. We didn't filibuster them. \nThey got their up-or-down vote, and they were confirmed with a majority \nof the vote in this Senate. So I just make that point.\n  As one of our witnesses said in committee, all in all, a judge who \nbelieves in strict construction of the law, or a fair construction of \nthe law, and who is not an activist poses less threat to our liberties \nthan one who is an activist judge. That is what Miguel Estrada believes \nin. That is what President Bush believes in. He wants to bring some \nsanity back to our legal system. He wants judges who have the classical \nview of the law. He wants judges who do not feel it is incumbent upon \nthem to tell a city they cannot have Christmas decorations. He does not \nbelieve they should be striking down the Pledge of Allegiance, or \nstriking down the Federal death penalty, or striking down the \nCalifornia ``three strikes and you are out'' law. Those are activist \ndecisions and they threaten our judicial process and deny the people \nthe right to control their destiny.\n  Federal judges, being lifetime appointed, are not subject to control \nby the democratic process. So when they are given the power to carry on \npolitical agendas, then they are acting in an antidemocratic way. It is \nan anti-, undemocratic act when a lifetime appointed judge, with no \naccountability to the public, starts issuing opinions that affect \npublic policy.\n  Well, I will just say that it wasn't long ago when the leadership on \nthe other side, without any hesitation, opposed the filibustering of \nFederal judges. Senator Leahy, past chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and currently the ranking Democrat on the committee, said \nthis:\n\n       If we want to vote against somebody, vote against them. I \n     respect that. State your reasons. I respect that. But don't \n     hold up a qualified judicial nominee. . . . I have stated \n     over and over again on this floor that I would . . . object \n     and fight against any filibuster on a judge, whether it is \n     somebody I opposed or supported, that I felt the Senate \n     should do its duty.\n\n  That is a clear and unequivocal statement in opposition to a \nfilibuster. He said that in 1998.\n  In 2000, Senator Leahy said:\n\n       I have said on the floor, although we are different \n     parties, I have agreed with Governor George Bush, who has \n     said that in the Senate a nominee ought to get a [floor] \n     vote, up or down, within 60 days.\n\n  Senator Biden, the past Judiciary chairman:\n\n       But I also respectfully suggest that everyone who is \n     nominated ought to have a shot, to have a hearing and to have \n     a shot to be heard on the floor and have a vote on the floor. \n     . . . It is totally appropriate for Republicans to reject \n     every single nominee if they want to. That is within their \n     right. But it is not, I will respectfully request, Madam \n     President, appropriate not to have hearings on them, not to \n     bring them to the floor, and not to allow them to have a \n     vote. . . .\n\n  Senator Feinstein:\n\n       A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them \n     down.\n\n  On and on that is mentioned. That has been our policy. Sure, some \nnominees have been held, but they usually have been forced up for \nvotes, and they have gotten their vote.\n  When President Clinton left office, there were only 41 judges who did \nnot get a vote. Only 41. There were 54 when President Bush left office, \nand it has been historic in this body at the end of a session when \nnominees come in and people are thinking there might be a new \nPresident, the process slows down. That has happened for good or ill \nprobably for the last century. That is within the realm of \nresponsibility. To openly filibuster a qualified nominee (early in a \nterm) is contrary to the traditions of this body and would set a \nprecedent that would be quite dangerous.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues not to go down this road. I urge my \ncolleagues to think seriously before they\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\nconsider a routine filibuster. Maybe if this nominee had ethical \nproblems or serious personal problems, that would justify a filibuster, \nbut not a nominee who is rated well-qualified by the bar, who has the \nsupport of virtually everyone with whom he has worked, who demonstrated \nby his testimony extraordinary skill and intelligence. I respect him. I \nbelieve he should be given a vote. I hope and believe that somehow we \nwill avoid this and we will get an up-or-down vote on him.\n  That is my request to my friends across the aisle, and it would be a \nmistake if that does not occur.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                         University of Michigan\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, George Washington was nearing the end of \nhis Presidency. He dreamed of a national university for the United \nStates to be located in Washington. This university was going to bring \ntogether all the different people of this great country into one \neducational setting to learn together, to learn from each other, to get \nto know each other, to overcome prejudices and intolerance.\n  President Washington actually planned to include his vision of such a \nuniversity in his now famous and historic Farewell Address. It was not \nincluded in that Farewell Address. Apparently, one of the people who \nwas working with him on that Farewell Address was Alexander Hamilton \nwho urged, as he was writing the address, drafting it:\n\n       The idea of the university is one of those which I think \n     will be most properly reserved for your speech at the opening \n     of the session. A general suggestion respecting education \n     will very fitly come into the address.\n\n  In other words, what Hamilton was saying is this vision of yours, Mr. \nPresident, about a national university, where people can come to shed \ntheir prejudices from various parts of the country, to live and work \nwith each other should be saved for a different address. Leave it out \nof the Farewell Address.\n  In fact, President Washington ended up leaving it out of his Farewell \nAddress, but he included it in a letter. It is a letter which has come \ndown through the generations, and that vision of a national university \nwas outwardly reflected in this letter.\n  He stated his belief that this country would be stronger if the \nchildren from different parts of the country could come together in an \neducational setting to learn from each other and about each other.\n  I want to read a few parts of this letter of George Washington \nbecause I think it has an application to the University of Michigan \ncase which is currently pending in the Supreme Court.\n  I come from the State of Michigan. I am proud of it, and I am proud \nof our university and its effort to promote diversity, and not just \nracial diversity, but geographic diversity, economic diversity, gender \ndiversity--diversity in general which has been promoted by not just the \nUniversity of Michigan but by most universities in this country, and it \nseems to me is to be encouraged.\n  What George Washington sensed 205 years ago was that a university had \na special ability to bring together different people to help them learn \nabout each other, drop their fears of each other and make us one \nNation.\n  This is what he wrote:\n\n       I have regretted that another subject (which in my \n     estimation is of interesting concern to the well-being of \n     this country) was not touched upon also: I mean Education \n     generally as one of the surest means of enlightening and \n     givg. just ways of thinkg to our Citizens, but particularly \n     the establishment of a University; where the Youth from all \n     parts of the United States might receive the polish of \n     Erudition in the Arts, Sciences and Belle Letters; and where \n     those who were disposed to run a political course, might not \n     only be instructed in the theory and the principles, but \n     (this Seminary--\n\n  Referring to the university--\n\n     being at the Seat of the General Government) where the \n     Legislature wd. be in Session half the year, and the \n     Interests and politics of the Nation of course would be \n     discussed, they would lay the surest foundation for the \n     practical part also.\n       But that which would render it of the highest importance, \n     in my opinion, is, that the Juvenal period of life, when \n     friendships are formed, and habits established that will \n     stick by one; the youth . . . from different parts of the \n     United States would be assembled together, and would by \n     degrees discover there was not that cause for those \n     jealousies and prejudices which one part of the Union had \n     imbibed against another part; of course, sentiments of more \n     liberality in the general policy of the Country would result \n     from it. What, but the mixing of people from different parts \n     of the United States during the War rubbed off these \n     impressions? A century in the ordinary discourse, would not \n     have accomplished what the Seven years association in Arms \n     did; but that ceasing, prejudices are beginning to revive \n     again, and never will be eradicated so effectually by any \n     other means as the intimate intercourse of characters in \n     early life, who, in all probability, will be at the head of \n     the councils of this country in a more advanced stage of it.\n\n  He went on:\n\n       To shew that this is no new idea of mine, I may appeal to \n     my early communications to Congress; and to prove how \n     seriously I have reflected on it since, and how well disposed \n     I have been, and still am, to contribute my aid towards \n     carrying the measure into effect, I enclose you the extract \n     of a letter from me to the Governor of Virginia on this \n     Subject, and a copy of the resolves of the Legislature of \n     that State in consequence thereof.\n       I have not the smallest doubt that this donation (when the \n     Navigation is in complete operation, which it certainly will \n     be in less than two years), will amount to twelve or 1500 \n     pounds Sterlg a year, and become a rapidly increasing fund. \n     The Proprietors of the Federal City have talked of doing \n     something handsome towards it likewise; and if Congress would \n     appropriate some of the Western lands to the same uses, funds \n     sufficient, and of the most permanent and increasing sort \n     might be so established as to envite the ablest Professors . \n     . . to conduct. . . .\n\n  President Washington saw that the two strongest ways to unite a \ncountry are when people go to war together against the common enemy and \nwhen they go to school together with a common goal, to learn. While we \nwould all like to avoid the need to fight together, we all know we can \nstrengthen our ties to democracy and to our country when we learn \ntogether about the world and each other.\n  Learning together allows us to strip away the prejudices that would \notherwise keep us apart. The hope of George Washington was later joined \nby the dream of Martin Luther King and by the promise and the potential \nof Brown v. Board of Education a half century ago, and they are now \nhanging in the balance because of the issues that are raised in the \nUniversity of Michigan affirmative action cases before the Supreme \nCourt.\n  In April, the U.S. Supreme Court is going to hear two oral arguments \nin two separate lawsuits challenging the University of Michigan's \ndiversity admissions policy. The Court's decision in these cases will \nresult in the most far-reaching affirmative action ruling since the \nBakke decision in 1978. The Court will decide the critical issue of \nwhether Bakke still remains the law of the land and whether racial or \nethnic diversity has a value at a university which can be considered in \nadmissions of higher education.\n  In the Bakke decision, the Court ruled against rigid quotas or set-\nasides based on race but found that higher education could consider \nrace or ethnicity as a factor in a properly considered competitive \nadmissions process to achieve the educational benefits of diversity.\n  If the Court overturns Bakke, it could outlaw any consideration of \nrace or ethnicity in admissions to colleges and universities.\n  There is a national security factor to this issue as well. There are \ngoing to be a number of military officers and people connected with \nnational security and defense who will be filing an amicus brief in \nsupport of the University of Michigan because universities run ROTC \nprograms. Those programs, where there is diversity at the universities \nthat have them, produce officers for the military, who in turn are \ndiverse and reflect our population. The failure to have officers who \nreflect our population in terms of race and ethnicity and gender, the \nfailure to have diversity in our officer corps, led to huge problems of \nmorale in the military for decades, until just about 20 years ago when \nwe reached out and made great efforts to have diversity in our officer \ncorps. That is going to be a part of the issue in an amicus brief filed \nin the University of Michigan case.\n  I am not going to spend a lot of time on that aspect, but I do want \nto at least comment on the fact that a significant number of very \nsignificant military officers, retired officers, who have been \nconnected at the highest levels with our Nation's military and its \nschools, are going to be filing a brief\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\nwith the Supreme Court relative to this issue.\n  I want to comment on the more fundamental issue, which is the value \nof diversity in a university and whether it is conceivable in this \ncountry that we will say to universities that they can give additional \npoints for geography, which many universities do, including the \nUniversity of Michigan. In other words, they can reach out to students \nin different parts of their State who have been underrepresented and \ntry to get better representation from those underrepresented parts. \nThey can give additional points for that. They can give additional \npoints for gender. If the law school has not had women students, they \ncan give additional points for that in order to overcome the problems \nwhich were created when women were discriminated against. They can have \nan affirmative action program for that. They can give additional points \nto alumni, kids--and they all do--and athletes--and they all do--and \nthe children of public officials--and many of them do.\n\n  Geography alone, which George Washington talked about--I went to a \ncollege out east which I know for a fact reached out geographically in \nthis country to try to have good representation from various parts of \nthe country. I come from the Midwest. My SAT scores were not as high as \nsome of the kids' in the East, but the college I went to decided it was \nimportant to those kids from the East that they have kids from the \nMidwest, kids from the Far West, kids from the South, kids from the \nSouthwest, kids from Alaska, kids from Hawaii, kids from Africa--it is \nimportant to the education of our students that they go to school with \na diverse group of students. So they gave out geographic points. I got \npoints. I do not think I would have gotten into my college, my beloved \ncollege, Swarthmore, but for the fact that I came from the Midwest and \nI was given some additional points. I do not know for sure, but that is \nmy belief, and that is the likelihood, I have no doubt. I know they \nhave geographical affirmative action. Is it conceivable that points can \nbe given for everything but race to achieve diversity, that race is \nsingled out as the one area where we cannot reach out to achieve \ndiversity in our universities? Is it possible that is what we are going \nto come to in this country, that the equal protection clause will be \nturned right on its head? The 14th amendment, which was designed, at \nleast in significant measure, to end the scourge of the remnants of \nslavery, is going to be used to prevent diversity from being achieved \nin one area where it is most important that we have a diverse \nuniversity, and that is the area of race. It is the one area where we \nhave had the most difficulty in overcoming the kind of prejudices and \nobstacles President Washington talked about and for which he said a \nuniversity was the most suited, other than going to war together.\n  Our military has done a spectacular job in terms of diversity. It has \nbeen a huge factor in the promotion of democracy in this country. \nHopefully, we do not have to go to war to promote coming together and \nlearning to overcome prejudices and differences. Hopefully, our \nuniversities can be allowed to reach out, as they are with geography, \nto overcome the fact that some parts of our States are totally \nunderrepresented in our educational institutions, to say, yes, we are \ngoing to reach out to that part of the State and we are going to try to \nget more students from there; they may not have done quite as well on \ntheir SATs, because of various historic factors or whatever, but they \nare highly qualified students, so we are going to give some additional \npoints to those students. But not race? Race would be singled out for \nnot being permitted to be given additional consideration to achieve \ndiversity which is so valuable in education? That would be an \nunthinkable, unconscionable result, and a distortion of the very \npurpose of the equal protection clause.\n  Of all the areas where we have the most hurdles to overcome, most \nbarriers to overcome, more attitudes to overcome, more prejudices to \novercome, with all the progress we have made--and we have made a lot--\nwe have a long way to go in the area of race. The idea that somehow or \nanother all that other diversity, all those other additional points can \nbe given--alumni kids, you can get 10 points; athletes, you can be \ngiven 20 points; gender, you can be given points; economic, you can be \ngiven points--but not race, that would be, it seems to me, singling out \nrace for discriminatory treatment when it comes to promoting diversity \nat a university.\n\n  The law school's current policies have been upheld by the Sixth \nCircuit as being consistent with Bakke. The Sixth Circuit has \nexplicitly rejected the plaintiff's contention that the system used by \nthe University of Michigan was the functional equivalent of a quota. \nThe Sixth Circuit found that the law school's admissions program is \n``virtually indistinguishable'' from the Harvard man, which Justice \nPowell held out in the Bakke decision as the appropriate model.\n  In the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions program, 110 \npoints out of 150 are given for academic factors, including grades, \ntest scores, and curriculum. The greatest weight, up to 80 points, goes \nto high school grade point average. Applicants can earn up to 12 points \nfor SAT or ACT scores, up to 10 points for attending a competitive high \nschool, 8 points for taking the most challenging curriculum, and 3 \npoints for SAT quality. Other factors can be considered, including \ngeography, athletics, relationship to alumnus, economic disadvantage. \nPoints can be added for students from various parts of the State which \nhave been underrepresented at the university. Students who have \nathletic scholarships get additional points, children of alumni get \nadditional points, students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds \nget additional points. And at the University of Michigan, students from \nan underrepresented racial or ethnic minority or attending a high \nschool serving a predominantly minority population can receive \nadditional points. And the provost can award additional points to \napplicants at his or her discretion.\n\n  The idea it is all right for colleges and universities to give \nspecial consideration to all the other groups--children of alumni, \nlarge donors' children--how is that one? It is OK to give special \nconsideration to the children of large donors for whatever university \npurpose that serves--but it is not OK to give additional points to \nunderrepresented minorities for the obvious university purpose that \nserves, which is a diverse student population, which our first \nPresident, the Father of our Country, pointed out in this letter is \nabsolutely essential if this country is going to be one, if this \ncountry is going to be unified.\n  Indeed, he saw that 200-plus years ago. I hope the Supreme Court will \nhave the wisdom of reading that letter and seeing how important it is \nthat President Washington's dream to bring people from different parts \nof the country, that people of different backgrounds, which is the \nUniversity of Michigan program, can, in fact, be realized. That is what \nsome of the stakes are in the University of Michigan case.\n  Since we are talking judicial matters this evening, I wanted to raise \nthat issue, as well.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is the Senator going to another subject for long?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It will be lengthy.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to speak on the Estrada nomination.\n  Mr. LEVIN. You can talk for quite some time on that. You have talked \nlonger, I believe, than I have on this evening.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Not as long as some of the other Members over there.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me try to limit this to about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n\n\n                           National Security\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will keep the floor and try to keep this down to 10 \nminutes.\n  Earlier today we had a hearing in the Armed Services Committee where \nwe received testimony from the intelligence community on worldwide \nthreats to our national security. I gave an opening statement at that \nhearing, parts of which I want to share with the Senate tonight because \nof the importance of the subject of Iraq. We have a lot of work ahead \nof us. We have threats of all kinds, threats which are more immediate, \nmore personal, more imminent, than Iraq, particularly the al-Qaida \nterrorist network, even though that network has been weakened, it has \nbeen deprived of its safe haven in Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n\n  It has, just over the last few months, attacked innocent civilians in \nBali and Tunisia and has attacked United States service members and \ncivilians in Kuwait and Jordan.\n  Last month, the United States and coalition forces fought the biggest \nbattle in Afghanistan since Operation Anaconda last spring. Even though \nour intelligence and our law enforcement agencies are working with \nallied countries to thwart further attacks in the United States and \nabroad, the fact is we remain highly vulnerable to al-Qaida, to other \nterrorist groups. As a matter of fact, the United States is at alert \norange now--that is the second highest level of alert in our military \nforces--and also at heightened force protection levels worldwide. We \nremain vulnerable. We remain vulnerable not just to conventional \nexplosives but now, we believe, more and more vulnerable to weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Earlier this week, Federal officials even suggested the public should \nmake preparations for a terrorist attack involving chemical, \nbiological, or radiological weapons. While we are placing such a huge \nfocus on Iraq, North Korea, a country that possesses weapons of mass \ndestruction and has ejected the international nuclear inspectors, has \ndeclared it is resuming operation of its plutonium-related nuclear \nfacility.\n  North Korea is not just a country which proclaims it is engaged in a \nnuclear program as it now has with the enriched uranium program. North \nKorea is probably the world's worst proliferator of ballistic missile \nand missile technology. It is on the brink of becoming an undisputed \nnuclear power. The administration has refused to open a direct dialog \nwith North Korea. That has serious ramifications. Our ally which lives \nnext to North Korea, which surely has got at least as much at stake as \nwe do in the whole matter--and, I think, obviously a lot more since \nthey are the ones nearest the threat--our ally, South Korea, wants us \nto open a direct dialog with North Korea. They have openly expressed \nthe wish that this country have a direct dialog of the highest levels \nwith North Korea.\n  The administration has decided not to do that, and all of a sudden, \nwhat is obviously a crisis to most of us and most of the world, is not \neven described as a crisis by the administration. Even though the \nfailure to have contact, the linking it to the axis of evil and the \nannouncement we will have a preemptive policy using military force, \ncould lead to additional provocative and irreversible action on their \npart because it is stoking the paranoia which exists in North Korea.\n  On top of that, Iran has admitted now it is mining uranium. That \nsurely must underscore our concern that its nuclear energy program is \nintended for nuclear weapons, not just for the promotion of nuclear \nenergy. Iraq is the focus and Iraq continues to flout the international \ncommunity. It is not assisting U.S. weapons inspectors to find or \naccount for chemical or biological weapons programs. Disagreement on \nhow to address the Iraqi threat has divided the U.N. Security Council.\n  Surely there can be little doubt Osama bin Laden would like to see \nthe United States and Britain attack Iraq without the authority of the \nworld community acting through the United Nations. Keeping the world \ncommunity together through the U.N. Security Council is exactly what \nOsama bin Laden does not want to see. He does not want to see a United \nNations. He wants to be able to say it is the United States, it is \nBritain, and it is a few of their personal, close allies. It is not the \nworld that is going after Iraq, it is the United States and Britain \nthat are doing it. He does not want, it is obvious, the world community \nto be united against the Iraqi threat. He wants to be able, as does \nIraq, to characterize the effort as an American/British-led unilateral, \nnot having U.N. authority type of effort.\n  All of us want Saddam Hussein to be disarmed. The best way to \naccomplish the goal of disarming Saddam Hussein without war is if the \nUnited Nations speaks with one voice relative to Iraq. I want to repeat \nthat, as I think there is so much concern about the possibility of war \nwith Iraq that that particular point is frequently lost.\n  The best way to accomplish the goal of disarming Saddam Hussein \nwithout war is if the United Nations speaks with one voice relative to \nIraq.\n  But if military force is going to be used, the best way of reducing \nthe short-term risks, including risks to the U.S. coalition forces, and \nthe long-term risks, including the risk of terrorist attacks on our \ninterests throughout the world, is if the United Nations specifically \nauthorizes the use of military force. That is the bottom line. The best \nway of increasing any chance for disarming Hussein without war, and of \nminimizing casualties in future attacks on the United States if war \ndoes ensue is if the United Nations acts relative to Iraq.\n  The next point, though, is essential as well. Supporting U.N. \ninspections is an absolutely essential step if we are going to keep the \nSecurity Council together. We are not going to have a chance of keeping \nthe United Nations Security Council speaking with one voice unless we \nsupport United Nations inspections, which are and have been such an \nimportant part of the Security Council's position.\n  How do we support those U.N. inspections? First, by sharing the \nbalance of the information that we have about suspect sites; No. 2, by \nquickly getting U-2 aircraft in the air over Iraq, with or without \nSaddam Hussein's approval, and by giving the inspectors the time they \nneed to do their work as long as the inspections are unimpeded.\n  I disagree with those, including high officials in our government, \nwho say that U.N. inspections are useless. We heard before the \ninspections began from the highest level of this government that \ninspections were useless. We heard it from Dr. Rice at the White House \nlast week. She said specifically that inspections are doomed to \nfailure.\n  I am also astounded that some of our highest officials have gone so \nfar as to refer in a derogatory way to the ``so-called'' U.N. \ninspectors. If these inspectors and inspections are useless without \nIraqi assistance in pointing out where they have hidden or destroyed \nweapons of mass destruction, why are we sharing any intelligence at all \nwith the inspectors; and why are we apparently finally implementing U-2 \nflights to support the inspectors?\n  It is one thing to be realistic about the limitations of the U.N. \ninspections and not have too high hopes about what they can produce. It \nis another thing to denigrate their value or prejudge their value or to \nbe dismissive and disdainful about the beliefs of others on the U.N. \nSecurity Council about their value, or to be cavalier about the facts \nrelative to those inspections.\n  Referring to being cavalier about facts brings me to another point \nwhich has to do with the sharing of intelligence information in our \npossession with the U.N. inspectors. I have followed this issue very \nclosely. I have asked the CIA for months to give us the precise \ninformation as to how many suspect sites there are, how many of those \nsuspect sites are of great significance, for how many of the \nsignificant sites have we shared information that we have with the \nUnited Nations inspectors. They have given me the information in \nwriting but, as it turns out, it is erroneous.\n  We just began sharing specific information in early January, \naccording to Secretary Powell, who is quoted in the Washington Post on \nJanuary 9. I can't go into those classified details in the open. I \ncan't give the precise numbers, how many suspect sites we have \ninformation on, how many of those suspect sites that we have \ninformation on are of significance, and how many of those have we \nshared with the United Nations. The numbers themselves are classified.\n\n  I can say in an unclassified setting, in public, that as of a couple \nof weeks ago we had shared information on only a small percentage, a \nfraction of the suspect sites in Iraq, and we had not shared \ninformation on the majority of the suspect sites. That was confirmed by \nCIA staff.\n  Yet when I asked the Director of the CIA yesterday about this \nsubject, he told us that we have now shared with the U.N. inspectors \ninformation about every site where we have credible evidence--all of a \nsudden, going from a fraction of the sites to we have now shared all \nthe sites.\n  Then last night, in Director Tenet's presence and in the presence of \nSenator Warner, his staff acknowledged that as a matter of fact we \nstill have useful information that we have not shared\n\n[[Page S2305]]\n\nwith the inspectors--which is the opposite of what Director Tenet told \nthe Intelligence Committee yesterday in open session. If we have not \nyet shared all the useful information that we have with the U.N. \ninspectors, that would run counter to the administration's position \nthat the time for inspections is over.\n  The same type of issue exists relative to the U-2s. The inspectors \nhave asked for U-2 surveillance planes. These are planes which have a \ncapability of tracking those suspicious vehicles on the ground that \nhave been referred to by Secretary Powell in his speech, tracking the \nvehicles that are at a suspicious site and going to another site. They \nhave the advantage of being able to loiter. Unlike a satellite, a U-2 \ncan loiter and actually keep track of a vehicle as it moves from one \nsuspicious place to another and can connect that information to \ninspectors in real time. They are intensely valuable to the inspectors. \nThey have asked over and over again for the U-2 flights. Why haven't \nthey been provided to the inspectors?\n  Well, because Saddam Hussein says he can't guarantee the safety of \nthe pilots. So instead of going to the U.N. and saying: Resolution \nwhatever the number is, the United Nations authorizes these U-2 flights \nand if Saddam Hussein interferes with these flights that will be \nconsidered an act of war against the United Nations--instead of doing \nthat, to give the inspectors this additional capability, at least until \nyesterday or perhaps today, Saddam Hussein has been given a veto by the \nU.N.--including us; we are part of the U.N.--over the use of \nsurveillance planes, which would contribute to the likelihood that \ninspectors would catch him with the goods.\n  I hope that is over now. I don't know for sure that it is. I hope now \nthere is an arrangement made to use the U-2 flights. But if we believe \nit is important, short term and long term, to both avoiding war, and if \nwar comes, to reducing its risks, that we have a United Nations that is \nunited, speaking with one voice against Iraq, we then must deal with \nthe United Nations' key request that we have an inspection process \nwhich is complete and robust. And we must lead at the United Nations to \nhelp make it robust. And that includes the use of the U-2 planes.\n  We have made the suggestion, Senator Clinton and myself, in a letter \nwhich we sent to Secretary Powell, that that kind of resolution be \nintroduced at the United Nations which would provide that the U-2 \nplanes be authorized by the United Nations, have the United Nations \nflag, and, if interfered with by Saddam Hussein, that would be \nconsidered an act of war against the United Nations and every member \nwould then be authorized to use military force in response.\n  When President Bush addressed the United Nations General Assembly on \nSeptember 12 of last year, he said that:\n\n       We want the United Nations to be effective, and respectful, \n     and successful.\n\n  We have some responsibility to help the United Nations achieve that. \nSaying to other countries, including allies, that if you don't see it \nour way you must have some ulterior motive, doesn't help us in leading \nthe United Nations to a united front against Saddam Hussein. While a \nnumber of heads of State and Governments have called for the United \nNations Security Council to take appropriate action, necessary action \nin response to the threat, and others have pledged to contribute \nmilitary forces to that effect, others believe we should give \nstrengthened inspections the time that they need to finish their \njob. But all of the groups agree on the necessity of disarming Iraq.\n\n  Rather than following a course that divides the United Nations and \nseparates us from some of our closest allies, we should fairly consider \ncourses of action that unite the world community against Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania be allowed 6 minutes without my \nlosing the right to the floor and that I immediately be recognized \nthereafter.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the current procedures with respect to the selection of judges, \nand what is happening in the Senate today is a constitutional \nrevolution.\n  The Constitution provides that the Senate will give advice and \nconsent to the President. And the tradition of this country for 215 \nyears has been that the President makes selections as he chooses, and \nadvice can come from the Senate. Consent has been given without \nchallenging the President to a partnership arrangement where the Senate \nhas to consent to the nominee before the President can submit the \nnominee to the Senate with any chance for confirmation.\n  What the Democrats are doing here today is really seeking a \nconstitutional revolution. What they want as the minority party in the \nSenate is a full partnership with the President on selecting Federal \njudges.\n  What we are doing with Miguel Estrada, and other nominees who are \ncoming up for an executive session tomorrow, is really a prelude to the \nnomination of the next Justice for the Supreme Court. The effort is \nbeing made by the Democrats to have their acceptable ideology without \nthe traditional deference which has been paid to the President.\n  The Senate has been maneuvered into a position here, an institution \nwith lines being drawn in the sand, and Republicans on one side and \nDemocrats on the other being backed into a corner--sort of a macho-\nmacho game where no one wants to play the chicken game. What we are \nreally seeing is gridlocking this institution on a permanent basis, if \nno one yields.\n  The Judiciary Committee has three nominees on the Executive Calendar \ntomorrow, and the Democrats have served notice that they are going \nfilibuster. If at least one Democrat does not vote to end the \nfilibuster, nothing will happen there.\n  So we have a long litany of judges--some of whom have been held up \nfor 2 years--and nothing is going to happen.\n  What we may be seeing here is the foundation laid for a grand \npolitical argument in the Presidential election of 2004. We are laying \nit right on the line. If the American people want judges confirmed, \nthere are going to have to be 60 votes in the President's party.\n  Both sides have been at fault in the past, in my opinion. When \nPresident Clinton was in the White House and the Republicans controlled \nthe Senate, we wouldn't confirm people. There were some breakthroughs \nbut relatively few. When President Bush submitted nominees for 2 years, \nor a year and 7 months, the Democrats stopped the nomination process.\n  It is high time we had a protocol which both sides respected wherein \nso many days after a nomination, there is a hearing, so many days \nlater, a vote in committee, and so many days later, a vote on the full \nfloor.\n  But we are really heading for extraordinary deadly deadlock in this \nbody. I think we ought to recognize it for what it is. There is a \nconstitutional revolution underway here to change the fundamental way \njudges are selected.\n  If the Democrats insist on a full partnership with the President, if \nany party insists on a full partnership with the President of the \nopposite party, then it is going to take 60 votes. And we may be \nsetting the stage for 60 votes in the 2004 election.\n  But it is my hope that cooler heads can prevail and we can sit down \nand work this out so that when the shoe is on the other foot, we don't \nhave this kind of gridlock and this effort to really upset longstanding \nconstitutional principles.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/12/senate-section/article/S2306-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2003\n\n  Mr. TALENT.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                              (Continued)\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, here we are in the middle of an \nunprecedented filibuster against the first Hispanic nominee to the \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia--against a man \nwho has a unanimously well-qualified rating by the ABA, which was the \ngold standard of the Democrats and something that a lot of confirmed \njudges did not have; a man who has all the credentials in the world--\nmagna cum laude from Columbia, magna cum laude from the Harvard School \nof Law, editor in chief of the Law Review, clerked for two Federal \njudges, one on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals put on the bench by \nPresident Carter, a Democrat, and, the other, Supreme Court Justice \nAnthony Kennedy--lots of experience, worked in the Solicitor General's \nOffice.\n  We have heard a lot of arguments, and many respected arguments. We \nhave heard that Mr. Estrada has not answered the questions of Senators \non that side. Well, he has. He spent a full day when they conducted the \nhearings. They set the agenda. They asked any questions they wanted to \nask. They were in control. They have even said on the floor during this \ndebate that the hearings were conducted fairly by them.\n  Then, when the election was lost, all of a sudden they now want to \nask more questions. And, by the way, they had an opportunity to ask any \nwritten questions after the full hearing. Only two Senators asked \nwritten questions--Senator Durbin from Illinois and Senator Kennedy \nfrom Massachusetts. He answered those questions.\n  The problem here is that he didn't answer the questions the way they \nwanted him to. He answered them the way he should have. We put those \nquestions and those answers into the Record today.\n  It is unfair, after what this man has gone through--after all the \nhearings, all the questions, all the time that has elapsed--almost 2 \nyears--that this highly qualified individual is now being filibustered \non the floor of the Senate.\n  If the Democrat Members of the Senate do not like his answers, then \nthey have a remedy; that is, vote against Miguel Estrada. I can live \nwith that. That is their right. If that is what they want to do, that \nis a proper exercise of their constitutional duty.\n  But really understand that to constitutionally modify the advice and \nconsent process of the Constitution and now require 60 votes in order \nto have a Presidential nominee confirmed by the Senate is \nunprecedented, except in one case, and that was Judge Fortas. President \nNixon himself fought against that and argued against that. But it was a \nbipartisan filibuster, if you have to characterize it.\n  To simply deny the Senate a vote is unfair. It is unfair to the \nSenate, it is unfair to the President, it is unfair to the process, and \nit certainly is unfair to this Hispanic American, who, by the way, has \nrisen to be one of the best appellate lawyers in the country even \nthough he has the speech impediment disability. Think of it. He has a \nspeech impediment, and yet he has argued 15 cases before the U.S. \nSupreme Court, winning 10 of them. I can't name many candidates for \njudicial office in my 27 years in the Senate who had even come close to \nthat record.\n  I think this is an abuse of the process. It is an abuse of what has \nreally been precedent through all of these years. It is an abuse by the \nminority. It is nothing more than what some would call the tyranny of \nthe minority against the first Hispanic nominee in the history of this \ncountry to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield for a question without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, one of the issues I have heard raised by \nthe other side is that the nominee has not had judicial experience. In \nfact, the chairman of the House Democratic Hispanic Caucus wrote a \nletter to the Judiciary Committee, I understand.\n  I want to quote from Congressman Bob Menendez, who says:\n\n       If the Senator--\n\n  Referring to Senator Hatch--\n\n       chooses to ignore one of the many reasons we oppose the \n     Estrada nomination, simply put, he has no judicial \n     expedience.\n\n  Now, I find this to be a particularly amazing argument coming from \nsomeone who is Hispanic, given the paucity of Hispanics on the bench \nright now, that we are setting this bar before a group that only has \nabout 3-percent representation on the bench right now but comprises 14 \npercent of the population of this country, that someone who heads the \nDemocratic Hispanic Caucus will put this bar to Hispanic nominees, that \nthey do not have judicial experience.\n  Has such a bar ever been placed before that you are aware of for \nnominees?\n  Mr. HATCH. First, let's understand the Democratic Hispanic Caucus. \nThey did not allow the Republican Hispanics, the three of them in the \nHouse of Representatives, to become part of that. So it is clearly a \nvery partisan group. We have a couple of our colleagues in the Chamber \nfrom the House of Representatives watching this very carefully, people \nwho have spoken out for the Hispanic community.\n  Secondly, by saying that he does not have any judicial experience, \ntherefore, he doesn't qualify to be on the Federal\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\nbench, what does that say to every member of the Hispanic Bar \nAssociation, none of whom, really, except current judges, have any \njudicial experience in the sense of having been judges. It means he is \nsaying they cannot be judges either.\n  What kind of a representative of the Hispanic community would make \nthat kind of a statement, if he really wants to help the Hispanic \ncommunity? Or is that representative just making partisan remarks, \nwhich is what I believe he was doing?\n  The fact is, we have confirmed 26 Clinton judges who have not had \njudicial experience--26. That is the phoniest argument I have heard \nyet, and it is a disgrace to argue it in the sense that Hispanics \ncannot serve on the judiciary if they have not had judicial experience.\n  Now, let's think of one other thing. Miguel Estrada was a law clerk \nto Amalya Kearse, a Carter appointee, on the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. That is judicial experience. He helped write some of the \nopinions that she made. He was a law clerk to Anthony Kennedy on the \nSupreme Court of the United States of America. That is a lot more than \na lot of others, than any of the 26 Clinton appointees had.\n  So to say that he has not had judicial expedience--but even if you do \nnot count that as judicial experience, this is a man with every \nqualification, and they have not laid a glove on him. It is really very \nunfair, and I think we ought to all stop and think about that.\n  But I would also like to point out--I do not mean to take too long on \nthis question, but I also would like to point out 108 men and women \nhave served on the Supreme Court, and of the 108, 43 had no judicial \nexperience at all. In the Court's history, 8 of the 16 Chief Justices--\nmost recently, Chief Justice Earl Warren--had no prior judicial \nexperience when appointed to the Supreme Court. Of those Justices \nappointed in the last 50 years, Justices William Rehnquist, Lewis \nPowell, Jr., Abe Fortas, Arthur Goldberg, and Bryon White had no prior \njudicial experience when they were appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I know that is the phoniest argument I have heard yet.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could first yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If you would yield for a question, I had the pleasure \nof serving on the Judiciary Committee last session of Congress, \nalthough we didn't get a lot of judges on through and cleared, and we \nare trying to clear those now.\n  But Miguel Estrada was up last session of Congress. One of the \ncharges against him, by a number of people, was that he is an \nideologue, he is a right-wing ideologue.\n  I would ask the question: It is my understanding Mr. Estrada worked \nwith the Clinton administration for the Janet Reno Justice Department. \nAnd it would seem highly unlikely to me that a right-wing ideologue \nwould be hired to work for the Clinton Justice Department. But that is \nthe charge that is being brought against him; is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. The nominee, Miguel Estrada, worked for the Clinton \nadministration. He worked in the Solicitor General's Office of the \nJustice Department in the Clinton administration. And it is highly \nunlikely that he would have received the support of Seth Waxman and \nother prominent Democrats if he were a right-wing ideologue. In fact, \nSeth Waxman says he is not.\n  Now, Seth Waxman was a Democrat Solicitor General under Clinton. By \nthe way, the seven living former Solicitors General are backing Miguel \nEstrada, four of whom are Democrats: Seth Waxman, Drew Days, Walter \nDellinger, and Archibald Cox.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague for responding to the question. I \nfind it so odd that would be a charge brought against him. He worked \nfor the Clinton administration, the Janet Reno Justice Department.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object. I object to the statement. I \nobject. I object.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Regular order. Regular order. The Senator \nfrom Utah has the floor. Members asking questions will address the \nChair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. When the Senator was talking about judicial experience \nor legal experience, correct me if I am wrong, but didn't Miguel \nEstrada argue 15 cases before the Supreme Court? And doesn't that mean \nhe has a lot of experience, legal experience, and that he must be held \nin highest esteem to be able to argue 15 cases before the Supreme \nCourt?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is a good question. Miguel Estrada is a full partner in \none of the great law firms of the country, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, at \nhis young age. He has argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court, winning \n10 of them. That is a pretty good record. By the way, I mentioned he \ndid that suffering a disability.\n\n  This man has arisen above language barriers, immigration barriers, \neducational barriers, legal barriers, to attain to the position he has. \nHe has lived a Hispanic dream life. And here he is being held up on the \nfloor of the Senate--without one good reason.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Utah, didn't Mr. \nEstrada come to the United States without speaking any English when he \nwas a teenager?\n  Mr. HATCH. He came to the United States at age 17, if I recall it \ncorrectly. He had a very limited knowledge of English, taught himself \nEnglish, went on to Columbia University, graduating magna cum laude, \nand from there went on to Harvard University, where he also graduated \nmagna cum laude and also was editor in chief of the Harvard Law Review.\n  Yes, he overcame a lot of problems. As I say, that is in addition to \nhis disability that has not stopped him from reaching the heights of \nthe legal profession.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield further to the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is one incredible record. Is not Columbia University \na university in New York City? I believe the Senator from New York was \non the floor. In fact, it is one of the finest universities in the \nUnited States. And an extremely competitive person came over when he \nwas 17. He must have been admitted when he was 19 or 20. He \nmatriculated there, and graduated magna cum laude; is that correct? He \nmust be an extremely bright individual. And then he went on and \ngraduated from Harvard. And he was editor of the Harvard Law Review, \none of the finest law reviews in the country.\n  He must be an incredibly bright individual; is he not?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is absolutely correct. Miguel Estrada is a \nbrilliant individual.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for a further question, are \neither of those universities considered conservative schools?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would never want to characterize either as being liberal \nor conservative. But I think people who know can very easily \ncharacterize them.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. As a new member of your committee, I do not have the \npleasure of knowing Mr. Estrada as you do, but expanding on what the \nSenator from New Hampshire just said, I believe that Mr. Estrada has \nestablished himself in the legal profession in a very unqualified \nmanner, that he is just extremely qualified, is an excellent lawyer. \nAnd I wish you would give us the benefit of some of his legal work and \nhis legal background.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, keep in mind, Miguel Estrada is a partner in the \nvery prestigious law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. But he got there \nby clerking--to get a clerk's position in a Federal court is a very \nhigh honor. To be editor of the Law Review at Harvard is one of the \nhighest honors any law school can offer. But then he becomes a clerk to \nAmalya Kearse on the Second\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\nCircuit Court of Appeals, which is one of the great circuits in this \ncountry. She is a great judge. And then he later became a clerk to \nJustice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, and is still one of his \nbest friends and advisers, and vice versa. And, of course, he has \nbecome a partner in one of the great law firms in this society.\n  He has tried all kinds of cases, 15 before the Supreme Court, winning \n10.\n  When the ABA, which my friends on the other side have called the gold \nstandard, did their thorough investigation of Miguel Estrada, they came \nto the conclusion he is unanimously well qualified, the highest rating \nthe American Bar Association can give. That is in spite of all of the \nimpediments this young man has had coming up through the ranks from \nHonduras to this country to college to law school to these various \npositions. By the way, I didn't mention he worked in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office giving very effective opinions for both the first Bush \nadministration and the Clinton administration.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. If the Senator will continue to yield, is it not true \nhe did serve as a Solicitor General in the Clinton administration for \nseveral years, advising that administration the same as Republican \nadministrations?\n  Mr. HATCH. He did. He served as an assistant to the Solicitor General \nand came away with virtual raves for his work. Only one person has \ncriticized him, and we have more than made it clear that that criticism \nis blown away by that person's, Professor Paul Bender from Arizona \nState University, raving reviews of his work when he was actually \nthere. I think we would rely on those raving reviews rather than the \npolitical statement that was made later.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I have heard some on the floor try and imply that somehow \nMr. Estrada has a hot temper, a short fuse. First, I would have to say \nthat seems inconsistent with the many letters from those who know him. \nThat includes such people as his former colleagues in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office, Ron Klain and Seth Waxman, who all praised his \npersonal demeanor. But beyond that, is the Senator as troubled as I am \nby the use of these code words that perpetuate stereotypes about \nHispanics and makes you wonder if we are debating Ricky Ricardo or \nMiguel Estrada? I see high praise in a New York Post article that \ndescribes him as a great American success story.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Utah would respond to that question.\n  Mr. HATCH. If there is a greater success story, I would like to meet \nthe person. If you were to meet Miguel Estrada, you would say this is \ntruly a wonderful man and a great lawyer. Fourteen of his colleagues, I \nbelieve, at the Solicitor General's Office and throughout the \nGovernment, including Seth Waxman, who was Solicitor General in the \nClinton administration, and I might add Ron Klain, who worked on the \nJudiciary Committee, was Al Gore's most faithful legal advisor, went \neverywhere with Al Gore, totally devoted to him, have said he would \nmake a wonderful judge. He has the temperament and ability to do so.\n  Only one person has issued a negative opinion, and that was Professor \nPaul Bender. If you read the record--I don't want to go through it \nagain--I think that opinion should be totally discarded when you look \nat the facts.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. I wonder if the Senator from Utah could tell us about the \ninternal memoranda our colleagues on the other side are seeking. It is \nmy understanding Mr. Estrada wrote these memoranda when he served as \nAssistant Attorney General. It is also my understanding he has said he \nhas no problem with their release. But it is my further understanding \nthat every living Solicitor General, Republican and Democrat, has \nadvised against their release; is that correct?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. That is true. All seven living Solicitor Generals--four \nDemocrats, three Republicans--oppose this request. The Democrats are \nArchibald Cox, Seth Waxman, Drew Days, and Walter Dellinger. The \nRepublicans are Charles Fried, Robert Bork, and Ken Starr. I might add \nthat both the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal oppose the \ndemand for these memos.\n  There is good reason for that. When the Democrats requested the \nmemos, they requested his recommendations on appeals, his \nrecommendations on certiorari petitions, his recommendations on amicus \ncuriae briefs. Never in the history of the Justice Department have \nthose type of materials that are privileged, confidential work product \nmaterials been given to this branch of Government or any other branch.\n  The Democrats have said there are four or five cases where the \nDepartment of Justice materials have been given. They have scoured the \nJustice Department; the administration and the current Justice \nDepartment have scoured those records, and they have found in all but \nBob Bork there was no evidence anybody had given up those records to \nanybody here. If they have records, they must have been leaked by \nfriends of the Democrats in the administration. They were not provided \nby the Justice Department.\n  In the case of Bob Bork, they did give some special request \nmemoranda, because it was up to the Supreme Court, affecting the area \ninvolving his decisions with regard to Archibald Cox. Certainly not the \nrecommendations in writing, the confidential recommendations in writing \nof appeals, amicus curiae and certiorari petitions.\n  Mr. SMITH. A further question, Mr. President, isn't it true, though, \nhe has said he has no problem with their release?\n  Mr. HATCH. He has said that. But the Justice Department has \ntremendous problems. They not only consider it a matter of principle, \nthey consider it a matter of absolute principle.\n  Mr. SMITH. And they are not his to release?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. They are not his to release even if he \nwanted to.\n  Mr. SMITH. I believe the Washington Post and others have described \nthis.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object. This is not a time for making \nstatements.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let him ask the question.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senators will address the Chair and try to \nask a question of the Senator from Utah. The Senator from Oregon had \nhis question answered. He did not ask for a chance to have another \nquestion. The Senator from Utah may respond.\n  Mr. SMITH. If I could rephrase my question, hasn't the Washington \nPost opined this is out of bounds, not fair game, a fishing expedition?\n  Mr. HATCH. No question about it. It is a fishing expedition. And why \nis it? We received the last letter to produce these materials after \nthey had been refused, in eloquent, very deliberate and straightforward \nletters from the White House; we received the last request, I think, \nthe day before the hearing on Miguel Estrada. Frankly, it is clearly a \nfishing expedition, trying to find something because they don't have \nanything on this man. They just don't like the fact he is a \nconservative Republican Hispanic.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Utah \nif he will yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without yielding my right to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, colleagues, this nomination for this \nSenator is a personal matter, for the reason that I was privileged to--\n--\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for my friend from \nVirginia. He is making a statement, not asking questions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think we ought to give the----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah has the floor. The \nChair was trying to obtain a ruling from the Parliamentarian and did \nnot hear the question. Will the Senator from Virginia restate his \nquestion? The Senator from Utah, let the Senator from Virginia restate \nhis question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think he should be allowed to ask his question.\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I will phrase it as a question. I just wanted to lay a \npredicate, a foundation for the purpose of the question. I said this \nwas a personal matter. I assert that because I had the privilege of \nintroducing this distinguished nominee----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to the form of the statement by my \nfriend from Virginia. He has the right to ask a question. He has no \nright to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has a right to have a preamble \nto a question before he asks it. He has not asked a question. The \nSenator from Virginia will continue.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was about to say, I had the privilege of introducing \nhim and I did so for several reasons. One, I carefully examined the \ndistinguished dossier of this lawyer. But am I not correct this is a \nnomination to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia?\n  Mr. HATCH. You are correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was privileged to be a law clerk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will ask another question, \nplease.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, Mr. President. I shall pose it in the form of a \nquestion. I had the privilege of being a law clerk on the same circuit \ncourt of appeals many years ago. I ask my distinguished colleague, when \na United States Senator goes before the Judiciary Committee for the \npurpose of introducing a nominee, does not that Senator place his or \nher credibility before that committee in making those statements?\n  Mr. HATCH. As you know, Senator, you did that. We respect your \ncredibility. I think both sides respect your credibility, as we should. \nYou did make a very formal and important statement on behalf of Miguel \nEstrada.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senators cannot have a dialog on the \nfloor under the guise of asking questions.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am happy to yield for a question without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Utah, who has \nexperience with the entire judicial process. As one who has served as a \nlaw clerk, I ask is it not commonplace for law clerks, for assistants, \nto write memoranda that do not necessarily reflect their views, but are \ndesigned to explain the rulings made by the judge or other lawyer or \nsolicitor who may serve?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without question, that is so.\n  Mr. BOND. Is it the experience and knowledge of the distinguished \nchairman of the committee that the legal scholarship may be shown by \nthese rulings, by these drafts, but they do not in any way reflect, \nnecessarily, the views of the clerk or the assistant?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is correct once again.\n  Mr. BOND. Is it not true, then, that perhaps the best judge of the \nlegal capabilities of a law clerk, Assistant Solicitor General, or \nassistant attorney would be those for whom that clerk or assistant \nworked?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. And three Democrat Solicitors General \nreviewed these materials and had access to them, and they have nothing \nbut praise for the work of Mr. Estrada.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there is something very troubling that I \nwish to pursue and that is whether a nominee----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may not address a question to \nthe Chair.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will ask the question of the Senator from \nUtah, who happens to be in the line of sight of the Chair, both of whom \nI respect. I will focus the question to the Senator from Utah. Do you \nshare the concern that should a clerk, assistant counsel to a U.S. \nSenator, or perhaps a Member of the other body, be nominated for a \njudicial position, under this principle enunciated by our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle the nominee would have to turn over all of \nthe papers prepared for that Senator, or that House Member, or the \ncommittee for which that nominee may have worked?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I have to say that the Solicitor General's Office is \none of the most important offices in the country. This is the advocate \nfor our country. These opinions are extremely important. They want the \nbest opinion they can get from the people who serve there and write the \nopinions, as Miguel Estrada did. By necessity, they have to be \nconfidential and privileged because, otherwise, the Solicitor General's \nOffice would not function as well on behalf of the American citizens.\n  So in all honesty, if our friends on the other side were to prevail \nin forcing any administration, or if we would do so later because they \ndo so now, then that means no privileges will be respected in the \nexecutive branch of the Government. Now, if we start doing that, I have \nto ask you, where does it end? Does it end where the opinions our \nstaffs give us at our request have to be given up if they are \nnominated?\n  Mr. BOND. That is the question I am asking, the same principle. Would \nthe same principle apply, that someone who had served you or me as a \ncounsel, if nominated, would have to provide all of the memoranda, \ndrafts, and opinions prepared, or memoranda prepared for you or me, \nwere they to be nominated?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, let's just be honest about it. Considering a \nnomination for a judgeship like it is being done here would become just \na methodology for anybody. If you didn't get the papers you wanted from \nsome source or other in the Federal Government--and it might even \ninclude the Senate--then you can hold up judges just as they are doing \nhere. Look, that would----\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. Chairman, would you ever----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Missouri seek to \nhave the question answered?\n  Mr. BOND. I simply ask the question, as a Senator, would you ever \nconsent to have confidential memoranda prepared for you by a lawyer who \nhappened to be in your employ, who is subsequently nominated for a \njudicial position--would you ever consent to a wholesale turnover of \nall that work product prepared for you as a U.S. Senator?\n  Mr. HATCH. Put it this way. If one of my excellent staff people was \nnominated to a Federal judgeship and somebody tried to pull that one \nover on me, I would raise such cane that it would blow the lid off this \nbuilding, and I think anybody else would, too. You can imagine how the \nSolicitor General's Office must feel for this type of an inappropriate \nrequest for a confidential, privileged matter that they have to keep \nthat way if they want to not chill honest discourse within the \nSolicitor General's Office. This is absurd. That is what they are \npinning their hat on here.\n  Let me tell you, if that is what it comes down to, it is going to be \nhard to get any judge through that one or the other side has a \ndifference with in the slightest degree. There is no reason to disagree \nwith Mr. Estrada. I have not heard one legitimate, good reason--not one \nyet.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I have a preamble to my question. I heard \nmy colleague refer to the opposition to Miguel Estrada as imposing an \nintellectual glass ceiling for Hispanics who are not liberals. We hear \na lot about diversity on the courts. Yet some people seem intent on \nblocking this nominee for having a diversity of opinion as compared to \nwhat those on the left want. Don't you agree that an important kind of \ndiversity is the diversity of ideas, and isn't that exactly what the \nopponents of Mr. Estrada and his confirmation are trying to prevent--\ndiverse ideas from a Hispanic nominee?\n  Mr. HATCH. It certainly looks that way to me. One argument is that he \nis not Hispanic enough. That is ridiculous. Others have said he hasn't \nhad any judicial experience. I think we have more than blown that away. \nI don't think any reasonable person would make that argument. Yet I \nhave heard argument after argument that he doesn't have any judicial \nexperience.\n  I agree that some special interest groups, and others that have been \ncriticizing Mr. Estrada, think all minorities have to think alike. If \nyou are a minority, if you don't toe the liberal line, they don't want \nanything to do with you. That is the problem here.\n  I don't think my colleagues are against Mr. Estrada because he is \nHispanic. No, it is because he is a Hispanic\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\nRepublican, and they think conservative, who may not agree with some of \ntheir more liberal ideas.\n  It seems to me that this is fundamentally un-American. I don't think \nthere is anyplace in our system for this type of thinking. Miguel \nEstrada reached his views by examining all the facts and coming to his \nconclusions, and to suggest that he or anyone else has to arrive at a \ncertain political bent--and one only--is simply not fair. He is not \nbeing treated fairly here. I don't think anybody who watches this or \nlooks at it, or understands it would think he is being treated fairly. \nHe is just not.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Utah yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we opened the Senate a little over 12 hours \nago. At the outset, I mentioned that I hoped we would have the \nopportunity to have a good, robust discussion over the day, and that \nafter that discussion we would have an opportunity to vote up or down \non this outstanding, well-qualified nominee.\n  I am delighted, as I look around the Chamber, to see at practically \nevery Republican desk someone behind it ready to vote. The discussion \nhas been good today. It has been complete today. And as my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle mentioned this morning, everything, in \nessence, has been said about this well-qualified nominee. If that is \nthe case and we, indeed, have given sufficient time: It has been 5 \ndays, since last Wednesday; we have spent 5 days on this nominee \ntalking about his qualifications, which has been fascinating over the \ncourse of today. Each time I listened to one of our Senators, I learned \nsomething. Every time, I got more and more excited about this \nparticular nominee.\n  We have attempted to have the up-or-down vote, in fact, on three \nprevious occasions. We have had a unanimous consent request, and at \nthis juncture I will again try to reach an agreement with my Democratic \ncolleagues.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that there be an additional--an \nadditional--6 hours for debate on the Estrada nomination; provided, \nfurther, that the time be equally divided between the chairman and the \nranking member, or their designees, and that following the conclusion \nof that time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, for the reasons outlined \nsince last Wednesday by the minority, an objection is raised.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I therefore modify my request to ask that \nthe vote occur no later than Friday of this week.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as you can see, the Chamber, at least on \nthis side of the aisle, is full and ready to vote. Therefore, I modify \nthe request to ask that the vote occur no later than 1 week from this \nFriday, 7 days from now.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as has been outlined in detail on many \noccasions here, if the nominee is willing to submit his----\n  Mr. GREGG. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, because I think we have had adequate \ndebate, and discussion--Miguel Estrada is a well-qualified nominee, and \nthere is a shortage of judges in the United States of America, a \ncritical shortage--I modify my request to ask that the vote occur no \nlater than 2 weeks from this Friday.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have approved 103 judges----\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Regular order.\n  Mr. REID. Up to this point. I object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as you can see, there is no fairness in \nthis process. This is the first filibuster for a circuit court of \nappeals nominee in the history of this country. The majority leader has \nbeen very fair in granting extra time. The other side said they have \ndebated it long enough. We have always voted up or down at this \njuncture, and the minority is unfairly filibustering this nominee for \nthe first time in history, this Hispanic-American nominee who has \nclimbed every step of the way into the American dream. They are taking \nan attitude and a position that takes away from that American dream.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, will the Senator----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah has the floor. Who \nseeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator from Utah will yield \nfor a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask the Senator from Utah if it is true that right now \nthere is nothing to prevent us from taking a stand and voting up or \ndown on Miguel Estrada other than the obstructionist delays being \nperpetuated by the other side.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, that is absolutely \ntrue.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask, Mr. President, a further question. Is it not true \nthat on the DC Court of Appeals there are 12 judges allocated to that \ncourt?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Is it not true that there are four vacancies on that \ncourt, which, calculating, means a third are unfilled?\n  Mr. HATCH. This is correct.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Does the Senator believe justice is being delayed and, \nthus, denied on the DC Court of Appeals due to a third of this court \nbeing vacant?\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree, justice delayed is justice denied, and this is a \nvery important court. The problem is our friends on the other side just \ndo not want a conservative Hispanic appointed by a Republican President \non that court.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask, Mr. President, a further question, if the Senator \nwill yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. For a question.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Does the Senator from Utah recognize the people of America \nbelieve there are many important issues facing this country--terrorism, \nwar possibly in Iraq, moving forward with creating more jobs and \nimproving health care, education--and by the Democratic Party's \nobstruction here of actually voting one way or the other on Miguel \nEstrada, they are delaying this body from acting on these very \nimportant matters for security and job opportunities for Americans?\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree 100 percent with the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor, I will be happy to \nyield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Utah, how many \nvotes does it say in the Constitution are required to confirm a judge \nin the Senate?\n  Mr. HATCH. A simple majority. It says we have the power of advising \nand consenting. It does not say we have the power to advise and \nfilibuster or obstruct, which is what is going on here.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is my question. If the Constitution says 51 \nvotes,\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\nor a simple majority, I am asking if it would be an effort to go around \nthe Constitution to filibuster a Federal judge. Is it even really \nseemly to filibuster a Federal judge nominee when the Constitution is \nvery clear on this issue? Is it setting a new standard with Miguel \nEstrada that we are going to all of a sudden have the Constitution \naverted to start requiring 60 votes out of 100 to confirm a Federal \njudge, a nominee, which is the President's absolute right to make, his \nright and responsibility, and he has nominated these qualified judges?\n  Mr. HATCH. There is no question. I agree with the distinguished \nSenator from Texas. That is what is going on here, and they are \ndepriving this qualified Hispanic of his right to sit on this bench \nwithout any real justification. That is what bothers me. It is a double \nstandard. It is clearly a double standard, and it is a double standard \nthat is unseemly. I think the Senator put it exactly right.\n  Two of our Hispanic Republican colleagues in the House have come over \nhere to show their support for Mr. Estrada, Mr. Mario Diaz-Balart and \nMr. Devin Nunes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield, without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator the following question: \nIs it not true that Richard Paez, a Hispanic American, nominated to be \na U.S. Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit, at a time when the Senator \nfrom Utah was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, waited over \n1,500 days before that committee was forced to finally face a Senate \nrecord vote, a cloture vote on March 8, 2000, before his nomination was \napproved by the Senate?\n  Mr. HATCH. It was a disgrace.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry. I gave the wrong date on that. March 8, 2002.\n  Mr. HATCH. It was a disgrace that Judge Paez had to wait that long, \nbut Judge Paez had an up-or-down vote on this floor allowed by my \ncolleagues at my request. There was no formal filibuster at the time. \nNobody said there was going to be a filibuster. We know we have had \nsome cloture votes in the past, but they have been for votes of \nconvenience or the majority leader has called them for some reason or \nanother but not because there was a filibuster.\n  The important thing is--and, look, I think it is time for your side \nto understand it. The important thing is here was a judge that, yes, I \ndo not think was treated fairly, but in the end he had a vote. In the \nend he sits on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals even though our side, \nalmost to a person, in fact to a person, disagreed with that \nnomination. But we gave him a vote.\n  Let me tell you something--\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will address the Chair, not \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me address the Chair then in answering this question. \nMiguel Estrada, without one thing against him--and by the way, Judge \nPaez had plenty of things against him that indicated he was not only an \nactivist judge but ruled without regard to the law. There were some \nlegitimate concerns on our side, even though I believed he should have \na vote and he ultimately did, unlike Miguel Estrada.\n  Let me tell you something, I have not seen one legitimate, \nsubstantive reason to not give Miguel Estrada the same privilege that, \nyes, it took time to do and I had to fight it through and there were \nall kinds of problems; some were very justified problems----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is time to give Miguel Estrada the same privilege that \nwe gave to Judge Paez.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator be kind enough to explain that when he \nwas chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and this Hispanic \nnominee Richard Paez was held up for over 1,500 days before his \nnomination was brought to the floor, it was necessary to file a cloture \nmotion to close debate to bring his name for a vote before the Senate?\n  Mr. HATCH. It was not necessary. It was not necessary because I was \nfighting to have that happen and it did in fact happen, unlike what is \nhappening today.\n  Let me make a suggestion to my colleagues on the other side. I am \nwilling to have one cloture vote, but then let's vote up or down on \nEstrada. And if you win, I will live with that. If you can destroy this \nman's career so that he cannot be a Federal circuit court of appeals \njudge, I will live with that. You have a right to vote against him. But \nyou do not have a right to filibuster this man, nor should you. It is \nshameful. And it is shameful to put him through this without one \nsubstantive reason to do it other than a phony request for privileged \ndocuments that everybody knows is phony.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah has the floor. The \nSenator from Utah will please restrain from referring to another \nSenator by ``you.'' The Senator must be referred to as ``the Senator.''\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to abide by that, and I am happy to be \ncorrected by the Chair. I do get a little excited in this matter, and I \napologize to my colleagues on the other side, but I think what has gone \non does not deserve much consideration.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The current occupant of the Chair is no \nmodel of decorum, but I am trying to establish it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I figured that the Chair would understand.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. To the Senator from Utah, I have three questions regarding \nthe Paez nomination which he just referred to. The first is if the \nSenator from Utah could tell us which party was in control of this body \nand by whom the cloture petition was filed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I will be happy to. As I understand it, the \nDemocrats were in control, and they filed the cloture motion--we were \nin control? OK. We were in control and we filed the cloture motion. I \nam sorry. I am so tired I cannot think straight.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator, of course, makes the point. The cloture motion \nin the case of Judge Paez was filed by the party in control of this \nbody, by the distinguished majority leader of the Republican Party at \nthat time, Trent Lott.\n  I would also ask this question: Is it not true that the debate for \nRichard Paez lasted 1 day; that there was no filibuster of his \nnomination?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, that is correct, and I suspect that my colleague and \nfriend from Illinois would not vote for cloture for Mr. Estrada as I \ndid for Judge Paez--as we did for Judge Paez.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for one \nfinal question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield, without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KYL. With respect to the Paez nomination, is it not also true \nthat a majority of the Republicans supported the cloture motion vote so \nthat Judge Paez could get a vote but that many of those very same \nSenators then voted against him? Having given everyone in this body an \nopportunity to vote, they exercised their right to vote against him but \ndid not deny the right of all the other Senators to vote for him, and \nthat he was confirmed?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. I am glad the Senator reminded me of that \nmatter.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be delighted to yield without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator from Utah aware that earlier this evening we \nvoluntarily gave up the floor, as we knew that you and the majority \nleader wanted to come and make a statement?\n\n[[Page S2313]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Which we would have done for you.\n  Mr. REID. I guess the question I am asking is: Who is filibustering \nthis?\n  Mr. HATCH. I guarantee you it is not us. I guarantee you it is you, \nand if you deny it I would be happy to go to a vote right now.\n  Mr. REID. I was just wondering. This is taking quite a while.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let's go to a vote. If you are not filibustering, let's \nvote.\n  Mr. REID. Another question, if I could, Mr. President?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. REID. On what?\n  Mr. HATCH. On this nomination.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. It is debatable after that. So what difference does it \nmake?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. No, it is not debatable.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is a sufficient second.\n  This is ordering the yeas and nays on this nomination.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is improper to ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield, without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. He loses the right to the floor on the motion.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nNevada for a question, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. He lost the right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that both Democrats and Republicans \nhave sought cloture in response to debate or objections to judicial \nnominees since the cloture rule was extended in 1949? Is the Senator \naware of that?\n  Mr. HATCH. I did not hear the question.\n  Mr. REID. The question is, Are you aware that cloture votes on \njudicial nominees are well precedented in recent history?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not for true filibusters. I agree we have had cloture \nvotes but not for true filibusters. It has been because a majority \nleader wanted to have a cloture vote, not because we were not willing \nto vote on nominees on either side. Your side was willing to vote and \nwe were willing to vote and even when they had to go to cloture on \nPaez, the majority of Republicans voted for cloture, and then a number \nof Republicans voted against. But they did give him an up-or-down vote, \neven though there was widespread disagreement with Judge Paez.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator----\n  Mr. HATCH. I voted for him, by the way.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that based on cloture votes, there \nhave been----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is the Senator asking the Senator from \nUtah to yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I ask the Senator if he would yield for a further \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield for a question, without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. Based on cloture votes, are you aware that there have been \n17 filibusters on judicial nominees? Are you aware of that?\n  Mr. HATCH. No way. Nobody has ever called those a filibuster and \nthere has never been a true filibuster against a circuit court of \nappeals nominee until this one, and your side has announced that this \nis a filibuster. No one has ever agreed that those others were \nfilibusters. There were cloture votes, no question about it. But no \ncircuit nominee has ever been defeated by denying cloture, none; zero; \nnada.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be glad to yield, without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware and has acknowledged that there have \nbeen a number of occasions where cloture had to be invoked on numerous \njudges, not the least of which were Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon in \nrecent years?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me answer that question. There has never been a true \nfilibuster, until this one, against a circuit court of appeals nominee. \nIn recent years, both sides have used cloture on various occasions \nother than for filibuster purposes, but there has never ever been a \ntrue filibuster against a circuit court of appeals nominee until this \ntime. And whenever there has been a cloture vote, the nominee received \nhis or her vote up or down.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Which is not being given here and which is being denied \nhere by the minority.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one final question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I wish the Senator would explain to me what a filibuster \nis. What is a true filibuster?\n  Mr. HATCH. When there is an attempt to try and stop debate, when \nthere is an attempt to try to defeat a candidate. And in every case we \nhave had a vote up and down and the judge has been approved.\n  Mr. REID. But the Senator would acknowledge it took cloture to have \nthat occur?\n  Mr. HATCH. No. No, I would not.\n  Technically, yes, but not because there was a filibuster. And the \nSenator knows that.\n  In recent years we have used cloture motions for almost everything. \nBut the Senator is talking to the Senator from Utah who knows what a \nreal filibuster is, and there has never been a true filibuster until \ntoday, until this filibuster.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield to my colleague without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Utah, please explain \nwhy the difference in substance rather than form of what happened 2 \nyears ago, now almost 2\\1/2\\ years ago, in the year 2000. The Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing in May 2000 on the nomination of one Bonnie \nCampbell, former attorney general of the State of Iowa to be a justice \nfor the Eighth Circuit--and then, nothing.\n  Then the Republican leadership would not bring her name on the floor \nfor a vote. Seven times that fall I came to the floor, I say to the \nSenator, to ask that her name be brought up to vote, up or down or that \nat least she get a vote in committee. The Republican leadership would \nnot bring her name up for a vote. I ask the Senator from Utah, other \nthan form, what is the difference in substance between that and today?\n  Mr. HATCH. She was never brought to the floor. I acknowledge that. \nShe was not. She was 1 of 41 who were left hanging at the end of that \nadministration in contrast to the 54 left hanging when the Democrats \nlost the Presidency and a Republican was President. In other words, 13 \nless. And 9 of the 41 were put up so late there was no way anyone could \nget through, so we are down to 32. And with 32 we had other problems. \nWe can have all the statistics, but we ``bettered'' the Democrats in \nevery case.\n  She was not brought up so there was, naturally, no filibuster.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, would the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Would the Senator from Utah be so kind as to explain the \nABA rating system under which it is my understanding that Mr. Estrada \nreceived the highest possible rating? Would the Senator further explain \nwhether there was a split rating, or whether it was unanimous, and what \nthe general concession of those on the other side of the aisle has been \ntoward ABA ratings in the past?\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator for her very erudite question. Let me \nstart with the last part of that.\n  When the Democrats were in control of the Judiciary Committee and \nthey had a Democrat President, they said the ABA was the gold standard. \nI cannot remember when a nominee who had a ``unanimously well-\nqualified'' rating, the highest rating the American Bar Association \ngives, had any difficulty like this. They went through. It was that \nsimple. There is a double standard here against this Hispanic \ngentleman.\n  I have to admit I was not very pleased with the ABA during many of \nthe years when they made ratings that\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\nwere split all the time because of partisanship. They have cleaned that \nup. The ABA is doing a decent job and has done a pretty decent job in \nthe last 4 or 5 years.\n  What happens is when a President decides to nominate somebody, the \nABA then conducts its own investigation. They send top examiners--\nlawyers, if you will--into the area from where this individual nominee \nis nominated. They do a complete review with the top, most ethical, \nhighest rated lawyers in that area, and others, and then they come and \nmeet in what is called a standing committee and then they determine \nwhat kind of a rating to give. And the ratings, generally, are ``not \nqualified,'' ``qualified,'' or ``well-qualified.'' Sometimes those \nratings have a split rating where some will be well qualified in part \nand qualified in part. We have even seen some ratings, well-qualified \nand not qualified.\n  In this particular case with this Hispanic nominee, Miguel Estrada, \nhe received the highest possible unanimously qualified rating of the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  Just last year, two of the Senators--the Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy--called the ABA rating \nthe gold standard for reviewing judges. They were not the only ones. \nNow, all of a sudden, that standard does not seem to be good enough.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, would the Senator from Utah yield for \njust one more followup question on the ABA?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Is the Senator from Utah aware of any other case in \nwhich a judicial nominee received a highly qualified rating from the \nABA and was subject to a filibuster on the Senate floor?\n  Mr. HATCH. I can't think of one case. In fact, there has never been a \ntrue filibuster conducted. In the cases where they have raised the \nquestion of cloture votes, cloture votes are called for one reason or \nanother by majority leaders, but in each of those cases, as I recall, \nthe nominees had an up-and-down vote. I would be happy to go to a \ncloture vote with our friends on the other side if afterwards they \nallow an up-and-down vote regardless of what happens on the cloture \nvote--happy to do it.\n  They do not seem to be inclined to do that. They want to filibuster \nthe first Hispanic nominee to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, who has a ``unanimously well-qualified'' rating \nby the American Bar Association, their gold standard, and who has all \nof these other qualifications that lawyers only dream about. And he has \nfulfilled the American dream. He is being denied his opportunity to \nserve by a double standard here that is being applied by my colleagues \non the other side.\n  It is some Members. I know all of them cannot feel that way.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator from Utah for clarifying this issue \nfor the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Pursuing the same question, can the Senator ever recall a \nHispanic nominee suggested by President Clinton, when he was chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, Hispanic nominee for the Federal \njudiciary who received a well-qualified rating in which the Senator, \nthen-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, refused to even give \nthat nominee a hearing?\n  Mr. HATCH. Do you have anyone specifically you are referring to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Enrique Moreno.\n  Mr. HATCH. In the case of Enrique Moreno, there was no consultation, \na refusal to consult with home State Senators. That is basically \nsomething we do not allow in the Judiciary Committee. It is one of the \nreasons that we will use both sides--if there is not adequate \nconsultation, it is one of the reasons we will use to not bring a \nnominee up. And I think the distinguished Senator from Illinois should \nknow that. If you do not, be advised, that was the reason Enrique \nMoreno did not come up.\n  I even wrote a letter to the then-Chief Counsel of the White House. I \nthink it was Chuck Ruff at the time, bless his memory. I wrote a letter \nto him saying: You will not consult--they basically admitted that--and \nthey were going to bring this up regardless. It was not adequate or \ngood enough and no chairman, I think, would allow that nominee to come \nforward without consultation--it is just that simple--Democrat or \nRepublican.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator further yield for a question? If the \nSenator will further yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not want to bore the membership with another debate \nabout the blue slip policy which the Senator indicated is going to \nchange, but I want to make sure it is clear for the record in this \ncase, we had a Hispanic American nominated for the bench by President \nClinton, Enrique Moreno, who received a well-qualified rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association, and was refused a hearing before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee when you were chairman because the two Republican \nSenators from Texas refused to approve the nomination. How is that \ndifferent from a filibuster, for the fate of Enrique Moreno?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Will the Senator from Illinois \naddress in the third person, not directly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Chair is correct. I ask the Chair to address the \nSenator from Utah as to how it is any different to have Enrique Moreno, \nwith a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association, \nnominated to the Federal judiciary, refused a hearing before then-\nChairman Orrin Hatch, because two Republican Senators from Texas \nrefused to approve him, thus, frankly, giving him less consideration \nthan Miguel Estrada who is before us today.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't think that is accurate at all. The fact is there \nwas no consultation. I informed the counsel at the White House there \nwas no consultation, and we were not going to bring this nominee up \nwithout consultation with both home State Senators. And both home State \nSenators agreed with that. Frankly, I think any chairman would have \nhandled it exactly the same way. And it is not the same at all.\n  Miguel Estrada not only had a hearing, but he came through the \nprocess. It was a difficult process for him, but he came through it and \nthe Judiciary Committee approved the nomination of Miguel Estrada. \nMiguel Estrada is now on the floor, so it is completely different from \nthat situation. There was consultation in the case of Miguel Estrada. \nAnd, frankly, we are sitting here right now in a filibuster for the \nfirst time in history of a circuit court of appeals nominee, without \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to address a question to the \nSenator from Utah if he would yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Utah, first of all, if \nthe Senator is aware there are many nominees who, for one reason or \nanother, never got out of the Judiciary Committee? In other words, \nisn't it correct there are many nominees who, for a variety of reasons, \ndo not make it to the floor of the Senate? Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is correct, in both Democratic control of the \ncommittee and Republican control of the committee. There are many \nreasons. The reason may be because of failure to consult. It may be \nbecause of further investigations that have to be conducted. It may be \nfurther FBI investigations have to be conducted. It may be because of \nlack of time. It may be because of holds on the Senate floor, which \nhave been used by both sides through time.\n  But I can tell you this. There were less holdovers at the end of my \ntenure as chairman of the committee than there were in 1992, at the end \nof the Democrats' tenure when there was a Republican President.\n  Let me add one last thing to that, and that is none of us complained, \nto my knowledge, about Senator Biden as chairman when there were 54 \nholdovers and 97 vacancies. We had 41 holdovers, and nine of those were \nput up so late there was no way I could have gotten to them in the \nremaining few weeks we had. So there were really only 32 holdovers and \nthere were a number of those\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\nfor which there were justifiable reasons for not bringing them up.\n  Mr. KYL. Further on this line of inquiry, if I could ask the Senator \nfrom Utah to yield, other than the case of Justice Abe Fortas, does the \nSenator from Utah know of any situation in which a nominee for the \nSupreme Court or the circuit court of appeals, for example, got to the \nfloor of the Senate and then was stopped by a filibuster?\n  Mr. HATCH. There has only been one true filibuster in the history of \nthis country, and that was the Fortas nomination. I have to say even \nPresident Nixon was against that filibuster. But it was a bipartisan \nfilibuster of both Democrats and Republicans, unlike what we are faced \nwith today where a minority of Democrats are filibustering against a \nHispanic nominee for the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia, a double standard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Utah to yield for two \nother questions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. This goes back, I would advise the Senator from Utah, to the \nquestion of whether or not there has been a full opportunity to \ndiscover what this nominee believes, what his background is, whether he \nis well qualified, whether there has been an opportunity, in other \nwords, to question him and whether he has provided full and complete \ninformation. Would the Senator from Utah advise all of us how many \nhours, if it was hours, this nominee was before the Judiciary Committee \nand whether he answered all of the questions that were put to him at \nthat hearing?\n  Mr. HATCH. In an unusual hearing, which was much longer than most \ncircuit court of appeals hearings, from 10 o'clock to 5:30 that day, he \nwas asked question after question. He was asked question after question \nby Democrats as well as Republicans, but mainly Democrats, to the \nextent that we have this transcript that is larger than most \ntranscripts we have, other than Supreme Court nominees, where he \nanswered the questions. The problem with the Democrats, as I understand \nit, is he just didn't answer the questions the way they wanted. But he \nanswered them and he answered them in accordance with the directions of \nno less than Lloyd Cutler, one of the leading Democrat lawyers in the \ncountry.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my final question to the Senator from Utah, \nif he would yield please.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. I think I counted 30 questions that were orally asked during \nthe course of a hearing that, as I understand it, went from 10:06 a.m. \nto 5:25 p.m. In addition to that, the committee routinely sends a \nquestionnaire to these candidates. That questionnaire was provided to \nMiguel Estrada, and it was returned. It is some 25 pages in length and \nis a complete answer, and he does not refuse to answer any of the \nquestions that were posed by the committee. These are the same \nquestions that are asked of every nominee who comes before the \ncommittee.\n  May I also ask the Senator from Utah if the answers to this \nquestionnaire have been printed in the Record, and if they have not, if \nthe Senator from Utah would place them in the Record?\n  Mr. HATCH. They have not been placed in the Record. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent the questionnaire and the answers be printed in the \nRecord. Anybody who looks at that will realize it is a very intrusive \nquestionnaire.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  I.

That Note, The Policies Behind Lending \n     Limits, may be found at 99 Harv. L. Rev. 430 (1985). I was a \n     member of the editorial board of the Harvard Law Review--a \n     student journal--from the Fall of 1984 to the Spring of 1986.\n       I have occasionally been asked to offer, and have given, \n     comments on drafts of scholarly articles. Although I do not \n     regard my role in the writing or publication of those \n     articles as ``editorial,'' the following published articles \n     reflect author acknowledgments of my comments:\n       Donald J. Boudreaux & A.C. Pritchard, Civil Forfeiture and \n     the War on Drugs: Lessons from Economics and History, 33 San \n     Diego L.

Rosenberg, Criminal Acts and Sentencing Facts: \n     Two Constitutional Limits on Criminal Sentencing, 23 Seton \n     Hall L. Rev. 459 (1993).\n       From time to time, I have been asked to speak on issues of \n     federal appellate practice, which sometimes raise broader \n     issues of legal policy, at continuing legal education \n     seminars sponsored by bar organizations. For example, for the \n     past several years I have been a participant in the appellate \n     litigation seminar that the District of Columbia Bar \n     organizes every October. For the past several years, I also \n     participated as a panelist in appellate practice seminars \n     organized by the National Association of Attorneys General. I \n     also participated in a similar program sponsored by the New \n     York Bar in New York City in 1999. In May 1999, I was a \n     panelist at a conference organized by the United States \n     Sentencing Commission and the Federal Bar Association; my \n     panel's discussion addressed, among other things, \n     constitutional issues raised by sentences imposed under the \n     federal Sentencing Guidelines. I have not retained any notes \n     reflecting my remarks as one of the panelists in such bar \n     seminars, nor am I aware of the existence of any transcript \n     of my remarks.\n       In the Spring of 1999, I participated in a debate organized \n     by National Public Radio's Justice Talking on the public \n     policy issues raised by a City of Chicago loitering \n     ordinance, which was then under review by the Supreme Court \n     of the United States. See City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 \n     U.S. 41 (1997). I was asked to participate in that debate \n     because I had authored an amicus brief in support of \n     Chicago's position on behalf of the U.S. Conference of \n     Mayors, the National League of Cities, and the National \n     Governors' Association. My opponent in that debate was Harvey \n     Grossman, the Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties \n     Union of Illinois, who was counsel for the parties who sought \n     to challenge the Chicago ordinance. The debate was broadcast \n     in the Fall of 1999. A transcript is attached.\n       13. Health: What is the present state of your health?

Legal Career:\n       a. Describe chronologically your law practice and \n     experience after graduation from law school including\n       1. whether you served as clerk to a judge, and if so, the \n     name of the judge, the court, and the dates of the period you \n     were a clerk;\n       From August 1986 until July 1987, I served as a law clerk \n     to the Honorable Amalya L. Kearse, United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Second Circuit. From February 1988 until \n     February 1989, I served as a law clerk to the Honorable \n     Anthony M. Kennedy, Associate Justice, United States Supreme \n     Court.\n       2. whether you practiced alone, and if so, the addresses \n     and dates;\n       I have never practiced alone.\n       3. the dates, names and addresses of law firms or offices, \n     companies or governmental agencies with which you have been \n     connected, and the nature of your connection with each;\n       In addition to the clerkships identified above, I have been \n     associated or employed by the following firms and agencies:\n       Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, 1050 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., \n     Suite 900, Washington, D.C. 20036, Of Counsel attorney, July \n     1997-December 1999, and Partner, January 2000-present.\n       Office of the Solicitor General, United States Department \n     of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. \n     20530, Assistant to the Solicitor General, Sept. 1992-July \n     1997.\n       Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New \n     York, New York 10019, Associate, Sept. 1987-February 1988, \n     February 1989-March 1990, and May 1992-September 1992.\n       United States Attorney's Office, Southern District of New \n     York, One St. Andrew's Plaza, New York, New York 10007, \n     Assistant United States Attorney, March 1990 to May 1992.\n       b. 1. What has been the general character of your law \n     practice, dividing it into periods with dates if its \n     character has changed over the years?\n       I was a corporate lawyer, engaged primarily in \n     transactional work, during the approximately two years I \n     worked at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.\n       After leaving Wachtell, Lipton in March 1990, I became an \n     Assistant United States Attorney, a job I held for over two \n     years. As an Assistant United States Attorney, I represented \n     the government in federal criminal trials (both jury and non-\n     jury), bail and change-of-plea hearings, and in appeals \n     before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \n     Circuit.\n       I left the U.S. Attorney's Office in May 1992 to join the \n     Office of the Solicitor General, where my practice \n     principally involved representing the U.S. government in \n     cases before the United States Supreme Court. I also handled \n     some cases in the regional courts of appeals, and gave advice \n     to government agencies concerning whether adverse trial court \n     rulings should be appealed to a regional court of appeals. \n     Although most cases I personally argued before the Supreme \n     Court involved criminal-law issues, a significant portion of \n     my practice--e.g.,, advising other agencies on the \n     advisability of appealing adverse decisions and opposing \n     petitions for a writ of certiorari--raised a broad range of \n     issues typical of civil litigation. I remained in the Office \n     of the Solicitor General for approximately five years.\n       I left the Solicitor General's office to join the \n     Washington, D.C. office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in July \n     1997. My practice at Gibson, Dunn has primarily involved \n     handling appellate matters, usually in civil cases, although \n     I have also occasionally handled trial-court litigation.\n       2. Describe your typical former clients, and mention the \n     areas, if any, in which you have specialized.\n       During my nearly eight years in public service, my client \n     was the United States of America. In private practice, my \n     former clients have included, among others, major investment \n     banks acting as advisors in mergers and acquisitions, health \n     care providers defending against malpractice, ERISA and RICO \n     allegations, corporations seeking to set aside excessive \n     damage awards, individuals seeking to set aside criminal \n     convictions, and a qui tam relator seeking to sue a State of \n     the Union for fraud.\n       c. 1. Did you appear in court frequently, occasionally, or \n     not at all? If the frequency of your appearances in court \n     varied, describe each such variance, giving dates.\n       Both as a governmental lawyer and as a lawyer in private \n     practice, I have appeared in court frequently.\n       2. What percentage of these appearances was in: (a) federal \n     courts; (b) state courts of record; (c) other courts?\n       The great majority of my court appearances (approximately \n     99%) occurred in federal court. I have rarely appeared in \n     state courts.\n       3. What percentage of your litigation was: (a) civil; (b) \n     criminal?\n       Approximately 70% of the litigation I personally handled \n     was criminal. The remainder was civil.\n       4. State the number of cases in courts of record you tried \n     to verdict or judgment (rather than settled), indicating \n     whether you\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\n     were sole counsel, chief counsel, or associate counsel.\n       I tried approximately ten cases to judgment while I was a \n     federal prosecutor. I was chief counsel in four of those, and \n     was sole counsel in the remainder.\n       5. What percentage of these trials was: (a) jury; (b) non-\n     jury?\n       All but one of the cases (approximately 90%) were tried to \n     a jury.\n       18. Litigation: Describe the ten most significant litigated \n     matters which you personally handled. Give the citations, if \n     the cases were reported, and the docket number and date if \n     unreported. Give a capsule summary of the substance of each \n     case. Identify the party or parties whom you represented; \n     describe in detail the nature of your participation in the \n     litigation and the final disposition of the case. Also state \n     as to each case: (a) the date of representation; (b) the name \n     of the court and the name of the judge or judges before whom \n     the case was litigated; and (c) the individual name, \n     addresses, and telephone numbers of co-counsel and of \n     principal counsel for each of the other parties.\n       1. In re Managed Care Litigation, MDL No. 1334 (S.D. Fla., \n     Moreno, J.). I am counsel for Aetna, Inc. and its healthcare \n     subsidiaries (``Aetna'') in a series of putative nationwide \n     class actions that have been filed throughout the United \n     States against Aetna and most members of the managed care \n     industry. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has \n     consolidated those cases for coordinated pretrial proceedings \n     in the United States District Court for the Southern District \n     of Florida. The suits generally allege that cost-containment \n     mechanisms used by Aetna and other managed care companies \n     amount to violations of RICO, ERISA and various state laws--\n     because they allegedly provide incentives for physicians to \n     provide deficient medical care, and thus fraudulently reduce \n     the value of the insurance coverage purchased by \n     subscribers--and they seek billions of dollars in damages. I \n     share with one of my partners the day-to-day supervision of \n     this litigation on behalf of Aetna, which is the largest \n     defendant. In that connection, I have been responsible for \n     developing our client's legal strategy, preparing all briefs \n     in the case, and arguing dispositive motions.\n       Opposing Counsel: Jerome Marcus, Berger & Montague, 1622 \n     Locust Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103; Tel.: (215) 875-3013.\n       Co-counsel: (1) Richard Doren, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, 333 \n     South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90071; Tel.: \n     (213) 229-7038 (co-counsel for Aetna); (2) John D.

Stricter v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263 (1999). I represented \n     the petitioner, a death row inmate, in a federal habeas \n     challenge to his conviction and death sentence. The principal \n     issue in the case was whether the prosecution violated the \n     rule of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), by failing to \n     disclose to defense counsel that a purported eyewitness to \n     the crime had been repeatedly interviewed by the police and \n     had made statements casting doubt on her in-court \n     identification. I was the principal draftsman of the \n     petitioner's merits briefs in the United States Supreme \n     Court, and also argued the case before the Supreme Court. The \n     Supreme Court ruled that the evidence was exculpatory under \n     Brady, but that it was not sufficiently material to create a \n     reasonable probability of acquittal.\n       Co-Counsel: Barbara Hartung, 1001 East Main Street, \n     Richmond Virginia 23219; Tel.: (804) 649-1088.\n       Opposing counsel: Pamela A. Rumpz, Assistant Attorney \n     General, Commonwealth of Virginia, 900 East Main Street, \n     Richmond, Virginia 23219; Tel.: (804) 786-2071.\n       3. United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1 (1997). I \n     represented the United States. The issue in the case was \n     whether 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c), which provides mandatory \n     sentences for defendants who use firearms in connection with \n     narcotics crimes or violent offense, permits federal courts \n     to impose a concurrent sentence when the defendant already is \n     serving a state sentence. I was the draftsman of the \n     certiorari petition and the petitioner's briefs on the \n     merits, and also argued the case before the United States \n     Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled that Section 924(c) \n     requires that sentences under that provision must be \n     consecutive to any other sentence that the defendant might be \n     serving.\n       Opposing counsel: (1) Angela Arellanes, 320 Gold Avenue, \n     S.W., Suite 1111, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87102; Tel.: (505) \n     247-2417, (2) Edward Bustamante, 610 Gold Street, S.W., \n     Albuquerque, New Mexico 87102; Tel.: (505) 842-9093, and (3) \n     Roberto Albertorio, One Civic Plaza, Room 4030, Albuquerque, \n     New Mexico 87102; Tel.: (505) 924-3917.\n       4. Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172 (1997). I \n     argued the case before the United States. The issue for the \n     Court was whether a criminal defendant may ever prevent the \n     government from introducing evidence of a fact relevant to \n     the prosecution's case by stipulating to the existence of \n     that fact. The Supreme Court ruled that a criminal defendant \n     may, in some circumstances, keep the government from \n     introducing evidence of the defendant's prior conviction if \n     the defendant offers to stipulate before the jury that he is \n     indeed a felon.\n       Opposing counsel: Daniel Donovan, Federal Defenders of \n     Montana, 9 Third Street North, Great Falls, Montana 59403; \n     Tel.: (406) 727-5328.\n       5. Montana v. Eglehoff, 518 U.S. 37 (1996). I represented \n     the United States as amicus curiae in support of the position \n     of the State of Montana. The issue in the case was whether \n     the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \n     invalidates state legislation that renders any evidence of \n     involuntary intoxication irrelevant and inadmissible in a \n     prosecution for intentional homicide. I was the draftsman of \n     the United States' brief, and also presented argument before \n     the United States Supreme Court in support of Montana \n     position. By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court upheld the \n     constitutionality of the statute.\n       Co-counsel: Pamela P. Collins, Assistant Attorney General, \n     Justice Building, 215 North Sanders, Helena, Montana 59620; \n     Tel.: (406) 444-2026.\n       Opposing counsel: Ann C. German, P.O. Box 1530 Libby, \n     Montana 59923; Tel.: (406) 293-4191.\n       6. Degen v. United States, 517 U.S. 820 (1996). I \n     represented the United States. The petitioner had been \n     indicted on federal narcotics violations and had fled to \n     Switzerland to avoid prosecution. The issues for the Supreme \n     Court were (i) whether federal courts possess inherent \n     authority to forfeit property civilly, without a hearing, \n     when the party claiming such property is a fugitive from \n     United States justice, and (ii) whether such a forfeiture \n     would violate the claimant's due process rights. I was the \n     principal draftsman of the government's brief and also argued \n     the case before the Supreme Court. The Court ruled that \n     federal courts slack inherent authority to forfeit a \n     fugitive's property.\n       Opposing counsel: Lawrence S. Robbins, Mayer, Brown & \n     Platt, 2000 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 2006; \n     Tel.: (202) 463-2000.\n       7. Citizens Bank of Maryland v. Strumpf, 516 U.S. 16 \n     (1996). I argued the case on behalf of United States as \n     amicus curiae in support of reversal. The issue in this case \n     was whether the ``automatic stay'' provisions of the \n     Bankruptcy Code, see 11 U.S.C. Sec. 362, are violated when a \n     creditor temporarily withholds payment of a debt that the \n     creditor owes to the bankrupt debtor in order to protect the \n     creditor's set-off rights. The Supreme Court ruled that a \n     creditor in such circumstances does not violate the Code's \n     ``automatic stay'' provisions.\n       Co-counsel: Irving E. Walker, Miles & Stockbridge, P.C., 10 \n     Light Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202; Tel.: (410) 727-\n     6464.\n       Opposing counsel: Roger Schlossberg, 134 West Washington \n     Street, Hagerstown, Maryland 21740; Tel.: (301) 739-8610.\n       8. United States v. Robertson, 514 U.S. 669 (1995). I wrote \n     all briefs and argued the case on behalf of the United \n     States. The principal issues in this case were (i) whether \n     the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1961 et seq. reaches the full extent of conduct \n     that Congress could conceivably regulate under the Commerce \n     Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and (ii) whether the \n     evidence in the case satisfied the statute's ``interstate \n     commerce'' requirement. The Court ruled that the evidence \n     submitted by the government--including evidence that the \n     defendant shipped materials from California to Alaska--\n     satisfied the statutory and constitutional requirements.\n       Opposing counsel (last known address and telephone number): \n     Glenn Stewart Warren, 2442 Fourth Avenue, San Diego, \n     California 92101; Tel.: (619) 232-6052.\n       9. United States v. Mezzanatto, 513 U.S. 196 (1995). I \n     wrote the briefs and argued the case on behalf of the United \n     States. In order to induce the prosecutor to engage in plea \n     negotiations, the defendant in this case had agreed to waive \n     the protections of Fed. R. Evid. 410, which ordinarily render \n     all evidence of plea negotiations inadmissible in court. The \n     defendant later changed his mind, and testified at trial to a \n     story that was inconsistent with what he had told the \n     prosecutor. In reliance on the defendant's agreement, the \n     trial court permitted the prosecutor to impeach the defendant \n     with his prior inconsistent statements. The U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, ruling that the rules \n     of evidence--including Rule 410--may never be waived by \n     agreement of the parties. The Supreme Court granted \n     certiorari to review that conclusion, and, after briefing and \n     argument, reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling. The Supreme \n     Court held that rules of evidence, like most rights conferred \n     by statute, may be waived by agreement of the parties.\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\n       Opposing counsel: Mark R. Lippman, 8070 La Jolla Shores \n     Drive, La Jolla, California 92037; Tel.: (858) 456-5840.\n       10. National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 \n     U.S. 249 (1994). I wrote the briefs and argued the case on \n     behalf of the United States as amicus curiae in support of \n     petitioner. The issue in the case was whether the Racketeer \n     Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  \n     1961 et seq. incorporates a ``pecuniary purpose'' requirement \n     for liability, so that only criminal enterprises that violate \n     RICO for mercenary reasons would be liable civilly or \n     criminally. (That interpretation of RICO had originated with \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which had \n     reversed the criminal convictions of several Croatian \n     terrorists who engaged in multiple bombings and arsons for \n     ``ideological'' reasons related to their desire to achieve \n     independence for their homeland). The Supreme Court \n     unanimously held that RICO does not embody a ``pecuniary \n     purpose'' requirement.\n       Co-counsel: Fay Clayton, Robinson, Curley & Clayton, P.C., \n     300 South Wacker Drive, Suite 1700, Chicago, Illinois 60606; \n     Tel.: (312) 663-3100.\n       Opposing counsel: G.

Legal Activities: Describe the most significant legal \n     activities you have pursued, including significant litigation \n     which did not progress to trial or legal matters that did not \n     involve litigation. Describe the nature of your participation \n     in this question, please omit any information protected by \n     the attorney-client privilege (unless the privilege has been \n     waived).\n       In addition to the litigation described above, my practice \n     has included preparing for civil litigation that did not \n     proceed to trial or that was settled during trial; handling \n     an international contract dispute that arose out of the \n     privatization of oil fields and refineries in a central Asian \n     republic (I and one of my partners represented our client in \n     the arbitration of that contract dispute, which was conducted \n     under UNCITRAL rules); advising clients conducting internal \n     corporate investigations into possible violations of federal \n     criminal law; and briefing and/or arguing appeals in civil \n     and criminal cases.\n       II. FINANCIAL DATA AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST (PUBLIC)\n       1. List sources, amounts and dates of all anticipated \n     receipts from deferred income arrangements, stock, options, \n     uncompleted contracts and other future benefits which you \n     expect to be derived from previous business relationships, \n     professional services, firm memberships, former employers, \n     clients, or customers. Please describe the arrangements you \n     have made to be compensated in the future for any financial \n     or business interest.\n       I do not expect to have any deferred income or other \n     benefits from any previous business relationships or \n     employment. If I am confirmed, my law firm has agreed to pay \n     out my capital, together with my annualized share of the \n     firm's income for the current year, in cash at the time I \n     resign my partnership to begin judicial service.\n       2. Explain how you will resolve any potential conflict of \n     interest, including the procedure you will follow in \n     determining these areas of concern. Identify the categories \n     of litigation and financial arrangements that are likely to \n     present potential conflicts-of-interest during your initial \n     service in the position to which you have been nominated.\n       I will follow the dictates of the Code of Judicial Conduct \n     and the provisions of applicable recusal laws, such as 28 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 455.\n       3. Do you have any plans, commitments, or agreements to \n     pursue outside employment, with or without compensation, \n     during your service with the court? If so, explain.\n       No.\n       4. List sources and amounts of all income received during \n     the calendar year preceding your nomination and for the \n     current calendar year, including all salaries, fees, \n     dividends, interest, gifts, rents, royalties, patents, \n     honoraria, and other items exceeding $500 or more. (If you \n     prefer to do so, copies of the financial disclosure report, \n     required by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, may be \n     substituted here.)\n       Please refer to my Ethics in Government Act report.\n       5. Please complete the attached financial net worth \n     statement in detail. (Add schedules as called for.)\n       Please refer to attached statement.\n       6. Have you ever held a position or played a role in a \n     political campaign? If so, please identify the particulars of \n     the campaign, including the candidate, dates of the campaign, \n     your title and responsibilities.\n       I have never played any role in any political campaign.\n       III. GENERAL (PUBLIC)\n       1. An ethical consideration under Canon 2 of the American \n     Bar Association's Code of Professional Responsibility calls \n     for ``every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or \n     professional workload, to find some time to participate in \n     serving the disadvantaged.'' Describe what you have done to \n     fulfill these responsibilities, listing specific instances \n     and the amount of time devoted to each.\n       The bulk of my legal career has been in the public sector, \n     but I have consistently devoted time to pro bono obligations \n     while working in private practice. During my first stint in \n     private practice (at Wachtell, Lipton), I accepted an \n     appointment to represent an incarcerated defendant who was \n     seeking habeas relief from his state conviction. I wrote all \n     appellate briefs and argued the case before the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. See Campaneria v. \n     Reid, 891 F.2d 1014 (2d Cir. 1989). The amount of time \n     devoted to this matter was approximately 300 hours.\n       Since returning to private practice (at Gibson Dunn), my \n     pro bono activities have included:\n       a. Writing an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the U.S. \n     Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities and the \n     National Governors' Association in City of Chicago v. \n     Morales, 527 U.S. 41 (1997). Morales was a constitutional \n     challenge to a Chicago ordinance that made it unlawful for \n     members of street gangs to loiter in public spaces. The \n     amicus brief, to which I devoted approximately 120 hours, \n     supported the arguments made by the City of Chicago.\n       b. Representing a death row inmate in a challenge to his \n     conviction and sentence. See Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. \n     263 (1999). I was the principal draftsman of petitioner's \n     Supreme Court briefs on the merits and argued the case on his \n     behalf in the Supreme Court. I devoted approximately 450 \n     hours to this representation.\n       c. Representing the City of Annapolis, Maryland in \n     defending the City's loitering ordinance--which prohibits \n     loitering with the intent to engage in drug dealing--from \n     constitutional attack. See N.A.A.C.P., Anne Arundel County \n     Branch v. City of Annapolis, Civ. No CCB-00-771 (D. Md). I \n     have devoted approximately 120 hours to that representation. \n     In April 2001, after the district court issued a ruling \n     invalidating the ordinance, the City of Annapolis determined \n     not to further defend the constitutionality of the ordinance.\n       2. The American Bar Association's Commentary to its Code of \n     Judicial Conduct states that it is inappropriate for a judge \n     to hold membership in any organization that invidiously \n     discriminates on the basis of race, sex, or religion. Do you \n     currently belong, or have you belonged, to any organization \n     which discriminates--through either formal membership \n     requirements or the practical implementation of membership \n     policies? If so, list, with dates of membership. What you \n     have done to try to change these policies?\n       I do not currently belong, nor have I ever belonged, to any \n     organization that discriminates in any way on the basis of \n     race, sex, or religion.\n       3. Is there a selection commission in your jurisdiction to \n     recommend candidates for nomination to the federal courts? If \n     so, did it recommend your nomination? Please describe your \n     experience in the entire judicial selection process, from \n     beginning to end (including the circumstances which led to \n     your nomination and interviews in which you participated).\n       There is no selection commission that recommends candidates \n     for nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit. Attorneys from the White House \n     Counsel's Office asked me to interview for the position. I \n     was interviewed once by two White House attorneys. I was \n     later informed that I was likely to be nominated for the \n     position. I was nominated on May 9, 2001.\n       4. Has anyone involved in the process of selecting you as a \n     judicial nominee discussed with you any specific case, legal \n     issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be \n     interpreted as asking how you would rule on such case, issue, \n     or question? If so, please explain fully.\n       No.\n       5. Please discuss your view on the following criticism \n     involving ``judicial activism'': The role of the Federal \n     judiciary within the Federal government, and within society \n     generally, has become the subject of increasing controversy \n     in recent years. It has become a target of both popular and \n     academic criticism that alleges that the judicial branch has \n     usurped many of the prerogatives of other branches and levels \n     of government. Some of the characteristics of this ``judicial \n     activism'' have been said to include: (a) a tendency by \n     the judiciary toward problem-solution rather than \n     grievance-resolution; (b) a tendency by the judiciary to \n     employ the individual plaintiff as a vehicle for the \n     imposition of far-reaching orders extending to broad \n     classes of individuals; (c) a tendency by the judiciary to \n     impose broad, affirmative duties upon governments and \n     society; (d) a tendency by the judiciary toward loosening \n     jurisdictional requirements such as standing and ripeness; \n     and (e) a tendency by the judiciary to impose itself upon \n     other institutions in the manner of an administrator with \n     continuing oversight responsibilities.\n       In my view, federal judges may decide only concrete cases \n     or controversies that properly come to them; they may not \n     ``make law'' or reach beyond the facts and circumstances of \n     the particular case they must decide. That limited judicial \n     role flows from the text of the Constitution, the separation \n     of powers inherent in our constitutional scheme, the federal-\n     state balance, and the presumption of validity that generally \n     attaches to legislative actions.\n\n                     FINANCIAL STATEMENT NET WORTH\n\n       Provide a complete, current financial net worth statement \n     which itemizes in detail all assets (including bank accounts, \n     real estate, securities, trusts, investments, and other \n     financial holdings) all liabilities (including debts, \n     mortgages, loans, and other financial obligations) of \n     yourself, your spouse, and\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\n     other immediate members of your household.\n\n                                 ASSETS\n\nCash on hand and in banks..........................................$73K\nU.S. Government securities--add schedule (savings bonds)............12K\nListed securities--add schedule.......................................0\nUnlisted securities--add schedule.....................................0\nAccounts and notes receivable:........................................0\nDue from relatives and friends........................................0\nDue from others.......................................................0\nDoubtful..............................................................0\nReal estate owned--add schedule 1105 Prince St., Alex., VA.........575K\nReal estate mortgages receivable......................................0\nAutos and other personal property...................................120\nCash value--life insurance............................................0\nOther assets--itemize:.................................................\nIRAs, 401(k), and KEOGH Plans......................................164K\n    Total Assets...................................................824K\n\n                         CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nAs endorser, comaker or guarantor.....................................0\nOn leases or contracts................................................0\nLegal Claims..........................................................0\nProvision for Federal Income Tax......................................0\nOther special debt....................................................0\n\n                              LIABILITIES\n\nNotes payable to banks--secured.......................................0\nNotes payable to banks--unsecured.....................................0\nNotes payable to relatives............................................0\nNotes payable to others...............................................0\nAccounts and bills due................................................0\nUnpaid income tax.....................................................0\nOther unpaid tax and interest.........................................0\nReal estate mortgages payable--schedule (schedule attached.........386K\nChattel mortgages and other liens payable.............................0\nOther debts--itemize...................................................\nDOJ TSP Loan........................................................19K\nMastercard..........................................................10K\nAmerican Express....................................................10K\nStudent Loan........................................................21K\nTotal liabilities..................................................446K\nNet Worth..........................................................378K\nTotal liabilities and net worth........................................\n\n                          GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nAre any assets pledged?

The firm has also \n     agreed to pay me, at the same time and also in cash, my \n     annualized share of the firm's income for the current year, \n     computed on the basis of the per-share income earned by the \n     firm during the year 2000.\n       IX. CERTIFICATION.\n       I certify that all information given above (including \n     information pertaining to my spouse and minor or dependent \n     children, if any) is accurate, true, and complete to the best \n     of my knowledge and belief, and that any information not \n     reported was withheld because it met applicable statutory \n     provisions permitting non-disclosure.\n       I further certify that earned income from outside \n     employment and honoraria and the acceptance of gifts which \n     have been reported are in compliance with the provisions of 5 \n     U.S.C. app. Sec. 501 et. seq., 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7353 and \n     Judicial Conference regulations.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me yield first to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama and then I will be happy to yield to my friend from Nevada \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will ask the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who has been involved in these matters for so many years, \naren't we confusing here home State Senators' objections with a \nfilibuster? And isn't it true that, to this very day, really earlier in \nthis year, the Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee virtually \ndemanded home State Senators be given even more power to block nominees \nthan in the past?\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe there have been some demands that have been far \nin excess of what has been allowed by their own chairmen in the past, \nespecially Chairman Kennedy and Chairman Biden. I think the Senator \nstates it correctly.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My second question, Mr. President, would be: The point \nis there has been no movement from the other side to change the basic \ntraditional view of the power of home State Senators to object. In \nfact, they affirm that and insist they should be given that, and even \nexpand it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator is correct.\n  I said I would yield to the distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Without the Senator losing his right to the floor, I \nattempted 20 minutes or so ago to add a little levity to this debate, \nindicating the distinguished Senator from Utah is aware I attempted to \nadd a little levity by suggesting you had joined in the filibuster. \nThat didn't go over. It wasn't very funny, as I learned very quickly.\n  Mr. HATCH. It wasn't very funny, but I appreciate the Senator trying \nto interject levity. We could use maybe a little bit around here, but \nthis is a tough issue and we are all upset.\n  Mr. REID. It should be a little more humorous, obviously, than I was \nable to provide.\n  Mr. HATCH. I respect the Senator, anyway.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the distinguished Senator from Utah, we are here. It \nis now 10:30 at night.\n  We have an agenda with people who are going to be covering the floor \nfor us. But I ask the Senator, because we have other people on the \nfloor: How much longer does he think he is going to want to take \ntonight on this matter, just so my colleagues over here know. Obviously \nthe Senator knows. He knows a little more than I know because it seems \nto be thinning out a little bit here. Can the Senator inform the \nSenate--especially this Senator--as to how much longer we are going to \ngo tonight?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not quite sure. I have a statement to make, and I \nwant to get that in the Record. I would like to take any questions my \ncolleagues have on either side of the aisle. This is an important \nissue. So it is 10:30 at night. It is nothing to me. I am fighting for \nMiguel Estrada.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one final question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I understand the importance of this nomination. I know the \nSenator believes I understand its importance. I am not in any way \ndenigrating or trying to stop anyone from speaking tonight. I only \nwould ask if the Senator would give us some general idea as to whether \nwe are going to be here all night or another hour or two hours. Can the \nSenator give us any indication?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to be here all night, if that is what it \ntakes. I do not want to foreclose any questions from my colleagues. I \ndon't know how many questions there will be. But I am here to answer \nthem, and I would like to make a statement for the Record before we \nfinish. I will try to expedite that, if I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been listening to these brilliant \nlegal minds asking questions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, does the Senator from Oklahoma have the \nfloor?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  I was trying to get across with just a prelude, if you will accept \nthat. There are several of us here who are not attorneys and who are \ncertainly not great legal minds. As we look at this, I recall, though, \nanother hearing, the origin of filibuster dealing back with the days of \ncivil rights. And what comes to my mind is, as I have been listening to \nthese questions being asked and the objections to Miguel Estrada by the \nminority--correct me if I am wrong--that the filibuster was created and \nmaintained for some civil rights legislation in the first place. Is \nthat correct?\n\n[[Page S2320]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. That is generally the viewpoint around here.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator share with those of us who are not \nattorneys the origin for filibuster?\n  Mr. HATCH. The filibuster comes from the word filibustero, which is \nSpanish. It is a word for pirating, by taking improper control, in this \ncase of the Senate. I hope I am saying that right. I think I am pretty \nclose.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. TALENT. I wonder if my colleague read the statement by former \nCongressman Herman Badillo from New York who called the opposition to \nblock Mr. Estrada ``grandstanding'' and ``this treatment of Mr. Estrada \nis demeaning and unfair not only to the nominee but the confirmation \nprocess and the integrity of the Senate.''\n\n  I wonder if my colleague believes that is a pretty remarkable \nstatement coming from a former Democratic Member of Congress about the \nopposition being mounted to a fellow Hispanic.\n  Mr. HATCH. I did read the quote in the Wall Street Journal, and I \nthought it was a tremendous article. It was written by the former \nDemocratic Congressman from the State of New York. I was privileged to \nhear Congressman Badillo the other day at our press conference when the \nHispanic community came together to decry what is going on against \nMiguel Estrada. He made one of the most profound and strong statements \nat that press conference. I have nothing but respect for him. I \nrespected him when he was in Congress, and he certainly has been \nspeaking up, and he is a Democrat.\n  But he is not the only Democrat. Seth Waxman is one of the all time \ngreat Solicitors General--wonderful Democrat attorney who I happen to \nhave a lot of respect for. He has spoken up for Miguel Estrada as have \nso many other colleagues at the Solicitor General's Office. But Mr. \nBadillo very firmly feels this is an injustice, that it is a double \nstandard, that this is prejudice against this nominee. I can't speak \nfor him, but this is what I got out of his remarks and out of his \narticle; and that there is no justification whatsoever in fighting \nagainst Miguel Estrada, and absolutely no justification in conducting \nthe first filibuster in the history of the country against a circuit \ncourt of appeals nominee.\n  I have to say I was very impressed with his article, and I appreciate \nthe Senator reading from it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, will the Senator yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am delighted to, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. It is my understanding one of the \nattacks is Mr. Estrada is in fact a rightwing ideolog who may use his \npolitical philosophy to shape the law in an unfair way. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. HATCH. I suspect that is what is worrying people on the other \nside.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Is my understanding correct that it is \nnot only the Senator's suspicion, but they have actually said that? \nPeople on the other side have said one of the concerns they have about \nthis gentleman is they are suspicious of his ideology and that he may \nbe inflexible in applying the law in a fair way. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. My colleagues on the other side who don't know Miguel \nEstrada--there is only one person who has given their criticism, and \nthat was Professor Bender from Arizona State University who I think has \nmore than been rebutted here on the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Along those lines, if the Senator will \ncontinue to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I take a moment to read a few paragraphs from the \nWhite House letter responding to the Senate Democrats' continuing \naction here on the notion that Mr. Estrada did not answer questions of \nthe Members?\n  When asked by Senator Edwards about judicial review, Mr. Estrada \nanswered:\n\n       Courts take the laws that have been passed by you and give \n     you the benefit of understanding that you take the same oath \n     that they do to uphold the Constitution. And, therefore, they \n     take the laws with the presumption that they are \n     constitutional. It is the affirmative burden of the plaintiff \n     to show that you have gone beyond your oath. If they come \n     into court, then it is appropriate for courts to undertake to \n     listen to the legal arguments, which is that the legislature \n     went beyond its role as a legislature and invaded the \n     Constitution.\n\n  That is a deliberative and very important answer to questions they \nclaim he never answered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Will the Senator continue to yield for \none more question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be delighted to, without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Would the Senator agree with me that if \none of the really serious questions about whether or not this man is a \nrightwing ideolog who couldn't shape the law in a proper fashion--that \nany rightwing ideolog would have a very difficult time working for the \nClinton administration? Would you agree with me about that concept?\n  Mr. HATCH. That was my experience with the Clinton administration. I \ndon't know of any rightwing ideolog----\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Did this gentleman in fact work for the \nClinton administration?\n  Mr. HATCH. He did, indeed, and he received rave reviews for his work \nat the Solicitor General's Office in the Clinton administration by a \nDemocrat Solicitor General.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Will the Senator agree that for any \nconservative to be able to work for the Clinton administration and do \nwell shows a tremendous amount of tolerance?\n  Mr. HATCH. I certainly agree with that. Mr. Waxman, who is a highly \nregarded and respected lawyer, was the Solicitor General--one of them. \nMr. Estrada worked under three Democrat Solicitors General who saw his \nwork product. Mr. Waxman is highly respected. I doubt he would put his \nreputation on the line, as he did, by vouching for Mr. Estrada if he \nwere not absolutely convinced he would be a fair and unbiased Federal \njudge. That is none other than Seth Waxman, the Solicitor General in \nthe Clinton administration.\n  I don't understand all this argument by the other side and why a \nfilibuster of this highly qualified person who has the highest rating \nof the American Bar Association, their gold standard. I have to say I \nhave to admit it is a good standard at this point, too. They are doing \na fair job. It isn't just because of Mr. Estrada I say that. I have \nbeen saying it for a couple of years. But one time I wasn't very \npleased with it.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. In the Senator's 27 years serving in this body, has the \nSenator seen anything that has progressed on a judicial nomination the \nway this nomination has, and does he have any concern this may be \nsetting a precedent?\n  Mr. HATCH. There is no question that this is setting a precedent. In \nresponse to my colleague's very important question, this is a very \nterrible precedent because if the Democrats succeed in filibustering \nthe first Hispanic judge nominee to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the \nDistrict of Columbia--the first filibuster in the history of the \ncountry, a true filibuster, then Katy bar the door. I remember there \nwere some on our side who wanted to filibuster, and cooler minds took \nover and said, We are not going to do that. First of all, we think it \nis wrong.\n  Second, we think it is unconstitutional to do it.\n  Third, it isn't fair to the President, to the Senate, to the nominee, \nnor to the process. It isn't fair. And that is the position we took.\n\n  And now we have what I consider to be a very unfair process, for no \ngood reason, because I have not heard one substantive argument against \nMiguel Estrada, not one in all of this debate, other than: We didn't \nlike his answers. Well, that is tough. Vote against him if you don't \nlike his answers. That is your right. Some of our people voted against \nsome of their judges because they did not like their answers. That is \nOK. It is honorable.\n  But do not filibuster a circuit court of appeals nominee or a Federal \njudge of any stature.\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, has any Member of the Senate questioned \nthe nominee's intelligence?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not one. Nobody could. We know how bright he is.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And has any person questioned his temperament?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, Paul Bender has. But he----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Has any Member of the Senate questioned his \ntemperament?\n  Mr. HATCH. There have been some who have been concerned about that \nbecause of Mr. Bender's comments. But Mr. Bender, when he was his \nsupervisor at the Department of Justice, gave him rave reviews in all \ncategories.\n  Now, I think the contemporaneous rave reviews, which Mr. Bender tries \nto get out of now, should take precedence over his partisan comments \nmade long after the fact.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask the Senator from Utah, what is generally the \nstandard by which the Senate is to analyze nominees and pass judgment \non them? What are the qualities and characteristics of a nominee that \nare the traditional areas by which individuals who have been nominated \nare judged?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, for a Federal circuit court nominee, it would be \nhonesty, integrity, temperament, physical capacity--or ability to \nwork--but, in addition, an FBI report that is favorable, and an ABA \nrating, that isn't necessarily followed but, nonetheless, is helpful if \nit is favorable. And in this case it is not only favorable, but it is \nthe highest rating they could possibly give. And there are other \nlegitimate considerations, but all of them he has passed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Further, I guess the question I have is, other than Mr. \nBender's comment, which came well after the fact and does not comport \nwith his contemporaneous reports--other than that one particular \nstatement--of all the qualifications that are traditionally used by \nMembers of the Senate to evaluate nominees for judicial positions, \ncircuit court positions, has any Member of the Senate questioned any of \nthose qualities?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not really. Not really. Not really, other than some who \nrelied on Mr. Bender's comments. And I might add that Mr. Bender worked \nfor Seth Waxman, who rebutted what Mr. Bender said, and put his \nreputation on the line as a Democrat former Solicitor General, and \nspeaks very favorably on all of those issues with regard to Mr. \nEstrada.\n  I would certainly give much more credibility to Mr. Waxman than I \nwould to Mr. Bender, who I think has acted reprehensibly under the \ncircumstances.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So, Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for just a \nclarifying question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What I understand the Senator from Utah is saying is \nthat on every quality by which judicial nominees are judged \ntraditionally here in the Senate, on every single one of those \nqualities, he has either had no argument from the other side that he \ndoes not meet those standards or, in many cases, he has exceeded those \nstandards, except in one case with respect to judicial temperament. In \nthat case, we have the person who makes those claims having written \ncontemporaneous reports that rebut his own later testimony, and the \nsupervisor rebutting that testimony. So other than that one case, on \nall of the other qualities by which we are to judge a candidate here, \nthere is no argument about his qualifications?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. By the way, when the ABA does its review, \nit is looking for every one of those qualities. It is looking for \npeople who would rebut those qualities. It is looking for people who \nboth support him and are opposed to him. It is looking for people who \nsay he does not have the right temperament, or he does not have the \nright intelligence, or he does not have the right integrity, or he does \nnot have the right health. The ABA goes into all of that. So does the \nadministration. And so do we as Senators if we want to.\n  In this particular case, virtually everybody who worked with him \ngives him high raves.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for an \nadditional question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Given that he is qualified on all of those grounds, one \nis left with the possibility that he may be objected to because of his \nideological position. Has any comment been made or any evidence been \nproduced by any Senator that his ideology is out of the mainstream of \ntraditional jurisprudence in any of the activities in which he has been \ninvolved?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not aware of anyone. I have heard remarks on the \nfloor by colleagues on the other side that they are concerned he may \nnot uphold all of their believed decisions. But he has said he would \nuphold precedent, that he would abide by the law as enunciated by the \nSupreme Court, and that he would examine everything as thoroughly as he \ncould, do the very best job he could to be fair. He has said exactly \nthe right things you would want a circuit court nominee to say.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for an \nadditional question, I would just ask that to be clarified. Has the \nother side produced any evidence that, in the history of this nominee \nas a lawyer, he has produced any information or any information has \nbeen produced that shows that his principles or ideology are outside of \nthe mainstream? Has any evidence been produced to that effect?\n  Mr. HATCH. Absolutely none. And that is one reason it is a fishing \nexpedition--because they want to see if they can find something for \nwhich they can criticize him. But not only did they wait 615 days to \nhold a hearing--which they controlled, they chaired, they questioned--\nbut they also allowed for written questions afterwards. And only two of \nthem--the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Massachusetts--\nprepared written questions for him, which he answered, which we put \ninto the Record today.\n  Frankly, I do not know of anyone who could point out any defect in \nthis man's character and his ability to be a great circuit court of \nappeals judge.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. To further answer that question, I would like to read from \nthe letter the White House just sent up here today:\n\n       In some recent hearings, including Mr. Estrada's, Senator \n     Schumer has asked that nominees identify particular Supreme \n     Court cases of the last few decades----\n\n  I think the correct reference was to the last 40 years, although I \nhave heard Senator after Senator on the other side talk about the whole \njurisprudence of the country, even though the question is referring to \nthe last 40 years. But:\n\n       In some recent hearings, including Mr. Estrada's, Senator \n     Schumer has asked that nominees identify particular Supreme \n     Court cases of the last few decades with which they disagree. \n     But the problems with such a question and answer were well \n     stated by Justice Stephen Breyer.\n\n  Of course, Justice Breyer is a Democrat, and he is now sitting on the \nSupreme Court.\n  The White House letter goes on:\n\n       As Justice Breyer put it, ``Until [an issue] comes up, I \n     don't really think it through with the depth that it would \n     require . . . so often, when you decide a matter for real, in \n     a court or elsewhere, it turns out to be very different after \n     you've become informed and think it through for real than \n     what you would have said at a cocktail party answering a \n     question.''\n       Senator Schumer also has asked nominees how they would have \n     ruled in particular Supreme Court cases. Again, a double \n     standard is being applied. The nominees of President Clinton \n     did not answer such questions. For example, Richard Tallman, \n     a nominee with no prior judicial service who now serves on \n     the Ninth Circuit, not only would not answer how he would \n     have ruled as a judge in Roe v. Wade--but even how he would \n     have ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson, the infamous case that \n     upheld the discredited and shameful ``separate but equal'' \n     doctrine. So, too, in the hearing on President Clinton's \n     nomination of Judges Barry and Fisher, Senator Smith asked \n     whether the nominees would have voted for a constitutional \n     right to abortion before Roe v. Wade. Chairman Hatch \n     interrupted Senator Smith to say ``that is not a fair \n     question to these two nominees because\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\n     regardless of what happened pre-1973, they have to abide by \n     what has happened post-1973 and the current precedents that \n     the Supreme Court has.''\n  In other words, I corrected a member of my party on the committee for \nasking that question of a Clinton nominee.\n  I hate to say it, but Miguel Estrada has answered their questions. He \njust hasn't answered them the way they wanted because they haven't been \nable to find any real defects in the answers he has given.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Is the Senator from Utah aware that the following \nSupreme Court Justices had no prior judicial experience: Harlan Fiske \nStone, Louis Brandeis, Hugo Black, and William O. Douglas?\n  Mr. HATCH. All giants of the law and none of whom had prior judicial \nexperience.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Is the Senator aware that Felix Frankfurter and Earl \nWarren and Byron White and Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist and \nStephen Breyer and Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun and Warren \nBurger and Ruth Bader Ginsburg all had no prior judicial experience \nbefore they were appointed and confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is exactly right. It just goes to prove how \nridiculous the accusations are that some have made against Miguel \nEstrada. And it also goes to show that there is a double standard with \nregard to this Hispanic nominee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Would the Senator yield for one final question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If the Senator would agree that all of those \ndistinguished men and women with no prior judicial experience went on \nto become distinguished members of the U.S. Supreme Court, then can the \nSenator help us understand why the Members of the other side suddenly \nthink it is not just important but disqualifying for someone who is \nnominated for a lower court to have no judicial experience? Why is this \nsuddenly a new criterion when many of the most distinguished jurists in \nour country's history have had a diverse background of experience? Why \nis this suddenly a new standard for Miguel Estrada?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator really raises the issue--that is why there is \na double standard--when all of these great Supreme Court Justices and \nothers never had a day of judicial experience. I will submit Miguel \nEstrada has had more time in the judiciary than any of them had before \nthey came to the court because not only has he argued before the \nSupreme Court, he was a clerk at the Supreme Court. He knows how the \nCourt works. He knows how it moves, thinks, and breathes. Yet he is \nbeing mistreated here. Why the double standard? I can only think of \none, and that is, they don't like what they think his philosophy is. \nThey don't like the fact that a Republican President has supported him \nand has nominated him. They don't like the fact that he is a Hispanic \nconservative Republican. They are afraid that because he is a Hispanic \nconservative Republican, he might upset the balance on this court. And \non this court, over 90 percent of the cases are unanimously decided.\n  I can tell you, all of their fears are unjustified. They are \nincredible the way they are being made. And they are, most importantly, \nunfair criticisms--most importantly, unfair. That is what bothers me. \nWhy can't we be fair to this Hispanic nominee who has fought so hard to \nbe part of the American dream and has earned a right? Why can't we be \nfair to him? What is wrong over here? What is wrong?\n\n  Not only is he a Hispanic nominee, a Republican, appointed by this \nPresident, whom I can see some of my colleagues don't like. I can \naccept that. But Miguel Estrada is a person who suffers from a handicap \nas well. He has a speech impediment. And if you watched the hearings, \nyou could see that. Yet this young man has gone to the height of the \nprofession in spite of those things. In spite of all the blocks, all \nthe barriers, all the glass ceilings, all of the criticisms, he has \nlived the American dream. He is an example to every young lawyer, not \njust Hispanic young lawyers--especially to them--but every young lawyer \nof how you can fulfill the American dream.\n  I haven't seen a glove laid on him by the other side. Yet they are \nstill filibustering him. Why the double standard? I think the Senator \nmakes a tremendous set of points there. I am personally grateful for \nhis participation.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My colleague from Utah has talked about how it is unfair \nto block a conservative nominee who is Hispanic. I would like to ask my \ncolleague a question about Judge Rosemary Barkett, a Hispanic woman, \nborn in Mexico, who spent her early years there before her parents \nimmigrated to the United States. At an early age, she devoted herself \nto religious service and took vows to become a nun, then a \nschoolteacher, educating children in Florida, then became a very \ndistinguished lawyer. After years in private practice, she underwent a \nrigorous screening process, and she was appointed to the State trial \nbench.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Regular order.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My question is, did my good friend from Utah not say \nabout Judge Barkett:\n\n       I led the fight to oppose [Judge Rosemary Barkett's] \n     confirmation . . . because [her] judicial records indicated \n     she would be an activist who would legislate from the bench?\n\n  Why is that any different than people on this side opposing Miguel \nEstrada because he might be a judicial activist who would legislate \nfrom the bench?\n  Why is my colleague accusing some on this side of being anti-Hispanic \nwhen he opposed a Hispanic judge similarly rising through the ranks \nbecause he disagreed with her philosophy?\n  I yield to my colleague for an answer to that question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to have the question from my dear colleague \nfrom New York. No. 1, I didn't know she was Hispanic. That is \nirrelevant to me anyway. I didn't know that. And if she is, I didn't \nknow it until today. No. 2, I did read her judicial records. She was an \nactivist. I did vote against her. But there is a difference here: I \nvoted. I allowed you to have a vote. We had a vote, and she is now \nsitting on the court.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a further question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is not the question I asked.\n  Mr. HATCH. You asked me why this is different from--wait, let me just \nfinish.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will yield in just a second. Let me finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators will address through the Chair, not \nto each other.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just finish here. You asked me why should this be \nany different from Miguel Estrada. There is nobody who can say that \nMiguel Estrada would legislate from the bench. There is nobody who has \none ounce of information that would indicate he would be an activist \njudge. He isn't a judge. In fact, your side has argued that because he \ndoesn't have judicial experience, he should not go on this position--\nsome have argued. I hope it hasn't been the distinguished Senator from \nNew York with his great knowledge of the law.\n  But there was a complete difference. The bottom line is this: Yes, I \nstill think I was right on that particular vote. I may have been wrong, \nbut I believed I was right. I did it sincerely. But she did have a \nvote. And she did pass, as I recall. She is now sitting as a judge. And \nI didn't hold her up, nor did I filibuster her, nor did I stand on this \nfloor and say she should not have a chance for a vote, which is what \nyour side--I should say, the Democrat side in this Chamber--is doing. I \nthink there is a lot of difference, a world of difference, between my \nvote which was\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\ncast sincerely. I have hardly voted against any judges since I have \nbeen here. I have been one of the strongest supporters of the Federal \njudiciary, if not the strongest supporter in this Chamber, ever since I \nhave been here.\n  I can say this: I still believe my vote was right. If it was wrong, I \napologize, but I didn't hold her up. I didn't filibuster her. I made \nsure she had a vote. And she got one, and she sits on the court today.\n  I can't ask a question, I guess, of the Senator, but I will just ask \nhim to think it through. There is really a difference between Rosemary \nBarkett's handling and Mr. Estrada's. He is not even getting a chance \nfor a vote. She did get her chance for a vote. I was one who helped her \nto get it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Now that the Senator from Utah knows that Judge Barkett \nis Hispanic, would he in any way characterize his own action as anti-\nHispanic?\n  Mr. HATCH. No. Nor am I characterizing yours that way. I have \ncharacterized it as anti-conservative Hispanic Republican, which is \ndifferent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators are advised not to address each \nother in the first person.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is a sincere last question. It is very important \nbecause I just got a phone call that I am going to be asked a question. \nFirst of all, I want to inform the Senator from Utah that in Oklahoma, \nour fastest growing population has been Hispanic for 25 years. I used \nto be a commercial pilot in Mexico. I know Hispanics.\n  When I was the mayor of Tulsa, we appointed the first Hispanic \ncommission anywhere in the Southwest. It is still there today.\n  Now, the question is this, and I am going to be asked this question \nthis weekend: Why was this Hispanic man, when nobody could question his \nqualifications, rejected? I have to answer this to the Hispanic \ncommission of Oklahoma Saturday. What shall I say?\n  Mr. HATCH. There is no legitimate reason. It is a double standard. It \nis unfair. It is unfair to him and to our President, and he should be \ngiven at least a vote up or down. If my colleagues want to vote against \nhim, that is their privilege. I would find no fault with that, even \nthough I would disagree. It is unfair to the process and to the Senate.\n  What is going on here is that for the first time in history, a true \nfilibuster is being waged against a nominee. It happens to be the first \nHispanic ever nominated to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Mr. INHOFE. One last question. You have answered it already, and this \nis not whether or not we want to vote for or against Miguel Estrada, \nbut does he deserve a vote, a public vote, on the floor of the Senate?\n  Mr. HATCH. Based upon the past history of this body, he deserves a \nvote. He is not getting it right now because of a filibuster for the \nfirst time in history. I have to say I decry that. That is not fair. It \nis a double standard. It is not right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I was an urban mayor of a vibrant, \ndiverse community, including Chicanos, Salvadorans, and Puerto Ricans. \nIs it true that Miguel Estrada was attacked by Democratic Hispanic \nMembers of the House as being Hispanic in name only?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, in essence, because he was basically accused of not \nbeing Hispanic enough. I believe he was accused of being Hispanic in \nname only. They even said he didn't give back enough to the community, \neven though this man worked his guts out to get to where he is as a \nHispanic lawyer in this country and deserves credit for it, and he is \nan idol and will be an idol to a lot of young people who want to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Is it true that Miguel Estrada--we have heard this \nbefore--came here as a teenager, learned to speak English, overcame a \ndisability, graduated with honors in college, graduated with honors \nmagna cum laude in law school, was editor of the law review, and he \ncame back to public service? Is it true, then, that he is supported by \nmany Hispanic organizations, really as a role model of the American \ndream?\n  Mr. HATCH. You should have heard the LULAC press conference this \nweek. It was truly remarkable. He was accused by his opponents of being \nvery unfair. LULAC happens to be the oldest Hispanic organization in \nthe country. I believe, if I am right, the head of LULAC is a Democrat. \nI may be wrong. He is outraged, by the way. With this double standard \nthat is going forth against Miguel Estrada, he is right to be outraged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Isn't the difference the Senator from New York \nsuggested about your comment about Judge Barkett and the situation with \nMiguel Estrada that Judge Barkett had an extensive record to analyze \nand you concluded by that record there was judicial activism? Is there \nany record that would lead any Member on the other side to suggest that \nMiguel Estrada would be a judicial activist?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course, he is not a judge. Rosemary Barkett was a judge \nand had written a number of legal opinions. Some of them I thought were \nwhacko and, frankly, were.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am still answering the question of the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will bet you are.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is there anything in Mr. Estrada's background that \nwould give you the opinion he would be a judicial activist on the \ncourt?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not any. In fact, even the Democrats who have known him \nhave been praising him and have supported him. I might add that I don't \nthink you would get better support than Ron Klain. There should not be \na Democrat on that side who doesn't believe he is an honest lawyer. \nThere should not be a Democrat on that side who doesn't accept Seth \nWaxman as a great lawyer, or one who doesn't believe Walter Dellinger \nis an exceedingly fine law professor, lawyer, and practicing attorney. \nThere should not be a Democrat who should disagree with the former \nAfrican-American Solicitor General of the United States.\n  I want to say this. I don't see any comparison with Rosemary Barkett \nat all. This man is not a judge. In accordance with the double \nstandard, it has been said he should not be a judge because he has no \njudicial experience. We just have proven there are all kinds of Clinton \njudges who had no prior judicial experience. Yet we put them through \nand they are serving well, as have literally hundreds of judges who \nnever had a day of judicial experience. It is just unfair, plain \nunfair.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Utah, when the Senator was \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and refused a hearing and \nvote for Enrique Moreno, who was rated well-qualified for an \nappointment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, was the chairman of \nthe committee, the Senator from Utah, aware of the fact that Mr. Moreno \nwas born in Juarez, Mexico, in the company clinic of a smelting plant \nwhere his father was employed; when he was 2 years old, his family \nemigrated to El Paso, TX, where Mr. Moreno attended school and his \nfather worked as a carpenter, his mother as a seamstress; he left El \nPaso to attend undergraduate and then law school at Harvard, and he\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\npracticed for 19 years? Was the Senator from Utah aware of that \nbackground when he would not give him an opportunity for even a hearing \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, or a vote before that committee, \nor on the floor of the Senate?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I believe the Senator is being very \noffensive. He normally is quite partisan but quite reasonable. He is \nbeing offensive because he keeps referring to me as denying him a vote \nin committee when, in fact, I have explained before that there was no \nconsultation. The Senators from Texas told me there was no \nconsultation, which they demand on their side all the time, and which \nwe demand on our side all the time, which I demanded of the Clinton \nadministration, and I demand of the Bush administration.\n\n  I think the Senator is being very unfair by trying to imply that I \ndeliberately kept Enrique Moreno, who may be all of these wonderful \nthings, and I assume that he is--I cannot recall all those details. I \nhave respect for him; I have tremendous respect for him. I would like \nto have seen him have a chance, had there been consultation. But I do \nrespect the home State Senators, and I think I respect the Democrat \nhome State Senators, too.\n  I have not even talked about the withholding of blue slips because \nthat was not the issue. The issue was consultation and, in this case, \nthere was zero, ``nada'' consultation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Wait a minute, I feel I have been unfairly attacked by the \nSenator, by someone who knows the process and I think ought to be fair \nand I think normally is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. No. Look, as chairman, I can only do certain things. I \nwill tell you this, I put through, as ranking member or chairman, 377 \nClinton judges, the second most judges confirmed for a President in \nhistory. The highest confirmed happened to be through President Reagan, \nand there were 382, 5 more. I believe that I would have put through \neven more than President Reagan or President Clinton had it not been \nfor Democrat holds on the floor against other Democrat nominees.\n  Let me go further because--let's be fair about it--President Reagan \nhad 6 years of his own party in control of the Senate, in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to help him get those 382 judges. President Clinton \nhad 6 years of the opposition party, and yet we gave him virtually the \nsame number as the all-time champion, President Reagan.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think my record shows I have not only been fair, I have \nbent over backwards. I will acknowledge that I have had problems on my \nside, just like your chairman when he was chairman, Senator Leahy, had \nproblems on his side with some who have always wanted to manipulate the \nsystem a little bit differently. But I was fair, and I do resent \nanybody implying that I was not fair.\n  In the case of Enrique Moreno, he would have had hearings had there \nbeen consultation, which I am sure the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois would be the first to raise if he was not consulted with \nregard to judges coming from his State.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Utah this question: \nHe has raised the issue of fairness when it comes to Hispanic nominees.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right, and I wanted fairness when you asked \nquestions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me finish the question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, finish it then.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator suggested it was fair for two Republican \nSenators from Texas to block a man like Enrique Moreno from even having \na hearing because that was their right.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is there a question there?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The question is coming. Is it not the right of Senators \nto raise questions on the floor about Miguel Estrada? Why is that \nunfair while the treatment of Enrique Moreno was fair? He did not even \nhave a hearing. Miguel Estrada had a hearing, an opportunity to answer \nquestions, and he refused to answer the questions. How is this fair to \nEnrique Moreno and unfair to Miguel Estrada?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I will tell you again. How many times do I have to repeat \nit for somebody who has been on the Judiciary Committee and ought to \nknow? If there was not consultation, you would be the first to say: I \nam not going to let that person go. Or you would be the first to \ncriticize the administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is reminded not to say ``you'' in \nthe first person.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me say this to the Chair. I have answered it about \nthree times now. Let's be fair about it. As chairman, I cannot do \neverything. All I can do is abide by the rules of the committee, which \nare that there has to be consultation, not phony requests for \nconsultation. You have to at least consult. They did not even consult.\n  I wrote a letter to the then-counsel, bless his departed soul, Chuck \nRuff, for whom I happened to care a great deal, and there are very \ngreat reasons I do. He was a great lawyer, and I got along well with \nhim. I said: You did not consult and they did not. He basically \nadmitted it. Those two Senators were well within their rights to say: \nWe are not going to have him if we are not going to get consultation. \nAnd they were within their rights.\n  As chairman, I had no choice other than to do that. I think the \nSenator knows that. That is why I believe the questions are very unfair \nto me.\n  Now, I will admit, Miguel Estrada was given a hearing by the \nDemocrats. Senator Schumer presided over it, and there was more than \none Democratic Senator present. It was a fair hearing. I believe it \nwas. It went from about 10 in the morning to 5:30 at night, longer than \nmost hearings. They asked every question they wanted to ask.\n  I assumed the Democrats believed they were going to win the election \nand therefore they would never have to have Miguel Estrada come up for \na vote any time. When we won the election, suddenly I got a request for \nconfidential documents of the Solicitor General. I should say the White \nHouse got that request the day before the hearing. He has had a \nhearing. He has had a vote in committee. He has come out of the \ncommittee.\n  He is now on the floor, and now we find this situation where for the \nfirst time in history, a circuit court of appeals nominee is being \ndenied a right to an up-or-down vote. That is abysmal. And he just \nhappens to be the first Hispanic nominee to the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia. I think it is wrong. I think it \nis unfair. I think it is unfair to the President. It is unfair to him. \nIt is unfair to the Senate. It is unfair to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. It is unfair, I think, to the whole process.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask this question in relation to Richard Paez, and I \nwill not go to the question of the cloture vote necessary to bring him \nto the floor, but I ask the then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee if it was fair to Richard Paez, nominated by the President, \nto the Ninth Circuit, well-qualified by the ABA, to have waited 3 years \nand then to have faced a motion to proceed on the floor which the \nSenator from Utah and a majority of the Republicans voted against after \nthis man had waited for 3 years for a vote? Was that fair to Richard \nPaez?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. There were plenty of reasons Richard Paez was held up by \npeople on our side. He had ruled in a number of cases in ways that \nappeared to be, and I think was, in fact, activist judging. Without my \nsupport, Richard Paez would not be sitting on the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. So, again, I feel impugned by the question because without \nme going to bat for him, which I did, without me fighting for him on \nthe floor, which I did, without me giving him a vote, which I did--\nwhich you are not; I should say the Democratic side is not--he would \nnot be sitting on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and he knows it \nand you know it--every Democrat on the other side knows it.\n  Unfortunately, I want to talk personally to my colleagues. I will do \nit\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\nthrough the mechanism of the Chair. But the fact is, had I not \nsupported him, he did not have a chance to be on the court because \nthere were many people who believed he was an activist judge and, I \nhave to confess, it was a close question.\n  I finally asked him to come visit with me. I sat down with him. He is \na nice man. He is a good man. I have to admit, I felt he was an \nactivist judge. But I also felt he was a good man.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just finish. I told him I would support him, and I \ndid. Unlike this particular situation, he got his vote and he passed \nwith my support, which would never have happened without it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for one final question? I promise \nI will not ask any further questions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In the case of Richard Paez, a Hispanic nominee who \nwaited over 4 years for a vote, was there ever a time when Richard Paez \nrefused to answer questions you posed to him?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not that I know of.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Was he evasive to you or did he try to in any way conceal \nhis true background and true record? Was there ever an instance of \nthat?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have to say we did not try to destroy the man. We did \nnot try to ask questions that were improper. We did not try to ask him \nhis opinions on how he was going to vote, all of which was done with \nMiguel Estrada, and he refused to answer those kind of questions, as he \nshould have, as anybody who reads Lloyd Cutler would agree he should \nhave.\n  I refer you to the President's letter which I am going to get to in a \nminute, if my colleagues will allow me to, because I want to make a \nstatement before we finish this evening. In all honesty, Miguel has not \nbeen treated very fairly and he is certainly not being treated fairly \nby a filibuster--or should I say the ``filibustero''?--on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, with respect to the Paez and Berzon \nmatters, I ask the chairman if he remembers I was one who questioned \nthose nominees and he made a decision in both of those cases to support \nthem after serious thought was given to it?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is it not a fact the Republican majority leader, Trent \nLott, was the one who moved for cloture on Paez and Berzon?\n  Mr. HATCH. No question about it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The vote was 86 to 14, and 85 to 13 to invoke cloture, \nand I supported cloture even though I opposed the nominees?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. I have to say our side was fair to Mr. \nPaez in the end. Admittedly, I wish it did not have to be delayed that \nlong, but in all honesty he was treated fairly in the end. I wish it \nhad been earlier, but I have to say I had my own qualms and my own \nquestions and there were plenty of reasons for that. There were people \nall over California who did not want him on the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which is considered one of the most activist courts in the \ncountry, because of the ``activist'' decisions he was making in \ncontradistinction to what California law really was. Prior to each and \nevery cloture vote in the past which has been mentioned, the Senators \nin the leadership on our side agreed to provide enough votes to invoke \ncloture before the cloture petitions were even filed on these Democrat \nnominees.\n  I wish my colleagues on the other side would agree to that precedent \nin relation to the cloture votes they keep referring to. Would they \nassure us, as we did them, that their side will provide enough votes to \ninvoke cloture before we even file a cloture petition for Estrada? That \nis what we did for Judge Paez and now Judge Berzon.\n  So there was no real filibuster. You cannot call that a filibuster. \nWe provided the necessary votes for them to get votes on the floor, and \nthey did get their votes up or down. That is something Miguel Estrada \nis being denied right now.\n  Where is the fairness? I do not see any fairness in that. Why should \nhe be denied the same privileges we gave to two people most every \nRepublican disagreed with, but nevertheless gave them a vote and they \nare now both sitting on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals?\n\n  I have to tell you I had much angst and many upset stomachs that \noccurred because of these two nominees, but I voted for both. Without \nme, neither of them would have made the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nIt is just that simple.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, to follow up on that question, I felt \nstrongly about those nominees. I did not dislike them personally, but I \nfelt Paez and Berzon were activists. In fact, their writings clearly \nindicated that.\n  Is it not a fact both Paez and Berzon, in separate opinions, have \ndeclared the longstanding ``three strikes you're out'' law in \nCalifornia unconstitutional? And I think one of them has been reversed \nalready by the Supreme Court more than once?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is my recollection. And I have to say there are those \nwho believe at least one, if not both, are activists on the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, which is virtually reversed every time by the \nSupreme Court. It is the most reversed court of appeals in the country.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to ask my friend from Utah a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure, without losing my right to floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My friend from Utah just characterized the kinds of \nquestions, such as what are your opinions of court cases, in an attempt \nto destroy the career of Mr. Estrada. I would like to ask the Senator, \nyou were just talking about Judge Paez with Senator Sessions. I ask the \nSenator, my friend from Utah, if you recall some of the questions \nSenator Sessions asked Richard Paez: In your opinion, what is the \ngreatest Supreme Court decision in American history? What is the worst \nSupreme Court case?\n  I would ask my colleague two questions. Was Senator Sessions \nattempting to destroy the career of Richard Paez? Second, does he \nrecall that instead of saying, I cannot answer that, Senator Paez gave \nanswers to both of those questions?\n  Mr. HATCH. Do you mean Judge Paez?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Now Judge Paez.\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe it is within the power of each Senator on the \nJudiciary Committee to ask any question they want to, no matter how \nstupid they may be, and we have had plenty of stupid questions from \nboth sides, to be honest with you.\n  I do not think those are stupid questions. Nor did I think the \nSenator's questions when he basically asked Miguel Estrada this \nquestion, can you think of any cases in the last 40 years with which \nyou disagree with the Supreme Court, nor do I find fault with Mr. \nEstrada saying, no, I do not. You and I might. I could think of some \ncases where we have passed laws. I was the cosponsor of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. I did not like to see it overturned. On the other \nhand, I do understand why it was and I do think it was a legitimate \ndecision even though I may have disagreed with it at the time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am glad to see we are not destroying careers by asking \nthose kinds of questions.\n  Mr. HATCH. The only way we are destroying careers, in all fairness, \nis by having filibusters, not by having up-or-down votes. If we distort \nthe record of people, I think that--I think both sides have done that \nfrom time to time, I am not saying deliberately, but nevertheless there \nhave been some times where I think the Senate has not acted in the best \nform.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I was pursuing this line of questioning before, and then \nsomehow we turned to other people to ask questions. But when I asked my \ncolleague before how he could say this about Judge Barkett, which is a \nreasonable thing for him to say--I do not\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\nbegrudge him one bit. I do not think he has an ounce of discrimination \nin his body--how that was not anti-Hispanic, but opposing Judge Estrada \nwas anti-Hispanic, he prefaced his remarks by saying, well, you are \nopposing not Hispanics but conservative Hispanics; you are anti-\nconservative Hispanics--was my friend from Utah being anti-liberal \nHispanic when he opposed Judge Barkett or was he simply ignoring the \nfact that she was Hispanic--he said he did not even know--and instead \nopposing her on her views and her record, something at least to this \nSenator is not only legitimate but an obligation to know about the \nviews and the record? So I would like to--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is reminded to address the Senator \nthrough the Chair and in the third person.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask my colleague, the Senator from Utah, how one \nis any different from the other. And isn't, as it seems to most of us, \none the mirror image of the other, either exactly blasphemous or \nequally pure?\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe the Senators can ask any questions they want. \nLike I say, no matter how dumb or stupid or intelligent or alert they \nare--I have seen both. In the case of Rosemary Barkett, I confess I \nnever knew she was Hispanic. And even if I did, it would be irrelevant \nto me. Nor have I accused any Democrat of being prejudiced against \nMiguel Estrada because he is Hispanic. I do not believe that. I do not \nbelieve there is a prejudiced bone over there. I do not believe there \nis over here either. But I have said I believe our colleagues on the \nother side are filibustering because Miguel Estrada is a Hispanic \nRepublican conservative nominated by President Bush, a Republican \nPresident.\n  I have also said I believe one of the reasons why there is such a \nvicious fight to stop him from going on the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia is because my colleagues on the other side believe \nhe is conservative, and believe he might tip the balance of the court. \nThat is what we get when we get a President. That is what we get when \nwe vote.\n\n  If my colleagues on the other side disagree with Miguel Estrada, you \nhave every right to vote against him. I think you shouldn't. There is \nno reason at all. I don't see one substantive reason so far, advanced \nby the minority, why he shouldn't sit on the court. Certainly, the fact \nhe has no judicial experience in the eyes of the Democrats, that is not \na valid reason.\n  Since we are talking about things I may have said about Clinton \nnominees, I have been in on hundreds, if not thousands, of judges since \nI have been in the Senate. Let me remind the Senator from New York what \nI said prior to the cloture vote on one Clinton nominee. I said: I \npersonally do not want to filibuster Federal judges. The President won \nthe election. He ought to have the right to appoint the judges he \nwants. I believe that with every fiber of my being. I think that is \nwhat you get when you get a President.\n  I didn't think most of President Clinton's judges--I would not have \nappointed most of them if I were President, but I was not President. \nAnd I submit I don't believe the distinguished Senator from New York \nwould probably nominate the same judges as President Bush, but \nPresident Bush deserves the courtesy of having his judges voted up and \ndown, and that is a courtesy not being granted for the first time in \nhistory.\n  When the minority mentions some cloture votes, we have no majority to \nmake sure it is invoked. There was no filibuster to make sure the \nnominees get a vote up and down. I would be happy if my friends on the \nother side would do the same for this fine nominee, even if you \ndisagree, and then vote no as some colleagues did. I voted yes on some \nof the most controversial judges because I start with the premise that \nthe President deserves support, whoever the President is, as long as \nthe nominee is qualified.\n  As much as I disagreed with Marsha Berzon, she was very qualified. \nShe was one of the top labor lawyers in the country. I admit, some of \nmy colleagues did not feel the same way as I did. I led the fight to \nput her on the bench. She personally came to me and thanked me, as did \nJudge Paez.\n  I would like to see the same fair treatment to Miguel Estrada. I \ndon't see it here. I think I made a pretty good case it is not here and \nthere is nothing fair about this process.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague from Utah will yield for a final \nquestion.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. One judge nominated to the same DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, Mr. Snyder--a fine judge, well respected, the highest ABA \nrating, same thing as Miguel Estrada in a lot of ways--never got a \nhearing, he never got a vote. He is from DC. There were no home State \nSenators to object to him, unlike Mr. Moreno.\n  I ask my colleague, why wasn't it very unfair not to let Mr. Snyder \nhave a vote on the very same circuit to which we are debating Miguel \nEstrada's entrance?\n  Mr. HATCH. I cannot answer that other than to say I wish we could \nhave. He was not named for the 11th seat on the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia, in contrast to Mr. Estrada who \nwas nominated for the ninth seat. There is a real difference because \nthere was a question whether the 11th and 12th seats at that time \nshould have been filled. But the ninth seat certainly should be filled, \nand everyone I know agrees with that, including people on the Democrat \nside.\n\n  I wish I could have gotten them all through, to be honest. To also be \nhonest, I don't know of an end of session where any Judiciary Committee \nhas been able to get them all through. Frankly, I think you can go back \nin time and find more nominees left hanging when the Democrats \ncontrolled the committee at the end of the first Bush administration \nthan we left at the end of the Clinton administration. You could go \nthrough all the statistics and criticize all you want and some \ncriticisms are justified.\n  I wish we could have done a better job back then when I was on the \nJudiciary Committee. I give an illustration. Tomorrow we have a markup \non three circuit court of appeals nominees. Some have indicated the \nDemocrats will filibuster the markup. One person on that markup is Mr. \nRoberts, who has been sitting there for 11 years. Mr. Paez sat there \nfor 4 years, but he got a vote and he is now sitting on the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Roberts has been sitting there for 11 \nyears and has had three nominations by two different Presidents and is \nconsidered one of the two greatest appellate lawyers in the country by \nSupreme Court Justices and many others. There is not anything you can \nfind against him other than he is appointed by President Bush, a \nRepublican President, and he may be conservative. I don't know whether \nhe is or is not, but he has been held up for 11 years through three \nnominations.\n  I have been informed that there may be a filibuster in committee \ntomorrow. That would be the first filibuster that I have seen in my 27 \nyears on the Judiciary Committee. If that is true--I cannot believe it \nis true. I believe my colleagues would allow votes and allow them to \ncome to the floor in an orderly fashion. I have to say that I hope that \nis not true. If that is true, then I think any reasonable person can \nconclude that my colleagues on the other side are not willing to do \ntheir constitutional duty to fill the courts with the President's \nnominees.\n  I will stay here all night and debate my record with the Senator from \nNew York or anyone else, but this has nothing to do with the----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am answering a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will stay all night to debate my record in comparison to \nany Democratic record. That has nothing to do with whether or not \nMiguel Estrada should be confirmed. The only thing that has to do with \nis whether we vote. And I think it would be very unfair not to vote up \nor down on Miguel Estrada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask my final question. I have so many but I know the \nhour is late.\n  Mr. HATCH. I add one last thing on that. I cannot see any reason for \nthis action against Miguel Estrada unless,\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\nof course, the opposition to Mr. Estrada, based upon what I have been \nhearing tonight, is really retribution for perceived past wrongs \nperpetrated against Clinton nominees when I was, in fact, one of the \nbest assets you had in getting nominees through. I took a lot of \ncriticism from the conservative right who I told to get lost, I have to \nsay, in contrast to what I think is the liberal left who seem to have \nlockjaw control over my colleagues on the other side.\n  I yield for a question as long as I don't lose my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The final question in relation to the hearing tomorrow, \nwould the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Utah, just give \nus 1 day of questions for Mr. Roberts? As the Senator well knows, we \nhad an unprecedented three court of appeals nominees before us in 1 \nday--all three controversial, all three very erudite. We never had that \nbefore. We took all day.\n  To his credit, our chairman waited until 9:30 but that is when the \nquestions finished with Mr. Sutton and one of the reasons many Members \nfind difficulty voting on Judge Roberts, who is a brilliant man. I \nwould just like to ask some questions. We have not had a chance to ask \nquestions.\n  I ask my colleague, if you give us 1 day of hearings on Judge \nRoberts, we would agree to vote the very next day. Would that be \nacceptable to the Senator?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course not. Because we had a full day of hearings. Mr. \nRoberts was there, Mr. Sutton was there, Justice Cook was there. We \nwent from 9:30 that morning to 9:30 at night, and I was prepared to \nstay all night if I had to. Any Senator could have come and asked any \nquestions they wanted. Many Senators asked all the questions they \nwanted to at that time. Afterwards we kept the record open for Senators \nto read and review the record and submit any written questions that \nthey wanted. We have had 2 weeks to do that.\n\n  There comes a time when you have to say let's treat these people \nfairly.\n  I know there is no reason in the world to hold up Mr. Roberts or the \nother two either. The fact that my colleagues spend all their time--not \nall their time but enough of their time interrogating Mr. Sutton, they \nstill interrogated Mr. Roberts and Justice Cook. I think we should \nproceed and I think it is fair to proceed. I think the Senator said it \nright when he said he is a distinguished appellate lawyer, one of the \nbest in the history of the country. I don't see any reason for the \ndelays in these matters.\n  I was open, as I have always been, to any questions that the Senators \nfrom the other side wanted to ask. We stayed there for a very lengthy \nhearing.\n  Look, fair is fair. Let's treat these people fairly.\n  I hope my colleagues will not filibuster tomorrow because that will \nbe the first time I recall a filibuster in the committee. If that is \nso, then it is clear that we have the politics of mass obstruction--\nwhich politics were suggested by two very ultraliberal law professors \nat a Democrat retreat in 2001. If that is true, then this is all part \nof the game, to slow down everything in the judiciary no matter how \nmany emergencies we have, and we have plenty, and to stop President \nBush from having his judges confirmed.\n  I don't think it is fair. I don't think anybody else who watches it \nthinks it is fair. I call upon my good friends to be fair.\n  I have to say, I like everybody in this body. I care for everybody in \nthis body. I care for my friend from New York and he knows it. I know \nhe cares for me. But it is time to wrap it up and say, look, you have \nhad your shot. And knowing you, you always take your shot. I should not \nbe talking to you personally, I acknowledge to the Chair. My friend \nfrom New York is not known for shyness, but he is known as a fair \nperson and he is known as a good lawyer, at least by me. I am asking \nhim to help be a leader on that committee. I am asking the \ndistinguished Senator from New York and others to be leaders on this \ncommittee, to help us do our job, to help fill these courts.\n  Yes, you may not like him. My colleagues on the other side might not \nlike the nominees of President Bush any more than we liked the nominees \nof President Clinton. But I put them through. Like I say, President \nClinton, he would have been the all-time champion in confirmation had \nit not been for Democratic holds on your side. So I think we were fair. \nI would like you to be fair to our people.\n  If there are no further questions, I would like to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield for one \nquestion.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to the Senator, I know in the heat of this debate \nsome on the other side have seemingly questioned the fairness of your \nleadership. I know they have not had the opportunity to be in \nRepublican conference when you have been absolutely consistent with the \nviews you expressed here on the floor to the Republicans who may have \nhad different views. Would you share with us what you have advised \nRepublicans in meetings about the impropriety of filibusters and how \nyou have been consistent in that and other issues that arise on matters \nhere today?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for asking that question because \neverybody knows, including my friends on the other side, that I argued \nvociferously against the few who wanted to filibuster on our side.\n  I expect my colleagues in good faith to argue on their side against \nthat. It is a dangerous thing to do. It is a wretched thing to do, \nfilibuster a judge. It is the first time in history. If they want to \nfilibuster some judges, why would they pick on the first Hispanic ever \nnominated to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, \na man who suffers from a disability yet rose to the top of his \nprofession. He came up the hard way. He fulfilled the American dream, a \nman who is an example to every young Hispanic person in this country, \nand to me. He is an example to me, and I think everybody in this body.\n  Why wouldn't we let this fellow have an up-or-down vote like we \nalways did? We always made sure that, regardless of the reason for a \ncloture vote, we made sure that cloture was invoked and a vote up or \ndown occurred.\n  I have to say, I think there is an element of unfairness here that I \nhave not seen in my 27 years in the Senate. It is a shame that it is \nhappening against the first Hispanic ever nominated to the Circuit \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia, who has not had a glove \nlaid on him. And because they can't find anything wrong, they want to \ngo on fishing expeditions long after they held their hearing, and then \ntry to justify this holdup and this filibuster for those reasons. It is \nunbelievable to me.\n  Look, I made this point before and I am going to make it one more \ntime and I hope everybody in America watches this. The Senate Democrats \nheld a retreat. They can't deny this. It has been reported thoroughly. \nThey were given suggestions by at least two very liberal law \nprofessors. Once President Bush became elected, these law professors, \nwanting to promote only their ideology, suggested that, No. 1, bottle \nup the nominees in committee. If we have a filibuster tomorrow, they \nare fulfilling that part of their suggestions of mass obstruction.\n  We have a filibuster now here on the floor, but I will get to that. \nThen they said: If you can't bottle them up in committee, then inject \nideology into the confirmation process, and that is exactly what has \nhappened. Some of the Senators on the other side have demanded to know \nthe ideology of the nominees, as if that is relevant. And every \nnominee, and especially Miguel Estrada, if you read his answers to \nquestions, has said we will abide by prior precedent. We will observe \nthe principle of stare decisis. We will rule in accordance with the law \nand with the rule of law. So there is no reason to inject ideology \nbecause they said they would put their own personal beliefs aside. \nMiguel Estrada said that on numerous occasions in response to questions \nby the Democrats.\n  If they can't win on injecting ideology, and we are seeing that at \nevery step of the way here now, then seek all unpublished opinions. I \nwill never forget Dennis Shedd. He was chief of staff to Senator \nThurmond on this committee, one of the nicest people we have ever had \nwork on this committee. \n\n[[Page S2328]]\n\nI would compare him to Ron Klain, two really nice guys, two really \nsmart guys, two really decent people, two wonderful attorneys. Ron \nKlain was Al Gore's top aide, and at the time I believe he worked on \nthe Judiciary Committee. I can't remember which Senator he worked for \nat the time, but he went throughout the whole campaign with Al Gore. He \nwas one of his top advisers. He is one of the top lawyers in this city \nand he is a personal friend. I admire him.\n\n  But when they couldn't get Judge Shedd in any other way, they \nrequested all his unpublished opinions. He has been serving for over 10 \nyears. Where are those unpublished opinions? Published opinions are \nwhere the judge writes an opinion and it becomes published and printed \nin some law book. Unpublished opinions are stored in repositories. To \nget 10 years of unpublished opinions took thousands and thousands of \nhours, an estimated $75,000. They had to go to Atlanta, as I recall, to \ndo this, all for the purposes of a fishing expedition, hoping to find \njust something to hang on Dennis Shedd, who is a well-respected Federal \ndistrict court judge. That is the kind of crap they had to go through.\n  I understand one of these professors at that infamous retreat will be \nhere tomorrow to speak to the Democrats and possibly continue to \nmisguide them.\n  Then they said if bottling him up in committee doesn't fully work--of \ncourse it will work for a while, which we may see tomorrow if they \nfilibuster these judges, inserting ideology into the confirmation \nprocess. If that doesn't work then, if they are judges, seek all \nunpublished opinions and see if you can find something to pin on them \nto defeat them. If that doesn't work, then do this: Seek privileged \ninternal memoranda, which they are trying to do in this case without \none ounce of justification, to try and get into the actual memoranda \nwritten by Miguel Estrada in his job, in his duty as an Assistant \nSolicitor in the United States Solicitor General's Office, in three \nareas: his recommendations on appeal, his recommendations on certiaria, \nand his recommendations on amicus curae matters. Never in the history \nof the Justice Department has the Solicitor General's Office ever been \nwilling to give up those privileged documents; and they shouldn't. It \nis the phoniest, most unjustified request that I have seen in a long \ntime, and I have seen a lot of phony, unjustified requests.\n\n  If all of that doesn't work--if bottling up doesn't work, injecting \nideology, seeking all unpublished opinions, and if you can't get \nprivileged, unpublished memoranda, then these law professors said to \nfilibuster--for the first time in the history of the country, \nfilibuster.\n  That is what we are going through right now. Isn't it a crime--well, \nmaybe that is too harsh. Isn't it a shame and even despicable that they \nare filibustering the first Hispanic nominee for the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia who has lived the American dream, \nwho has the highest rating possible unanimously--and it is their gold \nstandard--of the American Bar Association.\n  It is absolutely amazing that we are going through this. We have now \nbeen doing it for over a week. You would think this is a Supreme Court \nnominee. Of course, that is part of this. The whole purpose of giving \nMiguel Estrada a rough time is to say, Mr. Estrada, we don't want your \nkind on the Supreme Court.\n  That is really what the bottom line is here. That is why these \nprofessors are doing that--because this President has nominated some of \nthe greatest lawyers in the history of the country on the circuit court \nof appeals. And every one of them has to be considered ultimately for \nthe Supreme Court.\n  But this is a shot across the bow right now--that you had better \ndarned well conform to a particular ideology or you are just not going \nto make it.\n  I hope our colleagues, those with clear minds and fair attitudes, \nwill prevail on that side, as we had to prevail on this side against \nfilibustering. If they don't, ``Katie bar the door,'' because I am not \nsure I will be around next time to stop the filibusters--not to say \nthat I am all that important. But the fact is, I did stop them the last \ntime. There were only a few who wanted to do that. The vast majority of \nthe Republicans said that would be awful, and I think the vast majority \nof Democrats ought to say the same. I think they ought to wake up and \nrealize what they are doing. It is wrong. It is not fair to this \nPresident. I admit many of them do not like this President, but he is \nthe President. It is unfair to the Judiciary Committee who voted this \nman out of committee. It is unfair to the process, which has always had \nan up-or-down vote once the person has been brought up on the floor. It \nis unfair to Miguel Estrada.\n  I think I have said all that I care to say this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Miguel Estrada, who has been nominated by our President to serve on \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit.\n  Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution provides the President with \nthe authority to nominate, with the ``Advice and Consent of the \nSenate,'' individuals to serve as judges on the Federal courts. Thus, \nthe Constitution provides a role for both the President and the Senate \nin this process. The President has the power to nominate, and the \nSenate has the power to render ``Advice and Consent'' on the \nnomination.\n  Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution places the composition of \nour Judiciary entirely in the hands of the President and the Senate. \nTherefore, in order for our Judiciary to effectively administer \njustice, it is incumbent upon the ability of the Executive and the \nLegislative branches of Government to work together.\n  Throughout the quarter century I have had the honor of representing \nthe Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States Senate, I have \nconscientiously made the effort to work on judicial nominations with \nthe Presidents with whom I have served. Whether our President was \nPresident Carter, President Reagan, President Bush, President Clinton, \nor President George W. Bush, I have accorded equal weight to the \nnominations of all Presidents, irrespective of party.\n  Based on the last several years, I am concerned that we as a body are \nno longer according equal weight to the nominations of our Presidents \nirrespective of party. The process has become highly politicized and, \nas a result, we are ultimately discouraging highly qualified nominees \nfrom serving in our Judiciary.\n  If we as a Senate continue to let partisanship remain the hallmark of \nthe Senate's judicial confirmation process, and we hold up judicial \nnominees based on their party affiliation, then our judiciary will \nsuffer.\n  Throughout my 25 years in the United States Senate, I have always \ncarefully scrutinized judicial nominees and considered a number of \nfactors before casting my vote to confirm or reject.\n  The nominee's character, professional career, experience, integrity, \nand temperament are all important factors. In addition, I consider \nwhether the nominee is likely to interpret law according to precedent \nor impose his or her own views. The opinions of the officials from the \nState in which the nominee would serve and the views of my fellow \nVirginians are also important. In addition, I believe our Judiciary \nshould reflect the broad diversity of the citizens in serves.\n  These principles have served well as I have scrutinized the records \nof over a thousand judicial nominees. One most recent instance that is \nimportant for us to remember is my support for the nomination of Judge \nGregory to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  Judge Gregory was first nominated by President Clinton and \nsubsequently nominated by President Bush. Regardless of which President \nnominated Judge Gregory, the fact is that he was highly qualified for \nthe federal bench. Therefore, I supported his nomination when President \nClinton nominated him late in the 106th Congress, and when President \nBush nominated him early in the 107th Congress. Judge Gregory is now \nthe first African American Judge to ever serve on the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and he is serving with \ndistinction.\n  Judge Gregory's qualifications were clear-cut. Regardless of which \nPresident nominated him, he deserved the support of the United States \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\n  The same is true with the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n  Mr. Estrada has received a unanimous ranking of ``Well Qualified'' by \nthe American Bar Association. And, in my view, his record indicates \nthat he will serve as an excellent jurist.\n  Mr. Estrada's resume is an impressive one. Born in Honduras, Miguel \nEstrada came to the United States at the age of 17. At the time, he was \nable to speak only a little English. But just 5 years after he came to \nthe United States, he graduated from Columbia College with Phi Beta \nKappa honors.\n  Three years after he graduated from Columbia, Mr. Estrada graduated \nfrom Harvard Law School where he was an editor of the Harvard Law \nReview.\n  Mr. Estrada then went on to serve as a law clerk to a Judge on the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit and as a law clerk \nto Judge Kennedy on the United States Supreme Court.\n  After his clerkships, Mr. Estrada worked as an Assistant United \nStates Attorney, as an assistant to the Solicitor General in the \nDepartment of Justice, and in private practice for two prestigious law \nfirms.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Estrada has prosecuted numerous cases \nbefore Federal district courts and Federal appeals courts, and he has \nargued 15 cases before the United States Supreme Court.\n  Without a doubt, Mr. Estrada's legal credentials make him well \nqualified for the position to which he was nominated. I am thankful for \nhis willingness to resume his public service, and I am confident that \nhe would serve as an excellent jurist.\n  Mr. President, Miguel Estrada's nomination is a clear-cut case. I \nurge the Senate to confirm his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the audience has dwindled since this \nphase of this debate started at 9 o'clock. I apologize to the Presiding \nOfficer and to the staff that has been here for 2 workdays already \ntoday. But it would certainly be unfair to the people who we represent \non this side of the aisle for me not to say a few words to counteract \nand rebut the statements they have made for 3 hours.\n  First, I like President Bush. I certainly disagree with what my \nfriend from Utah has said--that people over here dislike the President. \nI don't know if that is the case. President Bush is one of the most \nlikable people I have ever met. I don't agree with a significant number \nof policies that he has enunciated, but that has nothing to do with \ndisliking President Bush. This debate has everything to do with our \nconstitutional prerogative under article II, section 2, of the \nConstitution that requires Senators to review the judicial nominations \nsent to us by the President of the United States. We have a right, we \nhave an obligation to do that.\n  I will talk about a number of issues, but the first thing I want to \ntalk about is the fact that cloture or filibusters on judicial \nnominations are well-established precedents; they have been long-\nestablished in this body and are appropriate in the context of Senate's \nConstitutional responsibility to advise and consent. There is no \nquestion that the use of filibusters has increased in recent years.\n  The Congressional Research Service reports that filibuster and \ncloture are used much more regularly today than at any time in the \nSenate's past. Approximately two-thirds of all identifiable Senate \nfilibusters have occurred since 1970. Cloture was sought most \nfrequently on nominations in the 103rd Congress; that is, in 1993-1994 \nwhen the House and the Senate were controlled by the Democrats, and the \nRepublicans used the filibuster and cloture as the tool of the \nminority. In that Congress, cloture was sought on 12 nominations--\njudicial and otherwise, and invoked in only 4.\n  Cloture votes on judicial nominees are well precedented in recent \nhistory. Both Democrats and Republicans have sought cloture in response \nto debate on judicial nominations since the cloture rule extended to \nnominations in 1949. Cloture was not sought on the nominations until \n1968 because prior to that concerns over nominations were resolved, or \nthe nominee was defeated behind closed doors.\n  Since that time, all Senators who have served in this body have \nrecognized that things have changed a great deal since 1968. There were \nvery few votes, period, in the Senate in those early days. Now we have \nhundreds of votes in every session. From 1968 to 2000, there were 17 \ncloture attempts on judicial nominees. Of the 17 cloture attempts on \njudicial nominations, in 6 of them the Democrats were in the majority \nand in 7 of them the Republicans were in the majority. Of the 17 \ncloture attempts, 2 involved nominees to the U.S. district courts, 8 \ninvolved nominees to the U.S. court of appeals, and 3 involved \nnominations to U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Opposition to judicial nominations have been based on objections to \njudicial philosophy of the nominee, concerns that the nominee would \ntreat all parties fairly on procedural grounds, and, in this instance, \nI might add, for lack of having information on the nomination given us \nby the President.\n  There is ample precedent for filibustering judicial nominations. \nBased on cloture votes, there have been, as I have stated, 17 \nfilibusters on judicial nominations. Often there is extended debate on \nthe nomination.\n\n  For example, the nomination of Clement Haynesworth to the U.S. \nSupreme Court was defeated after lengthy debate--7 days of debate. The \nnomination of G. Harrold Carswell to the U.S. Supreme Court was \ndefeated after 12 days of debate in 1970. The nomination of Robert Bork \nto the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987 was defeated after 8 days of debate.\n  So when the majority says that filibuster on judicial nominations is \nwithout precedent, ask them about the filibuster led by Senator \nThurmond--recently retired--in 1968 on the nomination of Justice Abe \nFortas to be Chief Justice of the United States. Ask the majority about \nthe filibuster in 1994 on the nominations, as we have heard tonight, on \nBarkett and Sarokin. Ask them about the nomination of Berzon, and Paez \nto the Ninth Circuit, and the scores of other judicial nominations that \nwere held up by using extreme delaying tactics when the Republicans \nwere in charge.\n  I stated earlier that of the 79 Clinton judicial nominations not \nconfirmed in the first Congress, there were 31 circuit and 48 district \ncourt nominees. Fifty-nine of these were never allowed a vote by the \nRepublican-controlled Senate--59 out of the 31 circuit and 48 district \ncourt judges. Out of the 79 judges, 59 of them weren't even allowed a \nvote. The Republicans didn't have to worry about a filibuster. They \nsimply didn't bring up President Clinton's nominees.\n  As I have indicated, being more specific, 31 circuit court nominees \nand 22 were blocked from getting the vote and being confirmed. And I \nread into the Record all the names of the district court judges who \nsimply were blocked from getting a vote and were not confirmed. I also \nread into the Record circuit court nominees who were not given an \nopportunity to be voted on, and certainly were not confirmed.\n\n  Now, it was the Framers' intent that we do exactly what we are doing \nnow. And there have been a number of writings on that. It is very \nimportant we understand that what is being done here does not happen \nvery often, but it does happen, Mr. President.\n  I personally--other than this right here--have been involved in only \none other filibuster involved in nuclear waste. I am told that I hold \nthe record as a first-year Senator for the longest filibuster in the \nhistory of the country. So I know what a filibuster is. Most Senators \nhave never been involved in a filibuster. We have one here.\n  Why? Because we are in an area where we really do believe that the \nperson who is being asked--Miguel Estrada--to be confirmed as a member \nof the DC Circuit is a person from whom we are entitled to get some \ninformation.\n  As I said to the majority leader, personally, and I have said \npublicly, there are only a few things that can be done in the \nprocedural posture of which the Senate is now engaged. These are not in \norder of priority: No. 1, pull the nomination. No. 2, the leader or \nanyone can get a petition signed for cloture and try to invoke cloture. \nOr it would seem to me the other thing that we could do is have this \nman, who said he does not care, prevail upon the President to say: Give \nthem those memos I wrote while I worked at the Solicitor\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\nGeneral's Office. It has been done before, he should say. It has been \ndone with Chief Justice Rehnquist. Senator Leahy has the stack of those \nmemos provided in Rehnquist's case. He wanted to become Chief Justice, \nJudge Rehnquist did. We said: We want to see those records, those \nsolicitor general memoranda. We got them. We reviewed those. It has \nbeen done in other cases. So there is certainly precedent for that. \nSimilarly we should be privy to Mr. Estrada's memoranda; Mr. Estrada \nshould answer our questions.\n  I know my friend, the distinguished Senator from Utah, has stated: I \nhave a book here with all the answers to these questions.\n  Well, earlier today, I compared Miguel Estrada's answers to the \nquestions to a series of answers my grandson gave to questions my son \nasked him. He just turned 3 years old. And I will repeat it.\n  We have a home in Nevada. It is new. It is in Searchlight, NV. We \nhave some new furniture in our new home. And we had my grandchildren \nand some of my boys there. And my little grandson, Wyatt, wrote on one \nof the couches with a pen. So his dad was upset, and he began to \ninterrogate his son, my grandson.\n  He said: Did you do this? And little Wyatt said: No. So my son, \nbecoming more concentrated in his interrogation of this 3-year-old boy, \nsaid: Well, who did it, then? And my 3-year-old grandson said: I don't \nremember his name.\n  Well, that is like the answers we have gotten from Miguel Estrada. \nThey are answers that I compare to my grandson's answers. Sure, he said \nsomething. My grandson gave an answer. And if you printed that out in a \nbook, it would fill up a sentence or so. And Miguel Estrada has filled \nup a book answering questions by not answering.\n  When we were in the majority, we could have stopped a lot of judges. \nWe have heard people over here asking their questions to the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee: Is this retribution? Is this \nvengeance? Well, we said, when we took over control of the Senate, \nthat, in fact, if we wanted to really be mean spirited and treat the \nRepublicans like they treated us, we could have stonewalled the \nappointment of judges. We said we would not do that. And our record \nstands: 100 judges in a period of 17 months. And just this past Monday \nwe voted unanimously for three additional judges.\n\n  And we will vote for a lot more.\n  We believe this man, Mr. Estrada, has some serious problems. We \nbelieve we have a few questions we want Miguel Estrada to answer. As I \nhave stated, Miguel Estrada's answers to the Judiciary Committee's \nquestions are just like on this chart: a big blank. We do not know any \nmore, other than the tone of his voice in what he said, what he knows. \nWith the answers he gave, we do not know anything more than when we \nstarted the Judiciary Committee hearing.\n  And if we want to talk a little bit about his legal philosophy, I \nthink it is important because my friend, the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, said he wanted to know about--I cannot remember all the \nnames, Marsha Berzon, Richard Paez, all the names he mentioned--he \nwanted to know if they were judicial activists, wanted to know their \njudicial philosophy. And he said, with a couple of them, they were \njudicial activists. He said he knew that, but he felt--for example, for \nPaez, Senator Hatch is absolutely right, he interceded with Richard \nPaez and was able to help get that nomination through. No question. \nSenator Hatch made a very valid, honest statement. But even then, he \nknew in his mind what the judicial philosophy of Richard Paez was.\n  We do not know what Miguel Estrada's legal philosophy is. We do not \nknow. For example, a question by Senator Durbin, a Senator from \nIllinois, asked: Give us an idea of some Supreme Court opinions with \nwhich you disagree. He had no opinion.\n  And as we talked about earlier today, I wonder if some people who \nhave not been to law school, maybe have taken a course in \nconstitutional law in undergraduate school--and if you are a lawyer \nlike he is--couldn't you dig up maybe the Dred Scott decision that said \nslavery was legal and constitutional? I don't think he agrees with \nthat. Couldn't he have let us know?\n  Here is Miguel Estrada's legal philosophy: a big blank. To say he has \nrepresented clients as a private lawyer is no answer, provides little \ninsight into his philosophy.\n  As I said earlier today, I have been to trial lots of times. I have \ntried cases before courts over 100 times, presented the client's case \nto a jury. And a jury had to arrive at a decision based on how I \nconducted that case. But after having reviewed every case that I tried, \nthere would be no way of determining what my judicial philosophy is \nbecause every time I went to court, I was representing somebody charged \nwith murder, or someone who was charged with robbery, or I was \nrepresenting someone who was trying to get money as a result of a \nwrongful eviction from an apartment house, on and on with all the \ndifferent cases that I tried. From that, no one would know what my \njudicial philosophy would be because I was representing individuals in \ncases.\n  So to say, Estrada has argued cases, why don't you look at the cases \nhe argued? That has nothing to do with his judicial philosophy. We want \nanswers to questions, as we got answers to questions from the 100 \njudges Democrats moved through this body when we were in the majority, \nand the three who were just approved, confirmed with us in the \nminority.\n  So we are entitled to know what Miguel Estrada's legal opinions are. \nYou see, the reason we are making such a big deal about trying to get \nthese memoranda from his work at the Solicitor General's Office is that \nit may give us some idea how he stands on legal issues.\n  He won't tell us, so maybe we can find out from reviewing some of the \npapers he has written while he was employed. That is why we are \nconcerned. We are concerned because we honestly believe we have a \nconstitutional obligation to review this man's records.\n  Let me just say there has been a lot of talk tonight. There are TV \nads running as we speak. By the way, these TV ads are being paid for by \nan organization, the ``Committee for Justice'', that was founded by the \nman who gave Miguel Estrada the rating from the American Bar \nAssociation, Fred Fielding. Mr. Fielding is the one who started this \ngroup, and he is running ads against us. That is an interesting \nproposition. At the ABA, the person who reviewed and interviewed Miguel \nEstrada, gave his recommendation to the ABA--and they accepted what he \ntold them--is a person who formed this committee that is running ads \nagainst us. They are running all over the country.\n  It seems to me the ABA has a slight problem. According to their \nmanual:\n\n       No member of the Committee shall participate in the work of \n     the Committee if such participation will rise to the \n     appearance of impropriety or would otherwise be incompatible \n     with the purposes served and functions performed by the \n     Committee.\n\n  The ABA better review this procedure they have, make sure their \nreviewers comply with it.\n  What these ads Mr. Fielding is running are saying, among other \nthings, is that we are anti-Hispanic. That's the rhetoric of my friends \non the other side of the aisle.\n  We have been accused by one Senator of sending the message ``if you \nare a minority and a conservative, we hate you.'' The distinguished \nchairman of the committee said: ``Hispanics face a new obstacle from \nDemocrats who would smear anyone who would be a positive role model for \nHispanics.''\n  I am disturbed by the hyperbole, the rhetoric being used to propel \nthe nomination of Miguel Estrada to one of the most powerful courts in \nthe United States, the DC Circuit. I am at a loss to understand it as \nanything other than an attempt to silence Senators who today seek to \nexercise their constitutional duty to decide whether this judicial \nnominee merits support.\n  Let no one within the sound of this Senator's voice be mistaken: We \nare not going to be intimidated from fulfilling this constitutional \nrole.\n  We know these statements about Democrats are false. The Hispanic \ncommunity, the American people, and my colleagues know the truth: The \nDemocratic party has put the vast majority of Hispanic appellate court \njudges on the bench. This is the first Hispanic circuit court \nnomination we have ever received from the President. This is the first \none, Miguel Estrada.\n  As important as our record on Hispanic judges, the Democratic party \nis\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\nthe champion of issues of importance to the Hispanic community, from \nfair labor practices to immigration to protection of civil rights.\n  To recount our record: Of the 10 Latino appellate court judges who \nare now serving, 80 percent were appointed by Democrats. Several of \nthese nominees were denied Senate consideration for years, while the \nRepublicans controlled the Senate. Judge Paez, we have heard about \nthat. Thirty-nine Republicans voted against his nomination. Judge Sonia \nSotomayor, nominated to the Second Circuit, was similarly stalled. Her \nconfirmation took 433 days. Twenty-nine Republicans voted against her \nconfirmation.\n  And then there were the Hispanic nominees who were denied hearings or \neven votes by Senate Republicans during the Clinton administration: \nJorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, Christine Arguello, Ricardo Morado, \nAnnabelle Rodriguez. These facts and these names bear witness to the \nfalse claims made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n\n  Despite these facts, Democrats don't believe that turnabout is fair \nplay. Where President Bush has sent the Senate open and direct \nnominees, those nominees have won swift confirmation in the Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate. President Bush has nominated eight Hispanic \nAmericans to the Federal district courts, four have been swiftly \nconfirmed: Judge Christina Armijo, Judge Philip Martinez, Randy Crane, \nJose Martinez.\n  This anti-Hispanic rhetoric is a red herring.\n  Mr. Estrada's background has nothing to do with my concerns. The red \nherring nature of this debate is belied by the fact that leading Latino \ngroups don't support Estrada. They include the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus; the Puerto Rican Defense and Education Fund; the Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund; the National Association of \nLatino Elected & Appointed Officials; the National Council of La Raza; \nNational Puerto Rican Coalition; Puerto Rican Defense and Education \nFund, California La Raza Lawyers.\n  These groups are joined by scores of others in opposition to Estrada, \nincluding the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Alliance for \nJustice, the National Organization for Women, the National Association \nfor the Advancement of Colored People, People for the American Way.\n  These groups are all dedicated to assuring equal opportunity in \nAmerica, protection of minority rights, and advancement of the public \ninterest. They, like many of my colleagues, are deeply concerned by Mr. \nEstrada's limited record and his unwillingness to engage with the \nSenate in an open and searching discussion of judicial philosophy and \nhis record.\n  While we are talking about this, let me say there has been some talk \nthat the Congressional Hispanic Caucus is split. There is some \ndissension among the ranks, some claim. The 20 members of the Hispanic \nCaucus are unanimously opposed to the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n  A release was issued yesterday where Ciro D. Rodriguez, a Member of \nCongress from Texas, chairman of that caucus, said:\n\n       It is disheartening to see that Members of the Republican \n     Senate continue to make misleading and unfounded statements \n     regarding the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's opposition to \n     the Bush nominee Miguel Estrada. The [Congressional Hispanic \n     Caucus] will continue to stand by its unanimous opposition to \n     this unqualified nominee and will not waiver.\n       Senate Republicans continue to hit below the belt, \n     insulting Hispanic Members of this Congress who have been \n     elected to serve as a voice for the people in their \n     community. Today Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch \n     continues to make misleading, partisan swipes. He incorrectly \n     claims that the [Congressional Hispanic Caucus] is split in \n     its opposition, and he mischaracterizes our arguments. \n     Yesterday, the [Congressional Hispanic Caucus] released a \n     letter to Senator Hatch demanding an apology for comments he \n     made during Senatorial debate, likening Members of the \n     [Congressional Hispanic Caucus] ``to the lioness eating her \n     cubs.''\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       We have yet to receive an apology or even an \n     acknowledgement from the Senator that his comments were out \n     of line and insulting.\n       The [caucus] has supported numerous highly qualified \n     Hispanic appointees by the Bush administration. We oppose Mr. \n     Estrada based on our review of his inadequate qualifications \n     for what is viewed as the second most powerful court in the \n     Nation.\n\n  There has been a lot of talk about LULAC being so widely in favor of \nMiguel Estrada. Mario G. Obledo, who is a recipient of the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom Award, past national President of LULAC, cofounder of \nthe Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, first general \ncounsel and past president of MALDEF, cofounder of the Hispanic \nNational Bar Association, founder of the National Coalition of Hispanic \nOrganizations, opposes the confirmation of Miguel Estrada.\n  He says, among other things:\n\n       I write to join other Latino civil rights organizations in \n     opposing the confirmation of Miguel Estrada to the D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. My history in the Latino civil \n     rights community is lengthy. I am a past National President \n     of LULAC, a co-founder of the Southwest Voter Registration \n     and Education Project, the first General Counsel and later \n     President of MALDEF, as well as a co-founder of the Hispanic \n     National Bar Association. I am a recipient of the President \n     Medal of Freedom Award, this nation's highest civilian honor \n     in recognition of my involvement with civil rights. I have \n     been an attorney for 43 years, and a former member of the \n     faculty of Harvard Law School. I was formerly the Secretary \n     of Health and Welfare for the State of California. I am the \n     founder and President of the National Coalition of Hispanic \n     Organizations. I mention some of my past and current work in \n     the Latino community so that there is an understanding of how \n     intertwined my life has been and still is with the betterment \n     of my community.\n       My opposition to Miguel Estrada's confirmation is based \n     upon the following. First, I believe that Mr. Estrada showed \n     himself unwilling to allow the Senate to fully evaluate his \n     record. He was less than candid in his responses. Yet, Mr. \n     Estrada, as every other nominee who is a candidate for a \n     lifelong appointment, must be prepared to fully answer basic \n     questions, particularly where, as here, there is no prior \n     judicial record and no legal scholarly work since law school \n     to scrutinize. He declined to give full answer to many of the \n     questions posed to him by the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n     When he did give answers, those answers raised troubling \n     doubts concerning his ability to be fair.\n       There are serious questions raised by his sparse record on \n     basic civil rights and constitutional matters. It is unclear \n     that Mr. Estrada would recognize that the First Amendment \n     protects the rights of Latino youth to congregate and \n     associate on public streets. It is also likely that Mr. \n     Estrada would not place proper limits on law enforcement as \n     required by the Fourth Amendment. Given his views of \n     enumerated rights, there are serious questions whether he \n     would recognize a suspect's right not to make incriminating \n     statements. His record leads me to conclude that he would not \n     take seriously and fairly Latino allegations of racial \n     profiling by law enforcement. Based on his actions in pro \n     bono litigation, there is a question whether he believes that \n     organizations which have long represented the interests of \n     communities would have the right to represent those interests \n     in court. In addition, his views concerning the continued \n     viability of affirmative action programs are also suspect.\n       Given these concerns, I oppose the confirmation of Mr. \n     Miguel Estrada.\n       Finally, I am dismayed and disturbed with the tone that has \n     been adopted by some of Mr. Estrada's most vocal supporters. \n     Instead of focusing on the merits, they have resorted to \n     name-calling and insults. If they cannot obtain sufficient \n     support for Mr. Estrada on the merits alone and can only gain \n     it by falsely accusing Senators of being anti-Hispanic or \n     accusing Latino organizations who oppose him of ``selling \n     out'' their people, then it does make one wonder whether Mr. \n     Estrada deserves the life-term appointment after all. There \n     are some brilliant lawyers who cannot serve as fair and \n     impartial jurists. I now conclude that Mr. Estrada may be a \n     very talented lawyer but he cannot serve as a fair and \n     impartial jurist. His nomination should be defeated.\n\n  Mr. President, we also have a letter dated today, from the League of \nthe United Latin American Citizens, LULAC, addressed to Senators \nDaschle and Hatch. Among other things, this letter goes on to say that \nthe LULAC organization supports Miguel Estrada. But the second \nparagraph says:\n\n       We are extremely disappointed that his nomination became \n     mired in controversy. That said, we are alarmed by \n     suggestions by some of the backers of Mr. Estrada that the \n     Senate Democrats and members of the Congressional Hispanic \n     Caucus are opposed to the nomination because of race, \n     ethnicity, and Hispanic bias. We do not subscribe to this \n     view at all, and we do not wish to be associated with such \n     accusations.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2332]]\n\n\n                                                  League of United\n\n\n                                      Latin American Citizens,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch and Senator Daschle: As you are aware, \n     the League of United Latin American Citizens, has taken a \n     position in support of Miguel Estrada for the D.C. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals based upon our review of his qualifications \n     and legal record. We believe that he is an extremely well \n     qualified nominee with an outstanding legal record that \n     demonstrates his knowledge of the law, his solid judicial \n     temperament, and his ability to set aside any personal \n     beliefs he may have and make sound legal arguments based on \n     the constitution and precedent.\n       We are extremely disappointed that his nomination has \n     become mired in controversy. That said, we are alarmed by \n     suggestions from some of the backers of Mr. Estrada that the \n     Senate Democrats and the members of the Congressional \n     Hispanic Caucus are opposing his nomination because of his \n     race, ethnicity or an anti-Hispanic bias. We do not subscribe \n     to this view at all and we do not wish to be associated with \n     such accusations.\n       LULAC has had a long and productive working relationship \n     with many Senate Democrats and all of the members of the \n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus and our experience is that they \n     would never oppose any nominee because of his or her race or \n     ethnicity. On the contrary, it is most often the Democratic \n     members of the Senate who support LULAC's priority issues and \n     score highest on the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda's \n     congressional scorecard which LULAC helps to compile. Nine \n     times out of ten it is the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that \n     is the champion or our legislative priorities as outlined in \n     the enclosed LULAC legislative platform.\n       Nevertheless, the under representation of Hispanics in the \n     Federal judiciary is of great concern to our organization and \n     we have consistently encouraged both Democratic and \n     Republican Presidents to appoint more Hispanics to the \n     Federal courts. Hispanics, however, remain severely \n     underrepresented in the judiciary comprising only 3.8% of \n     federal judges while making up 14% of the US population.\n       Consequently, we do not support the attempts of either \n     party to prevent qualified, fair-minded, Hispanic nominations \n     from moving forward for a timely confirmation vote. While we \n     clearly believe that the filibuster of Miguel Estrada is \n     unfair, we also believe that the delay of many of President \n     Clinton's Hispanic nominees including Richard Paez, Enrique \n     Moreno and Sonia Sotomayor were unfair. It would be in the \n     best interest of both Democratic and Republican Senators to \n     encourage more Hispanic nominations to the federal courts and \n     to avoid embroiling these nominees in the partisan disputes \n     that prevent the consideration of these candidates based on \n     their merits.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Hector M. Flores,\n                                         LULAC National President.\n\n  Mr. REID. This letter goes on to say they have had a longstanding \nrelationship with us, the Democrats; and basically it goes on to say \nthat they support Latino nominees for courts. They want more.\n  Mr. President, we have heard statements here that we don't need these \nmemoranda Mr. Estrada wrote when he was in the Solicitor General's \noffice; other people have not had to give them, so why should he? Other \npeople have turned these memos over is the short answer. Another answer \nis that Mr. Estrada--going to why it's so important here--is that he \nhas virtually no other record for us to examine. The other side of the \naisle, my colleagues, have called the request for these memos \nunprecedented. Senator Leahy produced a number of actual Solicitor \nGeneral memos turned over in the past.\n  We have heard a lot about Mr. Paez and about Marsha Berzon. Let me \ntake them as an example. This woman was asked to produce the minutes of \nmeetings she attended when she was a member of the ACLU, American Civil \nLiberties Union. My colleagues went further and even required Ms. \nBerzon to supply the minutes of the meetings of the ACLU while she was \na member even if she didn't attend the meetings.\n  We don't want to go nearly that far. We want to find out what is in \nthe memoranda. It is not unprecedented. My friends have said these \ndocuments are privileged. Everybody in this body knows that the \nattorney-client privilege doesn't apply to the Senate. In the 15-page \nletter that the President's lawyer, Mr. Gonzalez, wrote back to the \nSenate today--actually to Senators Leahy and Daschle in response to our \nrequest to produce these memoranda--even Mr. Gonzalez recognizes that \nthese are not privileged. Both the House and the Senate have explicitly \nrejected calls to incorporate that privilege into our rules. A judgment \nhas already been made that to do so would impede our ability to do our \nwork, and would impede it certainly with this nomination.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have implied that our \nrequests are dangerous. I don't believe that. They have implied it \nwould cripple the Solicitor General's office if these memoranda were \nreleased. The office functioned just fine after we got the information \nfrom Bork and Rehnquist. The Solicitor General's office survived just \nfine. We knew when we asked for that information before that it was on \na very limited basis and it would only apply to them and not to \neverybody.\n  The administration claims that these documents--it reminds me of some \nother documents that this administration has tried to hide. I remember \nthe Vice President and his National Energy Policy Development Group. We \nwanted to know if the Vice President met frequently with the oil \ncompanies in formulating the nation's energy policy. They went to court \nto stop that.\n  I would simply say here that what we are asking for is certainly fair \nand we should get it. It would be the right thing to do.\n  If the President and those on the other side of the aisle think so \nmuch of this man, it seems that is a very light step to take: to answer \nthe questions and give reasonable, detailed answers, and not refuse to \nprovide the memos that he wrote in the Solicitor General's office.\n  They say this is the first true filibuster. That certainly is not the \ncase. There have been a number of filibusters--at least 17 on judges. \nRepublicans have filibustered Democratic nominees. Republicans can call \nit what they want. Their attempts to invoke cloture walked, talked, and \nlooked like filibusters--they were filibusters. They didn't have the \nvotes to sustain any number of those instances.\n  There has been talk in the evening that the reason the judge from \nTexas, Judge Moreno, didn't get a vote is because there was no \nconsultation; it had nothing to do with blue slips, simply with the \nfact that there was no consultation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record, \ndated April 28, 1997, from Charles Ruff, the attorney for President \nClinton--like Gonzales is the attorney for President Bush now.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you for taking the time to meet \n     with the Attorney General and me.\n       As I told you, we are making every effort to send forward \n     in the next weeks nominations for the senior positions at the \n     Department of Justice, including Associate Attorney General, \n     and Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights and \n     Criminal Divisions, and the Office of Legal Counsel. We share \n     your commitment to fill these critical positions at the \n     earliest possible date and appreciate your willingness to \n     work with us in achieving that goal.\n       With respect to judicial nominees, we recognize that, \n     although the selection of judges is among the President's \n     most important constitutional duties, senators from both \n     parties have historically played an important role not only \n     through their formal votes on such nominations but by \n     providing their advice before a nomination comes to a vote. \n     We are committed to achieving the fullest possible measure of \n     bipartisan consultation before the President makes his \n     selection of a nominee. As we discussed, the nature of that \n     consultation should be shaped to meet the circumstances in \n     particular states--the interests of the senators involved, \n     the number and type of openings to be filled, and other \n     factors. For example, we met recently with Senators Gramm and \n     Hutchison to discuss their interest in having commissions \n     review the qualifications of candidates, and my staff will be \n     working with theirs to determine how best to implement such a \n     process. Similarly, I understand that Attorney General \n     Edmisten is working with Senators Nickles and Inhofe to \n     develop a bipartisan process for identifying potential \n     District Court candidates. And in Pennsylvania, Senators \n     Specter and Santorum have worked with Congressman Murtha to \n     establish commissions to review the qualifications of \n     interested candidates. In addition to these formal vehicles \n     for consultation, we have met and will continue to meet with \n     Republican senators and their staffs to explore how best to \n     obtain\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\n     their input and to ensure that they are advised when the \n     President is preparing to announce a nomination in their \n     state.\n       I know that you fully appreciate the nature of the \n     President's special prerogatives in this important area, just \n     as we are sensitive to the special role played by the members \n     of the Senate. We are grateful for your leadership and your \n     assistance, and we will be happy to discuss further any \n     specific issues that may arise relating to the nomination \n     process.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                Charles F.C. Ruff,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, he says, among other things:\n\n       We are committed to achieving the fullest possible measure \n     of bipartisan consultation before the President makes his \n     selection of a nominee. . . .We met recently with Senators \n     Gramm and Hutchison to discuss their interest in having \n     commissions review the qualifications of candidates, and my \n     staff will be working with theirs to determine how best to \n     implement such a process.\n\n  So there was consultation.\n  This President does not abide by the advice and consent clause of the \nConstitution. Article II, section 2: We have a constitutional \nobligation to do just what we are doing. Republicans held up scores of \nClinton nominations. These nominees were subjected to secret holds, \ngiven no hearings or even votes. On two separate occasions today, I \nhave read into the Record the names of these people who simply were \ndumped without even a hearing.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle did not make their \nobjections known to the American people. We have in the light of day. \nThey did not raise their objections in the light of day. They never \nengaged in debate like this because they hid behind secret holds.\n  Their assertion that holding up Miguel Estrada is anti-American, \nanti-Hispanic. I hope we have answered that assertion. This charge is \nsimply without foundation. Democratic administrations have placed \nnearly all the judges who now serve at the appellate court level. The \nDemocrat-controlled Senate expeditiously approved all of President \nBush's Hispanic nominees to the Federal district courts.\n  We have done the very best we could to move forward on judicial \nnominations, and we have determined it was time to draw the line \nbecause we are entitled to more than a blank page.\n  Miguel Estrada's ABA rating means we should approve him. That is what \nwe are being told. Of course, all should be reminded that the \nRepublicans, when they were in the majority, got rid of the ABA rating. \nThey did not want them to be part of the process. But now because \nMiguel Estrada got this ABA rating given by Fred Fielding, my \ncolleagues have deemed the ABA the gold seal of approval.\n  Mr. Estrada did receive a well-qualified rating from the ABA, and he \nmay deserve it, but it just does not look right. I am not here to in \nany way impugn the legal qualifications of a Harvard law graduate. I \ndidn't graduate from Harvard. It is a fine law school. But let's not \nbrag about this ABA rating, in the manner it was obtained.\n  While serving on the ABA review committee, Mr. Fielding founded the \npartisan ``Committee for Justice'' with C. Boyden Gray, another \npartisan Republican. There is nothing wrong being Republican partisan. \nIt is part of our system. Some of my best friends are Republican \npartisans. But they should not be involved in giving people ratings at \nthe ABA and then setting up committees and paying for ads--running \npartisan ads if somebody does not approve their nominee.\n  The committee is running untrue partisan ads against Democratic \nSenators in an attempt to keep us from performing our constitutional \nduty. When Fielding recommended Estrada's well-qualified rating, he was \nserving on President Bush's transition team and serving as a lawyer for \nthe Republican National Committee. This does not seem quite right to \nme.\n  You have to ask yourself, when Americans hear that the ABA rates a \nnominee well qualified, do they think the President's foot soldiers in \nthe effort to pack the bench play a major role in making that rating? I \ndoubt it.\n  You have to ask yourself, doesn't Mr. Fielding's dual role--\npurportedly ``independent'' evaluator and partisan foot soldier--\nviolate the ABA's rules?\n  ``Governing Principles of the Standing Committee on Federal \nJudiciary, Appendix,'' adopted by the ABA Board of Governors February \n1988. I ask unanimous consent that this appendix be printed in the \nRecord. It states, among other things:\n\n       No member of the Committee shall participate in the work of \n     the Committee if such participation would give rise to the \n     appearance of impropriety or would otherwise be incompatible \n     with the purposes served and functions performed by the \n     Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Appendix: Governing Principles of the Standing Committee on Federal \n                               Judiciary\n\n       The Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary shall continue \n     to direct its activities to evaluating the professional \n     qualifications of persons being considered for appointment to \n     the federal bench on the basis of predetermined and objective \n     evaluation criteria which shall be provided prior to \n     evaluation to persons whose qualifications are to be \n     evaluated. The Committee will continue, if asked, to provide \n     to the Attorney General and, following nomination, the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, its appraisal of the professional \n     competence, integrity and judicial temperament of such \n     persons.\n       In view of the special nature of the function performed by \n     this Committee and the confidence reposed in the Committee's \n     evaluations, the integrity and credibility of its processes \n     and the perception of these processes are of vital \n     importance.\n       No member of the Committee while serving as a member or \n     within one year following such service, shall seek or accept \n     a nomination to the federal bench.\n       No member of the Committee shall participate in the work of \n     the Committee if such participation would give rise to the \n     appearance of impropriety or would otherwise be incompatible \n     with the purposes served and functions performed by the \n     Committee.\n       Because confidentiality and discretion are of critical \n     importance to the evaluation processes of the Committee, only \n     the President of the Association, his designee, or the Chair \n     of the Committee shall respond to any media or general public \n     inquiries or make any statements to the media or general \n     public relating to the work of the Committee.\n       The President of the Association shall take any action \n     necessary to ensure adherence to these principles.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Mr. Fielding's work in this so-called well-\nqualified rating does not meet the smell test. It certainly does not \nmeet the test the ABA adopted.\n  We have also heard tonight, last night I should say at this point, \nthat there is a vacancy crisis on the Federal bench. Yet when my \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nduring the Clinton years, he declared that a vacancy rate of 67 \njudgeships on the Federal bench was ``full employment'' basically.\n  My colleagues have also asserted there is a crisis in the DC Circuit, \nnoting there are four vacancies in the DC Circuit. I say to my \ncolleagues, if they were concerned about such a crisis in the DC \nCircuit, why didn't they fill the vacancies? Do you know why? They said \nthe court had too many judges; they did not need more judges. Even \nthough we had well-qualified people, such as Elena Kagan and Allen \nSnyder, they said the court had enough judges to do the work they do.\n  They held them up so they could fill the court--hoping they would \ntake the majority and the White House. They wanted their judges on this \nimportant court that rules on civil rights, workers' rights, \nenvironmental protections, women's rights, and a number of other \nissues.\n  Now suddenly the court that was jammed to the gills, which really did \nnot need more judges, now needs them all.\n  We are going to help them fill vacancies because we believe the \ncircuit needed the help when we were in the majority, when we had \nPresident Clinton as President. But one of those people we are not \ngoing to allow to go to the DC Circuit is Miguel Estrada unless we get \nthe information we have requested.\n  Let me briefly state again that there has been some statement that \nthe Solicitor General's memoranda are privileged. They are not. Senate \nrules do not incorporate the attorney-client privilege. Both the House \nand Senate have declined to adopt that privilege as part of their rules \nbecause we found it would impede our ability to do our work.\n  The wisdom of that is revealed in the debate of this nominee. He has \nwritten very little besides these memoranda, if anything. I understand \nhe wrote one law review note in law school. My colleagues have opined \nproviding these memoranda would decimate the Solicitor General's \nOffice. As I established,\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\nit did not with the nomination of Bork when we got the information, it \ndid not with Rehnquist when we got the information, it did not with \nEasterbrook when we got the information, and Civiletti and others.\n  Mr. President, this is, as Senator Hatch would call it, a true \nfilibuster. They do not happen very often. There have to be strong \nprinciples involved, and there are. As I said last night, my friend \nfrom Utah can state as many times and in as many different ways he \nwants that there is not a problem with this nominee, and all I can say \nis, there is a problem with this nominee.\n  We, on this side of the aisle, try to be very fair, as does the other \nside of the aisle. We have a wide-ranging political philosophy on our \nside of the aisle, and it is not really often--because Democrats are \nnoted for their independence--that we unite in this manner.\n  We do so here because important principles are at stake, because our \nconstitutional duty is at issue. We do so because a nominee to a life-\ntime seat on the second highest court in the land should engage with us \nin a forthright manner as he asks for the honor to one day pass \njudgment on important freedoms enjoyed by the American people.\n  It is not very often we join together in a cause, but we have joined \ntogether in this cause because it is wrong for Miguel Estrada to go \nrushing on to the DC Court of Appeals with a blank slate, our not \nknowing what his judicial philosophy is, not knowing what his record \nis. We want to know what he wrote when he had the opportunity to write \nmemos when he was Assistant Solicitor General, and we want him to \nanswer questions. We are entitled to know that. These are not \noutlandish requests.\n  The legal memoranda are a blank sheet of paper. His legal philosophy \nis a blank sheet of paper. His answers to the Judiciary Committee's \nquestions are a blank piece of paper. We deserve more than that. The \nConstitution demands more than that.\n  Let me again apologize to the Chair for taking a few minutes this \nmorning, but I believed it would be a bit of laziness on my part to \nwalk out tonight, after having heard 3 hours of debate by my friend \nfrom Utah giving one side of the story, because this has two sides. \nThis debate has two sides. Of course, we believe strongly that on a \nmatter of principle we are right. The Republicans believe they are \nright. That is what the Senate is all about.\n  We are doing nothing that is unusual or untoward. That is what the \nSenate is all about. That is why the Founding Fathers gave the \nPresiding Officer and me the opportunity to serve, to represent a \nState. There are two Senators from each State. The small State of New \nHampshire, with two Senators, has as much opportunity, right, and power \nin this body as the two Senators from California with 35 million people \nin it. That is what the Senate is all about.\n  In the long term, this debate is going to be extremely important and \nhelpful to the Senate because what it means is Presidents in the \nfuture, when they send nominees to go on courts, are going to have to \nanswer a few questions. They cannot send blank slates to become judges.\n  I apologize to the Chair and to the very tired staff. They have \nworked long and hard. The Presiding Officer and I will be home asleep, \nand these folks will still be working to prepare the Record and take \ncare of things.\n  So I apologize to everyone for keeping them late. I know how hard \nthey work and how important each of them really is to the Senate and \nthe institution. I hope we can wrap things up pretty quickly.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Nevada spoke with \nhis usual eloquence and none of us could tell he was up that early in \nthe morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/12/senate-section/article/S2334-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. TALENT.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred November 24, \n2001, in Cincinnati, OH. Theodore Jenkins, 43, was savagely beaten and \nstabbed. Jenkins told police that he was attacked by five men who beat \nhim with a nightstick and stabbed him four times in the back. The \nattackers used racial slurs during the beating, and police investigated \nthe incident as a hate crime.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/12/senate-section/article/S2334-4", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JACKIE ROBINSON\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Kerry and \nMcCain in co-sponsoring their bill to award Jackie Robinson the \nCongressional Gold Medal in recognition of his profound and lasting \ncontributions to the cause of equality and civil rights in America.\n  Jackie Robinson has always been a hero of mine--initially because he \nwas the greatest of all Brooklyn Dodgers when I was a young Dodger fan \ngrowing up six blocks from Ebbets Field, and later because I realized \nhow he had changed America forever and for better.\n  Jackie Robinson was a peerless athlete who excelled in many sports \nand changed the way that baseball was played. He helped Brooklyn win \nfive pennants and one unforgettable World Championship, when we no \nlonger had to ``wait till next year.''\n  Even more important, he was a courageous pioneer who overcame \ntremendous pressure and prejudice to break the color line in major \nleague baseball. It is hard for us today to imagine the obstacles he \nfaced back in 1947, when our nation's schools, military, and public \nfacilities were all strictly segregated. Overcoming taunts, assaults, \nand death threats, Jackie Robinson played baseball--and played \nmagnificently. His grace, dignity, determination, and tremendous \nability made him a hero to millions of Americans of all races and \nbackgrounds.\n  Jackie Robinson once said, ``A life is not important except in the \nimpact it has on other lives.'' By this high standard, Jackie \nRobinson's life had monumental importance. As Senator Kerry pointed out \nwhen introducing this bill, Dr. Martin Luther King once said that he \ncould not do what he was doing if Jackie Robinson had not done what he \ndid. As our nation keeps struggling to realize Dr. King's great dream, \nwe can salute Jackie Robinson as one of the fathers of that dream.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to honor this great American by co-\nsponsoring and passing this bill to award Jackie Robinson the \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/12/senate-section/article/S2334-5", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2334-S2335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICAN HEART MONTH\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of February as \nAmerican Heart Month. As a strong supporter of the American Heart \nAssociation, I want to make clear that prevention of heart disease \nshould be a priority of health care funding. I have always believed \nthat focusing resources on prevention will save lives as well as \ntaxpayers dollars.\n  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in Missouri and in the \nUnited States. Almost 18,000 people in Missouri died of heart disease \nin 1999.\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\nMany women believe that heart disease is a man's disease, so they fail \nto perceive it as a serious health threat. Every year since 1984, \ncardiovascular diseases have claimed the lives of more women than men. \nAnd, the gap between male and female deaths continues to grow wider. \nThe national statistics are even more startling. Heart disease is the \nnumber one killer of women in the United States, claiming more than \n250,000 women per year.\n  Sadly, an American dies from cardiovascular disease approximately \nevery 33 seconds. More than 61 million Americans--one in five males and \nfemales--suffer from heart disease, stroke or another cardiovascular \ndisease. Stroke is the third leading cause of death in Missouri and in \nthe United States. Almost 4,000 people in Missouri died of stroke in \n1999. Heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases claim \nmore lives each year than the next five leading causes of death \ncombined.\n  We know the causes of cardiovascular disease--one of them is high \nblood cholesterol. High cholesterol is a leading risk factor for heart \ndisease and stroke. Approximately 42 million Americans have total blood \ncholesterol levels of 240 milligrams per deciliter and higher. These \nindividuals are considered at high risk for developing coronary heart \ndisease, which leads to heart attack.\n  I know that something can be done to combat heart disease and save \nAmerican lives, and that is why I joined Senator Dorgan in cosponsoring \nof The Medicare Cholesterol Screening Coverage Act of 2003. This \nlegislation adds blood cholesterol screening as a covered benefit for \nMedicare beneficiaries, at a frequency and in a manner determined by \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, (HHS). This is consistent \nwith guidelines issued by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \nInstitute, which recommend that all Americans over the age of 20 be \nscreened for high cholesterol at least once every five years. \nCurrently, Medicare only covers cholesterol and other lipid testing for \npatients who already suffer from known disease such as heart disease, \nstroke, or other disorders associated with elevated cholesterol levels.\n  This bill also provides flexibility to allow the Secretary of HHS to \ncover future cardiovascular screening tests that might become the \nstandard of care in the future, so that Medicare can keep pace with \nchanges in medicine. Congress has already acted to cover other \nscreening tests such as bone mass measurement, glaucoma screenings, and \nscreenings for colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer. Now is the time \nto also extend Medicare coverage for cholesterol screening.\n  In recognizing February as American Heart Month, I urge my colleagues \nto act on The Medicare Cholesterol Screening Coverage Act of 2003, and \nI thank Senator Dorgan for his leadership on this issue. I also urge my \ncolleagues to join me to prioritize legislation to help prevent heart \ndisease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/12/senate-section/article/S2335-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOANNE HULS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

LEE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding public servant, and a wonderful friend, former New Haven \nMayor Richard Lee, who passed away last week at the age of 86.\n  My most heartfelt condolences go out to his wife, Ellen Griffin Lee, \ntheir three children, Sarah, Tara, and David, and the entire Lee \nfamily.\n  I share the grief of so many from my state of Connecticut, and from \naround the country, who knew Dick Lee as the heart and soul of New \nHaven, and as a visionary leader who transformed urban politics \nnationwide.\n  Mayor Lee will be best remembered as the man whose innovative urban \nrenewal initiatives in the 1950's and 1960's engendered the rebirth of \nthe city of New Haven. His pioneering efforts not only improved the \nlives of the people of Connecticut, they served as a model for city \nrevitalization projects across America. Generations of Americans have \nbenefitted from the keen mind and passionate public service of Dick \nLee.\n  Born and raised in the working-class Newhallville section of New \nHaven, Dick Lee never went to college. Nonetheless, he moved swiftly \nthrough the ranks of New Haven city government. In 1954, at the age of \n37, he became the youngest mayor in New Haven's 365-year history. \nDespite his youth and lack of formal education, Dick Lee quickly became \nnationally known as one of the most savvy and sophisticated politicians \nof his time. He is now remembered as one of the most effective mayors \nin American history.\n  Under Mayor Lee's stewardship, New Haven became the recipient of more \nFederal aid per capita than any other city in the country. He used this \ninflux of Federal resources to create a national blueprint for \nAmerica's war on poverty, and to showcase innovative urban renewal \ninitiatives, which were desperately needed in hundreds of cities \nnationwide.\n  In the early 1960s, Dick Lee launched Head Start, and dozens of equal \nopportunity and anti-poverty programs in New Haven, long before other \ncities across America began thinking of ways to combat urban blight and \nimprove the lives of inner-city residents.\n  John Lindsay, Mayor of New York City, who called Dick Lee the ``dean \nof mayors in this country,'' once said, ``Sometimes my biggest problem \nis to develop something in New York that Dick Lee hasn't thought of \nfirst.\n  None of us will ever lose sight of that side of Dick Lee--the \ntireless visionary, extraordinarily effective leader, and dedicated \npublic servant. But many of us also had the great good fortune to call \nDick Lee a personal friend. And he was truly a wonderful friend. My \nfather Thomas Dodd, myself, and the entire Dodd family have known the \nLee family for generations. We will always treasure our many memories.\n  Mr. President, Dick Lee could have done many things with his life--he \ncould have run for governor of Connecticut; he could have run for \nCongress; he could have taken a Cabinet position.\n  He chose to stay home--he chose to stay in New Haven. That's because \nDick Lee embraced his city of new Haven as a beloved family member whom \nhe could never leave. I speak for many when I say it is nearly \nimpossible to imagine the Elm City without Dick Lee.\n  Dick Lee ultimately served 16 years as mayor of New Haven, 1954 \nthrough 1970, making him the longest serving mayor in the city's \nhistory. Through those years, he never lost sight of his\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\nworking-class roots; even after emerging as a towering figure in urban \npolitics, he continued to live for many years in his home neighborhood \nof Newhallville. And he never lost sight of what he believed to be his \ncalling in politics: improving the lives of others. His greatest \npassion was always reserved for helping the most underprivileged among \nus.\n  Dick Lee was often credited with turning new Haven into a ``model \ncity.'' He would never accept that term. He once said, ``I resent the \nterm `model city' . . . We're not a `model city' if there is a single \nman who is unemployed, if there is a single slum home.''\n  It has been said that the purpose of politics is to generate hope. \nDick Lee followed that credo every day, and millions have so \nbenefitted.\n  There weren't many leaders like Dick Lee back in the 1950's and \n1960's, and there aren't many today. He helped improve the lives of so \nmany people and will be greatly missed by so many more.\n  I would like to submit for the Record an extraordinary tribute to \nMayor Lee, written by Mark Zaretszky in the New Haven Register, dated \nFebruary 3, 2003.\n  The tribute follows.\n\n             Former Mayor Richard C. Lee Remembered Fondly\n\n       New Haven.--Former Mayor Richard C. Lee, the longest-\n     serving chief executive in the city's 365-year-history, will \n     be remembered by the city he loved as the man who remade New \n     Haven and, until his own health faltered, never missed a \n     wake.\n       Lee--friend and adviser to presidents, pioneer of the urban \n     renewal era, outspoken early critic of the Vietnam War and \n     proud Irish American--died Sunday morning after a long bout \n     with heart disease and diabetes. He was 86.\n       Lee, New Haven's 44th mayor, served a record eight terms \n     from 1954 to 1969. He is survived by his wife, Ellen Griffin \n     Lee, his children Sarah ``Sally'' A. Lee, David Lee and Tara \n     Lee Croke and their families, including grandchildren Stacy, \n     Lindsey and Elliott Lee.\n       ``My youth has fled, but it was a really good life,'' Lee \n     said a week before his death as he lay in bed Jan. 26 at the \n     Whitney Center in Hamden surrounded by family and close \n     friends. ``The memories never disappear . . . No one can take \n     them away from me.''\n       Mayor Lee had a particularly good day the previous \n     Saturday, according to Ellen Lee, spinning stories and \n     laughing with family and other friends for hours and staying \n     up until 10 p.m.\n       For part of the day last Sunday he wore a Boston Red Sox \n     cap given to him by the late ``Smokey Joe'' Wood, the New \n     Haven-born star pitcher who was his favorite Red Sox player \n     and Lee's neighbor for many years.\n\n\n                            a passionate man\n\n       ``Dick was a passionate man,'' said Mayor John DeStefano \n     Jr., who visited him several times during his last days. ``He \n     governed passionately, his likes and his dislikes were \n     passionate and I think what animated his personality was his \n     ability to feel emotion.''\n       DeStefano, the city's 49th mayor, said Lee, who had been an \n     adviser and confidante in DeStefano's nine years as mayor, \n     frequently called him at night to talk about the city's \n     goings-on, give advice when needed and pump him for gossip.\n       ``It's a series of late-night phone calls I'll miss,'' \n     DeStefano said.\n       What came through even in DeStefano's last visit to Lee \n     ``was this positive attitude,'' he said. ``He was like some \n     Runyonesque character who was a real bookmark of a time and a \n     place in the city.''\n       ``Every day I go to work and I sit at his desk--the very \n     desk that Dick Lee sat at--and I feel blessed . . . ,'' \n     DeStefano said.\n       ``He wasn't perfect. He failed at some things like all of \n     us do. but you don't fail unless you're trying--and Dick was \n     always trying. New Haven is just a blessed place for his \n     service,'' DeStefano said.\n\n\n                             youngest mayor\n\n       Mayor Lee, who took office on New Year's Day 1954 as the \n     youngest mayor in the city's history, recast New Haven in \n     broad strokes in the 1950s and 1960s--for better and, in the \n     minds of some New Haveners, for worse.\n       Lee, a World War II Army veteran, defeated Republican \n     incumbent Mayor William Celentano in 1953 to begin a half-\n     century unbroken chain of Democratic rule in New Haven that \n     continues to this day.\n       He brought in the best planners and social service \n     professionals of the time, listened to what they came up \n     with, dreamed big and made New Haven a ``model city'' watched \n     across the nation.\n       And while some of the huge changes he brought to the city \n     have not stood the test of time, he was respected--and, more \n     often than not, genuinely liked--even by his critics.\n       Some have called him the most significant New Haven mayor \n     since its first, Roger Sherman.\n       ``Dick Lee was a tireless visionary, a wonderful friend, \n     and one of the greatest mayors in American history,'' said \n     Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn. ``He loved New Haven and \n     made it a much better city than it would have been without \n     him.''\n       Lee ``was a mentor and inspiration to me in the early years \n     of my career, and I learned from him that politics means \n     having a vision, building coalitions to get things done, and \n     remembering to enjoy yourself in the process.''\n       Lieberman, whose house in New Haven for years was just two \n     or three blocks from Lee's, was the 2000 Democratic vice \n     presidential nominee. He is now a candidate for president in \n     2004.\n       ``I'll never forget our first meeting, when in my capacity \n     as Yale Daily News editor, I interviewed him at the Jewish \n     Center health club, and quickly ended up riding around town \n     with him to see the fruits of his successful urban renewal \n     campaign,'' Lieberman said.\n       ``That was the beginning of a lifelong friendship, and I \n     will miss him tremendously,'' he said.\n       ``Dick Lee is a legend in urban America,'' said U.S. Sen. \n     Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. on the occasion of Mayor Lee's \n     last big testimonial dinner in 1998. The senator has known \n     Lee since John F. Kennedy was president and Robert F. Kennedy \n     as attorney general.\n       During the 1960 presidential campaign, Lee was one of the \n     first U.S. mayors to declare his support for JFK, and was a \n     friend of the Kennedy family for years.\n       ``He's one of the all-time great American mayors, and his \n     eloquent leadership in tackling the challenge of our cities \n     became an inspiration to Congress and the country,'' Kennedy \n     said.\n\n\n                           newhallville roots\n\n       Lee grew up on Shelton Avenue in the city's working class \n     Newhallville section at a time when it was lit by gaslights, \n     and he continued to live there for several years after he \n     became mayor.\n       He later moved to McKinley Avenue in the Westville section \n     and stayed there until 2000, when his health forced him to \n     sell his Tudor house and move with his wife to an assisted \n     living apartment complex at Whitney Center.\n       Lee was a beloved figure to many New Haven, even to some of \n     those who berated him for knocking down their neighborhoods.\n       By the time Lee became mayor, he had been an alderman and \n     had worked as a reporter for the Journal-Courier, the morning \n     paper owned by the Jackson family that also ran the New Haven \n     Register; for the Chamber of Commerce and as director of the \n     Yale News Bureau.\n       While Lee never went to college, he was always proud of the \n     fact that Yale University in 1961 gave him an honorary \n     master's degree. He was the first American mayor since New \n     York's Fiorello LaGuardia to receive one and the first New \n     Haven mayor since 1842 to be so honored.\n       In later years he was one of the Proprietors of the Green \n     and a trustee at Albertus Magnus College. He also worked for \n     the United Way, served as vice president and assistant to the \n     chairman of Union Trust bank and had affiliations with the \n     University of Connecticut and Quinnipiac University.\n       Julia M. McNamara, the president of Albertus, said Lee's \n     affiliation with the college begun October 1925 when he was \n     one of two altar boys at the opening ceremony of the \n     Dominican facility. He was a trustee at Albertus for 17 years \n     and was trustee emeritus at the time of his death.\n       ``He brought with him all his wonderful experience and \n     background and a tremendous spirit of faith. He was a man of \n     great integrity who really, for us, was an inspiration,'' \n     said McNamara, who became a close personal friend of Lee.\n       Longtime friend and New Haven Register Editor Emeritus \n     Robert J. Leeney said Lee was totally dedicated to New Haven.\n       ``After a long life of achievement, the significant fact \n     about Dick Lee has been his lasting focus on the New Haven \n     community into which he was born,'' said Leeney, who directed \n     the newspaper's coverage for much of the time Lee was in \n     office. ``His affection and concern for hometown people and \n     places never waned despite his political sophistication and \n     his administrative skills.''\n       Throughout his career, ``he never worked more than a block \n     or two from the central Green . . .'' Leeney said. ``The \n     rhythm of this city was the rhythm of his life . . . His \n     constant public service and warm personality have made Dick \n     Lee's civic legacy a model of past energy and of future \n     inspiration for the city he loved.''\n       Lee's wake will take place Tuesday from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. at \n     Sisk Brothers Funeral Home, 3105 Whitney Ave. in Hamden. A \n     Mass of Christian burial will be celebrated at 10:30 a.m. \n     Wednesday in St. Mary's Church on Hillhouse Avenue.\n\n\n                            a new blueprint\n\n       Under Mayor Lee, New Haven became a blueprint upon which \n     much of the national war on poverty was modeled.\n       Lee's New Haven was the recipient of more federal money per \n     capita than any other city in the country during the \n     presidencies of JFK and Lyndon B. Johnson, when a total of \n     $180 million was sent to Elm City.\n       It was in Dick Lee's New Haven that Head Start, legal \n     assistance and various equal opportunity and anti-poverty \n     were born, beginning was back in 1962, before the rest of the \n     nation knew what those things were.\n       New Haven was one of six cities to initiate ``human \n     renewal'' programs using Ford\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\n     Foundation grants that fostered programs that were precursors \n     to the national ``Model Cities'' legislation.\n       Lee and his administration, led early on by Development \n     Administrator Edward Logue, also were responsible for huge \n     chunks of the city's modern landscape: the Chapel Square \n     Mall, the Coliseum and the Knights of Columbus building, \n     Dixwell Plaza and the Dixwell Community ``Q'' House, schools, \n     fire houses, a revived Wooster Square and the Long Wharf \n     commercial strip.\n       But ``I think to focus on the urban renewal projects would \n     be to miss the point of Dick Lee's time as mayor,'' said \n     DeStefano. ``His terms in office spanned a period of time in \n     which the character of America changed.''\n       ``With the suburbanization of America in the 50s and the \n     dramatic social change of the 60s . . . the war, civil rights \n     and the disturbances . . . in the city . . . I think the \n     measure of his mayoralty (was) that Dick Lee kept the city \n     together,'' he said. ``Together in terms of sharing a \n     direction, sharing a vision, creating hope, and from that \n     hope, helping people lead complete lives.''\n       As a new mayor, Lee assembled New Haven's first \n     ``professional'' government. He listened to the talented \n     people he hired and made New Haven one of the ``model \n     cities'' of the time.\n       Then, as Lee's time in the mayor's office approached its \n     end amid the tumultuous events of the 1960s, he saw the \n     city's image tarnished when racial unrest erupted in 1967, \n     something that took him by surprise.\n       As viewed today, Lee's eight terms in office, spanning 16 \n     years from 1954 to 1969, were punctuated by such ironies. \n     They also long ago were inscribed in 20th century political \n     science and urban planning textbooks.\n       Douglas Rae, a professor of political science at Yale, who \n     has just finished a book critical of some of Lee's legacy, \n     offered no such criticism of Lee the man.\n       ``He is New Haven's finest political creation of the 20th \n     century--a man whose vision and humanity tower above other \n     mayors and other public figures in that long period,'' Rae \n     said. ``The guy was absolutely remarkable.''\n\n\n                             HUMAN RENEWAL\n\n       ``He was a great mayor,'' said former state Treasurer Henry \n     E. ``Hank'' Parker, who came to New Haven from Poughkeepsie, \n     N.Y. in 1957 to be program director for Winchester Community \n     School as part one of Lee's ``human renewal'' programs.\n       ``He opened the door to a city that needed the urban \n     renewal that he indeed pioneered,'' said Parker, who became \n     the first president of the New Haven Black Coalition in 1968 \n     and ran for mayor himself in 1969, the year Lee bowed out. \n     ``Without that, we would have been even further behind.''\n       Parker made history of his own when he became Connecticut's \n     first black state treasurer in 1974.\n       What made Lee great?\n       Parker said Lee managed the tumultuous changes New Haven \n     and all cities were going through in that era ``better than \n     anyone else of this time.'' He used his Community Progress \n     Inc. and other programs to blend together urban and human \n     renewal ``like nobody else,'' Parker said.\n       Lee ``was meticulous about government,'' Parker said. ``He \n     was willing to bring people into the administration who were \n     smarter than he was'' and listened to what they said.\n       ``It wasn't the buildings'' that made Lee significant, said \n     DeStefano. ``It was the people.''\n       When Lee started as mayor, ``the African American \n     population was increasing but there was bad housing and old \n     schools. There was discrimination,'' said former Mayor John \n     C. Daniels, who met Lee as a high school student and was \n     later introduced to politics when Lee appointed him to fill a \n     vacancy on the Board of Aldermen.\n       ``He was in the forefront of changing that,'' said Daniels \n     who served as mayor for two terms from 1990 to 1994 and was \n     the first, and still the only, African American to hold the \n     office.\n\n\n                           BRING IN THE BEST\n\n       Lee made it acceptable for mayors to reach outside of the \n     city to bring in talented people, said former two-term mayor \n     Frank Logue, younger brother of the late Edward Logue, who \n     was Lee's right-hand man before moving on to help remake \n     Boston and New York City.\n       ``He put together energetic and creative people to be the \n     key people in city government,'' Logue said. ``As far as I \n     know, he was the first guy to do that in a serious way . . \n     .''\n       One of the significant things about Lee is the extent to \n     which even his critics respected him.\n       ``He's really one of New Haven's heroic figures,'' said \n     Vincent J. Scully Jr., Sterling professor emeritus in art \n     history at Yale University.\n       Scully was one of the people who successfully opposed Lee-\n     era redevelopment plans that would have knocked down the post \n     office and federal court building that now bears Lee's name, \n     the New Haven Free Public Library and Union Station.\n       But Lee ``was a dedicated man,'' Scully said. ``He really \n     has to be regarded as New Haven's greatest mayor.''\n       Lee sought advice from the experts of that time and ``got \n     the best advice he could,'' said Scully, a New Haven native. \n     ``I though a lot of it was very much a mistake . . . but that \n     wasn't Lee's fault . . . He did what the experts told him to \n     do . . .\n       Scully said the reaction to urban renewal spawned a new era \n     for urban planners, led here by former New Haven Preservation \n     Trust director Margaret ``Peggy'' Flynn.\n       ``New Haven became the heart and soul of the New \n     Preservation movement,'' he said.\n       To many people, Lee was the guy who saved New Haven. To \n     others however, including many of those who lived along Oak \n     Street and Legion avenue, neighborhoods he bulldozed for the \n     never-completed Route 34 connector, he was a pariah.\n       But, according to one of his former top staffers, former \n     Redevelopment Agency head Harold Grabino, ``the `wrecked New \n     Haven` stuff is a lot of crap.''\n       ``It's unfortunate that it didn't hold,'' Grabino, now a \n     New York City developer, said of Lee's bold effort to rebuild \n     New Haven. ``But without the attempt that was made, New \n     Haven would have been in far worse shape than it was, a \n     lot earlier.''\n       Grabino remembers Lee as ``very much a person-to-person \n     politician'' who worked masterfully to try to satisfy New \n     Haven's diverse population and varying ethnic groups.\n       He also remembers him as a man who, after one particularly \n     grueling day trip to Washington, D.C. to testify before \n     Congress, insisted upon stopping at three wakes on the way \n     home from LaGuardia Airport.\n       Joel Cogen, legal counsel for the Redevelopment Agency \n     under Lee, said Lee really did believe in working with people \n     in the neighborhoods. ``It was an incipient thing at that \n     time.'' He said the mayor was further hamstrung by the kind \n     of federal money available, which favored demolition over \n     renewal.\n\n\n                           outlived legacies\n\n       One of the ironies of Lee's life is how--despite \n     infirmities that had doctors and his family worrying about \n     his health decades before he died--he managed to outlive many \n     of his legacies.\n       Those included his grandest, most symbolic and most \n     celebrated project, which cleared three downtown blocks--\n     angering dozens of business owners whose properties he \n     acquired--to make room for Macy's, Malley's, the Chapel \n     Square mall and what is now the Omni Hotel.\n       Since then, the Malley's building was leveled, Macy's \n     closed and most of the merchants in the mall have been sent \n     packing, although a new developer is on the scene with \n     promises of upscale stores.\n       The three-block project was the largest physical component \n     of Lee's urban renewal programs and many critics have viewed \n     its decline as evidence of failure. Others, including \n     DeStefano and some of Lee's former staffers, say the \n     development served its purpose and now must be redone.\n       Lee came to terms years ago with the fact that even some of \n     his grandest plans had faded.\n       ``Well, we still have the hotel,'' he laughed, throwing up \n     his arms in a shrug when asked about the state of downtown in \n     1998.\n       Lee even managed to outlive some of the huge public works \n     projects intended to be his memorials: the Richard C. Lee \n     High School closed in 1986; the Oak Street/Route 34 \n     connector, which later was named for him, was never finished.\n       He joked privately at the 1994 dedication of the four block \n     connector as the ``Richard C. Lee Highway'' that it was one \n     of his greatest disappointments. ``Let's just say it's an \n     awfully short highway,'' he said.\n       Finally, in 1998 the federal government renamed the federal \n     courthouse on Church Street after him--a memorial that is \n     likely to remain standing for some time.\n       Appropriately, it was a building he once sought to knock \n     down.\n       Lee recognized the contradictions of his legacy long ago \n     and commented on it in a speech he delivered in 1980 when the \n     U.S. Conference of Mayors gave him a public service award.\n       ``For every failure we recorded, we had more than our share \n     of successes,'' Lee said, referring to his entire generation \n     of mayors, ``and, by God, I'm proud of that era.\n       ``We would dream, and we did; we would try, and we did,'' \n     he said. ``When we failed, we failed magnificently, and, when \n     we succeeded, we succeeded sometime beyond our fondest \n     expectations, and, after all, what's wrong with a record like \n     that?''\n       He also recognized that even monumental plans have a \n     limited shelf life.\n       ``You know, we were swimming against the tide,'' Lee said, \n     referring to the social and economic forces, led by the \n     federal highway system, that literally took people and \n     commerce out to the suburbs in the second half of the last \n     century.\n\n\n                              a local guy\n\n       While Lee loved New Haven and chose not to move on to \n     higher office, his fame was not just a local phenomenon.\n       ``There were times when Dick Lee could have run for \n     governor. He could have run for senator. He probably could \n     even have taken a Cabinet position,'' said Daniels.\n       But ``Dick loved being mayor of New Haven,'' said \n     DeStefano. ``It meant the world to him. Except for Ellen and \n     his family, nothing meant more.''\n       Recognition of Lee's dedication, innovation and \n     leadership--and his role as an urban groundbreaker--cut \n     cleanly across ideological lines and emanated far beyond New \n     Haven.\n       In 1967, John Lindsay, the Republican mayor of America's \n     largest city, called Lee ``the dean of mayors in this \n     country'' and\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\n     said, ``Sometimes, my biggest problem is to develop something \n     in New York that Dick Lee hasn't thought of first.''\n       Conservative icon William F. Buckley Jr. once kidded that \n     Lee, a liberal Democrat, ``is excellently equipped to act as \n     a mayor, particularly of impoverished cities which desire to \n     mulct (extract) from the federal government funds to reify \n     (make concrete) Mr. Lee's municipal visions.''\n       A few days after Lee finally let go of City Hall in 1969, \n     the New York Times in an editorial called him ``one of the \n     pioneers of urban renewal'' and declared, ``a significant \n     chapter in American urban history was concluded.''\n       While New Haven won widespread fame as one of the ``model \n     cities'' of that era, Lee himself rejected that notion.\n       ``I resent the term `model city,' '' he told the New York \n     Post in August 1967, one week after five days of race riots \n     erupted. ``I have avoided it. I've hated it. We're not a \n     model city if there is a single man who is unemployed, if \n     there is a single slum home.''\n       He told Time magazine soon afterward: ``If New Haven is a \n     model city, then God help urban America.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/12/senate-section/article/S2338-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MITCHELL AWARD\n\n Ms. CANTWELL.

Our children must learn early that they have a lifelong \nresponsibility to reject illegal drug use and to stay sober. Our young \npeople who avoid drugs will grow up best able to participate in the \npromise of America.\n  Yet far too many Americans already use illegal drugs, and most of \nthose whose drug use has progressed--more than five million Americans--\ndo not even realize they need help. While those who suffer from \naddiction must help themselves, family, friends, and people with drug \nexperiences must do their part to help to heal and to make whole men \nand women who have been broken by addiction.\n  We know the drug trade is a business. Drug traffickers are in that \nbusiness to make money, and this Strategy outlines how we intend to \ndeny them revenue. In short, we intend to make the drug trade \nunprofitable wherever we can.\n  Our Strategy is performance-based, and its success will be measured \nby its results. Those results are our moral obligation to our children. \nI ask for your continued support in this critical endeavor.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to prohibit the use of taxpayers funds to advocate a \nposition that is inconsistent with existing Supreme Court precedent \nwith respect to the Second Amendment; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprohibit the use of taxpayer funds to advocate a position on the \nmeaning of the Second Amendment that is inconsistent with existing \nSupreme Court precedent, as expressed in the Supreme Court case of \nUnited States v. Miller.\n  This legislation responds to the Bush Administration's filing of two \nunprecedented briefs to the United States Supreme Court, which argued \nthat the\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\nSecond Amendment establishes an individual right to possess firearms. \nIn taking this position, the Justice Department directly contradicted \nthe well-established precedents of the Supreme Court, as expressed in \nthe seminal case of United States v. Miller. In that 1939 case, the \nSupreme Court found that the Second Amendment did not establish a \nprivate right of individuals to possess firearms, but rather was \nintended to ensure the effectiveness of groups of citizen-soldiers \nknown at the time as the Militia.\n  The Court in United States v. Miller explained the historical \nbackground to the Second Amendment and issued its ruling clearly and \nunambiguously. That ruling has never been reversed, and the Court has \nfollowed it in every subsequent related case. Similarly, the precedent \nin United States v. Miller has been followed by every Justice \nDepartment over the past several decades, including the Justice \nDepartments of Presidents Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and George H.W. \nBush.\n  The meaning of the Second Amendment should not be a partisan issue. \nIn fact, it should not be a political issue. It is a legal and \nconstitutional issue. And the law on this question has been clearly \nestablished by the highest court in the land in case after case for a \nperiod of many decades.\n  Unfortunately, instead of following the law, as Attorney General \npromised to do during his confirmation hearing, the Bush Administration \nand the Justice Department have used their authority to file briefs as \na means of pursuing a partisan political agenda that flies in the face \nof established Supreme Court precedents. This is wrong. And, in my \nview, it is a misuse of taxpayer dollars.\n  Congress should not have to pass a law to ensure that the Executive \nBranch follows the Constitution, as clearly interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt. Unfortunately, in light of the Bush's Administration's latest \nactions, Congress must step in. After all, Congress's ultimate power is \nthe power of the purse. And we have a responsibility to use that power, \nwhen necessary, to ensure that the Executive Branch complies with \nconstitutional law.\n  This responsibility flows from Congress's obligation to preserve, \nprotect and defend the Constitution. It also flows from our obligation \nto ensure that taxpayer dollars are not misused. The American people \nshould not be forced to pay taxes to support an unreasonable \ninterpretation of the Second Amendment that is not only inconsistent \nwith constitutional law, but that threatens to undermine legislation \nneeded to reduce gun violence and to save lives.\n\n  In 1998, more than 30,000 Americans died from firearm-related deaths. \nThat is almost as many as the number of Americans who died in the \nentire Korean War. In my view, there is much that Congress needs to do \nto reduce these deaths, including enacting reasonable gun safety \nlegislation. Yet if the Bush Administration prevails in its effort to \nradically revise the Second Amendment, such laws could well be \nundermined. The end result would be more death and more families losing \nloved ones to the scourge of gun violence.\n  I have asked the Congressional Research Service whether there are any \nconstitutional precedents that would bar the Congress from adopting \nthis legislation, and the answer was ``no.'' I also would note that \nthere is precedent for Congress prohibiting the use of taxpayer dollars \nto advocate positions with which Congress disagrees. For example, \nCongress for many years prohibited the Justice Department from using \nappropriated money to overturn certain rules under our antitrust laws. \nThis responded to the filing of a brief in the Supreme Court by the \nJustice Department urging a revision of its precedents on resale price \nmaintenance, and the legislation effectively blocked the Department \nfrom filing similar briefs.\n  In conclusion, we should not allow taxpayer dollars to be used to \nmisrepresent the meaning of the Second Amendment on behalf of a \npartisan, political agenda. We should defend the Constitution against \nsuch ideological attacks. We should protect taxpayers from being forced \nto subsidize ideological gambits. And we should ensure that the \nConstitution is not misused to undermine gun safety legislation that \ncould save the lives of many innocent Americans.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record, \nalong with some related materials about this matter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 364\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS.\n\n       No funds appropriated to the Department of Justice or any \n     other agency may be used to file any brief or to otherwise \n     advocate before any judicial or administrative body any \n     position with respect to the meaning of the Second Amendment \n     to the Constitution that is inconsistent with existing \n     Supreme Court precedent, as expressed in United States v. \n     Miller (307 U.S. 174 (1939)).\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 12, 2002]\n\n                A Faulty Rethinking of the 2nd Amendment\n\n                            (By Jack Rakove)\n\n       Stanford, CA.--The Bush administration has found a \n     constitutional right it wants to expand. Attorney General \n     John D. Ashcroft attracted only mild interest a year ago when \n     he told the National Rifle Association, ``The text and \n     original intent of the Second Amendment clearly protect the \n     right of individuals to keep and bear firearms.''\n       Now, briefs just filed by Solicitor General Theodore Olson \n     in two cases currently being appealed to the Supreme Court \n     indicate that Mr. Ashcroft's personnel opinion has become \n     that of the United States government. This posture represents \n     an astonishing challenge to the long-settled doctrine that \n     the right to bear arms protected by the Second Amendment is \n     closely tied to membership in the militia. It is no secret \n     that controversy about the meaning of the amendment has \n     escalated in recent years. As evidence grew that a \n     significant portion of the American electorate favored the \n     regulation of firearms, the N.R.A. and its allies insisted \n     ever more vehemently that the private right to possess arms \n     is a constitutional absolute. This opinion, once seen as \n     marginal, has become an article of faith on the right, and \n     Republican politicians have in turn had to acknowledge its \n     force.\n       The two cases under appeal do not offer an ideal test of \n     the administration's new views. One concerns a man charged \n     with violating a federal statute prohibiting individuals \n     under domestic violence restraining orders from carrying \n     guns; the other involves a man convicted of owning machine \n     guns, which is illegal under federal law. In both cases, the \n     defendants cite the Second Amendment as protecting their \n     right to have the firearms. The unsavory facts may explain \n     why Mr. Olson is using these cases as vehicles to announce \n     the administration's constitutional position while urging the \n     Supreme Court not to accept the appeals.\n       The court last examined this issue in 1939 in United States \n     v. Miller. There it held that the Second Amendment was \n     designed to ensure the effectiveness of the militia, not to \n     guarantee a private right to possess firearms. The Miller \n     case, though it did not fully explore the entire \n     constitutional history, has guided the government's position \n     on firearm issues for the past six decades.\n       If the court were to take up the two cases on appeal, it is \n     far from clear that the Justice Department's new position \n     would prevail. The plain text of the Second Amendment--``A \n     well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a \n     free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n     shall not be infringed''--does not support the unequivocal \n     view that Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Olson have put forth. The \n     amendment refers to the right of the people, rather than the \n     individual person of the Fifth Amendment. And the phrase \n     ``keep and bear arms'' is, as most commentators note, a \n     military reference.\n       Nor do the debates surrounding the adoption of the \n     amendment support the idea that the framers were thinking of \n     an individual right to own arms. The relevant proposals \n     offered by the state ratification conventions of 1787-88 all \n     dealt with the need to preserve the militia as an alternative \n     to a standing army. The only recorded discussion of the \n     amendment in the House of Representatives concerned whether \n     religious dissenters should be compelled to serve in the \n     militia. And in 1789, the Senate deleted one clause \n     explicitly defining the militia as ``composed of the body of \n     the people.'' In excising this phrase, the Senate gave \n     ``militia'' a narrower meaning than it otherwise had, thereby \n     making the Ashcroft interpretation harder to sustain.\n       Advocates of the individual right respond to these \n     objections in three ways.\n       They argue, first that when Americans used the word \n     militia, they ordinarily meant the entire adult male \n     population capable of bearing arms. But Article I of the \n     Constitution defines the militia as an institution under the \n     joint regulation of the national and state governments, and \n     the debates of 1787-89 do not demonstrate that the framers \n     believed that the militia should forever by synonymous with \n     the entire population.\n       A second argument revolves around the definition of ``the \n     people.'' Those on the\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\n     N.R.A. side believe ``the people'' means ``all persons.'' But \n     in Article I we also read that the people will elect the \n     House of Representatives--and the determination of who can \n     vote will be left to state law, in just the way that militia \n     service would remain subject to Congressional and state \n     regulation.\n       The third argument addresses the critical phrase deleted in \n     the Senate. Rather than concede that the Senate knew what it \n     was doing, these commentators contend that the deletion was \n     more a matter of careless editing.\n       This argument is faulty because legal interpretation \n     generally assumes that lawmakers act with clear purpose. More \n     important, the Senate that made this critical deletion was \n     dominated by Federalists who were skeptical of the milita's \n     performance during the Revolutionary War and opposed to the \n     idea that the future of American defense lay with the militia \n     rather than a regular army. They had sound reasons not to \n     commit the national government to supporting a mass militia, \n     and thus to prefer a phrasing implying that the militia need \n     not embrace the entire adult male population if Congress had \n     good reason to require otherwise. The evidence of text and \n     history makes it very hard to argue for an expansive \n     individual right to keep arms.\n       There is one striking curiosity to the Bush \n     administration's advancing its position at this time. \n     Advocates of the individual-right interpretation typically \n     argue that an armed populace is the best defense against the \n     tyranny of our own government. And yet the Bush \n     administration seems quite willing to compromise essential \n     civil liberties in the name of security. It is sobering to \n     think that the constitutional right the administration values \n     so highly is the right to bear arms, that peculiar product of \n     an obsolete debate over the danger of standing armies--and \n     this at a time when our standing army is the most powerful \n     the world has known.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 10, 2002]\n\n                            Guns and Justice\n\n       The U.S. Solicitor General has a duty to defend acts of \n     Congress before the Supreme Court. This week, Solicitor \n     General Ted Olson--and by extension his bosses, Attorney \n     General John Ashcroft and President Bush--took a position \n     regarding guns that will undermine that mission.\n       Historically, the Justice Department has adopted a narrow \n     reading of the Constitution's Second Amendment, which states \n     that ``a well regulated militia being necessary to the \n     security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and \n     bear arms shall not be infringed.'' Along with nearly all \n     courts in the past century, it has read that as protecting \n     only the public's collective right to bear arms in the \n     context of militia service. Now the administration has \n     reversed this view. In a pair of appeals, Mr. Olson contends \n     that ``the Second Amendment more broadly protects the rights \n     of individuals, including persons who are not members of any \n     militia . . . to possess and bear their own firearms.'' Mr. \n     Ashcroft insists the department remains prepared to defend \n     all federal gun laws. Having given away its strongest \n     argument, however, it will be doing so with its hands tied \n     behind its back.\n       Laws will now be defended not as presumptively valid but as \n     narrow exceptions to a broad constitutional right--one \n     subject, as Mr. Olson put it, only to ``reasonable \n     restrictions designed to prevent possession by unfit persons \n     or to restrict the possession of types of firearms that are \n     particularly suited to criminal misuse.'' This may sound like \n     a common-sense balancing act. But where exactly does the \n     Second Amendment, if it guarantees individual rights, permit \n     ``reasonable restrictions''? And where does its protection \n     exempt firearms that might be well suited for crime?\n       Mr. Ashcroft has compared the gun ownership right with the \n     First Amendment's protection of speech--which can be limited \n     only in a fashion narrowly tailored to accomplish compelling \n     state interests. If that's the model, most federal gun laws \n     would sooner or later fall. After all, it would not be \n     constitutional to subject someone to a background check \n     before permitting him to worship or to make a political \n     speech. If gun ownership is truly a parallel right, why would \n     the Brady background check be constitutional?\n       The Justice Department traditionally errs on the other \n     side--arguing for constitutional interpretations that \n     increase congressional flexibility and law enforcement policy \n     options. The great weight of judicial precedent holds that \n     there is no fundamental individual right to own a gun. \n     Staking out a contrary position may help ingratiate the Bush \n     administration to the gun lobby. But it greatly disserves the \n     interests of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 14, 2002]\n\n                   An Ominous Reversal on Gun Rights\n\n       Using a footnote in a set of Supreme Court briefs, Attorney \n     General John Ashcroft announced a radical shift last week in \n     six decades of government policy toward the rights of \n     Americans to own guns. Burying the change in fine print \n     cannot disguise the ominous implications for law enforcement \n     or Mr. Ashcroft's betrayal of his public duty.\n       The footnote declares that, contrary to longstanding and \n     bipartisan interpretation of the Second Amendment, the \n     Constitution ``broadly protects the rights of individuals'' \n     to own firearms. This view and the accompanying legal \n     standard Mr. Ashcroft has suggested--equating gun ownership \n     with core free speech rights--could make it extremely \n     difficult for the government to regulate firearms, as it has \n     done for decades. That position comports with Mr. Ashcroft's \n     long-held personal opinion, which he expressed a year ago in \n     a letter to his close allies at the National Rifle \n     Association. But it is a position at odds with both history \n     and the Constitution's text. As the Supreme Court correctly \n     concluded in a 1939 decision that remains the key legal \n     precedent on the subject, the Second Amendment protects only \n     those rights that have ``some reasonable relationship to the \n     preservation of efficiency of a well-regulated militia.'' By \n     not viewing the amendment as a basic, individual right, this \n     decision left room for broad gun ownership regulation. The \n     footnote is also at odds with Mr. Ashcroft's pledge at his \n     confirmation hearing that his personal ideology would not \n     drive Justice Department legal policies.\n       It is hard to take seriously Mr. Ashcroft's assertion that \n     the Bush administration remains committed to the vigorous \n     defense and enforcement of all federal gun laws. Mr. \n     Ashcroft, after all, is an official whose devotion to the gun \n     lobby extends to granting its request to immediately destroy \n     records of gun purchases amassed in the process of conducting \n     Brady law background checks even though they might be useful \n     for tracking weapons purchases by suspected terrorists.\n       The immediate effect of the Bush Justice Department's \n     expansive reading of the Second Amendment is to undermine law \n     enforcement by calling into question valuable state and \n     federal gun restrictions on the books, and by handing \n     dangerous criminals a potent new weapon for challenging their \n     convictions. What it all adds up to is a gift to pro-gun \n     extremists, and a shabby deal for everyone else.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. \n        Cochran):\n  S. 365. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to establish a \nprogram to make allocations to States for projects to expand 2-lane \nhighways in rural areas to 4-lane highways; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, to introduce \nthe Rural Four-Lane Highway Safety and Development Act of 2003. We are \npleased to be joined by Senators Lincoln and Cochran in sponsoring the \nbill.\n  The purpose of this bipartisan legislation is to ensure that States \nhave the resources they need to upgrade major two-lane roads across the \nNation to high-quality four-lane divided highways. The goals of this \nbill are to improve the safety of our most dangerous highways and to \nstimulate economic development in rural areas.\n  I think most Senators would agree that the Dwight D. Eisenhower \nNational System of Interstate and Defense Highways is one of the \ntransportation marvels of the 20th century. The system's 46,000 miles \nof divided highways interconnect virtually every major urban area in \nthe Nation. The system represents one of the most efficient and safest \nhighway systems in the world.\n  Unfortunately, when the Interstate System was planned, it left many \nrural communities and smaller urban areas without direct links to the \nhigh-quality transportation network that the interstate highways \nprovide. Many of these smaller and rural communities continue to suffer \neconomically because of the lack of high-quality four-lane highways.\n  To address this issue, in 1995 Congress developed the concept of a \nNational Highway System as a way of extending the benefits of an \nefficient highway network to all areas of the country. Congress \ndesignated the National Highway System to help focus Federal resources \non the Nation's most important roads.\n  Today there are about 160,000 miles on the National Highway System, \nincluding all of the interstate highways and all other routes that are \nimportant to the Nation's economy, defense, and general mobility. The \nNHS comprises only 4 percent of the Nation's roads, but carries more \nthan 40 percent of all highway traffic, 75 percent of heavy truck \ntraffic and 90 percent of tourist traffic.\n  The NHS reaches nearly every part of the Nation. According to the \nFederal Highway Administration, about 90 percent of America's \npopulation lives within 5 miles of an NHS route. All urban areas with a \npopulation of more than 50,000, and 93 percent with a population of \nbetween 5,000 and 50,000, are within 5 miles of the NHS. Counties with \nNHS highways have 99 percent of\n\n[[Page S2344]]\n\nall jobs, including 99 percent of all manufacturing jobs, 97 percent of \nmining jobs, and 93 percent of agricultural jobs.\n  The NHS is the critical transportation link for most of our Nation's \nrural areas. The Federal Highway Administration estimates that, of the \n160,000 miles now on the National Highway System, fully 75 percent, or \n119,000 miles, are in rural areas. Of the 1.2 trillion total vehicle \nmiles traveled in 2000 on NHS roads, about 60 percent were in rural \nareas.\n  I hope all Senators will agree that improving highway safety should \nbe our top priority. When it comes to highway safety, the fact is that \ntravel on four-lane roads is safer than two-lane roads. This is \nespecially true in rural areas. According to the Bureau of \nTransportation Statistics, in 1998 the rate of traffic fatalities on \nall rural roads was 2.39 per 100-million vehicle miles; however, the \nrate on rural interstate highways was half as high--only 1.23 per 100 \nmillion vehicle-miles.\n  The reason for the lower fatality rate on rural interstate highways \nshould be obvious. When a road has only one lane in each direction, \ntrucks and other slow-moving vehicles increase the hazard of passing. \nVehicles turning on or off a two-lane road can also increase risk. A \ndivided four-lane highway greatly reduces these perils.\n  Of the 119,000 miles of rural NHS roads, about 33,000 miles are \ninterstates and another 28,000 miles have been upgraded to four or more \nlanes. The remaining 58,000 miles--more than half of this rural highway \nnetwork--are still only two-lane roads with no central divider. These \nare the most dangerous roads on the National Highway System.\n  In my State of New Mexico, we have made some progress toward \nupgrading our rural two-lane highways to four lanes. In recent years, \nUS550 from Bernalillo to Bloomfield, US285 from Interstate 40 to \nCarlsbad, and a key segment of US54 from El Paso to Alamogordo have \nbeen widened to four lanes. In addition, upgrading of US70 from Las \nCruces to Clovis is nearly completed. But much more remains to be done.\n  New Mexico has 2,647 miles of rural roads in the NHS. Eight hundred \nand ninety-two of these NHS miles are interstates. Of the balance of \nNew Mexico's NHS highways, 1,755 miles are in the rural parts of my \nState, especially Chaves, Colfax, Eddy, Lincoln, Guadalupe, Otero, \nQuay, San Juan, and Union Counties. And almost 70 percent--1,217 \nmiles--of New Mexico's rural NHS highways remain only two-lane roads. \nThese two-lane roads are major transportation routes with heavy truck \nand commercial traffic. In 2000, a total of 10.3 billion vehicle miles \nwere traveled on New Mexico's NHS highways, and about one quarter, or \n2.7 billion miles, were traveled on these rural NHS roads.\n  Unfortunately, there are only very limited funds available to upgrade \nthe most important two-lane rural NHS roads to four-lane highways. \nAccording to a recent GAO study, over two-thirds of all Federal highway \nfunding between 1992 and 2000 has gone either to roads in urban areas \nor to interstate highways. Consequently, there is a continuing \nshortfall in Federal highway funding needed to upgrade the most \nimportant rural two-lane roads. Our bill will help address the \nshortfall so that more rural segments of the NHS can be improved to \nfour-lane divided highways.\n  As in many States, New Mexico's rural counties strongly believe their \neconomic future depends on access to safe and efficient four-lane \nhighways. Basic transportation infrastructure is one of the critical \nelements for companies choosing where to locate. Truck drivers and the \ntraveling public prefer the safety and efficiency of a four-lane \ndivided highway.\n  Thus one of the top priorities for rural cities and counties in my \nState is to complete the four-lane upgrade of such key routes as US54 \nfrom Tularosa to Nara Visa, US62/180 from Carlsbad to the Texas state \nline, US64/87 from Clayton to Raton, and US666 from north of Gallup to \nShiprock. These two-lane rural routes in New Mexico not only bear some \nof the State's heaviest truck and automobile traffic, but also are some \nof the State's most dangerous roads. In fact, US666 is considered one \nof the most dangerous two-lane highways in the Nation.\n  New Mexico is not alone among western states in needing to upgrade \ntwo-lane roads on the National Highway System. For example, Texas has \nalmost 3,500 miles of rural two-lane NHS roads. Montana has 2,469 \nmiles, Kansas has 2,293, Nebraska 1,964, Wyoming 1,924, Minnesota \n1,897, and Missouri 1,853 miles.\n  In the East, where States are smaller, many NHS routes remain only \ntwo lanes. In Vermont, 78 percent of rural NHS roads are only two \nlanes, in New Hampshire it's 84 percent and 99 percent in Maine.\n  I do believe it is time Congress took action to improve the safety of \ntravelers on the highest priority rural two-lane roads. Last year, I \nsecured nearly $1 million in Federal funding to begin the upgrade of \nUS64/87 between Clayton and Raton, which is part of the Ports-to-Plains \nHigh Priority Corridor on the National Highway System.\n\n  In addition, last week Senator Roberts and I introduced S. 290, which \ndesignates U.S. Highway 54 from El Paso, Texas, through New Mexico, \nTexas, and Oklahoma to Wichita, Kansas, as the SPIRIT High Priority \nCorridor. Our bipartisan bill has four cosponsors. A high-priority \ncorridor designation provides no additional Federal funding, but helps \nfocus attention on the need to upgrade the nation's major two-lane \nroutes.\n  The purpose of the bill we are introducing today, the Rural Four-Lane \nHighway Safety and Development Act of 2003, is to provide direct \nFederal funding to States to upgrade existing two-lane roads in rural \nareas to safe and efficient four-lane divided highways. The States \nwould determine which two-lane roads they wanted to upgrade. To be \neligible for funding, the highway must be on the National Highway \nSystem or a congressionally designated High Priority Corridor. Our bill \ngives funding priority to upgrading the most dangerous two-lane \nhighways, routes most affected by increased traffic as a result of \nNAFTA, highways that have high levels of commercial traffic, and \nprojects that will help stimulate regional economic growth. Total \nfunding for six years is $1.8 billion from the highway trust fund.\n  My State bears a substantial burden in the maintenance and upgrading \nof its portion of critical national highways. New Mexico has 3.3 \npercent of the Nation's land area, but only 6 tenths of one percent of \nthe population. We have 2.2 percent of all of the interstate highway \nmiles and 1.7 percent of all other NHS miles. At the same time, as a \nborder State, New Mexico is common route for trucks crossing the border \nwith Mexico and heading to or coming from the east and west coasts. It \nis likely that the upgrading to four lanes of the most important NHS \nhighways in New Mexico might not occur without the supplemental funding \nprovided in my bill.\n  I continue to believe strongly in the important role of highway \ninfrastructure to economic development. Even in this age of the so-\ncalled ``new'' economy and high-speed digital communications, roads \ncontinue to link our communities together and to carry the commercial \ngoods and products our citizens need. Safe and efficient highways are \nespecially important to citizens in the rural parts of our country.\n  I recognize that the funding level in this bill is inadequate to \nupgrade all of the remaining two-lane routes on the NHS in the next six \nyears. Upgrading an existing two-lane road to a full four-lane divided \nhighway can cost upward of one million dollars per mile.\n  Moreover, some of the existing two-lane roads probably don't have \nsufficient traffic to justify upgrading at this time. In addition, some \ntwo-lane NHS routes pass through scenic areas where it may not be \nappropriate to upgrade to four lanes. However, I do believe the funding \nin this bill will take us a long way toward ensuring the most critical \nprojects are completed in the next six years.\n  This year Congress will take up the reauthorization of the \ncomprehensive six-year transportation bill, TEA-21. We are introducing \nthis bipartisan bill today to help ensure that the issue of the safety \nof rural two-lane NHS routes receives the attention it deserves as the \ndebate on reauthorization begins. I look forward to working with the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Inhofe, \nand Senator Jeffords, the ranking member, as well as Senators Bond and\n\n[[Page S2345]]\n\nReid of the Transportation, Infrastructure and Nuclear Safety \nSubcommittee, to find a way to ensure additional federal resources are \nin place to hasten the work of upgrading rural two-lane NHS roads to \nsafe, efficient four-lane divided highways.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 365\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions from \nelectric powerplants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nClean Power Act of 2003 along with 19 of my colleagues, Republicans and \nDemocrats. That is a fifth of the Senate on record supporting a measure \nwhich dramatically reduces emissions of four pollutants coming from \npower plants--sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide and \nmercury.\n  These pollutants create or contribute to smog, soot, acid rain, \nmercury contamination and global warming. They cause death, disease, \necological degradation, birth defects, and increase the risk of abrupt \nand unwelcome climate changes.\n  The nation has made some impressive strides in reducing air pollution \nsince 1990. But there is a lot of unfinished business, a fact confirmed \nevery day by more and ever better science.\n  Power plants are still the nation's single largest source of air \npollution, including greenhouse gases. They are responsible for 60 \npercent or more of national sulfur dioxide emissions, 25 percent of \nnitrogen oxides, 40 percent of carbon dioxide, and about 45 tons of \nmercury annually.\n  Fine particulate matter coming from power plants, mainly through \nSOX and NOX emissions, is causing or contributing \nto the premature deaths of approximately 30,000 people.\n  More than 130 million people are living in areas with unhealthy air. \nGround-level ozone triggers over 6.2 million asthma attacks each summer \nin the eastern United States alone, and some studies show that it may \nactually cause asthma. Another 160,000 people are sent to emergency \nrooms due to smog-induced respiratory illness. Power plants are \nsignificant contributors to this air quality degradation, as well as \ncausing major reductions in visibility in our national parks and wild \nplaces. The National Park Service posts air quality warning signs for \nhikers in the Great Smoky Mountains every other day on average during \nthe high ozone season.\n  Acid rain continues to fall on the Northeast, and the Southeast, \ndamaging sensitive ecosystems and acidifying lakes and streams. In my \nstate of Vermont, the red spruce, the sugar maple, and other species \nare becoming more and more immune-compromised.\n  The Hubbard Brook Research Foundation says we must reduce sulfur \ndioxide emissions by 80 percent from current Clean Air Act requirements \nto begin biological recovery mid-century in the Northeastern U.S. That \nmeans bringing emissions way down now, not prolonging the wait for \nhealthy trees and lakes.\n  Coal-fired power plants emit the bulk of the uncontrolled mercury \nemissions in the U.S. Mercury is a potent neurotoxic pollutant. It \ncontaminates fish causing fish consumption warnings in 41 States. And \nmercury puts over 60,000 children at risk of negative developmental \neffects due to fetal exposure.\n  Despite our international commitment to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions to 1990 levels through voluntary means, we have failed. In \nparticular, power sector emissions of carbon dioxide, a major \ngreenhouse gas, have increased by more than 25 percent since 1990. This \nfailure increases the risks from global warming.\n  It is plainly obvious that we must make swift and major reductions in \nthese pollutants for the sake of public health, the environment, and \nthe world's climate. Without quick action, the nation's fleet of fossil \npower plants will continue to inefficiently belch out millions of tons \nof harmful pollutants.\n  The Clean Power Act of 2003 will mainly use the largely successful \ncap-and-trade system in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments to make quick \nand cost-effective reductions in these pollutants. At the same time, \nthis bill does not abolish or eliminate any of the vital local and \nregional air quality protection programs in the Clean Air Act. Our bill \nreduces emissions of sulfur dioxide by 81 percent from 2000. Nitrogen \noxides will be reduced by 71 percent from 2000. And carbon dioxide will \nbe capped at 21 percent below 2000 levels. Mercury will be controlled \nto 90 percent below 1999 levels.\n  This bill has a hybrid allocation system for distributing the \nallowances for the three capped and tradable pollutants \n(NOX, SOX, CO2). Most allocations, \nabout \\2/3\\, go to households and consumers. The rest go to renewable \nenergy, energy efficiency, and other categories. This system rewards \ncleaner power producers and ensures that the public gets compensated \nfor the polluters' use of the atmosphere.\n  Our bill is intended to save the lives that are now being lost \nprematurely to lung disease and other illnesses. We want to continue on \nthe path set in 1990 of reducing acid rain.\n  We want certainty that mercury will no longer threaten unborn \nchildren and the future environment will be safer and cleaner for them \nwhen they are grown.\n  Certainty is a valuable commodity. Industry witnesses have testified \nthat certainty is critical to their investment strategies. Our bill \nprovides a\n\n[[Page S2346]]\n\nclear signal on exactly what is expected of pollution sources and when.\n  I want certainty that the promise of the Clean Air Act will be \ndelivered to all Americans.\n  At the Environment and Public Works Committee, we have heard many \ntimes that technologies are readily available to meet the challenges in \nour bill. And that these challenges can be met in a cost-effective \nmanner that allows our economy to prosper and improve public health.\n  We can't afford to slow down progress on achieving better air quality \nand we must start to make real progress in reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions. The voluntary approach has failed for 12 years now and we \nmust do better.\n  As Senators may know, when I was Chairman of the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee, we approved a bill nearly identical to the \nbill that we are introducing today. The only significant difference is \nthat the deadline for compliance with all the pollution caps except \nmercury have been moved later by one year. Mercury still follows the \nschedule in the consent decree which requires compliance by 2008.\n  I look forward to entering into serious discussions with the \nAdministration on signing into law good, comprehensive four-pollutant \nlegislation. However, their actions so far on air quality matters have \nnot fostered an atmosphere of trust and cooperation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a brief summary of the legislation and \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 366\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Title IV of the Clean Air Act (relating to noise pollution) \n     (42 U.S.C. 7641 et seq.)--\n       (1) is amended by redesignating sections 401 through 403 as \n     sections 801 through 803, respectively; and\n       (2) is redesignated as title VIII and moved to appear at \n     the end of that Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Summary of the Clean Power Act of 2003\n\n       Amends the Clean Air Act with a new title VII--Electric \n     Generation Emission Reductions.\n       Caps--Sets annual emissions caps for three pollutants that \n     apply beginning in 2009: SOx--275,000 tons in \n     western region; 1,975,000 tons in eastern region; \n     NOx--1,510,000 tons; and CO2--\n     2,050,000,000 tons.\n       Mercury emissions are capped in 2008 at a rate that results \n     in 5 tons annually\n       The Administrator is authorized to reduce these caps if the \n     Administrator determines that they are not reasonably \n     anticipated to protect public health or welfare or the \n     environment. In addition, the Administrator is authorized to \n     limit the emissions from an electric generating facility \n     (EGF), if she determines that its emissions may reasonably be \n     anticipated to cause or contribute to a significant adverse \n     impact on an area.\n       Modernization--By the later of 2014, or 40 years after \n     commencing operation, each EGF must achieve emission \n     limitations reflecting the best available control technology \n     applied to a new major source of the same generating \n     capacity.\n       Allownace Creation & Trading--Allowances are created \n     representing each of the caps' tons and may be traded, except \n     for\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\n     mercury. They will have unique serial numbers to identify \n     them. Western and Eastern SOx allowances may be \n     traded between regions, but extra-regional allowances can't \n     be used to meet an EGF's obligations. Trading in emission \n     allowances with other sectors is prohibited, except if the \n     allowances are for carbon dioxide and are created by a cap on \n     another non-electricity sector.\n       Allowance Submission to Meet Caps--Three months after the \n     end of 2009, and every year thereafter, each electric \n     generating facility that generates 15 MW (or the thermal \n     equivalent) or greater from a fossil fuel combustion unit or \n     combination of units that sells electricity must give to EPA \n     at last the amount of allowances that represent the tons they \n     emitted in the previous year. Allowances created and banked \n     under Title IV (acid rain--SOx) or through Title I \n     regulations (ozone--NOx), may be used at the rate \n     of 4:1. However, if allowances are banked because a facility \n     meets NSPS in the period 2001-2008, they may be used 1:1 for \n     compliance with Clean Power Act. Allowances under the Clean \n     Power Act may be banked.\n       Emissions Emission Penalties--By 2007 and every 3 years \n     thereafter, each state will identify the electric generating \n     facilities in that state and in other states that are \n     significantly contributing to non-attainment of an ozone \n     naaqs in that state. Beginning in 2009, the Administrator is \n     authorized, upon a petition from a state or a citizen \n     demonstrating that control measures are inadequate to prevent \n     that significant contribution, to require that each \n     identified and inadequately controlled facility submit 3 \n     nitrogen oxide emission allowances for each ton of nitrogen \n     oxides emitted by that electricity generating facility during \n     the period of an ozone naaqs exceedance that occurred in the \n     previous year.\n       An EGF that fails to submit enough allowances to EPA will \n     be required to submit additional emission allowances as a \n     penalty. This is similar to section 412 of CAA. For \n     SOx, NOx, and CO2, the \n     penalty is 3 times the excess emissions or shortfall in \n     allowances multiplied by the average annual market price of \n     the allowance. For mercury, the penalty is 3 times the excess \n     emissions and the average cost of mercury controls.\n       Mercury Emissions Limitation--Starting in 2008, mercury \n     emissions are limited to no greater than 2.48 grams of \n     mercury per 1,000 megawatt hours. This is equivalent to \n     reducing aggregate emissions of mercury from EGFs by 90 \n     percent from today's levels, and the emission limitation \n     imposed are deemed to be maximum achievable control \n     technology (MACT) for mercury. In the event that aggregate \n     emissions from EGFs go above the 5 ton cap, then EPA must \n     adjust the limitations downward. EGFs may average their \n     emissions over 30-day periods and between units at a single \n     facility. EPA must promulgate regulations to prevent the \n     rerelease of mercury into the environment from coal \n     combustion waste, i.e. fly ash.\n       Non-Mercury Haps Rulemaking--EPA must proposed MACT \n     regulations to cover non-mercury hazardous air pollutants \n     from EGFs by 2005 and enforce them by 2008.\n       Monitoring--Coal-fired EGFs above 50MW will be required to \n     conduct ambient air quality monitoring within a 30-mile \n     radius for hazardous air pollutants and sulfur dioxide \n     emitted by the facility. In general, EGFs must conduct \n     continuous emission monitoring.\n       Allowance Allocation.\n       Allowances representing the tons of pollution in the \n     emission caps for SOx, NOx, and \n     CO2, are distributed annually every year by the \n     Administrator in 2009 to five main categories: consumers/\n     households, transition assistance, renewable energy-\n     efficiency-cleaner energy, carbon sequestration, and \n     existing units.\n       Consumers/Households--After the allowances described below \n     are distributed, the Administration will have a minimum of \n     62.5% of the total allowances to distribute to households. \n     EPA will arrange for a trustee to receive these allowances \n     and to convey their fair market value to households based on \n     the number of persons in the household and the ratio of the \n     household's state's residential electricity consumption to \n     the national residential electricity consumption.\n       Transition Assistance--EPA will arrange for a trustee to \n     receive 6% of the allowance in 2009 (this declines over 10 \n     years by increments of .5 to 1.5% in 2018), who must then \n     turn around and obtain fair market value for those allowances \n     and convey:\n       80% of that value to dislocated workers and communities \n     that experience a disproportionate impact due to the emission \n     reductions required by the bill, and\n       20% to producers of electricity intensive products (like \n     aluminum) based on their share of total output multiplied by \n     the average amount of power used by most efficient production \n     process multiplied by the national average emission rate of \n     the covered pollutants from fossil fuel generating facilities \n     in tons per MW.\n       Renewable Energy Generating Units, Efficiency Projects and \n     Clean Energy Sources--EPA will allocate no more than 20% of \n     the total allowances to:\n       (1) renewable electricity generating units based on their \n     output multiplied by the national average emission rate of \n     the covered pollutants from fossil fuel generating facilities \n     in tons per MWh. So, for each avoided ton of pollution per \n     unit of output, the renewable generator will get an allowance \n     equal to one ton.\n       (2) owners and operators of energy efficient buildings, \n     producers of energy efficient products and entities that \n     carry out energy efficiency projects, based on the tons of \n     pollution that would have been emitted at the national \n     average rate for fossil fuel electricity generation or \n     natural gas combustion for each megawatt-hour or unit of \n     natural gas saved.\n       (3) cleaner fossil fuel EGFs, based on their output \n     multiplied by half of the tons of pollution that would \n     otherwise have been emitted at the national average rate for \n     fossil fuel electricity generation or natural gas combustion \n     for the same amount of output.\n       (4) combined heat and power facilities, based on their Btus \n     of thermal energy output multiplied by the tons of pollution \n     that would otherwise have been emitted in tons per Btu at a \n     fossil fuel EGF for the same amount of output.\n       Carbon Sequestration--EPA will allocate up to .075% of the \n     total carbon dioxide allowances to states for developing \n     biological carbon sequestration inventories and for \n     establishing state revolving loan funds for loans to owners \n     of nonindustrial private forest lands to carry out carbon \n     sequestration. EPW will allocate up to 1.5% of the total \n     carbon dioxide allowances to entities conducting geologic \n     carbon sequestration, based on the national average rate of \n     carbon dioxide emissions from EGFs per ton sequestered.\n       Existing Facilities. EPA will allocate 10% of the \n     allowances in 2009 (declining 1 point annually over time \n     until it reaches 1% in 2018) to EGFs based on share of 2000 \n     output.\n       Acid Precipitation and Sensitive ecosystem research--EPA \n     must expand the report completed every four years on the \n     reduction in acid deposition rates necessary to prevent \n     adverse ecological effects by including consideration of \n     changes in lakes and streams acid neutralizing capacity. In \n     addition, EPA must submit a report every four years on \n     sensitive ecosystems, including the Adirondacks, the mid-\n     Appalachian Mountains, the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain, the \n     Rocky Mountains, and the southern Blue Ridge Mountains. If \n     necessary, EPA is authorized to promulgate regulations in \n     2012 to protect them.\n       Failure of EPA to Issue Regs--EPA must promulgate \n     regulations by 2009 to implement and enforce these emission \n     limitations or each EGF must achieve specific emission \n     performance at each facility relative to an uncontrolled \n     source--95% for sulfur dioxide, 85% for nitrogen oxides, 25% \n     for carbon dioxide, and 90% for mercury.\n       Small Generator Inventory--EPA will conduct an inventory of \n     emissions from Electric Generating Facilities (EGFs) with \n     generating capacity less than 15MW. Based on that inventory, \n     EPA will annually subtract those emissions from the total \n     amount of allowances allocated prior to distribution each \n     year.\n       Savings Clause--Nothing in the Clean Power Act precludes a \n     State from adopting and enforcing any requirement for the \n     control of emissions of air pollutants that is more stringent \n     than the requirements imposed under this title.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Jeffords in \nintroducing the Clean Power Act of 2003. This bill will remove the \nloophole that has allowed the dirtiest, most polluting power plants in \nthe Nation to escape significant pollution controls for more than 30 \nyears.\n  Maine is one of the most beautiful and pristine States in the Nation. \nIt is also one of the most environmentally responsible States in the \nNation. Maine has fewer emissions of the pollutants that cause smog and \nacid rain than all but a handful of states. Maine also has one of the \nlowest emissions of carbon dioxide nationwide.\n  Unfortunately, despite the collective environmental consciousness of \nboth the citizens and industries of Maine, Maine still suffers from air \npollution. Every lake, river, and stream in Maine is subject to a state \nmercury advisory that warns pregnant women and young children to limit \nconsumption of fish caught in those waters. Even Acadia National Park, \none of the most beautiful national parks in the Nation, experiences \ndays in which visibility is obscured by smog.\n  Where does all this pollution come from? A large part of it comes \nfrom a relatively small number of mostly coal-fired power plants that \nuse loopholes to escape the provisions of the Clean Air Act. Coal-fired \npower plants are the single largest source of air pollution, mercury \ncontamination, and greenhouse gas emissions in the nation. A single \ncoal-fired power plant can emit more of the pollutants that cause smog \nand acid rain than all of the cars, factories, and businesses in Maine \ncombined.\n  As the easternmost State in the Nation, Maine is downwind of almost \nall power plants in the United States. Many of the pollutants emitted \nby these power plants--mercury, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and \ncarbon dioxide--end up in or over Maine. Airborne mercury falls into \nour lakes and\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\nstreams, contaminating freshwater fish and threatening our people's \nhealth. Carbon dioxide is causing climate change that threatens to \nalter Maine's delicate ecological balance. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen \noxides come to Maine in the form of acid rain and smog that damage the \nhealth of our people and the health of our environment.\n\n  A single power plant can emit nearly a ton of mercury in a single \nyear. That's equivalent to incinerating over 1 million mercury \nthermometers and is enough to contaminate millions of acres of \nfreshwater lakes. In contrast, Maine has zero power plant emissions of \nmercury. This bill would reduce mercury emissions from power plants by \n90 percent by 2009.\n  I am pleased that there has been so much recognition recently of the \nproblems that so many States are facing on clean air. President Bush \nhas proposed a ``Clear Skies'' initiative that will reduce emissions of \nmercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Last year, Senators \nCarper, Chafee, Breaux, and Baucus also introduced legislation that \nwould reduce these pollutants, as well as carbon dioxide.\n  There are important differences between these proposals. The \nJeffords/Collins bill does more to reduce smog, acid rain, mercury \npollution, and global warming than any other bill. Our bill provides \nmore public health and environmental benefits than any other serious \nproposal, and it provides the benefits sooner. However, any step which \nreduces air pollution is a step in the right direction. Our parks and \nour people have waited far too long for clean air.\n  I think virtually everyone agrees that we need to reduce power plant \npollution. I look forward to working with the Administration and my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to provide cleaner air.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor Senator Jeffords' \nbill--as I did in the 106th and 107th Congresses--as I am dedicated to \nreducing power plant emissions that cause some of the Nation's--and \nMaine's--most serious public health and environmental problems.\n  For too many years, coal-burning power plants exempt from emissions \nstandards under the Clean Air Act have created massive pollution \nproblems for the Northeast because whatever spews out of their \nsmokestacks in the Midwest, blows into the Northeast, including my \nState of Maine, giving it the dubious distinction of being at the ``end \nof the tailpipe'', so to speak.\n  The Jeffords' legislation calls for reductions of power plant \nemissions for pollutants that cause smog, soot, respiratory disease; \nacid rain that kills our forests; mercury that contaminates our lakes, \nrivers and streams; and climate variabilities that cause severe shifts \nin our weather patterns. Maine currently leads the Nation in asthma \ncases per capita, which is not a surprise, but which it can do little \nabout when nearly 80 percent of the State's dirty air is not of their \nown making but is transported by winds blowing in from the Midwest and \nSoutheast.\n  The bill will dramatically cut aggregate power plant emissions by \n2009 of the four major power plant pollutants: nitrogen oxides \nNOX, the primary cause of smog, by 71 percent from 2000 \nlevels; sulfur dioxide, SO2, that causes acid rain and \nrespiratory disease, by 81 percent from 2000 levels; mercury, Hg, which \npoisons our lakes and rivers, causing fish to be unfit for human \nconsumption, through a 90 percent reduction by 2008; and carbon \ndioxide, CO2, the greenhouse gas most directly linked to \nglobal climate variabilities, by 21 percent from 2000 levels. Of note, \nthe NOX, SO2, and mercury reductions are set at \nlevels that are known to be cost effective with available technology.\n\n  The bill will also eliminate the outdated coal-burning power plants \nthat were grandfathered in the Clean Air Act unless they apply the best \navailable pollution control technology by their 40th birthday or 2014, \nwhichever is later. The thinking for the exemption in the Clean Air Act \nwas based, at the time, on the assumption that the plants would not \nstay on line much longer. However, as energy has gotten more expensive, \ncompanies are keeping these older, dirtier plants up and running.\n  Furthermore, just as the Clean Air Act already provides tradable \nallowances for sulfur dioxide that causes acid rain, the Jeffords' \nlegislation also allows for tradable allowances to control emissions \nfor three other pollutants--NOX, SOX, \nCO2,--by using market-oriented mechanisms to meet emissions \nreduction requirements.\n  The tradable allowances would be distributed to five main categories, \nincluding 63 percent or more to households; six percent for transition \nassistance to affected communities and industries, which will decline \nover time; up to 20 percent to renewable energy generation, efficiency \nprojects and clean energy sources, based on avoided pollution; 10 \npercent to existing electric generating facilities based on 2000 \noutput; and up to 1.5 percent of the carbon dioxide allowances for \nbiological and geological carbon sequestration. Of note, trading will \nnot be allowed if it enables a power plant to pollute at a level that \ndamages public health or the environment.\n  I realize that the Administration's Clear Skies Initiative does not \naddress carbon dioxide as a pollutant nor does it address emissions \nreductions for CO2. While I recognize that the pollutants \nlisted under the Clear Air Act have been to achieve healthier air for \nhumans by cutting back on smog and soot, and also for mercury \ncontamination, I believe it is long past due that carbon dioxide be \nrecognized as a pollutant that is harming the health of the planet.\n  I am supporting the goal of CO2 emissions reduction in the \nJeffords' bill in the hopes that the bill will be a rallying point to \nfurther the debate for reducing CO2 and at the same time, \nget our air cleaner on a quicker timeframe. In particular, Congress \nneeds to develop a market mechanism approach for CO2 \nemissions trading--such as we now have for acid rain--to allow U.S. \nindustries the flexibility and certainty to reduce CO2 \nemissions without the threat of higher energy production costs in the \nfuture that will be passed on to the consumer. I will continue to work \nwith my colleagues, the White House and representatives from various \nindustry groups, and environmental organizations to achieve this goal.\n  The bottom line is that we have the opportunity to raise the bar for \ncleaner domestic energy production in an economically effective manner. \nSolutions exist in available and developing technologies, and most of \nall in the entrepreneurial spirit of the American people who want a \ncleaner and healthier environment, including those in Maine who want to \nensure that the State's pristine lakes and coast will remain clean and \nour forests healthy for generations to come. States like Maine are \nleading the way in trying to reduce CO2 emissions--and the \nJeffords' legislation sends a powerful message to those who would \npollute our air: your days are numbered.\n  I am optimistic that the Congress can come together with the \nPresident, industry and all those who want cleaner, healthier air to \ncreate a cohesive policy that is best suited for our nation, so I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Jeffords' legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 367. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto reauthorize and improve the temporary assistance to needy families \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to re-introduce a bill \nthat reauthorizes the landmark welfare reform legislation passed in \n1996. It is basically the same bill as I introduced in the last \nCongress and it is designed to allow States to continue the important \nwork to promote work and personal responsibility. This reauthorization \nbill is designed to allow States to continue to provide the flexible \ninitiatives that have reduced national welfare caseloads by over 50 \npercent and moved millions of Americans from welfare to work.\n  Welfare reform was a bold experiment to dramatically change a major \nsocial program. In 1996, Congress ended the entitlement of eligible \nfamilies with children to cash aid. The results five years later are \nimpressive. Over two-thirds of the people who are leaving the welfare \nrolls have left for work.\n  Seven years ago, we agreed that the bipartisan goal of welfare reform \nshould be to promote work and to protect children. We stood here \ntogether,\n\n[[Page S2354]]\n\non unchartered ground, and endorsed significant policy changes that we \nbelieved would help families gain independence and economic self-\nsufficiency, while protecting the children. States began to revise \nwelfare service delivery with guidance based on the new reforms. Each \nState designed and implemented programs that were unique and specific \nto their populations. While the results have been mixed, I believe that \nencouraging progress has been made. The challenge this year will be to \ncontinue to build on our foundation, and be sensitive to the current \neconomic situation and the fiscal crisis States face today.\n  When we started welfare reform, we had a strong economy. Now, States \nare struggling and most of their reserves are gone. I believe we can \ncontinue the progress of welfare reform, but I strongly believe we must \nprovide the key investments that help welfare parents make a successful \ntransition from welfare to work, including increasing child care \nfunding.\n  In West Virginia, welfare reform has brought bold changes. Parents on \nwelfare get extra support as they face new responsibilities and \nobligations to make the transition from welfare to jobs. In 2001, I \nhosted a roundtable discussion to meet with individual West Virginians \nwho were undergoing major life transitions. They told me that they were \nproud to be working, but that it was often still a struggle to make \nends meet and do the best for their children. The goal of this \nlegislation is to help those parents, and millions more, to promote the \nwell-being of their children, even as they work.\n  Today, I am introducing the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act Amendments of 2003. States need help to \ncontinue making progress. We should continue to build on this \nfoundation, and not reduce state flexibility. It is essential that we \ncontinue welfare reform, not unravel it, or restructure it.\n  This bill acknowledges that we must keep the focus on work, by both \nrequiring and rewarding work. To ensure a real focus on helping parents \nleave welfare rolls for a job, this legislation gradually replaces the \ncaseload reduction credit with an employment credit, designed by \nSenator Lincoln of Arkansas and Congressman Levin of Michigan. Under \nthis important provision, States will only get a bonus toward their \nwork participation requirement if parents move from welfare to a job. \nThis credit will acknowledge the dignity of all work by providing a \nbonus for parents who get jobs, both full and part-time. A mother who \nhas never worked in her life and then gets a part-time job has achieved \na true accomplishment, and that deserves recognition. It is also the \nfirst step toward independence. It is an empowering approach to \npromoting work and sends the proper message to families who are \nstriving to become self sufficient. I am pleased to incorporate their \nproposal into my bill, and I look forward to working with them closely \nthroughout the welfare debates during this Congress to develop an \nemployment credit that truly rewards work.\n  At this point, with a soft economy, I believe it is unwise to \nsignificantly change State TANF programs to impose drastically higher \nwork participation rates requiring 40 hours per week of work and \nactivities. Such changes, as suggested by the Administration, would \ndouble the work requirement for mothers with children under the age of \n6, and that does not seem right. Increasing work requirement without \nnew funding for child care, transportation, and job placement \nactivities would be, plain and simple, an unfunded mandate. It could \nhinder state efforts to move parents into private sector jobs. It could \nundermine our progress.\n  State officials have testified before the Finance Committee that such \nchanges would force states to restructure existing programs that are \nworking and turn their focus away from those who need some assistance \nwith child care or transportation, but are no longer dependent on a \nwelfare check. We should not cut back on necessary child care and work \nsupports for working families who are following the rules we set in \n1996.\n  This comprehensive welfare reform bill makes the right investments. \nIt invests $5.5 billion more in child care, which is the amount \nsupported by the Finance Committee in a bipartisan vote last June.\n  This bill also increases funding for the basic TANF block grant by \n$2.5 billion because of state need. It provides full funding for the \nSocial Services at $2.8 billion, which was promised to the states in \n1996. My bill also would expand and increase the supplemental grants to \nhelp the states with high growth and high poverty deal with the \nchallenges of welfare reform. With these new investments, states will \nbe able to increase investment in the fundamental work supports like \nchild care, transportation, and training, that help a parent succeed in \nmoving from welfare to work. States would have flexibility in \nallocating the new resources, but I believe much of the funding can and \nwill be directed into child care, which is a major priority.\n  This bill would continue the transitional Medicaid program so \nfamilies can keep health care coverage for a year as they move from \nwelfare to work. In 1996, I was proud to work with Senator Breaux and \nthe late Senator John Chafee to protect access to health care for such \nvulnerable families. I have incorporated Senator Breaux's bipartisan \nbill to continue transitional Medicaid coverage, and I appreciate his \nleadership on this and other key issues. Our bill also gives states \nmore flexibility and options to place parents in vocational training \nand English as a Second Language programs, so parents can get real \njobs. In recognition of Maine's success with the Parents as Scholar \nprogram, States have the option to follow the Maine model for 5 percent \nof their caseload to combine work and education.\n\n  The bill also invests $200 million to create BusinessLink Grants, \ncompetitive grants to support public and private partnerships to help \nparents get jobs. The Welfare-to-Work Partnership is just one example \nof how nonprofits working with business leaders can make a real \ndifference. The Partnership includes over 20,000 businesses that have \nprovided more than 1 million jobs to parents moving from welfare to \nwork. I have met with the board members of this group, and we should \nencourage such partnerships. I know that other groups, like the \nSalvation Army and Good Will, are doing important work on providing \ntransitional job opportunities, and these organizations would be \neligible for grants as well.\n  A job is the first step, but for welfare parents to make a successful \ntransition to independence, they need a range of supports. To achieve \nthis goal, the bill will create Pathways to Self-Sufficiency Grants to \nimprove the support network for parents. These grants are intended to \nprovide incentives and support to TANF caseworkers and nonprofit \norganizations to help improve the comprehensive network of supports for \nworking families, including Medicaid, CHIP, child care, EITC, and a \nrange of services. Working mothers deserve to know what type of support \nwill be available so that they do not slip back into welfare.\n  Work is fundamental, but we also need to be concerned about important \naspects of the lives of families and children. This legislation creates \na Family Formation Fund to encourage healthy families, reduce teenage \npregnancy, and improve child support and participation of parents in \nchildren's lives. The bill seeks to end certain discrimination and \nharsh rules for two-parent families in the current system. If our goal \nis to support marriage, we should not penalize married couples.\n  Our legislation also makes a simple, but important change. Under the \ncurrent TANF program, each welfare parent has an Individual \nResponsibility Plan that serves as an assessment and work plan. In \naddition to having a responsibility to work, parents have a \nresponsibility to protect their children's well-being. To emphasize \nthis fundamental point, this bill adds language directing states to \nincorporate the concept of a child's well-being into each parent's \nIndividual Responsibility Plan. States have great flexibility, but it \nis important to send a clear message that one of a parent's \nresponsibilities is the well-being of their children.\n  This legislation builds on the foundation of the 1996 Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. My hope is that \nthis framework will help promote bipartisan discussion about how we can \nmake even more improvements in our welfare system,\n\n[[Page S2355]]\n\nwhile maintaining our partnership with the States, particularly at this \ntime of severe fiscal problems in our States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Graham of South Carolina):\n  S. 368. A bill to amend title X of the Social Security Act to include \nadditional information in social security account statements; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, there is a greater awareness of the \nprecarious financial condition confronting our Nation's Social Security \nsystem. Unfortunately, partisanship has controlled the debate on \nreform, polarizing and paralyzing Congress, while the fate of Social \nSecurity has become more grim and the consequent need for reform has \nbecome more urgent.\n  It is now time for us to come together to reform and revitalize this \nsystem, so that Social Security will continue to benefit both the \nseniors of today and tomorrow. As elected officials, we have an \nobligation to ensure that Social Security benefits are paid as \npromised, without unfairly burdening the workers of today.\n  American workers deserve to know the true financial status of the \nSocial Security program. Each individual should have the right to \nhonest information, including the real value of their personal \nretirement benefits. Most Americans have little knowledge of the true \nfinancial status of Social Security because the current system does not \nprovide them with practical, easy to understand information.\n  Today, Senator Lindsey Graham and I are introducing a bill that will \nrequire the inclusion of that practical information in annual Social \nSecurity statements sent to all taxpaying Americans. These statements \nwill include straight forward information regarding the average rate of \nreturn workers can expect to receive from Social Security as compared \nto the amount of taxes an individual pays into the program, the amount \nSocial Security receives in payroll, how much revenue is needed to give \npromised benefits to seniors, and the date when the program will no \nlonger have sufficient funds to pay promised benefits. It is only fair \nand just to provide everyone with the true facts about how much they \nwill pay in payroll taxes and what the limited return will be on their \ncontributions.\n  We must talk straight to Americans about Social Security and begin \nworking together in a bipartisan fashion to make the necessary changes \nto strengthen and save the Nation's retirement program for the seniors \nof today and tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 368\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Endangered species Act of 1973 to improve \nthe processes for listing, recovery planning, and delisting, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Listing \nand Delisting Reform Act of 2003.'' The Endangered Species Act has \nbecome one of the best examples of good intentions gone astray. Today, \nI am taking one small step toward injecting some common sense into what \nhas become a regulatory nightmare. It is my intention to start making \nthe law more effective for local landowners, public land managers, \ncommunities and State governments who truly hold the key to any \nsuccessful effort to conserve species. My legislation seeks to improve \nthe listing, recovery planning and delisting processes so that \nrecovery, the goal of the act, is easier to achieve.\n  In Wyoming, we have seen first hand the need to revise the listing \nand delisting processes of the Endangered Species Act. Listing should \nbe a purely scientific decision. Listing should be based on credible \ndata that has been peer-reviewed. In 1998, the Preble's Meadow Jumping \nMouse was listed in the State of Wyoming. The listing process for this \nmouse demonstrates how the system has gone haywire, devoid of good \nscience. One of the more significant shortcomings regarding the \nhandling of the Preble Mouse has been the confusion between the ``known \nrange'' as opposed to the alleged ``historical range'' of the mouse. \nHistorical data and current knowledge do not support the high, short-\ngrass, semi-arid plains of southeastern Wyoming as part of the mouse's \nhistorical habitat range. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has even \nadmitted to uncertainties regarding taxonomic distinctions and ranges. \nfurther, the State was not properly notified causing counties, \ncommissioners, and landowners all to be caught off guard. Such poor \npractices do not foster the types of partnerships that are required if \nmeaningful species conservation is to occur. Clearly, changes to the \nEndangered Species Act are desperately needed.\n  Not far behind the mouse in Wyoming, was the black tailed prairie \ndog. Petitions to list the prairie dog were filed with the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service. I've lived in Wyoming most of my life, and I've \nlogged a lot of miles on the roads and highways in my State over the \nyears. I can tell you from experience that there is no shortage of \nprairie dogs in Wyoming. Any farmer or rancher will concur with that \nopinion. This petition, and countless other actions throughout the \ncountry, makes it painfully clear that some folks are intent on \ncompletely eliminating activity on public lands, no matter what the \ncost to individuals or local communities that rely on the land for \neconomic survival.\n  My legislation will require the Secretary of the Interior to use \nscientific\n\n[[Page S2356]]\n\nor commercial data that is empirical, field tested and peer-reviewed. \nRight now, it's basically a ``postage stamp'' petition: any person who \nwants to start a listing process may petition a species with little or \nno scientific support. This legislation prevents this absurd practice \nby establishing minimum requirements for a listing petition that \nincludes an analysis of the status of the species, its range, \npopulation trends and threats. The petition must also be peer reviewed. \nIn order to list a species, the Secretary must determine if sufficient \nbiological information exists in the petition to support a recovery \nplan. Under my proposal, States are made active participants in the \nprocess and the general public is provided a more substantial role.\n  This legislation requires explicit planning and forethought with \nregard to conservation and recovery at the time the species is listed. \nLet me be clear about the intent of this requirement. I do not question \nthe basic premise that some species require the protection of the \nEndangered Species Act. However, listing a species can cause hardship \non a community. For that reason, it is critically important and only \nreasonable that every listing be supported by sound science. We should \nbe sure of the need for a listing before we ask the members of our \ncommunities and private landowners to make sacrifices.\n  In Wyoming, I have found that with several listings, the Secretary of \nthe Interior was unable to tell me what measures were required to \nachieve species recovery. The Secretary could not tell me what acts or \nomissions we could expect to face as a consequence of listing. How can \nthis be, if the Secretary is fully apprized of the status of the \nspecies? Conversely, if the Secretary cannot clearly describe how to \nreverse threatening acts to a species so that we can achieve recovery, \nhow can we be sure that the species is, in fact, threatened?\n  This ambiguity has caused much undue frustration to the people of \nWyoming. If the Secretary believes that certain farming or ranching \npractices, or a private citizen's development of their own property is \nthe cause for a listing, then the Secretary should identify those \nactivities that have to be curtailed or changed. If the Secretary does \nnot have enough information to indicate what activities should be \nrestricted, then why list a species? Why open producers and others to \nthe burden of over-zealous enforcement and even litigation without \nbeing able to achieve the goal of recovering the species?\n  This legislation is ultimately designed to improve the quality of \ninformation used to support a listing. If the Secretary knows enough to \nlist a species, that person should know enough to tell us what will be \nrequired for recovery. That should be the case under current law, and \nthat is all that this provision would require.\n  Additionally, we need to revise the end of the process, the de-\nlisting procedure. Recovery should be the goal of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Yet, it is virtually impossible to de-list a species. \nThere is no certainty in the process, and the State who has all the \nresponsibility for managing the species once it is off the list are not \ntrue partners in that process. Once the recovery plan is met, the \nspecies should be de-listed.\n  Wyoming's experience with the Grizzly bear pinpoints some of the \nproblems with the current de-listing process. The Interagency Grizzly \nBear Committee set criteria for recovery and in the Yellowstone \necosystem, those targets have been met, but the bear has still not been \nremoved from the list. We've been battling the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService for years over this issue to no avail. Despite rebounded \npopulations, we keep funneling money down a black hole.\n  The point is something needs to be done. People in Wyoming have grown \nweary of the Endangered Species Act and the efforts of a vocal minority \nto run roughshod over their lives and interests. It is imperative to \nthe longevity of many species and our citizens in the West that we \nbring this Act to the snubbing post and gain control of the process. \nThe changes I've suggested will have a significant affect on the \nquality of science, public participation, state involvement, speed in \nrecovery and finally the delisting of a species. Species that truly \nneed protection will be protected, but let's not lose sight of the real \ngoal--recovery and delisting.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Reed).\n  S. 371. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure an \nadequate supply of vaccines; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from \nNew York, Senator Clinton, to introduce the Childhood Vaccine Supply \nAct--a bill that would help ensure that our nation's public health \nsystem has an adequate vaccine supply.\n  Vaccinations are critical in our efforts to keep our population, \nparticularly children and the elderly, healthy. They are key in \nprotecting the elderly from influenza during flu season or protecting \nchildren from contracting polio or the mumps. They--vaccinations, \ninoculations, immunizations, whatever you want to call them--also help \nlessen the threat of bacterial or viral infections and potential \ndisease outbreaks.\n  Currently, it is recommended that children receive 12 routine \nvaccinations against preventable diseases. These vaccinations are given \nin a series of shots and booster shots by the age of two, with an \nadditional four doses later in life. This ends up being about 16 to 20 \ndoses of vaccines for children. Yet, just last year, over half of the \nvaccines children need were in short supply.\n  That shortage of vaccines was not acceptable, and we should do all we \ncan to prevent any future shortage and do all we can to protect our \nkids from illness and disease. As a Senator, and more importantly, as a \nfather of eight and grandfather of eight, nothing is more important to \nparents than the health and safety of our children.\n  While we are not currently experiencing a shortage, we know that the \nvaccine market is unstable and unpredictable. According to the Centers \nfor Disease Control's National Immunization Program, there were several \nreasons for the shortages last year. The CDC concluded and posted on \nits website that the ``reasons for these shortages were multi-factorial \nand included companies leaving the vaccine market, manufacturing or \nproduction problems, and insufficient stockpiles.'' The CDC did as good \na job as it possibly could, especially considering the vaccine \nshortages our nation faced last year. The agency's website posted \ninformation about shortages and released revised vaccine schedules to \nkeep our public informed and knowledgeable about vaccination shortages.\n  But, even with the strong efforts of the CDC, we can work toward \npreventing a future vaccine shortage. We can work toward a more \npermanent solution. The bill I am introducing with my colleague from \nNew York will go a long way to do just that.\n  The bill we are introducing today--the Childhood Vaccine Supply Act--\nwould help bring some stability to our fragile vaccine supply. Unlike \ndrug manufacturers, vaccine manufacturers do not have to give notice \nwhen they stop making a vaccine--whether the vaccine is withdrawn from \nthe market intentionally or because the manufacturer is simply unable \nto continue making the vaccine. Essentially, these manufacturers leave \nthe marketplace with no notice and no warning. Most doctors and \nhospitals--and more importantly parents and older adults--often have no \nidea that a vaccine is in short supply until they line up for a flu \nshot or go to the doctor for their child's immunizations.\n  Our bill would change this. It would require any manufacturer of a \nvaccine to give notice of discontinuance. By giving notice, the Centers \nfor Disease Control, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, \nwould be better able to ensure an adequate vaccine supply for our \nNation's population. Additionally, our bill would require all drug and \nvaccine manufacturers to give notice when they withdraw from the \nmarket. This change would ensure that we have a better sense of who is \nmaking vaccines and drugs and would allow the CDC and FDA to monitor \nthe manufacturer's production and release of vaccines. Let me explain \nwhy this is important.\n  Vaccines, or biological products, are difficult to develop and \nmanufacture. They are more complex than drugs. Because of this, it \ntakes longer for a biological product to reach the market.\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\nFor example, a pharmaceutical company that manufactured tetanus vaccine \nstopped producing it, leaving only one company to produce tetanus \nvaccine for the entire country. The remaining company increased \nproduction to accommodate all of the needs of the United States. \nDespite this, it still required about 11 months for the vaccine to be \nready for release. In other words, it took 11 months for the company to \nramp-up production to meet demand. Our bill would create a notification \nmechanism to capture those drugs and vaccines leaving the market so we \ncan avoid future vaccine and drug shortages.\n  Our bill would take another important step toward ensuring an \nadequate vaccine supply. It would confirm the authority of the CDC to \ndevelop a plan for the purchase, storage, and rotation of a supply of \nvaccines sufficient to provide routinely recommended vaccinations for a \nsix-month period for children and adults. Essentially, our bill would \ncreate a framework for the CDC to develop a national vaccine stockpile \nto ensure that childhood vaccine shortages simply do not occur.\n  Our children deserve timely vaccinations. When childhood vaccinations \nare in short supply or are unavailable, they do without, living \nunprotected against disease. That should never happen. Our bill is a \nstep toward ensuring children get the vaccines they need and that they \nget them at the right time.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important \nissue to which I have pledged my constant dedication throughout my \ncareer--ensuring that children have access to affordable and safe \nvaccines. These vaccines are one of the most successful and cost-\neffective tools we have to prevent disease and death.\n  Yet only a year ago, however, doctors had to turn families away at \nthe door because of national vaccine shortages for eight out of the \neleven vaccine-preventable diseases. During the vaccine shortage, \nchildren became ill with pneumococcal meningitis and pneumonia, \ndiseases that could have been prevented with an adequate supply of the \npneumococcal vaccine.\n  Since the HELP Committee met to discuss the vaccine shortage crisis, \nwe have witnessed some significant progress, which is a credit to a \ncollaborative effort by public health officials, vaccine manufacturers \nand providers. Shortages for five vaccines have stopped, and childhood \nvaccines for eight different diseases are no longer being delayed. \nThese shortages, temporarily alleviated, could return at any time. I \nknow that my home state of New York, like the rest of the Nation, only \nhas a one-to-two month stockpile for some of the routinely recommended \nchildhood vaccines.\n  At the most recent HELP Committee hearing no vaccines, we listened to \na GAO report that acknowledged two critical components to protecting \nour children's health security, and today I rise to present legislation \nthat would take these two important steps.\n  Having the government stockpile vaccines is important because vaccine \nproduction is a complex process. The GAO report confirmed that a pause \nin production for safety reasons could happen again and would have a \ncritical and devastating impact on the ability to vaccinate children \nand adults. I appreciate the administration's announced commitment to \nprovide funds in the 2004 Budget for a vaccine stockpile. The Childhood \nVaccine Supply Act would strengthen and support the administration's \nauthority in these efforts and assure that the stockpile includes \nadults as well as all children, who were affected by the tetanus-\ndiphtheria toxoid shortage last year.\n  * * *\n  We also need an additional buffer because DCD acknowledges that it \nwill take 4 years before we can have a 6-month stockpile of childhood \nvaccines. We need a notification mechanism so that CDC can work with \nother manufacturers to maintain the vaccine supply when a manufacturer \ncannot produce an adequate supply of vaccine. Each of the four major \nvaccine producers has stated that they do not object to this sort of an \nadvance notice provision. The Childhood Vaccine Supply Act would create \na notification mechanism for manufacturers to give one-year advance \nnotice when they intend to stop making a vaccine.\n  We have worked amicably with Senators Frist, Gregg, and Kennedy on \nboth of these vaccine provisions. We have work amicably with Senator\n\n[[Page S2358]]\n\nFrist on this issue and our vaccine provisions, and fully expect to \ncontinue working with this bipartisan group of Senators to accomplish \nthe important goal of assuring safe vaccines for all children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 372. A bill to amend the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \nto require that Federal agencies consult with State agencies and county \nand local governments on environmental impact statements; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``State and \nLocal Government Participation Act of 2003'' which would amend the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, NEPA. This bill is designed to \nguarantee that Federal agencies identify State, county and local \ngovernments as cooperating agencies when fulfilling their environmental \nplanning responsibilities under NEPA.\n  NEPA was designed to ensure that the environmental impacts of a \nproposed Federal action are considered and minimized by the federal \nagency taking that action. It was supposed to provide for adequate \npublic participation in the decision making process on these Federal \nactivities and document an agency's final conclusions with respect to \nthe proposed action.\n  Although this sounds simple and quite reasonable, NEPA has become a \nreal problem in Wyoming and many States throughout the Nation. A \nstatute that was supposed to provide for additional public input in the \nfederal land management process has instead become an unworkable and \ncumbersome law. Instead of clarifying and expediting the public \nplanning process on Federal lands. NEPA now serves to delay action and \nshut-out local governments that depend on the proper use of these \nFederal lands for their existence.\n  The ``State and Local Government Participation Act'' is designed to \nprovide for greater input from State and local governments in the NEPA \nprocess. This measure would simply guarantee that State, county and \nlocal agencies be identified as cooperating entities when preparing \nland management plans under NEPA. Although the law already provides for \nvoluntary inclusion of state and local entities in the planning \nprocess, too often, the federal agencies choose to ignore local \ngovernments when preparing planning documents under NEPA. \nUnfortunately, many Federal agencies have become so engrossed in \nexamining every environmental aspect of a proposed action on Federal \nland, they have forgotten to consult with the folks who actually live \nnear and depend on these areas for their economic survival.\n  States and local communities must be consulted and included when \nproposed actions are being taken on Federal lands in their State. Too \noften, Federal land managers are more concerned about the comments of \nenvironmental organizations located in Washington, DC or New York City \nthan the people who actually live in the State where the proposed \naction will take place. This is wrong. The concerns, comments and input \nof state and local communities are vital for the proper management of \nfederal lands in the West. The ``State and Local Government \nParticipation Act of 2003'' will begin to address this troubling \nproblem and guarantee that local folks will be involved in proposed \ndecision that will affect their lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 372\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State and Local Government \n     Participation Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONSULTATION WITH STATE AGENCIES AND COUNTY AND LOCAL \n                   GOVERNMENTS ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENTS.\n\n       Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act \n     of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is amended in the first \n     sentence of the matter following clause (v) by striking ``any \n     Federal agency which has'' and inserting ``each Federal \n     agency, State agency, county government, and local government \n     that has''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Clinton, \n        Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 373. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for patient protection by limiting the number of mandatory \novertime hours a nurse may be required to work in certain providers of \nservices to which payments are made under the medicare program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues, \nSenators Kerry, Clinton, Sarbanes, Corzine, Mikulski, Dodd, Levin, \nReed, Lieberman, Feingold, Inouye, and Akaka in introducing the Safe \nNursing and Patient Care Act.\n  Current Federal safety standards limit work hours for pilots, flight \nattendants, truck drivers, railroad engineers and other professionals, \nin order to protect the public safety. However, no similar limitation \ncurrently exists for the Nation's nurses, who care for so many of our \nmost vulnerable citizens.\n  The Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act will limit mandatory overtime \nfor nurses in order to protect patient safety and improve working \nconditions for nurses. Across the country today, the widespread \npractice of mandatory overtime means that over-worked nurses are often \nproviding care in unacceptable circumstances. Restrictions for \nmandatory overtime will help ensure that nurses are able to provide the \nhighest quality of care to their patients.\n  Some hospitals have taken action to deal with this serious problem. \nOver the last few years in Massachusetts Brockton Hospital and St. \nVincent Hospital agreed to limit mandatory overtime as part of \nnegotiations following successful strikes by nurses. These limits will \nprotect patients and improve working conditions for the nurses, and \nwill help in the recruitment and retention of nurses in the future.\n  Job dissatisfaction and harsh overtime hours are major factors in the \ncurrent shortage of nurses. Nationally, the shortfall is expected to \nrise to 20 percent in coming years. The goal of the Safe Nursing and \nPatient Care Act is to improve the quality of life for nurses, so that \nmore persons will enter the nursing profession and remain in it.\n  The bill limits mandatory overtime to declared states of emergency. \nClearly, there are times when other options are exhausted and hospitals \nneed additional help. The bill takes account of such needs. The bill \nrequires health providers to notify nurses of these new rights, and \nnurses who report violations are guaranteed protection from workplace \ndiscrimination. In addition, the bill requires the Agency for Health \nCare Research and Quality to report to Congress on appropriate \nstandards for the maximum numbers of hours that nurses should work in \nvarious health settings without compromising patient care.\n  Improving conditions for nurses is an essential part of our ongoing \neffort to reduce medical errors, improve patient outcomes, and \nencourage more Americans to become and remain nurses. The power of \nproviders to force nurses to work beyond what is safe for themselves \nand their patients is one of the major drawbacks to careers in nursing. \nThe Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act is a significant step that \nCongress can take to support the Nation's nurses, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Inofe, Mr. \n        Allen, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 374. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe occupational taxes relating to distilled spirits, wine, and beer; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my \ngood friend and colleague, Senator Bunning today in introducing \nlegislation that will repeal the Special Occupational Tax, (SOT), on \ntaxpayers who manufacture, distribute, and sell alcoholic beverages. \nThe special occupational tax is\n\n[[Page S2359]]\n\nnot a tax on alcoholic products, but rather operates as a license fee \non businesses. The tax is imposed on those engaged in the business of \nselling alcohol beverages. Believe it or not, this tax was originally \nestablished to help finance the Civil War. That war is over, and this \ninequitable tax has outlived its original purpose. Clearly an example \nof an anticipated approach to Federal taxation, repealing the SOT has \nan element of simplification in it.\n  The SOT on alcohol dramatically increased during the budget process \nin 1988 and has unfairly burdened business owners across the country \nsince. From Thompson Falls to Sidney, from Chinook to Billings, small \nbusinesses are burdened with yet another tax in the form of the SOT. \nAccording to the ATF, there are 480,427 locations nationwide that pay \nSOT's every year, including 485,603 retailers. These retail \nestablishments account for $114 million out of $126 million in SOT \nrevenues.\n  In Montana, there are 3,378 locations, including 3,254 restaurants \nand 494 convenience stores, which pay nearly $2 million dollars in the \nSOT every year. Seasonal resorts in Whitefish and Yellowstone, ``mom \nand pop'' convenience stores in Butte, and allowing alleys, flower \nshops, and restaurants across Montana, and the United States, pay the \nFederal Government almost $100 million per year for the privilege of \nrunning businesses that sell beer, wine, or alcoholic beverages.\n  The SOT is extremely regressive. Retailers must annually pay $250 per \nlocation; wholesalers pay $500; vintners and distillers pay $1000. \nBecause the SOT is levied on a per location basis, a sole \nproprietorship must pay the same amount as one of the Nation's largest \nretailers, and locally-owned chains having to pay per location, would \nhave to pay as much as, if not more than, the Nation's largest single \nsite brewery. In testimony before the Finance Committee last spring, a \nsmall business owner from Helena, MT who runs four convenience stores \nand three restaurants said it best. ``Whether it's a seasonal \nrestaurant, an Elks Lodge or American Legion, a bowling center, \ncampground, a florist who delivers gift baskets containing wine, or a \nconvenience store operator, no one is spared from the tax.'' This is \nnot what Congress had in mind 150 years ago, and I don't believe it's a \nsituation we want today.\n  Repealing the SOT on alcohol is supported by a broad-based group of \nbusiness organizations and enjoys wide-spread bipartisan support on \nCapital Hill. Similar legislation is being introduced in the House \ntoday, and a bill, identical to this one, was introduced in the \nprevious Congress, but for one reason or another, the law was not \nenacted.\n  The legislation preserves ATF's record-keeping requirements, while \nremoving the agency's enforcement burden, and will save up to $2 \nmillion per year. The GAO examined SOT efficacy several times, and \nfound it fundamentally flawed. The Joint Committee on Taxation called \nfor the elimination of SOT in its June 2001 simplification study.\n  More than 90 percent of all SOT revenue comes from retailers--a great \nmajority of that number are small businesses. Recently, President Bush \nmet with a group of small business owners and employees in St. Louis. \nHe said, ``The best way to encourage job growth is to let [small \nbusinesses] keep more of their own money, so they can invest in their \nbusiness and make it easier for somebody to find work.'' Repealing the \nSOT would provide an immediate and visible tax cut to small business \nowners.\n  Now, as the Federal Government considers ways to provide additional \neconomic stimulus to the people who need it most, the time is right for \nus to move forward and enact this legislation to repeal the SOT an \nalcohol. We urge our colleagues to join us in this endeavor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleague, Senator \nBaucus, in the introduction of legislation to repeal the Special \nOccupational Tax on the sale of alcoholic beverages.\n  This is an unfair tax imposed on all businesses that manufacture, \ndistribute or sell alcohol products. It has a particularly egregious \nimpact on the Nation's small businesses--the ``Mom and Pop'' \nconvenience stores, the local bowling alleys, the small sandwich shop, \nthe seasonal bait shop, and the community lodges. This regressive tax \nimposes the same tax on little businesses and large businesses. The tax \nis levied as a fixed amount per location--$250 for retailers, $500 for \nwholesalers, and $1,000 for vinters and distillers--with no adjustment \nfor the size of a business. Thus, a family which owns two small \nconvenience stores will pay twice as much as a large one-location \n``super'' party store. This tax results in small retail outlets paying \na larger percentage of their revenue towards this tax. In addition, the \ntax is not prorated, meaning that seasonal businesses such as bait \nshops or marinas that are open for three months a year will pay the \nsame rate as businesses that are open year-around.\n  Largely due to the negative impact of this tax on small businesses, \nthere has been strong bi-partisan support for its repeal in both the \nSenate and the House. The effectiveness of the tax--which is \ntraditionally quite expensive to administer--has been found to be \nflawed by the General Accounting Office in several examinations. In a \n2001 study on the simplification of the Federal tax system, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation recommended the repeal of the Special Occupancy \nTax on alcohol. The Joint Committee found that the tax is in the nature \nof a business license fee and serves no tax policy purpose.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Baucus and me in repealing \nthis burdensome tax once and for all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Rockefeller, and \n        Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 275. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a minimum geographic cost-of-practice index value for \nphysicians' services furnished under the medicare program of 1; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my friends Senator \nLincoln, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Thomas to introduce the \n``Medicare Access Equity Act of 2003,'' a bill to address the \ninequality that exists in Medicare reimbursement levels to urban and \nrural physicians.\n  Nothing is more important to our families than accessible and \navailable health care. When we become ill and need treatment, we must \nturn to our doctors for help. But, imagine this, a hospital filled with \nthe latest technology, and no doctors to administer treatment.\n  Does this sound ridiculous? It's not. Rural patients often have \ndifficulty obtaining timely care due to a shortage of physicians, and, \nthe problem I have described is not just occurring in my home State of \nNew Mexico, forty-one other States are experiencing similar problems \nbecause of a common set of rules and procedures.\n  In most rural areas, Federal policy undermines a doctor's ability to \nsee Medicare patients by establishing disparity in reimbursement \nlevels. Rural physicians are among the lowest Medicare dollar \nreimbursement recipients in the country, and I submit that this is the \nreason these areas cannot effectively recruit and retain their \nphysicians.\n  Medicare payments for physician services are based upon a fee \nschedule, intended to relate payments for a given service to the actual \nresources used in providing that service. One component of this fee \nschedule is ``physician work.'' CMS defines ``physician work'' as the \namount of time, skill and intensity necessary to provide service.\n  Each component of the fee schedule is multiplied by a geographic \nindex; designed to adjust for variations in cost. The geographic index \nas it relates to ``physician work'' is lower in rural areas than in \nmetropolitan/urban areas. Thus, although rural physicians put in as \nmuch or even more time, skill, and intensity into their work as \nphysicians in metropolitan/urban areas; rural physicians are paid less \nfor their work.\n  This practice is unfair and it is discriminatory. There is no reason \ndoctors in Albuquerque, NM should be paid less for their time than \ndoctors in New\n\n[[Page S2361]]\n\nYork City. Doctors should be valued equally, irrespective of geography.\n  The ``Medicare Access Equity Act of 2003'' fixes this problem. The \nBill creates a more equitable Medicare reimbursement formula for \ndoctors in 56 different fee schedule areas in 42 different States. It \ncontinues to apply the current formula to determine geographic index as \nit relates to physician work. However, once the calculation has been \ncompleted, The Secretary will increase the work geographic index to one \nfor any locality for which such index is below one. Those fee schedule \nareas that are currently at or above one will not be affected by this \nlegislation.\n  Our Bill builds upon the simple proposition that increased Medicare \nPhysician reimbursements improve patient access to care and the ability \nof states to recruit and retain physicians. If Medicare physician \nreimbursement rates are raised, patients will be the ultimate \nbeneficiaries.\n  Thank you and I look forward to working with my colleagues Senator \nLincoln, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Thomas on this very important \nissue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 375\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare \n     Access Equity Act of 2003''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Americans have paid taxes in to the medicare program \n     equally across the country and every American should have \n     access to quality health care.\n       (2) There is a national market for health care providers.\n       (3) Increasingly, private insurance companies tie their \n     reimbursement rates to those paid by medicare.\n       (4) The physician fee schedule formula for medicare \n     currently includes several adjustments for variable costs \n     throughout the nation. While it is appropriate for the cost \n     of running a practice to reflect overhead differences, \n     physicians should not be compensated for their time \n     differently based on where they live.\n       (5) Medicare beneficiaries pay the same part B premium \n     regardless of location which forces subsidization of higher \n     reimbursement areas by seniors in lower reimbursement areas \n     without any corresponding benefit.\n       (6) Areas of the country that currently receive the lowest \n     reimbursement from medicare are often the same areas that are \n     experiencing the greatest shortage of physicians. Attracting \n     more physicians to these areas cannot be achieved without \n     greater equity in medicare reimbursement.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOOR ON WORK GEOGRAPHIC ADJUSTMENT.\n\n       Section 1848(e)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395w-4(e)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(E) Floor at 1.0 on work geographic indices.--After \n     calculating the work geographic indices in subparagraph \n     (A)(iii), for purposes of payment for services furnished on \n     or after January 1, 2004, the Secretary shall increase the \n     work geographic index to 1.00 for any locality for which such \n     geographic index is less than 1.00.''.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Pete Domenici today in introducing the ``Medicare Access Equity \nAct of 2003.''\n  This important legislation will significantly help rural physicians \nin Arkansas and across the country keep their doors open to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. By correcting a disparity in the Medicare physician fee \nschedule, Medicare will pay rural physicians more fairly for their \nindividual effort in treating Medicare patients.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, 60 percent of seniors live in rural \nareas. Consequently, Medicare patients make up a large percentage of a \nrural physician's practice.\n  It is simply unfair that current Federal policy doesn't value \nphysician work in all areas, urban and rural, in the same way. Because \nthe component of the fee schedule that relates to physician work is \nmultiplied by a geographic indicator adjusting for variants in cost, \nMedicare payment policy devalues the amount of time and skill that \nrural physicians spend in providing medical services.\n  I believe that work is work, regardless of where it is performed. It \ntakes the same amount of time and skill for a physician in Pea Ridge, \nAR to treat a wound or diagnose a patient as a physician in Los \nAngeles, CA. It is time to correct this inequity.\n  The Medicare Access Equity Act does this by revising the geographic \npractice cost indices GPCI, to establish a minimum index of 1 for the \n``physician work'' component. The bill applies the current formula to \ndetermine physician work GPCIs, but if a GPCI is calculated to be less \nthan 1, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will increase it to \n1.\n  This is critical to my home State of Arkansas, where the physician \nwork GPCI is currently 0.953, the sixth lowest GPCI in the country. \nIncreasing Arkansas' work GPCI to 1 will automatically pump more money \nto rural physicians in Arkansas, where many may begin to close their \ndoors due to the rising costs of providing health care.\n  It is my hope that Senator Domenici and I, with help from the Senate \nRural Health Caucus, can pass this important legislation as part of any \nMedicare reform we consider this year. Fair reimbursement is key to \nensuring that rural Americans retain the quality health care they \nreceive from their doctors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 377. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the contributions of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nto the United States; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \npay tribute to one of our Nation's most prominent individuals, Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemorative Coin \nAct of 2003 instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins to \nrecognize Dr. King's contribution to the people of the United States. \nRevenues from the surcharge on the coin would go to the Library of \nCongress to purchase and maintain historical documents and other \nmaterials associated with the life and legacy of Martin Luther King, \nJr. This honor is long overdue.\n  His contributions to our Nation are well known and well documented. \nFrom 1955 when he helped lead the Montgomery Boycott to his death at \nthe hands of an assassin in 1968, Dr. King dedicated his life to the \ncause of civil rights. In those 13 years, he was jailed several times, \ngot cursed at and stoned by mobs, reviled by racist attacks in the \nSouth. Civil rights marches for freedoms we take for granted today like \nthe right to vote or drink from the same water fountain, were met with \npolice dogs and fire hoses.\n  Honoring Dr. King also means honoring those local leaders in the \ncivil rights struggle who kept Dr. King's vision alive at the \ngrassroots. In my particular home State of Louisiana, Rev. Dr. T.J. \nJemison led a successful bus boycott in our State capital Baton Rouge. \nHe became an advisor to Dr. King during the Montgomery Bus boycott. \nMany of these local leaders faced constant danger at home. One \nLouisianan, Dr. C.O. Simpkins of Shreveport had his home bombed simply \nbecause he dared to stand by Dr. King and demand that the buses in \nShreveport be integrated.\n  But Dr. King urged us to fight hate with love, quell violence with \npeace, and to replace ignorance with understanding. He believed in a \nhigher calling for America. In his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech at \nthe Lincoln Memorial in 1963, he called on America to live up to its \ncreed, that all men were created equal. America heeded his call by \npassing landmark civil rights legislation in 1958 and 1964. For his \nwork, he received the Novel Peace Prize in 1964. At 35 years old, Dr. \nKing was the youngest recipient of the Peace Prize.\n  Today, our Nation is a better place than it was just 40 years ago. It \nis truly remarkable how much this nation has changed in the lifetimes \nof virtually everyone currently serving in the Senate. Our nation has \nmade great strides forward, but race relations in our country are not \nperfect. But we are working to get there.\n  A nineteenth century rabbi named Zadok Rabinwitz said that ``A man's\n\n[[Page S2362]]\n\ndreams are an index to his greatness.'' Dr. King had a dream. His dream \nis becoming our nation's reality. By any measure his dreams were great \nand they made a great Nation even greater. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemorative Coin Act of 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Baucus, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 378. A bill to recruit and retain more qualified individuals to \nteach in Tribal Colleges or Universities; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, our tribal colleges and universities have \ncome to play a critically important role in educating Native Americans \nacross the country. For more than 30 years, these institutions have \nproven instrumental in providing a quality education for those who had \npreviously been failed by our mainstream educational system. Before the \ntribal college movement began, only six or seven out of 100 Native \nAmerican students attended college. Of those few, only one or two would \ngraduate with a degree. Since these institutions have curricula that is \nculturally relevant and is often focused on a tribe's particular \nphilosophy, culture, language and economic needs, they have a high \nsuccess rate in educating Native American people.\n  I had the honor today of meeting with students, faculty and \npresidents from South Dakota's tribal colleges to talk about the \neducational needs of Native Americans and the role tribal colleges play \nin strengthening tribal communities. It, like so many of the meetings I \nhave had with representatives of tribal colleges, was a fascinating \nconversation. I am consistently impressed by the enduring spirit, sense \nof community and hope for a better quality of life that these \ninstitutions support. After meeting these students and educators, I \nhave no doubt that the future of Indian Country is in good hands.\n  The results of a tribal college education are impressive. Recent \nstudies show that 91 percent of 1998 tribal college and university \ngraduates are working or pursuing additional education one year after \ngraduating. In addition, the unemployment rate of recently polled \ntribal college graduates was 15 percent, compared to 55 percent on many \nreservations overall.\n  While tribal colleges and universities have been highly successful in \nhelping Native Americans obtain a higher education, many challenges \nremain to ensure the future success of these institutions. These \nschools rely heavily on Federal resources to provide educational \nopportunities for all students. As a result, I strongly support efforts \nto provide additional funding to these colleges through the Interior, \nAgriculture and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations bills.\n  In addition to resource constraints, administrators have expressed a \nparticular frustration over the difficulty they experience in \nattracting qualified individuals to teach at tribal colleges. \nGeographic isolation and low faculty salaries have made recruitment and \nretention particularly difficult for many of these schools. This \nproblem is increasing as enrollment rises.\n  That is why I am introducing the Tribal College and University \nTeacher Loan Forgiveness Act. This legislation will provide loan \nforgiveness to individuals who commit to teach for up to five years in \none of the 34 tribal colleges nationwide. Individuals who have Perkins, \nDirect, or Guaranteed loans may qualify to receive up to $15,000 in \nloan forgiveness. This program will provide these schools extra help in \nattracting qualified teachers, and thus help ensure that deserving \nstudents receive a high quality education.\n  This measure will benefit individual students and their communities. \nBy providing greater opportunities for Native American students to \ndevelop skills and expertise, this bill will spur economic growth and \nhelp bring prosperity and self-sufficiency to communities that \ndesperately need it. Native Americans and the tribal college system \ndeserve nothing less. I believe our responsibility was probably best \nsummed up by one of my state's greatest leaders, Sitting Bull.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the medicare incentive payment program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n[[Page S2363]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwith Senators Thomas, Lincoln, and Johnson entitled ``The Medicare \nIncentive Payment Program Improvement Act of 2003'' is designed to \nimprove the flow of needed bonus payments to physicians serving \nMedicare patients in Health Professions Shortage Areas, HPSA.\n  The Medicare Incentive Payment Program, MIPP, created by the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1987, was meant to assist physicians in \ndefraying the higher costs and burdens of serving Medicare patients in \nshortage areas. Rural areas are know to suffer from physician \nshortages, both primary care and specialty physicians. In fact, even \nthough 20 percent of America lives in a rural area, less than 11 \npercent of physicians in the U.S., practice in rural areas.\n  In my own State, the ongoing loss of physicians from underserved \nareas has affected both primary care and in particular, specialty \nservices. In many areas, the shortage of specialists exceeds that of \nthe primary care physicians. The New Mexico Health Policy Commission \nreported in its year 2000 report that 22 percent of residents in Los \nAlamos and Santa Fe were unable to receive needed specialist care.\n  While the national ratio of physicians per population is 198 doctors \nper 100,000 persons, New Mexico ranks 33rd in the country with only 170 \nphysicians per 100,000 population. We are not in a position to ``grow \nour own doctors'' either as New Mexico ranks 37th among the 46 States \nwith medical schools in graduating physicians per capita.\n  New Mexico, like many other States with large numbers health \nprofession shortage areas, or HPSAs, must rely on its ability to \nrecruit and retain physicians in underserved areas to meet the health \ncare needs of its citizens. It was the original intent of the MIPP to \ndo this, by allowing for physicians in underserved areas to receive an \nadditional 10 percent add-on in payments for services rendered. These \n10 percent ``bonuses'' are meant to be an essential component in our \nongoing effort to ensure Medicare beneficiaries access to medical \nservices, particularly in underserved areas.\n  Unfortunately, the Medicare Incentive Payment Program has fared \npoorly, with few providers choosing to receive the payments. In fact, \nthe total annual physician payments have never exceeded $100 million, \nbecause of a series of disincentives in the legislation.\n  The program requires a provider to do a number of things to obtain \nthe bonus payments. First, providers must be aware that MIPP payments \nare available to them. Many providers are unaware of the program's \nexistence. Next, physicians must find out if the patient's medical care \noccurred in a shortage area. Following this, a unique code must be \nattached to the Medicare claim, which is then forwarded to the carrier. \nFinally, after all these steps, providers are subjected to automatic \nMedicare audits, just for applying for the very payments for which they \nare eligible.\n  Providers committed to serving Medicare patients in underserved areas \ndeserve the support assured by the original legislation's intent.\n  The Medicare Incentive Payment Improvement Act of 2003 addresses and \nimproves shortcomings in the original legislation by: Placing the \nburden for determining the bonus eligibility on the Medicare carrier. \nEliminating automatic provider audits. Directing the Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services to establish a Medicare Incentive \nPayment Program Educational Program for Providers. Establishing an \nongoing analysis of the programs, ability to improve Medicare \nbeneficiaries' access to physician services. Continue to provide the \noriginal 10 percent add-on bonus for Part B physician payments in \nHealth Provider Shortage Areas.\n  Medicare carriers are the logical arbiters to determine whether \nphysician services occurred in a shortage area. Physicians, already \noverworked, lack sufficient time, resources and training to research \nand determine whether a service was provided in a HPSA. By placing the \nresponsibility on carriers, with their sophisticated information \nsystems, the physician's administrative burdens will be reduced.\n  The automatic audits triggered by this program, which are costly, \ntime intensive, and unwarranted, will be lifted under our legislation. \nBy placing the responsibility on carriers to determine payment \neligibility the need for provider audits is eliminated.\n  While the MIPP program is intended to improve beneficiaries' access \nto physician services, there is no measure of the program's effect on \nphysician availability. The legislation offered today directs CMS to \nperform an ongoing analysis as to whether these payments actually do \nimprove beneficiaries' access to physician services.\n  I believe these improvements, in addition to others listed above, \nwill greatly improve patient's access to care.\n  The following organizations have expressed support for this \nlegislation: American College of Physicians/American Society of \nInternal Medicine, and the National Rural Health Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  S. 3\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, to \nreform the funding of benefits under the Civil Service Retirement \nSystem for employees of the United States Postal Service, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, I rise to offer to the Senate some \ngood news for our mailers and, indeed, anyone who uses the United \nStates Postal Service. The USPS, which has been losing significant \namounts of money in recent years despite repeated increases in postage \nrates, has determined that its finances are in better order than \npreviously thought. If Congress acts expeditiously on legislation that \nI am introducing today along with my colleague, Senator Carper, the \nPostal Service will avoid an imminent rate hike.\n  In recent years, the United States Postal Service has been raising \npostal rates at a rapid pace. When the USPS last raised rates in 2002, \nit was the third such rate increase during an 18-month period. Such \nsteep, irregular rate increases make it very difficult for businesses \nto plan for their postal costs. This is a particular problem for\n\n[[Page S2364]]\n\ncatalog companies and magazine publishers, which set their prices in \nadvance based on assumptions about postal rates. Mailing costs for some \nsmaller catalog businesses, I am told, now can exceed production costs.\n  In so many ways, postage rate increases have a significant economic \nimpact. As rates increase, so do the costs Americans bear to send \nletters, mail packages, and pay their bills. Rate increases also raise \nthe cost of goods, which, of course, reflect not only the cost to ship \nbut also the cost to advertise by mail.\n  But rate increases reflect the price of maintaining an ever-expanding \npostal network and the infrastructure to sustain it. Each year, the \nPostal Service adds 1.7 million new addresses. This equates to 4,800 \nnew letter carriers making deliveries to over 513 million new delivery \nstops each year, all while maintaining one of the lowest first-class \nletter rates in the world.\n  In addition to providing a critical service to individual postal \npatrons, the Postal Service is a powerful economic engine. The USPS is \nthe eleventh largest enterprise in the Nation with $66 billion in \nannual revenue, more than Microsoft, McDonald's and Coca Cola combined. \nWhile the Postal Service itself employs more than 700,000 career \nemployees, it is also the linchpin of a $900 billion mailing industry \nthat employs nine million Americans in fields as diverse as direct \nmailing, printing and paper production.\n  That is why the deteriorating state of the United States Postal \nService's finances has been a source of great concern to many of us. \nAfter several years of large losses, the USPS has been slowly \napproaching its statutory borrowing limit of $15 billion.\n  A few months ago, however, the Office of Personnel Management \ndiscovered that the USPS will dramatically over-fund its contributions \nto the Civil Service Retirement Fund unless the law is changed. After \nhaving based the Postal Service's annual contributions on the \nassumption that it had an actuarial deficit of $32 billion, OPM \ndiscovered instead that the USPS's CSRS deficit was actually only $5 \nbillion. The difference is primarily due to higher than expected yields \non pension investments by the Department of the Treasury. If the USPS \ncontinues to fund the CSRS at its current pace, it will over-fund its \nCSRS liability by $78 billion.\n  If Congress approves the changes to the payment schedule as my bill \nprovides, the Postal Service's CSRS retirement expense would be reduced \nby $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2003 and another $2.8 billion in fiscal \nyear 2004. The USPS would be able to reduce its debt by more than $3 \nbillion in fiscal year 2003, and anticipated rate increases would be \ndelayed until at least 2006, ushering in an era of stable and \npredictable postal rates.\n  My initial response upon hearing this good news was one of pleasant \nsurprise but mixed, I admit, with a healthy dose of skepticism. As the \nold saying goes, ``if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.'' \nHowever, the Office of Management and Budget, as well as the U.S. \nTreasury Department, have confirmed OPM's analysis. Further, having \nspoken with experts outside the government as well, I have become \nsatisfied that this situation represents a rare exception to the rule.\n  That is why Senator Carper and I today introduce the Postal Civil \nService Retirement System Funding Act of 2003. Our bill will correct \nthe statutory funding mechanism for the Civil Service Retirement \nSystem, CSRS. This legislation is necessary to prevent the overpayment \nof retirement contributions by the U.S. Postal Service. Most important, \nthis bill directs OPM to determine a new amortization schedule that \nwill pay off the Postal Service's existing unfunded CSRS liability of \n$5 billion.\n  In addition, the legislation requires that the savings resulting from \nthis Act be used to reduce the postal debt in a manner that the \nSecretary of Treasury shall specify. It also expresses the sense of \nCongress that the Postal Service should use these savings to fulfill \nits commitment to hold postal rates unchanged until at least 2006, to \nbegin to pay a portion of their massive unfunded health care \nliabilities, and that the savings not be used to pay bonuses to Postal \nService executives.\n  The USPS needs other changes as well, something acknowledged by \neveryone inside and outside the Postal Service. I was pleased that \nPresident Bush appointed a Commission on the U.S. Postal Service that \nis modeled along the principles outlined in legislation I introduced \nlast year. I am hopeful that when the Commission reports this summer, \nit will provide us with a blueprint to ensure that our postal system is \nready to serve twenty-first century America as ably as it has served us \nin the past. I look forward to receiving the Commission's report and \nany recommendations for legislation it may include.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 380\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I am pleased today to be able to join my friend from \nMaine, the chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee, in introducing \nthe Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003. \nThis bill is of vital interest to the future of the Postal Service and \nenjoys the strong support of postal management, postal employees and \npostal customers.\n  According to OPM and GAO, the Postal Service will significantly \noverfund its obligations to its employees enrolled in the Civil Service \nRetirement System if it continues paying at the current rate. The \nReform Act addresses this by reducing the amount of money the Postal \nService is required to pay into CSRS each year to reflect a more \naccurate estimate of its obligations that has been prepared by OPM. In \nthe current fiscal year, this will reduce the Postal Service's annual \nCSRS\n\n[[Page S2366]]\n\npayment by nearly $3 billion. These savings, and savings of similar \nsize projected for future years, will be used to retire a portion of \nthe Postal Service's $11.1 billion debt to Treasury. The Postal Service \nhad previously only been able to budget $800 million for debt reduction \nthis fiscal year.\n  Most importantly, the savings the Postal Service will enjoy if the \nReform Act becomes law will allow it to hold the price of postage \nsteady until at least 2006. This is important because, while what the \nPostal Service charges for its services is still a bargain when \ncompared to the prices charged by most foreign posts, postal customers \nhave absorbed multiple rate increases in recent months that have raised \nthe price of postage by more than the rate of inflation. At a time when \nthe economy is weak and modes of communication like e-mail and \nelectronic bill pay are more popular than ever, another rate increase \nthis year could be a disaster for the Postal Service. If the price of \npostage goes up again in 2004, as I expect it to if the Reform Act is \nnot enacted, the Postal Service will likely lose a good deal of \nbusiness. Companies will be more aggressive in encouraging their \ncustomers to communicate with them online. Large mailers will reduce \nvolume and let workers go. Everyday users of the mail will be forced to \nbear another large spike in the price of a first-class stamp. All of \nthis would come at a time when the Postal Service is predicting an \nincrease in volume for the first time in quite a while. The Reform Act \nwill keep mail in the system and give mailers the opportunity to \nincrease the amount of business they do with the Postal Service.\n  The Reform Act, however, does not remove the Postal Service's \nobligation to continue on the modernization program begun under \nPostmaster General Jack Potter. General Potter came on the job at a \ndifficult time for the Postal Service but has led them in a successful \neffort to streamline operations, taking billions of dollars in costs \nout of the system without hurting service. That process needs to \ncontinue.\n  The Reform Act also does not eliminate the need for the Postal \nService to deal with the future cost of retiree health benefits. These \ncosts are estimated at about $50 billion. The Postal Service funds them \nnow on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning they are not reflected in the \nprice of postage today. If not addressed soon, these costs will be \npushed on to future ratepayers, forcing the Postal Service to begin \nraising rates dramatically once the baby boom generation begins to \nretire. Some of the savings the Postal Service will enjoy if the Reform \nAct becomes law should be used to prevent this from happening.\n  Finally, the Reform Act does not remove Congress's obligation to \nenact postal reform legislation this year that will help the Postal \nService and General Potter continue the transformation necessary to \nmake the Postal Service viable in the electronic age. President Bush's \nCommission on the United States Postal Service will release a set of \npostal reform proposals this summer that I hope will offer some fair, \nbalanced recommendations that we can use to begin drafting legislation. \nI plan to put forward a proposal of my own this year that maintains \nuniversal service and current delivery standards while giving the \nPostal Service the kind of flexibility its private sector competitors \nhave to set prices and cut costs. I look forward to working with \nChairman Collins and all of my colleagues on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in getting a postal reform bill signed into law during the \n108th Congress.\n  In closing, I would like to briefly address some of the similarities \nbetween the Reform Act and the Managerial Flexibility Act President \nBush proposed during the 107th Congress and make an important \ndistinction between the two proposals. Like the Managerial Flexibility \nAct would have done for all Federal agencies, the Reform Act makes the \nPostal Service responsible for benefits due to its CSRS enrollees as a \nresult of prior military service and amortizes its unfunded CSRS \nobligations over a period of 40 years. The Managerial Flexibility Act \nalso would have required Federal agencies to begin funding their \nretiree health benefits on a cost accrual basis, something the Postal \nService should be able to do if the Reform Act becomes law and it \nbegins to see some savings. This kind of accounting makes sense in the \ncase of the Postal Service, which by law must be self-sufficient and \nmust pay its employees' pension and health costs through the price of \npostage. The utility of requiring all Federal agencies to account for \ntheir employees' retirement costs in this way is not clear to me. As \nCBO points out in its January 23rd evaluation of the version of the \nReform Act proposed by OPM late last year, recognizing the accrual cost \nof agency retirement benefits by mandating payments between agencies \nand the Treasury does not provide the government with the resources \nnecessary to make future payments when they come due and does not \nlessen the burden on future taxpayers to pay them. In the case of the \nPostal Service, however, the kind of accounting contained in the \nManagerial Flexibility Act will give postal customers, who must plan \nhow much they mail in future years based on how much they anticipate \npostage will cost, a more realistic idea of what the Postal Service's \nfuture costs of doing business will be.\n  If the Reform Act is not enacted before April 1st, the Postal Service \nwill need to assume that they will be required to make the large CSRS \npayment required of them under current law, forcing them to file the \nrate case they have been preparing. This will force mailers to begin \nlitigating the case, meaning they will begin spending resources paying \nlawyers instead using the mail. I call on my colleagues to act quickly \non the Reform Act to prevent this from happening.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Inouye, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Warner, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Talent):\n  S. 382. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of cardiovascular screening tests under the \nmedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing today the \nMedicare Cholesterol Screening Coverage Act of 2003, along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Campbell, Bingaman, Inouye, Lincoln, Landrieu, \nWarner, Johnson, Cantwell and Talent. Companion legislation is being \nintroduced in the House of Representatives today by Representative Dave \nCamp and Representative William Jefferson.\n  I think it is appropriate to be introducing this bill during \n``American Heart Month.'' For the last 40 years, Congress and the \nPresident have recognized American Heart Month because of the need to \ncontinue the fight against heart disease--our country's #1 killer and a \nleading cause of disability. Cardiovascular diseases take an enormous \nhuman and financial toll on our Nation. Every 33 seconds, an American \ndies from cardiovascular disease. About 41 percent of deaths each year \nare from cardiovascular diseases--more than the next 6 leading causes \nof death combined. Adding cholesterol screening testing to the menu of \npreventive services already covered by Medicare is yet another step we \ncan and should take in the fight against these insidious diseases.\n  Cardiovascular diseases account for one-third of all of Medicare's \nspending for hospitalizations. Yet the identification of one of the \nmajor, changeable risk factors for cardiovascular disease--high levels \nof cholesterol--is not covered by Medicare.\n  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the American Heart \nAssociation recommend that all Americans over the age of 20 have their \ncholesterol levels tested at least once every five years. But when an \nAmerican turns 65 and enters the Medicare program, their coverage for \ncholesterol screening stops. That is just not right.\n  Adding a cholesterol screening benefit to Medicare is a common-sense, \ncost-effective step. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this \nbenefit would cost only $20 million a year--a small fraction of the $26 \nbillion that Medicare spends each year for hospitalizations of patients \nwith cardiovascular diseases.\n  I am pleased that language similar to my bill was included in S. \n3018, bipartisan Medicare legislation introduced last fall by the \nleaders of the Finance\n\n[[Page S2367]]\n\nCommittee, Senators Grassley and Baucus. Unfortunately, however, the \nSenate did not act on this bill before adjourning last year.\n  I hope Congress will act soon to provide Medicare coverage of \ncholesterol screening, and I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this \nbill.\n  Another way my colleagues can help in the fight against heart disease \nis by joining the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition. The \nCongressional Heart and Stroke Coalition was founded in 1996 and I am \nhonored to serve as one of its co-founders and co-chairs. Since its \ninception, this bicameral, bipartisan Coalition has grown to nearly 200 \nMembers.\n  Its purpose is to raise awareness among Congress and the public about \nheart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases and to support \npublic policies to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure these diseases. \nI encourage those Members who have not already joined the Congressional \nHeart and Stroke Coalition to do so.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to add a cholesterol \nscreening benefit for Medicare beneficiaries and to make progress in \nthe fight against cardiovascular diseases.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 382\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \naddress the growing problem of Canadian waste shipments to Michigan.\n  In 2001, Michigan imported almost 3.6 million tons of municipal solid \nwaste, more than double the amount that was imported in 1999. This \ngives Michigan the unduly distinction of being the third largest \ndumping ground of waste in the United States.\n  My colleagues may be surprised to know that the biggest source of \nthis waste was not another State, but our neighbor to north, Canada. \nMore than half the waste that was shipped to Michigan in 2001 was from \nOntario, Canada, and these imports are growing rapidly. On January 1, \n2003, as another Ontario landfill closed its doors, the City of Toronto \nswitched from shipping two-thirds of its trash, to shipping all of its \ntrash--1.1 million tons--to a Michigan landfill. And this deal could \nlast 20 years! Experts predict that soon there will be virtually no \nlocal disposal capacity in Ontario, which could mean even more waste \nbeing shipped across the border to Michigan.\n  Not only does this waste dramatically decrease Michigan's own \nlandfill capacity, but it has a tremendous negative impact on \nMichigan's environment and the public health of citizens. Currently, \nCanadian municipal solid waste is sent to landfills in seven different \nMichigan counties--Genesee, Huron, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, Washtenaw, \nand Wayne counties. Based on current usage statistics, the Michigan \nDepartment of Environmental Quality, DEQ, estimates that Michigan has \ncapacity for 15-17 years of disposal in landfills. However, with the \nproposed dramatic increase in importation of waste, this capacity is \nless than 10 years. The Michigan DEQ estimates that for every five \nyears of disposal of Canadian waste at the current usage volume, \nMichigan is losing a full year of landfill capacity. The Canadian waste \nalso hampers the effectiveness of Michigan's State and local recycling \nefforts, since Ontario does not have a bottle law requiring recycling.\n  These Canadian waste shipments also present a threat to homeland \nsecurity. Currently, 130 truckloads of waste come into Michigan each \nday from Canada. These trucks cross the Ambassador Bridge and Blue \nWater Bridge and travel through the busiest parts of Metro Detroit. In \naddition to causing traffic delays, and filling our air with the stench \nof exhaust and garbage, these trucks also present a security risk at \nour Michigan-Canadian border, since by their nature trucks full of \ngarbage are harder for Customs agent to inspects then traditional \ncargo.\n  Last year, I joined with Senator Levin and Congressman Dingell to \nintroduce legislation to enforce the protections that Michigan is \nalready entitled to which are contained in an international agreement \nbetween the United States and Canada. I continue to be supportive of \nthis bill and I was proud to join as an original co-sponsor when it was \nreintroduced last month. However, with the recent landfill closings in \nOntario, this problem has spiraled out of control.\n  That is why today I am introducing ``the Canadian Waste Import Ban \nAct of 2003.'' This bill would stop these shipments by placing an \nimmediate federal ban on the importation of Canadian municipal solid \nwaste. The ban will be in place until the EPA enforces ``the Agreement \nConcerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste.'' Under this \nexisting agreement, the EPA is supposed to receive notification of \nCanadian waste shipments, and then would have 30 days to consent or \nobject to the shipment. Not only have these notification provisions not \nbeen enforced, but the EPA has indicated that they would not object to \nthe municipal waste shipments.\n  In addition, the bill requires the EPA to Michigan's or any State's \nconsent before receiving any shipment of Canadian municipal solid \nwaste. In enforcing the agreement, the EPA must obtain the consent of \nthe receiving State, before consenting to a Canadian municipal solid \nwaste shipment. The EPA must also consider the impact of the shipment \non homeland security, the environment, and public health.\n  This legislation will stop the importation of Canadian trash until \nMichigan residents are given the voice they deserve in deciding whether \nor not this waste should be sent to their landfills. We need to give \nthe states a real voice in these decisions and my bill guarantees that \nthe states through the EPA will get to decide whether or not they want \nto receive this Canadian waste. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Canadian Waste Import Ban \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\n     SEC. 2.
