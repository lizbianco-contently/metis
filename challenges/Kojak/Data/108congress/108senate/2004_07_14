For that, our State \nhas benefited greatly. I also wish to recognize Reverend Longbottom's \nwife Lori who accompanied him to Washington as well. We in Nebraska are \nvery proud of the Longbottoms. I am very proud to say a few words about \nhim.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the intelligence we had \nprior to going into Iraq and the decision that was made \noverwhelmingly--by I believe 77 votes in this body--to authorize the \nuse of force against Iraq. Today we have received the copy of the \nButler report in Great Britain talking about their intelligence \nfailures as well. Lord Butler examined the intelligence the British \nGovernment had and found there were problems in their intelligence as \nwell. But they did an in-depth assessment of what they knew then and \nwhat they know now.\n  I thought it was very interesting, since yesterday on this floor a \nquestion had been raised about the statement President Bush made in his \naddress to a joint session of both Houses of Congress that Saddam \nHussein had sought uranium from Africa.\n  Conclusion No. 499 in the Butler report is as follows:\n\n       We conclude that, on the basis of intelligence assessments \n     at the time, covering both Niger and the Democratic Republic \n     of Congo, the statements on Iraqi attempts to buy uranium \n     from Africa in the Government's dossier and by the Prime \n     Minister in the House of Commons, were well-founded.\n\n  By extension, we also conclude that the statement in President Bush's \nState of the Union Address of 28 January, 2003, that the British \nGovernment has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant \nquantities of uranium from Africa was well-founded.\n  In other words, an examination by the committee, headed by Lord \nButler, to examine intelligence produced by the British Intelligence \nService was accurate, that Iraq was seeking uranium from Africa as part \nof its nuclear weapons program. So much for the charges by many--some \nin this body--that there was no basis for this statement that President \nBush made, based on British intelligence that Iraq was seeking uranium \nfrom Africa and that it was not well-founded. It was. And on that, we \nnow have a conclusion from Lord Butler that was the case.\n  I think the issue was more fully discussed, obviously, in the \nconclusions of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and in the \nseparate opinion, separate findings produced by Chairman Roberts, to \nwhich I and other members of the committee signed off.\n  Today, as I came to work, I heard on the radio a very regrettable and \nunfortunate opinion piece by a writer from the Washington Post, saying \nthat, obviously, President Bush should not have gone into Iraq, saying \nin effect that taking down Saddam Hussein was wrong. He was telling our \ntroops, who are on the ground risking their lives--and too many who \nhave given up their lives--we are fighting in vain. That is absolute \nnonsense. It is regrettable that we have forgotten during a time of war \nthat, generally, politics stops at the water's edge.\n  As I have mentioned before on the floor, there seems to be a \nconcerted effort by our friends in the other party to contend that, \nbecause the intelligence was not as good as it should have been, we \nshould not have gone in and deposed the murderous tyrant who had not \nonly slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people, the Kurds, \ninvaded Kuwait, and threatened Saudi Arabia, but also provided a harbor \nfor terrorists such as al-Qaida and Abu al-Zarqawi's group.\n  I have had the opportunity to talk to some of the young men and women \nwho have put their lives on the line in Iraq. I would trust their \njudgment far more than I would trust a political hatchet job by a \nwriter who is trying to score political points against the President \nand the Vice President.\n  Let me go back to a couple of conclusions from the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  Conclusion 92, on page 345, says:\n\n       The CIA's examination of contacts, training, and safe haven \n     and operational cooperation as indicators of a possible Iraq/\n     al-Qaida relationship was a reasonable and objective approach \n     to the question.\n\n  Conclusion 95, on page 347, says:\n\n       The CIA's assessment on safe haven that--that al-Qaida or \n     associated operatives were present in Baghdad and \n     northeastern Iraq in an area under Kurdish control--was \n     reasonable.\n\n  In other words, judgments were reasonable that this was a country \nharboring terrorists. Thinking back, do you know what the President \nsaid? He said that we are going to carry the war to the terrorists. We \nare going to go after them where they hide, where they take refuge. We \nwiped them out in Afghanistan and we had to go into Iraq where they \nwere also gaining safe haven.\n\n  To say we are not significantly safer in the United States, or people \naround the world, our allies, and free people are not safer as a result \nof deposing Saddam Hussein is pure nonsense. Unfortunately, we are at \nwar with the terrorists. The terrorists were in Iraq. They had access \nto the weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein had produced in \nthe past and was willing to produce in the future.\n  Over the last few days, we all have heard briefings on recent \nincreased threats in the United States. Today, had we not acted in \nIraq, we would be even more at risk to the possibility of terror, and \nthe likelihood that those terrorist attacks would have included \nchemical or biological weapons would have been far greater.\n  Our examination of what happened, what was going on in Iraq, \nconducted after the war found there were significant production \ncapabilities for chemical and biological weapons in Iraq. There were \nterrorists there who were seeking to gain access to these weapons. Did \nwe find large stockpiles? No. Did we expect to find large stockpiles? \nNo. At best, they said the amount of chemical and biological weapons \nwould be less than would fill a swimming pool.\n  But the problem with these chemical and biological weapons, whether \nthey be ricin, sarin gas, anthrax, or smallpox, very small amounts can \ncause significant death, damage, and destruction to the United States. \nThe potential to kill people with these deadly biological and chemical \nweapons was terrific, and we are safer because we took him out.\n  Do we know if we have captured all of the weapons of mass destruction \nthat he produced? No. We cannot know that. We will find out more, I \nbelieve, as the Iraqi Government takes steps, through its own security \nforces, to go after the known and suspected terrorists, to find where \nthey are. We have\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\nheard reports about chemical and biological weapons being dispersed. We \ncannot confirm where they are. We only hope and pray they are not in \nthe hands of terrorists who have made their way to the United States. \nBut only time will tell.\n  Conclusion 97, which is on page 348 of the Intelligence Committee \nreport, concluded:\n\n       The CIA's judgment that Saddam Hussein, if sufficiently \n     desperate, might employ terrorists with global reach--al-\n     Qaida--to conduct terrorist attacks in the event of war, was \n     reasonable.\n\n  And of course it was reasonable; after all, we already knew Saddam \nHussein was supporting terrorists such as the Arab Liberation Front, \nand he was offering money to the families of suicide bombers, \nparticularly Hamas. We know he had the ability to turn his \nmanufacturing capabilities, with the scientists he had, into the \nproduction of chemical and biological weapons.\n  We know how tragic the terrorist attack of 9/11 was on our soil. We \nlost over 3,000 people. They used unconventional weapons--airplanes \nloaded with fuel--to cause those deaths. I tremor to think about what \ncould happen if chemical or biological weapons were used in large areas \nwhere unsuspecting civilians are gathered in the United States.\n  After what happened on 9/11, we had many investigations saying why \ndidn't we put all of those elements together? They were very \nfragmentary. We had walls that prevented us from sharing that \ninformation among our intelligence agencies. It would have been almost \nimpossible, even in hindsight, to connect all the dots and know what \nwas going to happen on 9/11.\n  After that, intelligence analysts were under great pressure to try to \nidentify potential attacks on the United States, or the potential use \nby terrorists of weapons of mass destruction and they overstated many \nof those conclusions. But what we know from our own experience is that \nSaddam Hussein consistently engaged in a pattern of denial and \ndeception. He made it very difficult to find out what he was doing. We \nknow from his actions what a deadly, murderous terrorist he was. By \nremoving the Saddam Hussein regime, we eliminated yet another front \nfrom which terrorists could operate safely; most importantly, we \neliminated the possibility that Saddam's weapons programs in the future \ncould be leveraged by terrorists who seek to destroy us.\n  Finding huge stockpiles of weapons was not the objective of going \ninto Iraq. The failure to do so should not be taken as a measure of the \nlack of success in Iraq. Prime Minister Tony Blair today said, on \nreceiving the Butler report, that we were right to go into Iraq. He has \nbeen a steadfast ally, and we commend him.\n  We also have the interim report of the Iraqi Survey Group. We spent a \nlong time listening to Dr. David Kay in our closed sessions, but he has \nissued an interim report that we can quote. That interim report noted \nfinding ``dozens of WMD-related program activities and significant \namounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations during \nthe Inspections that began in late 2002.''\n  Some of these included, for example:\n\n       A clandestine network of laboratories and safehouses within \n     the Iraqi Intelligence Service that contained equipment \n     subject to U.N. monitoring and suitable for continuing CBW \n     research.\n\n  That is chemical and biological weapons research.\n\n       A prison laboratory complex, possibly used in human testing \n     of BW agents, that Iraqi officials working to prepare for \n     U.N. inspections were explicitly ordered not to declare to \n     the U.N.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, is there any time remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. No.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for 1 more minute to conclude.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. I believe the Senator has 49 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will do the best I can with the time \nremaining to conclude.\n  Dr. David Kay said he thought ``it was absolutely prudent'' going \ninto Iraq. He went on to say:\n\n       In fact, I think at the end of the inspection process, \n     we'll paint a picture of Iraq that was far more dangerous \n     than even we thought it was before the war. It was a system \n     collapsing. It was a country that had the capability in \n     weapons of mass destruction areas and in which terrorists, \n     like ants to honey, were going after it.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Democratic \nleader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time and reserve the \ntime left under morning business for my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8057-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8057-S8059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           INCREASING NUMBER OF UNINSURED FAMILIES IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this morning we were again reminded of \nhow much remains to be done in addressing the health care crisis in \nAmerica. Today's paper has this headline: ``Medicare Law Is Seen \nLeading to Cuts in Drug Benefits for Retirees.'' According to the \narticle, the government is now estimating that 3.8 million retirees who \ncurrently receive prescription drug benefits through their employers \nwill see their coverage reduced or eliminated as a result of the \nRepublican drug law passed last fall.\n  That is simply unacceptable, and it is only one of the many problems \nwe are facing when it comes to health care. Over the past several \nyears, the cost of health insurance has skyrocketed, and millions more \nAmericans have found themselves uninsured.\n  A while back, I held a ``living room meeting'' on health care costs \nin Sioux Falls. An older, married couple came to that meeting. He's a \nveteran, 68 years old, with diabetes and congenital heart failure. \nShe's 62, with cerebral palsy. Last year, shortly after the husband \nretired, this couple learned that the wife's bladder cancer had come \nback. This couple pays $418 a month in health insurance premiums \nthrough COBRA, plus another $400 a month for prescriptions, and more on \ntop of that in co-pays for doctor visits. Soon, their COBRA eligibility \nwill expire.\n  The husband is on a waiting list--a waiting list--to see a VA doctor. \nBut they don't know how they will pay for the wife's health care after \nthey lose their current insurance coverage. Individual coverage for a \n62-year-old woman with cerebral palsy and cancer would be prohibitively \nexpensive--if they could get it at all. So, after nearly 20 years of \nmarriage, this couple is contemplating divorce as the only option for \ngetting essential health care for the wife.\n  If this Senate wants to protect American families, let's discuss what \nwe can do to make health care more affordable and accessible so that \nspouses don't have to consider divorcing each other in order to get \nessential health care.\n  Forty-four million Americans were uninsured in 2002--the most recent \nyear for which figures are available. That's 2.4 million more Americans \nwithout health insurance than the year before--the largest 1-year \nincrease in a decade. Eight-and-a-half-million of those 44 million \nAmericans are children. Sixteen million are women, many in their child-\nbearing years.\n  As shocking as those figures are, they tell only half the story--\nliterally. A new study conducted for Families USA, using census data, \nshows that almost 82 million Americans--one in three Americans younger \nthan 65--were uninsured at some point in the last two years. Two thirds \nwere uninsured for at least six months. Half were uninsured for 9 \nmonths or longer.\n  Who are these people? They're working people, mostly. Eighty percent \nof uninsured Americans live in families in which at least one adult \nworks. But their employers don't offer health insurance, or their pay \nis so low they can't afford to buy it. A growing number are middle \nclass. One in four had family incomes between $55,000 and $75,000.\n  In South Dakota, more than 27 percent of people younger than 65 were \nuninsured for at least some part of the last 2 years. That's 180,000 \npeople living with the fear that they are just one serious illness or \naccident away from financial disaster.\n  In 14 States, according to the Families USA study, more than one-\nthird of all people younger than 65 were uninsured for at least part of \nthe last two years. One in three people. The State with the highest \npercentage of uninsured was Texas: 43.4 percent.\n\n[[Page S8058]]\n\n  We have the highest per capita health care spending of any nation on \nEarth. Yet, in comparison with other developed, high-income nations, \nthe United States consistently scores at or near the bottom on infant \nmortality, life expectancy, and the proportion of the population with \nhealth insurance.\n  We hear a lot today about who is more optimistic about America's \neconomy and our future. I believe it is pessimistic to look at the \nstate of health care in America today and conclude that we really can't \ndo much better. I believe it is pessimistic to watch the cost of health \ncare increase sharply every year; to watch the number of uninsured \nAmericans grow every year; and to watch more businesses be forced to \nreduce or eliminate employee and retiree health benefits every year--\nyear after year--and conclude there isn't really much of anything we \ncan do about it. And I believe it is deeply irresponsible for this \nSenate to spend almost no time on serious discussions of responsible \nproposals to address this crisis. People all across America are looking \nto us for help on health care.\n  Lowell and Pauline Larson are two of those people. I've known the \nLarsons for years. Lowell is 68, almost 69. Pauline turned 64 on the \nFourth of July. They live in Chester, SD. Lowell Larson has worked hard \nall his life. He started work in a furniture mill in Sioux Falls just \nout of high school and stayed there for 20 years before he finally got \nthe chance--about 30 years ago--to do what he'd wanted all his life: \nown his own farm.\n  It's a small farm--160 acres. The Larsons raised corn and beans and \nkept a few cows. It's hard work. I don't think Mr. Larson would mind me \ntelling you, he and Pauline don't have much money. Small family farmers \ndon't make much money. Some years, if the weather's bad, or the market \nis weak, they don't make any money.\n  What Lowell Larson does have, in abundance, is a strong sense of \npersonal and family responsibility. It's part of the South Dakota \nethic. It's what we're taught, and what we teach our children: If \nsomeone you love needs help, you help them. And if you owe someone \nmoney, you do everything you can to pay them.\n  When Lowell Larson was a young man, his mother had a stroke. He \npostponed marriage and spent 20 years caring for her. After his mother \ndied, Lowell met Pauline. At 45, he finally married. A few years later, \nPauline began having trouble walking, and she was diagnosed with MS. \nOver the next few years, she progressed from a cane to a wheelchair.\n  In early November 2002, Pauline had a serious stroke. She spent a few \nweeks in the hospital, followed by a few months in a nursing home. Then \nshe had to have her gall bladder removed--more time in the hospital. In \nless than 2 years, the Larsons ended up with $40,000 in medical bills \nfrom Pauline's stroke and surgery. On top of that, they spend more than \n$200 a month on muscle relaxants and other medications Pauline needs \nfor her MS.\n  The Larsons used to have private health insurance. But it got so \nexpensive, they gave it up about 5 years ago. ``We didn't know she was \ngoing to have a stroke,'' Lowell says.\n  Today, Lowell Larson gets Medicare. Pauline has a very bare-bones \nhealth policy that pays $75 a day for hospital care and $50 a day for \nnursing home care--nothing else. Last year, the Larsons held a sale. \nThey sold many of their personal possessions and much of their farm \nequipment to raise money to pay their medical bills. The sale brought \nin about $30,000. Lowell Larson talked with doctors and hospitals and \ngot them to forgive another few thousand dollars of their debt.\n  Lowell Larson brought Pauline home from the nursing home about 18 \nmonths ago because they couldn't afford the $4,000 a month it cost and \nbecause they were both too lonely living apart. These days, Pauline \nspends most of her time in a hospital bed set up in their home. She has \ndifficulty speaking. She also has trouble using her right arm, which \nmakes it hard for her to feed herself.\n  It can wear you down, living with the fear that your family is just \none more medical emergency away from financial disaster. Lowell Larson \nsays, ``A lot of mornings, I wake up around 4:30 or 5 o'clock and I \njust start worrying about things.'' The Larsons are counting the days \nuntil Pauline turns 65 and can get Medicare.\n  Since President Bush took office, family health care premiums have \nincreased by more than $2,700 a year. The average cost for a family \nhealth plan is now $9,000 a year. Workers pay about $2,400 of that \namount out of their own pockets. That's just for premiums. It doesn't \ninclude copayments and deductibles. And these are the people in the \nbest situations; they have access to group plans through their \nemployers. This is just one more example of how the middle class is \nbeing squeezed in America. Families are paying more for skimpier \ncoverage every year. Unless we act, the number of families without \nhealth insurance will continue to grow.\n  And the consequences of un-insurance are staggering. People without \ninsurance use one-third less health care. They skip preventive care and \nregular check-ups. They don't fill prescriptions. They postpone \nsurgeries if they can. They live with pain. When they get sick, they \ncrowd emergency rooms where the care they get is often too little, and \ntoo late.\n  In a new survey by the American College of Emergency Physicians and \nthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, two-thirds of ER doctors said the \nuninsured patients they see are sicker than those with insurance, and \nnearly all--94 percent--said it was harder to schedule needed followup \ncare with uninsured patients.\n  People without insurance pay more for health care. Hospitals \nroutinely charge uninsured patients up to four times as much as \npatients with insurance for the same services. Too often, people who \nare already battling illness find themselves having to fight off \naggressive debt collectors, too.\n  And 18,000 Americans die prematurely every year because they do not \nhave health insurance. Forty-nine people every day.\n  Our economy also suffers. The Institute of Medicine estimates that \nlack of health insurance costs America between $65 billion and $130 \nbillion a year in lost productivity and other costs.\n  Democrats have been leading the fight for universal health coverage \nin America for decades. We want to work with our Republican colleagues \nto reduce the number of uninsured Americans and make health care more \naffordable and accessible.\n  But the few proposals offered so far by the President and \ncongressional Republicans will not work. Independent studies of these \nproposals show that they would do little to address soaring health care \ncosts and the growing insurance gap, and, in some cases, they would \nactually make matters worse.\n  There are better ideas. Democrats have proposed that, within 2 years, \nall Americans have access to affordable health care that is as good as \nthe health care members of Congress have--at the same rates, or lower. \nWe ask our Republican colleagues to work with us to make that a \nreality.\n  In addition, we should adequately fund the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. We should also adequately fund the VA and the Indian \nHealth Service--we must keep our promises to America's veterans and \nhonor our treaty obligations to American Indians.\n  We can reduce the cost of prescription drugs--one of the driving \nforces behind medical inflation--by letting Medicare negotiate the best \nprices for American seniors, and by allowing Americans to re-import \nsafe prescription drugs from Canada and other industrialized nations.\n  I introduced a bill recently that could significantly reduce the \nnumber of uninsured Americans and help small business owners create new \njobs at the same time. The Small Business Health Tax Credit--S. 2245--\nwould provide small businesses with tax credits to cover up to 50 \npercent of the cost of their employees' health insurance. These health \ncare tax credits would help businesses save money, which means they \nwill have more money to invest in new equipment, hire new workers, and \ngive their employees raises.\n  If our Republican colleagues have additional ideas that will actually \nreduce the cost of health care and increase the number of Americans \nwith insurance, we welcome the chance to work with them on those ideas \nas well.\n  What we cannot do is to continue to ignore this urgent problem. \nLowell and\n\n[[Page S8059]]\n\nPauline Larson sold much of what they owned to pay their medical bills \nbecause they take their responsibilities seriously. It's time for this \nSenate to take seriously its responsibility--to find solutions to \nreduce the cost of health care and the number of Americans without \nhealth insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today we observe a sad milestone in the \nscandal and tragedy that some have labeled ``leakgate.'' It has been \nexactly 1 year, July 14, since two senior White House officials leaked \nValerie Plame's identity as a covert operative at the Central \nIntelligence Agency.\n  Last July 14, 2003, 8 days after Ms. Plame's husband published an op-\ned in the New York Times which questioned information in the \nPresident's 2003 State of the Union message regarding a supposed effort \nby Iraq to purchase uranium from Africa, her identity was revealed in \nprint by columnist Robert Novak. This illegal act should have outraged \neveryone at the White House. It should have moved President Bush \nimmediately to demand the identity of the perpetrators.\n  Instead, in his only public statement about this act of betrayal, Mr. \nBush smiled--yes, he smiled--and said:\n\n       This is a town that likes to leak. I don't know if we are \n     going to find out the senior administration official. Now, \n     this is a large administration, and there's a lot of senior \n     officials. I don't have any idea.\n\n  Again, he said it with kind of a smirk and a wry smile on his face.\n  I consider that statement to be disingenuous. The number of senior \nWhite House officials with the appropriate clearances and access to \nknowledge about Ms. Plame's identity can probably be counted on one \nhand, two at the most. If Mr. Bush was serious about identifying the \nperpetrators, those officials could have been summoned to the Oval \nOffice and this matter would have been resolved in 24 hours.\n  Now, we are not talking about some little thing happening. This is an \nillegal action under the law.\n  Mr. Bush did not question his staff in the Oval Office. There was no \noutrage at the White House. There were no internal investigations. \nThere was no angry President Bush demanding answers from his senior \naides. There was only a cavalier dismissal, followed by a year of \nvirtual silence.\n  Three decades ago, a previous occupant of the Oval Office, President \nNixon, was recorded on audiotape saying to a senior White House \nofficial:\n\n       I don't give an [expletive] what happens. I want you to \n     stonewall it, let them plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up or \n     anything else, if it'll save it, save this plan. That's the \n     whole point. We're going to protect our people if we can.\n\n  That was Richard Nixon almost 30 years ago. This White House has now \ndelayed any accountability for this damaging and illegal leak for a \nfull year. White House officials who committed this act of treachery \npresumably are still exercising decisionmaking power.\n  Who is the White House protecting? Why? Do we now have a modern day \nRichard Nixon back in the White House?\n  And what was the cost of exposing Ms. Plame? Not only her job. As \nVincent Cannistraro, former Chief of Operations and Analysis at the CIA \nCounterterrorism Center, told us:\n\n       The consequences are much greater than Valerie Plame's job \n     as a clandestine CIA employee. They include damage to the \n     lives and livelihoods of many foreign nationals with whom she \n     was connected, and it has destroyed a clandestine cover \n     mechanism that may have been used to protect other CIA \n     nonofficial cover officers.\n\n  Valerie Plame's cover was blown to discredit and retaliate against \nher husband Joseph Wilson. The recent report by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee provides some insight. It states that back in 2002 when the \nCIA was searching for someone with connections to Niger to find out \nabout a possible purchase or attempt to purchase uranium by Iraq, she \nsuggested that her husband, former Ambassador Wilson, go as a \nfactfinder. Mr. Wilson was sent there. He reported the claim's lack of \ncredibility to the CIA.\n  Later that year, the President was to give a speech in Cincinnati \nmentioning the claim. On October 6, CIA Director Tenet personally \ncalled Deputy National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley to outline the \nCIA's concerns that this claim was not real. And it was then deleted \nfrom the President's Cincinnati speech.\n  Between October 2002 and January 2003, concerns about the claim \nincreased. In January, the State Department sent an e-mail to the CIA \noutlining ``the reasoning why the uranium purchase agreement is \nprobably a hoax.''\n  Here is the troubling aspect: The same official, Stephen Hadley, who \nspoke with George Tenet and took the claim out of the October speech in \nCincinnati, was also in charge of vetting the State of the Union \nAddress. Amazing. If he knew it was a problem and took it out in \nOctober, why was it put in for the State of the Union message?\n  A lot of questions need to be answered. Mr. Bush seemingly does not \nwant to know the identity of the leakers. The White House occupies a \nsmall area. The number of employees who are suspect in this matter is \nsmall. This should not be like trying to find nonexistent weapons of \nmass destruction in Iraq.\n\n  One year has passed. Perhaps the President and others have already \ntold Special Prosecutor Fitzgerald who is responsible. Perhaps that has \nhappened. If not, I believe it is clear that the President and the Vice \nPresident should be put under oath. They need to tell the special \nprosecutor and the American public who committed these acts. They \nshould be put under oath, questioned, and filmed. Remember, this \nhappened just a few years ago when another President, President \nClinton, was put under oath and questioned by the special prosecutor, \non film, which we witnessed right here on the Senate floor.\n  Also, by putting the President and the Vice President under oath and \nquestioning them as they should be questioned, it sends another \npowerful message to the people of this country: No President, no Vice \nPresident, is above the law. President Clinton was not above the law. \nThis President should not be above the law.\n  I call upon the special prosecutor: Put the President under oath. Put \nthe Vice President under oath. Question them about their knowledge of \nthis incident and let's get this matter cleared up. Find those \nresponsible and prosecute them to the full extent of the law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to follow up on what my colleague \nfrom Iowa has had to say. I thank him for his strength and leadership \non this issue.\n  As was mentioned, it is a year ago that Robert Novak published a \ncolumn outing a covert CIA agent. The next day I called for an \ninvestigation.\n  For about a month not much happened. Then, and I think the record \nshould underscore this, George Tenet, head of the CIA, publicly and \nprivately asked for an investigation, and one began.\n  I don't have any complaints with the investigation. I think both Mr. \nComey and Prosecutor Fitzgerald have done a fine job. I have faith in \nwhat they are doing, at least from everything I have heard. But the \nbottom line is very simple. First, this was a dastardly crime. This is \na crime of a serious nature committed by someone in the White House. We \nknow that much. Unfortunately, the attitude of the White House has not \nbeen what it should be. There ought to be an attitude there that says \nthis was a terrible crime. To reveal the name of an agent jeopardizes \nthat agent's life and the lives of many others with whom they came in \ncontact. There ought to be every effort to turn over every stone to \nfind out who did this.\n  There is a lot of speculation it was done for vengeance, to get at \nAmbassador Wilson. It doesn't matter what the reason is, the bottom \nline is there is a rule of law in America, and this crime is a lot \nworse than a lot of crimes that we get prosecutions for. The bottom \nline is simple. I believe if the President wanted it to come out, and \nsaid, It doesn't matter where the chips fall, we are going to find out \nwho did it and bring them to justice, it would have come out already as \nto who did it.\n  Instead, we first had stonewalling--no investigation. Now we have an \ninvestigation, but everyone is hiding behind the shield laws and other \ntypes of things that say this gets in the way of the sanctity of \nfreedom of the press.\n  That is not true. If the President insisted that every person in the \nWhite House sign a statement--not just asked them to do it, insisted--\nunder oath, that they did or did not, and then released the journalists \nthey might have talked to, we would know who did it.\n  Ultimately, as Harry Truman always reminded us, the buck stops with \nthe President. This is lawbreaking. This is not just political \nintrigue, this is not just payback, this is lawbreaking of a serious \ncrime. Right now, as we speak, we are trying to build up human \nintelligence, which fell too far in the CIA. Right now, as we speak, \nthere are American men and women risking their lives in these \nundercover activities. They know that somebody who did the same has \nbeen put at risk, and there is no strong rush to find out who did it \nand punish them.\n  That hurts our intelligence gathering. It hurts our soldiers. It \nhurts the rule of law. On this first anniversary we make a plea to the \nPresident: It is not too late. Make every person who worked in the \nWhite House during the time of the leak sign a statement under oath \neither that they did or did not talk to them. If they will not sign it, \nthey should not be in the White House anymore. This is too serious to \ntreat as everyday politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken with the manager of the bill, \nthe Senator from Texas. He has agreed to allow Senator Kennedy to speak \nfor 5 minutes, and Senator Reed to go next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it speaks volumes that the Senate \nRepublican leadership has taken this disgraceful detour into right-wing \ncampaign politics when so much genuine Senate business is still \nunfinished, and so little time is left to get it done.\n  We can't pass a budget. We are far behind in meeting our \nappropriations responsibilities. So far, in fact, we have passed only 1 \nof the 13 appropriations bills for the next fiscal year that begins on \nOctober 1. We may not see any of these bills acted on, on or before the \nAugust recess. Even in the wake of the al-Qaida terrorist threat \nannounced last week by Secretary Ridge, the Senate leadership refuses \nto proceed with debate and votes on the Homeland Security \nappropriations bills.\n  We know many higher priorities should be worked on. Since President \nBush took office in 2001, health insurance premiums have soared 43 \npercent. Tuition at public colleges has risen 28 percent. Drug costs \nhave shot up 52 percent. Corporate profits have risen by over 50 \npercent. Yet private sector wages are down six-tenths of 1 percent \nsince President Bush took office, and there are 3 million more \nAmericans in poverty.\n  The Senate Republican leadership has consistently failed to address \nthese and many other urgent priorities. It has taken no action to fix \nAmerica's broken health care system. It has blocked passage of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. It has refused to allow a vote on raising the \nminimum wage. It has still not scheduled a vote on renewing the \nexisting ban on assault weapons, which will expire September 13.\n  Rather than deal with these urgent priorities, the leadership is \nengaging in the politics of mass distraction by bringing up a \ndiscriminatory marriage amendment to the U.S. Constitution that a \nmajority of Americans do not support.\n  Conservative activist Paul Weyrich explained the partisan GOP \nstrategy in a recent e-mail newspaper. President Bush has ``bet the \nfarm on Iraq'' he wrote, and the best solution to his declining poll \nnumbers is to ``change the subject'' to the Federal marriage \nconstitutional amendment. Weyrich acknowledged that doing so might cost \nthe President votes from gay and lesbian Republicans, but he is not \ntroubled about it. ``Good riddance,'' he wrote.\n  We all know what this issue is about. It is not about how to protect \nthe sanctity of marriage or how to deal with activist judges. It is \nabout politics. I might say, of the activist judges, of the seven \njudges who drew the decision in Massachusetts, six of them were \nappointed by Republicans.\n  This is about politics, an attempt to drive a wedge between one group \nof citizens and the rest of the country, solely for partisan advantage. \nWe have rejected that tactic before, and I am hopeful we will do so \nagain.\n  I am also hopeful that many of our Republican colleagues, those with \nwhom we have worked over the years in a bipartisan effort to expand and \ndefend the civil rights of gay and straight Americans alike, will join \nus in rejecting this divisive effort. There is absolutely no need to \namend the Constitution on this issue. As news reports from across the \ncountry make clear, Massachusetts and other States are already dealing \nwith the issue and doing it effectively and doing it according to the \nwishes of the citizens of their State. No State has been bound or will \nbe bound by the rulings and laws on same-sex marriages in any other \nState.\n  The Federal statute enacted in 1996, the Defense of Marriage Act, \nmakes the possibility of nationwide enforceability even more remote. \nNot a single State or Federal court has called the constitutionality of \nthat act into question.\n  Furthermore, not a single church, mosque, or synagogue has been \nrequired or ever will be required to recognize same-sex marriages. As \nthe First Amendment makes clear, no court, no State, no Congress can \ntell any church or any religious group how to conduct its own affairs. \nThe true threat to religious freedom is posed by the Federal marriage \namendment itself, which would tell churches they cannot consecrate a \nsame-sex marriage, even though some churches are now doing so.\n  Given these indisputable facts, the proponents of the Federal \nmarriage amendment have built their case upon a tower of speculation \nand conjecture--an attempt to conjure up a national crisis where none \nexists.\n  This is a wholly insufficient basis for even considering a proposed \nconstitutional amendment on the Senate floor, much less voting for it. \nIf it is not necessary to amend the Constitution, it is necessary not \nto amend it.\n  I urge my colleagues to show respect for our country's Constitution \nand its principles and traditions, and not play partisan campaign \npolitics with the foundation of our democracy. I urge them to reject \nthis discriminatory and unnecessary proposal.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8061-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

There is so much more we can and should \ndo with respect to that looming threat.\n  Several years ago in response to developments in Hawaii and \nelsewhere, Congress, along with then-President Clinton's support, \nenacted the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA. DOMA put into \nFederal law a clear and precise definition of marriage as follows:\n\n     . . . the word ``marriage'' means only a legal union between \n     one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word \n     ``spouse'' refers only to a person of the opposite sex, who \n     is a husband or a wife.\n\n  In the face of this clear language in the statute, it is amazing to \nme we would disregard the wisdom of our Founding Fathers and attempt to \nenshrine in the Constitution this principle without testing the \nconstitutionality of this statute. Since it was first written and with \nthe addition of the Bill of Rights in 1791, our Constitution has only \nbeen amended 16 times. The vast majority of these amendments dealt with \nthe separation of powers and structure of our Government, the right to \nvote, power to tax, and other issues that, frankly, are only issues \nthat can be decided through Constitutional amendment. The amendment \nthat is before us today has not yet risen to this level of interest and \nconcern.\n\n  First, as I indicated, Congress has already addressed the issue of \nwhat marriage is, and that law to date has not been challenged in a \nmeaningful way. So there is no definitive finding of the \nconstitutionality of DOMA. Indeed, typically the first step when one \nseeks to pursue a constitutional remedy is to determine whether the \nstatutes are adequate. That has not been done.\n  Second, only one State in our Nation has recognized same-sex \nmarriage, and that decision has yet to impact other States.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues that now is not the time to play \npolitics in an election year with the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  I believe it is also important to note that the Founding Fathers in \ntheir wisdom established a Federal system of Government that \nintentionally left many critical issues to the control of State \nlegislatures and State courts. This system has served our Nation \nextremely well, and I fear this amendment, if adopted, would lead to a \nsuccession of proposals to federalize family law and to federalize \nother issues that have been the purview of States since the beginning \nof our country.\n  Also, it strikes me as a misplaced priority when it comes to all the \nother issues that face us today--issues of funding homeland security, \nissues pertaining to health care, issues that are affecting the lives \nof every family in the country--to be here today and debating a \nproposal that does not have the majority support of the American \npublic. In an ordinary time, debating any issue might be justified, but \nthis is not an ordinary time.\n  As we were reminded last week by Governor Ridge and Mr. Mueller of \nthe FBI, there are those who are plotting today to attack us in our \nhomeland, and yet here we are talking about the issue of a relationship \nbetween two consenting adults.\n  We have 30 days left on the majority leader's schedule, and \napparently we are going to spend our time on these types of divisive \nissues. That is not how I think we should properly spend our time. I \nthink we should commit ourselves to dealing with the issues that \npertain to every American family--issues of health care, issues of \nsecurity, both economic and international.\n  Today we are spending time on an amendment which will not pass, which \nis not supported by the majority of Americans, and which defers us and \ndeflects us from concentrating on the issues I think can help \nAmericans.\n  Finally, I know many of my constituents are gays and lesbians in \nlong-term relationships. While I myself believe civil unions are \nperhaps the best place to begin to publicly acknowledge these \nrelationships, I want to recognize that the impetus behind the push for \ngay marriage comes from a desire for security and serious, committed \nrelationships by many adult Americans.\n  In closing, let us heed the wisdom of our Founding Fathers. The \nStates are simply the correct place for the regulation of marriage, and \nthis kind of election-year politicking, which suggests an intolerance \ntoward many of our constituents and neighbors, is plain wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate I learned a new \naphorism, referring to the debates and sometimes repetitive arguments \nyou tend to hear by Members of Congress. Someone told me: ``Well, \neverything has been said; it is just not that everyone has had an \nopportunity to say it yet.''\n  Sometimes I wonder if that reflects the fact when we are debating \nimportant issues like this, people aren't listening or maybe they made \nup their minds and they are not open to the facts or persuasion or \nperhaps some preconceived notion they have about the motivation for \nlegislation is flat wrong, but they have already locked in, they have \nalready gone public, they have taken a position and then it becomes two \ncontending adversaries across some demilitarized zone and we try to \nfight it out the best we can and then count the votes.\n  But I think two things are most important about this debate. Despite \nsome of the repetition of erroneous arguments, we have had an important \ndebate. I think two things will come out of this that have been very \npositive, regardless of what happens in the vote today.\n  First, we have had a debate on the importance of traditional \nmarriage, the importance of the American family and steps we should be \ntaking in order to preserve the traditional marriage and American \nfamily and to work in the best interests of children. That is a debate \nthat has been long overdue. I am told it has been perhaps at least 8 \nyears, since the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act, since this \nbody has even talked about the most basic building block in our \nsociety. I think that has been very positive.\n  I also think it has been positive that we have been able to direct \nthe American people's attention to the erosion of our most fundamental \ninstitutions by judges who seek to enforce their personal political \nagendas under the guise of interpreting the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n\n  Now I come to the Senate and hear some of my colleagues, including \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, say this is all part of a right-wing \nconspiracy, or words to that effect. Surely, when the Defense of \nMarriage Act passed in 1996 by a vote of 85 Senators, an overwhelming \nbipartisan consensus which defined marriage as a union of a man and a \nwoman, that was not the product of a vast right-wing conspiracy. \nIndeed, that was the Senate and Congress functioning at its best, \ncoming together to protect the fundamental institution, one we have \nfought hard and should continue to fight hard to preserve and protect \nagainst all challenges.\n  We have heard and I have read in the press that this side of the \naisle has been castigated for not accepting the Democratic leader's \noffer to go to an up-or-down vote on this amendment. The problem is, of \ncourse, that they only tell half of the offer. The other part of the \noffer was banning consideration of any further amendments that might be \noffered in the Senate--in other words, constraining the debate, \nstifling the debate, and limiting the right of any Senator on any piece \nof legislation, whether it is a constitutional amendment or an ordinary \nbill, to offer alternatives for the body to consider as a means of \nadvancing the debate.\n  My understanding is the majority leader countered by saying, okay, we \nwill go to an up-or-down vote, but we are not going to limit our right \nto offer amendments. The amendment most talked about is the so-called \nSmith amendment, which is, lo and behold, the first sentence of the \namendment offered by Senator Allard hardly a surprise to anybody--which \nmerely defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle were apparently afraid to \nallow the Senate to consider alternatives as a way of advancing the \ndebate because they were afraid an alternative, perhaps along the lines \nof Senator Smith's amendment, the one-sentence amendment, would garner \nmore votes. I am advised it would garner perhaps as many as ten new \nvotes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will gladly yield after I complete my remarks.\n  It is a bogus offer. It is a bogus argument that somehow by refusing \ntheir attempt to stifle the debate and stifle the amendment process \nthat this has somehow become nothing but bare partisan politics.\n  There are those who would raise their voices, those who would call \nMembers names, Members who believe it is important to defend the \ntraditional institution of marriage, in hopes we would lose the courage \nof our convictions. In hopes that we would simply be silent while we \nsee the ongoing march of litigation as part of a national strategy to \nundermine the traditional institution of marriage that we know is the \nmost important stabilizing influence in our society and one that \nfunctions in the best interests of our children. But we are not going \nto lose the courage of our convictions. We are not doing to sit on the \nsidelines. We are not going to be quiet. We are not going to give up. \nIn fact, regardless of how this vote turns out at noon today, I know of \nno important piece of legislation considered by Congress that has been \nsuccessful the first time it has been introduced into the Senate.\n  What I have learned is probably the most important characteristic of \na Member of the Senate is someone who is willing to persevere over \nweeks and months and even years until ultimately they are able to see \nthe fruit of their labor and the legislation they have sponsored be \naccepted by the Senate. It is part of a building process, it is part of \nan awareness process that is very important.\n  Part of the awareness process is also to knock down some of the \nunfounded statements that are made during the course of the debate. It \nwas, I believe, the Senator from Massachusetts who said that no court \nhas called the Defense of Marriage Act into question. Perhaps he was \nnot able to listen yesterday when I read a paragraph out of the \nMassachusetts Supreme Court decision in Goodridge, relying on the case \nof Lawrence v. Texas, that plainly calls the constitutionality of the \nFederal Defense of Marriage Act into question. As a matter of fact, you \ncannot really believe, as the court did, that the marriage laws of \nMassachusetts were unconstitutional and believe that the Defense of \nMarriage Act is constitutional as well.\n\n  To be fair, the unconstitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act is \nan argument the Senator from Massachusetts made back in 1996 when he \nvoted against the Defense of Marriage Act, as did the other Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, who voted against the Defense of \nMarriage Act then and who stated that if passed, it would be \nunconstitutional. This has been a consistent theme, although they have \nsome of their facts wrong. I hope that helps clarify.\n  The question before the Senate today is simple: Do you believe \ntraditional marriage is important enough that it deserves full legal \nprotection? As I said, an overwhelming bipartisan consensus in 1996 \nvoted that it did by passing that statute. President Clinton said as \nmuch by signing that legislation into law in 1996.\n  This debate is important. It is long overdue because we have, in \nessence, a stealth operation going on today. It is an effort where a \nhandful of courts around the country, as well as those who have engaged \nin a nationwide litigation strategy, are basically operating off the \nradar screen of most Americans. The only time the American people know \nvery much about it is when a blockbuster decision is handed down, such \nas the Massachusetts Supreme Court in May of this year, or when they \nhappen to see local officials engaged in civil disobedience, for \nexample, in San Francisco, issuing same-sex marriage licenses and same-\nsex marriages in that location.\n  This is not, despite the wishes of some of the people who are opposed \nto this amendment, something that can be solved at the State level. I \nbelieve in the principle of federalism. I believe people at the local \nlevel, closest to the problem, are best prepared and are in the best \nposition to try to address that problem. But we have seen how, with one \nState recognizing same-sex marriage, people have moved now, we know, to \n46 different States and how there are lawsuits pending in at least 10 \nof those States--and no one knows how many there will be in the \nfuture--seeking to compel those States, in violation of their current \nState law, to recognize those same-sex marriages.\n  Some people have said, don't worry. The Senator from New York, \nSenator Clinton said, don't worry, we do not have to amend right now, \nwe can wait until after the Federal Defense of Marriage Act is held \nunconstitutional. In fact, she said no one had challenged it, and I \nhave attempted to clarify that by my earlier statements.\n  In the interest of completeness, let me ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the cover sheet from a lengthy petition in both \ncases, one filed in the Western District of Washington, in re Lee Kandu \nand Ann C. Kandu, and another complaint, Sullivan v. Bush, filed in \nFederal court, the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, \nseeking to hold the Federal Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional as \na matter of Federal law.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Washington\n\n       In re Lee Kandu and Ann C.

As explained below, \n     the government has failed to respond directly to the legal \n     issues presented by this case--issues never before considered \n     by this or (to the best of petitioner's knowledge) any other \n     court as to the proper construction and constitutionality of \n     the federal Defense of Marriage Act (``DOMA''). To the extent \n     that the government does touch on the issues presented by \n     this case, the government's arguments are based on outdated \n     case law and lack merit.\n\n\n                                argument\n\n     I.

It is also well settled that ``the regulation \n     of domestic relations has been left with the States and not \n     given to the national authority.'' Williams v.

Some have said there are more important issues to debate. \nCertainly, the Senate has debated and I hope and trust we have passed \nlegislation that has done a lot of good on behalf of the people who \nsent us here. If we haven't, we have not been doing our job. I believe \nwe have a record we can be proud of when it comes to defending America \nand the war on terrorism, when it comes to rejuvenating our economy to \nsee it come roaring back the way it has, indeed, providing a \nprescription drug benefit to senior citizens.\n\n  We have done a lot of which we can be very proud. And for someone to \nstand up and say that preservation of traditional marriage is not \nimportant enough for us to talk about, to me, is breathtaking in its \naudacity and its sense of obliviousness to what the concerns are of \nmoms and dads and families all across this country.\n  We know for years, for a variety of reasons, the American family has \nbeen increasingly marginalized. We know we have a crisis in this \ncountry of too many children being born outside of wedlock, too many \nmarriages ending in divorce, and too many children being raised in less \nthan optimal circumstances, putting them at risk for a whole host of \nsocial ills for which ultimately the American taxpayer has to pick up \nthe tab. And I have not even mentioned the human tragedy involved, as \nsome child fails to live up to their God-given potential.\n  I do not believe that we can remain neutral or to remain merely \nspectators in this further marginalization of the American family. We \ncannot allow for a process that puts more and more children at risk \nthrough a radical social experiment. And if we want to look for the \nonly evidence that we know is available, we can look to Scandinavia, \nwhere less people get married, more children are born out of wedlock, \nand more children become, thereby, the responsibility of the State.\n  It is not good for them, it is not good for us, and we should not, \nwithout letting the American people have a voice in the process, merely \nsit back while judges radically redefine our most basic societal \ninstitution.\n  Now, let me click through a number of other arguments that have been \nmade.\n  I know Senator Durbin has said we should not talk about \nconstitutional amendments during an election year. My question to him \nis: Isn't Congress still in session? Aren't the American taxpayers \nstill paying us to do our job? As a matter of fact, six times Congress \nhas successfully proposed amendments in an election year.\n  Some have claimed that the text that is before us--Senator Allard's \namendment--prevents States from enacting civil unions if they should \nwish to do so through their elected representatives. Yet the Democrats' \nown legal expert, Professor Cass Sunstein, answered this very question: \nOf course not. This amendment does not prevent the States from enacting \ncivil unions should they decide to do so.\n  Some have even gone so far as to claim that the Allard text would \nregulate private corporations, churches, and other private \norganizations. As the Presiding Officer well knows, and as virtually \neverybody in this body should know, the Constitution regulates State \nactors, not private actors. These arguments do not hold water. But they \ndo not have to work for our opponents on this issue to say them because \nthat is not the point. The point is, if you cannot convince them, \nconfuse them. Their aim is to distract the American people away from \nthe real question, which is, as I said at the outset: Do you believe \nthat traditional marriage is important enough that it deserves full \nprotection under law?\n  I would ask the opponents of this amendment, if you believe in \ntraditional marriage--as some of you but certainly not all of you have \nsaid you do--but you do not support this amendment, what is your plan? \nWhat do you think the American people should do when courts run red \nlights and act in excess of their authority by legislating from the \nbench, redefining our most basic institutions? What are you going to do \nto stand up on behalf of the American family to prevent the increasing \nmarginalization of the American family?\n  But I am confused by the arguments that are made by some on the other \nside of this issue. When some of their very own leaders say the Defense \nof Marriage Act is unconstitutional--such as Senator Kennedy, Senator \nKerry--when your very own leaders say, as the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts did yesterday, that traditional marriage is a ``stain on \nour laws''--repeating the language of the Massachusetts Supreme Court \nin saying that traditional marriage is a ``stain that must be \neradicated'' because it, in essence, represented discrimination--what \ndo the opponents of this amendment think we should do? Do you want the \ncourts to strike down traditional marriage? What you are saying is that \nyou do not want the American people to know about it, much less have a \nvoice in correcting this radical social experiment.\n\n  Of course, everyone has a right to file lawsuits. But the American \npeople have rights, too, rights preserved by Article V of the U.S. \nConstitution, which provides a process of amendment, particularly when \ncourts engage in a radical redefinition of our most basic institution \nunder the guise of interpreting the Constitution. Indeed, the only way \nthe American people have of responding is through a constitutional \namendment. So we have no choice but to offer this amendment by way of \nresponse.\n  I think no one should be fooled into thinking that on this side of \nthe aisle we are afraid of a full and fair debate and a vote on the \nvarious proposals that may come to the floor. But, indeed, under the \noffer made by the Democratic leader last Friday, it would have cut off \nany amendments, would have stifled a full debate, which I think has \nbeen on the whole very positive.\n  I appreciate my colleague for letting me finish my prepared remarks. \nI do not know if he still has a question, but I would be glad to \nrespond if he does.\n  Mr. CARPER. I do. I thank my colleague for yielding. There is a \nquestion I want to ask. But let my just say, first of all, I think you \nknow how much I respect you and the high regard I have for you and how \nmuch I enjoy working with you. We agree on a lot of things. And there \nare one or two things we do not agree on, and that is, I think, to be \nexpected.\n  The issue that you raised early in your remarks is one I want to come \nback to; and that is, the question of whether we should in some way \nhave an up-or-down vote on the amendment that is before us, or if there \nshould be opportunities for other colleagues, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to offer their own amendments to this underlying amendment.\n  I think the concern for our side is that we are mindful of the \npossibility of this not being just a debate, an opportunity to address \nwhether there should be a constitutional amendment as marriage being \nbetween a man and a woman, but an opportunity to consider other issues \nof a constitutional nature.\n  There are people on our side interested in amendments that deal with \ncampaign finance, in restricting money spent on campaigns. That is one \nexample.\n  As a Member of the House, when I served with Senator Santorum over \nthere, we were great proponents of something called a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution, not one that mandated a balanced budget, \nbut one that said: Shouldn't the President be required to propose a \nbalanced\n\n[[Page S8064]]\n\nbudget? And shouldn't we make it a little more difficult for the \nCongress to unbalance that budget?\n  There are a number of constitutional amendments that are floating out \nthere on your side and on our side. Here is my question.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would be glad to respond to my \ncolleague's question, but I first ask unanimous consent that the time \nengaged in question and answer be charged to the other side, in \nfairness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARPER. I will not object.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. I just ask that the response come out of your time.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would be glad to respond to that because I think that \nis an important issue. No one has suggested we should not make this \ndiscussion about preserving traditional marriage. I would say there was \nno attempt to try to limit any debate, any amendments that might be \noffered--for example, the single-sentence amendment, which is the first \nsentence of Senator Allard's amendment--to amendments that are germane \nto the preservation of traditional marriage.\n\n  So I must say that while I respect my colleague--and he knows that, \nand, as he said, there are many things we agree on--I simply disagree \nthat our refusal to take the offer that would allow no amendments, \nwhether or not they are germane to the issue of traditional marriage, \nin no way opens this matter up to non-germane or extraneous amendments.\n  I would be pleased--at least speaking personally; of course, any \nSenator could lodge an objection to the unanimous consent request--for \nus to stay on the subject because I think this has been a very helpful \ndebate.\n  I would also ask unanimous consent that a letter to Ms. Margaret A. \nGallagher dated July 11, 2004, and a letter from the Liberty Counsel \ndated July 10, 2004, be printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   The Becket Fund\n\n\n                                        for Religious Liberty,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2004.\n     Ms. Margaret A. Gallagher,\n     President, Institute for Marriage and Public Policy, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Gallagher: Your Institute and others have asked us \n     to examine whether the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment \n     (``FMA'') would violate the principle of religious liberty. \n     In particular, you have first asked whether the FMA would \n     reach private action in light of the fact that the FMA \n     contains no express provision limiting its reach to state \n     action only. Second, you have asked us to consider what the \n     practical consequences for religious liberty would be should \n     the FMA become law. That is, you have asked us whether it \n     will trigger a ``witch hunt'' against religious organizations \n     and individuals that choose to conduct or participate in \n     religious ceremonies which they refer to as weddings.\n       You have provided us with an opinion letter by David Remes \n     (the ``Remes Letter'') which answers both questions in the \n     affirmative. Our strong belief is that the Remes Letter is \n     mistaken on both counts. The FMA would not reach private \n     action, and the parade of horribles it posits is unlikely in \n     the extreme.\\1\\\n       At the outset we wish to emphasize that the Becket Fund is \n     a nonpartisan, interfaith, public-interest law firm that \n     protects the free expression of all religious traditions. We \n     have represented religious congregations that have come down \n     on both sides of the debate over the FMA. We have for example \n     represented Unitarians, who do not support the FMA, and more \n     conservative congregations who do. We have represented a wide \n     assortment of faiths, including a variety of Jewish and \n     Christian congregations, Buddhists, Muslims, Native \n     Americans, Sikhs, Hindus, and Zoroastrians, whose views on \n     the FMA are unknown to us. We have also represented religious \n     congregations who take opposing positions on the moral issue \n     of homosexual behavior itself. We have on the one hand \n     represented congregations that condemn not only gay marriage \n     but also gay sex, and on the other, at least one congregation \n     (the Come As You Are Fellowship in Reidsville, Georgia) that \n     openly welcomes gays. Had we concluded that the FMA would \n     violate the principle of religious liberty we would have been \n     at the forefront of the effort against it. We have, however, \n     concluded otherwise.\n\n\n      The Federal Marriage Amendment Will Not Reach Private Action\n\n       The Remes Letter argues that the FMA ``by its own terms'' \n     reaches private action. The Remes Letter concludes this \n     simply from the fact that the FMA does not state otherwise. \n     But more than 100 years ago the Supreme Court settled the \n     point that constitutional provisions that do not facially \n     restrict themselves to state action cannot be assumed to \n     reach private action. In United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. \n     542 (1875), the United States attempted to prosecute one \n     group of private citizens for ``banding and conspiring'' \n     together to deprive another group of citizens of, among other \n     things, the ``right to keep and bear arms for a lawful \n     purpose.'' Id., 92 U.S. at 545. The government's indictment \n     was based on the argument made by the Remes Letter--because \n     the Second Amendment did not limit itself facially to state \n     action, but simply stated that ``[a] well regulated Militia \n     being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of \n     the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed[,]'' \n     private actors could be indicted for attempting to deprive \n     others of those rights. U.S. Const. amend. II; Cruikshank at \n     548. The Supreme Court rejected that reasoning out of hand: \n     ``The second amendment declares that it shall not be \n     infringed; but this, as has been seen, means no more than \n     that it shall not be infringed by Congress. This is one of \n     the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the \n     powers of the national government, leaving the people to look \n     [to the state police power] for their protection against any \n     violation by their fellow-citizens of the rights it \n     recognizes.''--United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. at 553. \n     Had the Court ruled otherwise and applied to the Second \n     Amendment the strained interpretation that the Remes Letter \n     applies to the FMA, much mischief would have resulted. \n     Churches, synagogues, and mosques for example, could not \n     prevent persons from wearing firearms on the premises without \n     thereby violating the Constitution.\n       The Remes Letter theory, if true, would lead to equally \n     strange interpretations of other Amendments. The Third \n     Amendment, which prohibits the quartering of troops in \n     private homes during time of peace without the consent of the \n     owner--but which does not explicitly limit its scope to state \n     action--would make it unconstitutional for a tenant to \n     sublease his apartment to a military officer whom his \n     landlord found objectionable. Every petty theft would \n     constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment because that \n     Amendment does not explicitly limit its condemnation of \n     unreasonable seizures to state actors. Excessive spanking \n     would arguably violate not only child abuse laws but the \n     constitution itself, because it might be construed to be \n     cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, \n     which also does not expressly limit its scope to state \n     action. None of these examples are the law, precisely because \n     it has long been settled that constitutional provisions that \n     do not expressly limit themselves to state action \n     nevertheless do not ordinarily reach private action.\\2\\\n       The sole exception--and curiously the only example the \n     Remes Letter cites--is the Thirteenth Amendment, which bans \n     slavery. To remove that evil root and branch, it was \n     necessary to take the extraordinary step of a constitutional \n     provision that reached both public and private action. See, \n     e.g., United States v. Nelson, 277 F.3d 164, 175 (2d. Cir. \n     2002) (history shows that unlike other amendments, the \n     Thirteenth Amendment ``eliminates slavery and involuntary \n     servitude generally, and without any reference to the source \n     of the imposition of slavery or servitude'' and therefore \n     ``reaches purely private conduct.'' (emphasis added)).\\3\\\n       By contrast, to achieve the FMA's objective, it is not \n     necessary to reach private action. The FMA is occasioned by \n     the interplay among state court decisions requiring that \n     civil marriage be available to same-sex couples and the Full \n     Faith and Credit Clause of the federal constitution. That \n     Clause requires in general that civil marriages performed in \n     one state be recognized in all other states. Thus, without \n     the FMA, the argument goes, same-sex couples civilly married \n     in Massachusetts must be considered civilly married in Alaska \n     as well. However, the Full Faith and Credit Clause simply \n     does not apply to purely religious ceremonies. Unlike \n     uprooting slavery, therefore, preventing civil same-sex \n     marriage from spreading via the Full Faith and Credit Clause \n     does not require reaching private action. The general rule of \n     the Second, Third, Fourth, and Eighth Amendments therefore \n     applies, and not the exception of the Thirteenth.\n       Put differently, the historical context of the FMA informs \n     its construction, just as the historical context of the \n     adoption of the Bill of Rights informs construction of the \n     Second, Third, Fourth, and Eighth Amendments, and the Civil \n     War and Reconstruction provide the historical context that \n     informs construction of the Thirteenth Amendment. Indeed, the \n     FMA refers in its second sentence to state and federal \n     constitutions--an unmistakable allusion to the actions of the \n     Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in Goodridge v. \n     Department of Public Health, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003) and \n     other courts which have engendered the confusion to which the \n     FMA is addressed.\n       In sum, it strikes us as past fanciful that courts \n     construing the FMA would abandon the general rule adhered to \n     in the Second, Third, Fourth and Eighth Amendments, and grasp \n     at the exception of the Thirteenth. The FMA thus causes us no \n     anxiety for the religious liberty of those of our clients who \n     might wish to conduct ceremonies for gay couples.\n\n\n  The FMA Will Protect Religious Liberty More Than It Will Threaten It\n\n       We next examine the Remes Letter's suggestion that should \n     the FMA become law, it\n\n[[Page S8065]]\n\n     would occasion a witch hunt against those congregations and \n     individuals who might seek to hold or participate in \n     religious ceremonies for gay couples. The short answer to \n     this fear is that the FMA does nothing but restore the status \n     quo that has until very recently obtained in all 50 states \n     since the Founding. We are aware of no such witch hunt ever \n     being conducted against Unitarians or other groups who \n     support same-sex marriage, whose tax exemptions seem to us as \n     secure today as they ever have been. In those instances \n     (overlooked by the Remes Letter) where same-sex marriage \n     ceremonies have become the subject of litigation, the \n     prosecutors have been clear that the crucial distinction lies \n     between a purely religious ceremony, which the law will not \n     disturb, and those ceremonies that purport to invoke state \n     law and confer state benefits (``By the authority vested in \n     me . . . .''), which would be illegal. See Thomas Crampton, \n     Two Ministers are Charged in Gay Nuptials, N.Y. Times, March \n     16, 2004, at B1 (charges based on fact that ministers ``have \n     publicly proclaimed their intent to perform civil marriages \n     under the authority vested in them by New York state law, \n     rather than performing purely religious ceremonies.'') \\4\\ \n     That seems to us to be the appropriate line to draw.\n       By contrast, in the short time since the Massachusetts \n     Supreme Judicial Court handed down Goodridge, ordering gay \n     marriage in the Commonwealth, a large number of serious \n     questions have emerged about the rights of religious \n     organizations who are conscientious objectors to that ruling. \n     For example, Catholic colleges and universities there have \n     started examining whether the schools must now provide \n     married student housing to legally married gay couples.\\5\\ \n     Similarly, religious employers that provide health and \n     retirement benefits to the spouses of married employees may \n     risk liability for withholding those benefits from same-sex \n     spouses.\n       On top of these liability risks, resisting churches are \n     more likely to face selective exclusion from public \n     facilities, public funding streams, and other government \n     benefits. The Boy Scouts, whose right to exclude openly gay \n     scouts from leadership was confirmed in Boy Scouts of America \n     v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640 (2000), have been the target of state \n     and local governments who have sought to exclude the Scouts \n     from public benefits they have long enjoyed. Throughout \n     Connecticut, for example, the Boy Scouts were denied \n     participation in the state's payroll deduction charitable \n     giving program. See Boy Scouts v. Wyman, 335 F.3d 80 (2d Cir. \n     2003). Similarly, the New York City Council recently passed a \n     law to exclude any contractor from doing more than $100,000 \n     worth of business with the City, if the contractor refuses to \n     extend health benefits to same-sex domestic partners. As a \n     result of their religious convictions, groups like the \n     Salvation Army--which has provided the City with millions of \n     dollars in contract services for the needy--will be excluded \n     from participation in government contracts. Such sanctions \n     can only be expected to increase under a regime of same-sex \n     marriage.\n       Moreover, the Goodridge decision is having an impact on \n     individuals as well. One Massachusetts Justice of the Peace \n     has already resigned, because she could not perform same-sex \n     marriages in good conscience and Massachusetts refuses to \n     provide an opt-out for conscientious objectors. Thus we are \n     concerned that, whatever religious liberty problems there \n     might be at the margins should the FMA become law, there will \n     be far more problems if it does not.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, it is our opinion that the \n     FMA would not reach private action and would sufficiently \n     protect religious liberty from unwarranted state intrusion.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Kevin J.

United States, 389 U.S. 347, 350 n.5 \n     (1967) (``The Third Amendment's prohibition against the \n     unconsented peacetime quartering of soldiers protects another \n     aspect of privacy from governmental intrusion.''

When read in \n     conjunction with a July 2, 2004 letter we prepared concerning \n     the legal attacks being waged against marriage in the \n     courtrooms, it becomes clear that the federal marriage \n     amendment must pass.\\1\\\n       In an effort to provide a ready reference to the arguments \n     raised in the Covington Memo, we will address each of their \n     arguments in order. Contrary to the conclusions reached in \n     the Covington Memo, the Federal Marriage Amendment \n     (``FMA'') preserves marriage as the union of one man and \n     one woman in a way that is consistent with constitutional \n     jurisprudence and federalism. Accordingly, in the first \n     section of this letter, we rebut the argument that ``The \n     FMA is Ambiguous and Self-Contradictory.'' The second \n     section exposes the intellectual dishonesty in the \n     argument that ``The FMA Would Threaten Private Recognition \n     of Marriage of Same-Sex Couples, Even By Religious \n     Bodies.'' The third and fourth sections reveal the \n     analytical error in the arguments that ``The FMA Displaces \n     Democratic Decision-making'' and the ``The FMA is \n     Inconsistent with Principles of Federalism.'' The fifth \n     section addresses the argument that ``The FMA Would \n     Constrain All Three Branches of Government.'' The final \n     section discusses the current legal battles taking place, \n     which undermines the argument, that ``The FMA Would \n     Precipitate Continuing Struggle.''\n\n\n         I. the two sentences in the current fma are consistent\n\n       The two sentences in the current FMA are consistent with \n     each other. The current FMA provides that ``Marriage in the \n     United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a \n     woman. Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.''\n       The first sentence is a broad declaration that marriage \n     throughout the country is limited to a union of one man and \n     one woman. It also acts as a broad prohibition on conferring \n     the legal status of marriage on any relationship other than \n     that of a man and a woman. The second sentence reinforces the \n     first sentence. It reinforces the first by expressly stating \n     that neither the U.S. Constitution nor a state constitution \n     may be construed to require same-sex marriage. The decision \n     in Goodridge v. Department of Health, 440 Mass:. 309, 798 \n     N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003), exemplifies the necessity of that \n     portion of the second sentence.\n       In Goodridge, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court \n     (``SJC'') stated that ``[t]he everyday meaning of `marriage' \n     is `the legal union of a man and woman as husband and wife,' \n     and the plaintiffs do not argue that the term `marriage' has \n     ever had a different meaning under Massachusetts law.'' Id. \n     at 319.\\2\\ However, the SJC reformulated ``marriage'' to mean \n     the ``union of two persons.'' Significantly, under the \n     Massachusetts constitution, the SJC was without authority to \n     redefine the indisputable understanding of marriage from the \n     ``union of a man and a woman'' to the ``union of two \n     persons.'' See Opinion of the Justices to the Senate, 324 \n     Mass. 746, 85 N.E.2d 761 (1949) (unambiguous words in the \n     constitution must be interpreted according to their meaning \n     at the time they were added to the constitution). \n     Nevertheless, four of the seven judges held that it would \n     ``construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two \n     persons as spouses, to the exclusion of marriage.'' \n     Goodridge, 440 Mass. at 343.\\3\\\n       The second sentence of FMA makes clear, for those looking \n     for wiggle room in the language of the first sentence, that \n     the FMA prohibits a repeat of the Goodridge decision. While \n     the Covington Memo describes the first part of the second \n     sentence as inconsistent with the first sentence, the level \n     of judicial activism currently taking place across the \n     country mandates a clear expression that marriage at the \n     state and federal level is limited to the union of a man and \n     a woman. The second sentence closes the door to any argument \n     that the first sentence applies only to rights arising under \n     the federal constitution, and therefore allows courts and \n     legislatures to permit same-sex marriage under their state \n     constitutions. This is particularly necessary given the fact \n     that in the state marriage cases, those challenging the \n     marriage laws as unconstitutional rely heavily on the \n     argument that state constitutions grant broader individual \n     rights than the federal constitution. See Covington Memo at 5 \n     (``state courts are absolutely free to interpret state \n     constitutional provisions to afford greater protections to \n     individual rights than do similar provisions of the United \n     states Constitution''). Whether or not a state constitution \n     affords broader individual rights, the FMA reserves marriage \n     in all fifty states as the union of one man and one woman.\n       The second sentence also prohibits a repeat the Baker v. \n     State, 744 A.2d 864 (Vt. 1999) decision by the Vermont \n     Supreme Court. In\n\n[[Page S8066]]\n\n     that case, the court construed the state constitution to \n     require the state to grant the same legal incidents of \n     marriage to same-sex couples as are granted to marriages \n     entered into by a man and a woman. After passage of the FMA, \n     no court could render such a decision.\\4\\ The two sentences \n     of the FMA accomplish the same purpose--to reserve marriage \n     for a union of a man and a woman. The two sentences are \n     consistent.\n\n\nii. the fma does not reach private conduct nor does it threaten private \n                 recognition of same-sex relationships\n\n       The FMA does not reach private action nor does it prohibit \n     private recognition of same-sex relationships. Marriage is a \n     unique institution with a distinct definition and with \n     distinct requirements for entry into the relationship. Two \n     individuals may not simply declare themselves married and \n     thus obtain the legal status of marriage. In all fifty \n     states, a marriage may only be entered into with state \n     sanction and approval.\n       A private religious group may conduct a religious ceremony \n     to ``unite'' two persons of the same-sex, but such a union is \n     not a marriage for legal purposes. Marriage is a public legal \n     status. See Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190, 205 (1888) \n     (marriage is the ``most important union in life, having \n     more to do with morals and civilization of a people than \n     any other institution'' and its status is conferred by the \n     legislature); see also Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 7 \n     (1967) (stating, ``[M]arriage is a social relation subject \n     to the State's police power.'').\n       The Covington Memo argues that the FMA would be interpreted \n     as the Thirteenth Amendment (regarding slavery) has been \n     interpreted to prohibit private conduct. The Thirteenth \n     Amendment is distinguishable from the FMA. Unlike marriage \n     slavery does not require a state sanction--it is a purely \n     private relationship. Because slavery may exist without state \n     sanction or recognition, the Thirteenth Amendment applies to \n     private conduct. Marriage, in contrast, cannot exist without \n     government sanction. The FMA does not reach private conduct, \n     nor would it regulate private ceremonies. A ceremony \n     conducted by a private group is merely ceremonial or \n     symbolic, not legal. The Second, Fourth, Fifth and Eighth \n     Amendments are not limited by their text to state action, but \n     it is clear they apply only to state action.\n       A thirteen-year-old child may not make a ``driver's \n     license'' on a home computer and then protest when stopped by \n     the police for driving without a license. Because the \n     thirteen-year-old may not legally drive does not mean that \n     private acts of playing driver off the public highways or \n     creating a ``license'' for non-legal purposes are prohibited. \n     However, if this person used the fake license to obtain \n     access to a bar, then that action would come within the law. \n     In the same way, it is impossible for a same-sex couple to \n     conduct a private religious ceremony that legally results in \n     marriage, and therefore, the FMA doesn't apply to the private \n     action or ceremonies.\n       The FMA cannot ``punish'' religious organization:; that \n     conduct ceremonies recognizing same-sex relationships. Nor \n     would the FMA deny government funds to religious groups or \n     deny charitable tax status to those organizations. The FMA \n     also does not apply to private employment agreements \n     providing health insurance to same-sex couples or other \n     private contractual rights.\\5\\ The FMA simply does not apply \n     to private conduct.\n\n\n iii. the fma represents the very essence of democratic decision-making\n\n       The Covington Memo argues that the FMA would displace \n     democratic decision-making. The argument seems to be that the \n     FMA would usurp the power of the people to decide for \n     themselves whether to allow same-sex marriage. In fact, the \n     FMA, and the amendment process, represents the very essence \n     of democratic decision-making. The people of the United \n     States have the right to amend their Constitution. Once the \n     FMA is passed through the Senate and the House, 38 states \n     must ratify the amendment. It is the people, acting through \n     their elected representatives, who have the right to amend \n     the United States Constitution. This act represents the \n     democratic process at its apex.\n       The Covington Memo also cites Justice Scalia's dissent in \n     United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 566 (1996) for the \n     proposition that amending the Constitution prohibits the \n     people from changing their perceptions and opinions. This \n     argument demonstrates a lack of understanding of the \n     democratic process. Moreover, the statement by Justice Scalia \n     is taken out of context and twisted to mean something he did \n     not say.\\6\\ Justice Scalia dissented from the Supreme Court \n     removing of the debate from the public over whether women \n     should be admitted to military schools.\n       Instead of supporting the position of the opponents of the \n     FMA, Justice Scalia's dissent supports the position of the \n     FMA's supporters. The FMA puts the debate right where it \n     should be--with the people and their elected representatives. \n     The FMA represents the highest and best of the democratic \n     decision-making process.\\7\\\n\n\n      iv. the fma is consistent with the principles of federalism\n\n       Marriage has always been a national policy between one man \n     and one woman. Utah's battle over polygamy is instructive. In \n     1862, the United States Congress passed the Morril Act, which \n     prohibited polygamy in the territories, disincorporated the \n     Mormon church, and restricted the church's ownership of \n     property. See Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ \n     of Latter-Day Saints v. United States, 136 U.S. 1, 19 (1890). \n     In Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145 (1878), the Supreme \n     Court upheld the Morril Act, stating that polygamy has always \n     been ``odious'' among the Northern and Western nations of \n     Europe, and from ``the earliest history of England polygamy \n     has been treated as an offense against society.'' Id. at 164. \n     The court noted ``it is within the legitimate scope of the \n     power of every civil government to determine whether polygamy \n     or monogamy shall be the law of social life under its \n     dominion.'' Id. at 166. To further the national policy of one \n     man and one woman, Congress passed the Edmunds Act in \n     1882, and later passed the Edmunds-Tucker Bill in 1887. \n     See Late Corporation of the Church, 136 U.S. at 19. See \n     also Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333 (1890).\n       As a condition to be admitted to the Union, Congress \n     required the inclusion of anti-polygamy provisions in the \n     constitutions of Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah. See \n     Arizona Enabling Act, 36 Stat. 569; New Mexico Enabling Act, \n     36 Stat. 558; Oklahoma Enabling Act, 34 Stat. 269; Utah \n     Enabling Act, 28 Stat. 108. See also Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 \n     U.S. 15 (1885). For Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, the \n     Enabling Acts permitting these states to be admitted to the \n     Union required that the anti-polygamy provisions be \n     ``irrevocable,'' and that in order to change their laws to \n     allow polygamy, each state would have to persuade the entire \n     country to change the marriage laws. See Romer v. Evans, 517 \n     U.S. 620, 648-49 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Idaho \n     adopted the constitutional provision on its own, and the 51st \n     Congress, which admitted Idaho into the Union, found its \n     constitution to be ``republican in form and . . . in \n     conformity with the Constitution of the United States.'' Act \n     of Admission of Idaho, 26 Stat. 21.5. To this day, Arizona, \n     Idaho, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah state in their \n     constitutions that polygamy is ``forever prohibited.'' See \n     Ariz. Const. art. XX, para. 2; Idaho Const. art. I, Sec. 4; \n     N.M. Const. art. XXI, Sec. 1; Okla. Const. art. I, Sec. 2; \n     Utah Const. art. III, Sec. 1.\n       When commenting on the national policy of marriage as the \n     union of one man and one woman, the Supreme Court declared \n     the following: ``[C]ertainly no legislation can be supposed \n     more wholesome and necessary in the founding of a free, self-\n     governing commonwealth, fit to take rank as one of the co-\n     ordinate States of the Union, than that which seeks to \n     establish it on the basis of the idea of the family, as \n     consisting in and springing from the union for life of one \n     man and one woman in the holy estate of matrimony; the sure \n     foundation of all that is stable and noble in our \n     civilization; the best guaranty of that reverent morality \n     which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and \n     political improvement.''--Murphy, 114 U.S. at 45.\n       The national ban on polygamy, or put another way, the \n     national policy of marriage between one man and one woman, is \n     enforced in many ways. A juror who has a conscientious belief \n     that polygamy is right may be challenged for cause in a trial \n     for polygamy, and anyone who practices polygamy is ineligible \n     to immigrate to the United States. See Witherspoon v. \n     Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 536 (1968) (citing Reynolds, 98 U.S. \n     at 147, 157); 8.U.S.C. Sec. 1182(A). That is to say, a \n     polygamous relationship recognized in a foreign jurisdiction \n     will not be legally recognized in the United States.\\8\\\n       Although states have traditionally regulated the edges of \n     marriage (divorce, alimony, support, custody and visitation), \n     they have historically never regulated or altered the essence \n     of marriage (the union of one man and one woman). The recent \n     exception is Massachusetts, and the act by that court now \n     threatens the rest of the nation on this central issue of \n     marriage. The FMA merely carries forward the longstanding \n     national policy that marriage is the union of one man and one \n     woman, and thus is consistent with the history of marriage in \n     this country.\n\n\nV. THE FMA CONTINUES THE NATIONAL POLICY OF MARRIAGE AS ONE MAN AND ONE \n                 WOMAN AMONG ALL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT\n\n       The FMA is designed to maintain the historic status quo \n     regarding marriage as the union of one man and one woman. \n     This core marriage policy therefore applies to all branches \n     of government. If the Executive, Legislative or Judicial \n     branch sought to order, enact or decree same-sex marriage, \n     the FMA would prohibit such action. However, the FMA does not \n     prohibit the legislature from extending legal protection or \n     benefits to same-sex couples.\n       The argument in the Covington Memo that opines the FMA \n     would tell a state court how to interpret its constitution is \n     undercut by the admission contained in the same paragraph. \n     The memo concedes that ``a state constitution may not permit \n     something that an otherwise valid federal law forbids. . . \n     .'' Our constitutional form of government has never permitted \n     states to interpret their constitutions in a manner that \n     conflicts with the federal constitution. The United States \n     Constitution obviously preempts any state law to the \n     contrary. See Good News Club v. Milford Central Sch., 533 \n     U.S. 98, 107 n.2 (2001) (contrary state law must yield to the \n     United States Constitution); Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 \n     (1996) (contrary state constitutional provision must yield to \n     the United States Constitution); Falwell v. Miller, 203 F. \n     Supp. 2d 624 (W.D. Va. 2002) (same). The FMA is consistent \n     with constitutional jurisprudence.\n\n[[Page S8067]]\n\n          VI. THE FMA WOULD DECREASE LITIGATION OVER MARRIAGE\n\n       The FMA would limit the judicial chaos that is currently \n     escalating throughout the country.\\9\\ There are currently \n     about 40 separate court challenges over same-sex marriage \n     pending, most of which began since February 12, 2004, the day \n     San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom issued licenses to same-sex \n     couples. This number increases daily. Two more suits were \n     filed July 12 in Florida, where three other suits were filed \n     within the past several weeks. The suits throughout the \n     country have one thing in common--a claim that the state and \n     federal constitution require a state to permit two people of \n     the same sex to marry.\\10\\ The FMA would ensure the \n     maintenance of the longstanding national policy; of marriage \n     as the union of one man and one woman. The FMA is designed to \n     bring order and stability to the marriage union and thus to \n     halt the current litigation frenzy.\n\n\n                            VII. CONCLUSION\n\n       The FMA preserves marriage as the union of one man and one \n     woman, and places the decision on this important matter with \n     the people. Passage of the FMA is the only way to protect \n     marriage and it is entirely consistent with constitutional \n     jurisprudence and federalism.\n     Mathew D. Staver, Esq.,\n       President and General Counsel, Liberty Counsel.\n     Rena Lindevaldsen, Esq.,\n       Senior Litigation Counsel, Liberty Counsel.\n     Erik Stanley, Esq.,\n       Chief Counsel Liberty Counsel.\n     Anita L. Staver, Esq.,\n       Litigation Counsel, Liberty Counsel.\n     FOOTNOTES\n     \\1\\ The July 2 letter discusses in great detail the 33 \n     lawsuits taking place in 12 states--with lawsuits in 9 of \n     those states commenced since February 12, 2004, when San \n     Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom began issuing certificates to \n     same-sex couples. In many cases, the most shocking aspect is \n     the willingness of some judges to abdicate their role as \n     judge to become legislator, and the willingness of some state \n     attorney generals to abdicate their role as law enforcement \n     officials to become political activists. Without question, \n     there is a culture-changing debate taking place in this \n     country, but it is not taking place in the state legislatures \n     where elected representatives can debate the issue. Instead, \n     the battle is in the courtrooms of America. Although the fact \n     that courts, and not legislators, have been the ones making \n     the laws granting same-sex couples legal benefits is itself \n     shocking. The disturbing reality is that those who believe \n     marriage should be limited to the union of one man and one \n     woman are frequently not allowed to participate in the \n     courtroom battles. Instead, those who support traditional \n     marriage are often kept out of the litigation by courts, \n     state attorney generals, and the homosexual advocacy \n     organizations on the erroneous theory that same-sex marriage \n     does not concern them and will not harm marriage or the \n     country. Thus, some courts are rushing ahead without the \n     opportunity for debate, dialogue, and with absolutely no \n     evidence concerning the impact same-sex marriage would have \n     on the culture.\n     \\2\\ The word ``marriage'' appears in the Massachusetts \n     constitution in the only section that places an express \n     restriction on the authority of the judiciary.\n     \\3\\ A federal lawsuit challenging the Goodridge decision as \n     violating the federal guarantee of a republican form of \n     government--i.e., the court usurped the powers of the \n     legislature--was unsuccessful before the First Circuit Court \n     of Appeals. The Court of Appeals held that absent extreme \n     cases, such as abolishing the Legislature or creating a \n     monarchy, there is no violation of the federal Guarantee \n     Clause. See Largess v. Supreme Judicial Court for State of \n     Massachusetts, 2004 WL 1453033, 1st Cir. (Mass.).\n     \\4\\ That which a legislative body ``may'' enact on its own is \n     far different than being ``required'' to act pursuant to a \n     court mandate.\n     \\5\\ The Covington Memo cites the case of Shahar v. Bowers, \n     114 F. 3d 1097 (11th Cir. 1997) in support of its argument \n     that the FMA would apply to private conduct. This case \n     suggests nothing of the sort. In Shahar, the Attorney General \n     of Georgia withdrew a job offer from an attorney who had \n     participated in a same-sex ``marriage'' ceremony. Absent the \n     FMA, an Attorney General would prevail when choosing to hire \n     or retain staff attorneys. The government as an employer is \n     given great deference in hiring/firing under the application \n     of the Pickering balancing test used in Shahar. The FMA would \n     change nothing with regard to how employees are treated. The \n     statement that people could be ``punished'' under the FMA for \n     private ceremonies cannot be supported by the facts of \n     Shahar--the fact is that the employee was not ``punished'' \n     for entering into a ``same-sex'' marriage. It was a well-\n     publicized, controversial ceremony that was attended by \n     people in the department. Id. at 1101. The revelation that \n     she was ``marrying'' a woman ``caused quite a stir'' in the \n     office, causing staff attorneys to wonder about the \n     employee's decision-making ability under the facts of the \n     case. Id. at 1105-06.\n     \\6\\ In fact, one need look no further than the Constitution \n     itself to recognize the absurdity of this argument. The \n     Eighteenth Amendment was ratified in 1919 to prohibit the \n     ``manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating \n     liquors. . . .'' However, fourteen years later, the people \n     ratified the Twenty-first Amendment that repealed the ban on \n     liquor. Even a Constitutional Amendment may be changed over \n     time by another Constitutional Amendment.\n     \\7\\ To the extent that the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and \n     Fifteenth Amendments violated federalism, the states \n     consented to this act by the passage of these amendments.\n     \\8\\ If same-sex marriage were sanctioned it would be \n     virtually impossible to ban polygamy. When Tom Green was put \n     on trial for polygamy in Utah in 2001, several articles and \n     editorials appeared in various newspapers supporting the \n     practice of polygamy (The Village Voice, Washington Times, \n     Chicago Tribune, and the New York Times). Although the ACLU \n     initially tried to minimize the idea of the slippery slope \n     between gay marriage and polygamy, the ACLU itself defended \n     Tom Green during his trial and declared its support for the \n     repeal of all ``laws prohibiting or penalizing the practice \n     of plural marriage.'' Polyamory (group marriage) is also an \n     inevitable consequence of sanctioning gender-blind marriage. \n     See Deborah Anapol, Polyamory: The New Love Without Limits. \n     Paula Ettelbrick, former legal director for Lambda Legal \n     Defense and Education Fund, supports same-sex marriage and \n     state-sanctioned polyamory. Ettelbrick teaches law at the \n     University of Michigan, New York University, Barnard and \n     Columbia. A number of other law professors similarly promote \n     polyamory, including Nancy Polikoff at American University, \n     Martha Fineman at Cornell University, Martha Ertman at the \n     University of Utah, Judith Stacey, the Barbara Streisand \n     Professor of Contemporary Gender Studies at the University of \n     Southern California, and David Chambers at the University of \n     Michigan.\n     \\9\\ The Civil Rights Act of 1964 began an explosion of \n     litigation. A current search on Westlaw for only the \n     employment provision section of the Act (Title VII) reveals \n     10,000 federal cases, which is the maximum number of cases \n     Westlaw can retrieve. All of the federal and state cases \n     would amount to several tens of thousands of cases. However, \n     the fact that the Civil Rights Act spawned litigation is not \n     sufficient reason to refrain from passing the Act. In the \n     case of the FMA, the litigation is sure to decrease.\n     \\10\\ One Utah case argues that polygamous marriage should be \n     permitted.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, on the Fourth of July, as many of my \ncolleagues, I covered my State, and, as I have done for many years on \nthe Fourth of July, I ended up in Dover, DE. Dover, DE, on the evening \nof July 4 is a politician's dream. People have had a full day of \nparades and family gatherings, community gatherings. We are there to \nawait the fireworks when dusk finally comes. Roughly 10,000 people \ngathered in front of Legislative Hall, a huge American flag that almost \nmasked Legislative Hall in its majesty, a C-5 aircraft soon to fly \noverhead, and then the fireworks themselves.\n  I work the crowd at that gathering, and it is a lot of fun. People \nare in a good mood, a lot of good-natured kidding going on: Are you \nrunning for anything this year? No, I am not, I am just here because I \nlove being in Dover on the evening of the Fourth of July.\n  There was one serious question, at least one that was raised to me \nthat evening. The question was: How are you going to vote on that \namendment on gay marriage? In responding to that question, I pointed to \nLegislative Hall and I said to the questioner: When I was Governor of \nthis State in 1996, I signed into law our own Defense of Marriage Act \nthat said marriage is between a man and a woman. I believed that then. \nI believe it now.\n  Later that evening I addressed the crowd, and I alluded to the \nDeclaration of Independence. But I spoke more about the Constitution, a \ncopy of which I hold. The Constitution of the United States was first \nratified in Delaware. I told the crowd that night that the Constitution \nwas ratified in the Golden Fleece Tavern about 300 or 400 yards from \nwhere we gathered.\n  We all know the Constitution does a number of things. It establishes \na framework of government. It says, this is how our Government is going \nto work. We will have three branches of Government: a legislative, \nexecutive, and a judicial branch. It says, there are certain things the \nFederal Government should be doing and certain responsibilities that \nare left to the States.\n  Among the responsibilities left to the States in this Constitution \nare matters of family law: Who can marry, how do we divorce, how do we \nend those marriages, who gains custody of the children, how about \nvisitation rights, matters of alimony, property settlement, and the \nlike. Those are matters that we have left to the States for over 200 \nyears.\n  Senator Cornyn mentioned the concern he has over the state of \nmarriage. I share it. Half the marriages in our country today end in \ndivorce. Too many kids grow up in families where nobody ever marries, \nand families are not invested enough in their children.\n  I also acknowledge the concern over efforts in some parts to \nrecognize same-sex marriage. That concern has led many States to enact \nlaws such as my State's Defense of Marriage Act and to enact here in \nthis Congress the Defense of Marriage Act as well. That concern over \nproposals for same-sex marriage has led some States to actually \nconsider constitutional amendments.\n  With respect to same-sex marriages, let me offer this: There are a \nlot of views, but two of those views are basic when you cut to the \nchase. View No. 1: marriage is between a man and a woman. The \nalternative view is marriage is between two people. I think the\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\nview of most Americans today--not all but most Americans today--is that \nmarriage is between a man and a woman.\n\n  The question for us to consider here today is this: Is there a clear \nneed to amend the Constitution of our country to ensure that the view I \nhave just stated, the majority view, prevails in States such as \nDelaware and others? It is a legitimate question. As we seek to answer \nit, let's consider a couple of examples of State laws spelling out how \nmarriage is supposed to operate and whether those laws have been \nsustained over the years. Let me mention three examples.\n  A number of States have prohibitions against first cousins marrying. \nIf two people live in a State where you have a man and woman who are \nfirst cousins and they want to get married, they go to another State to \nget married and return to their State. Their State does not have to \nacknowledge the validity of the marriage.\n  Some States have restrictions with respect to divorce. If you get a \ndivorce, you have to wait a while before you can remarry. If you live \nin a State with that restriction and you go to another State that \ndoesn't have those restrictions, you return to your State, your State \ndoes not have to recognize that marriage.\n  We have all seen movies about May-December marriages and how they can \nbe interesting and entertaining, but a lot of States have a law that \nsays a 57-year-old man can't marry a 13-year-old girl, and if you try \nto do that in a State where maybe you could get away with it, and you \nmove back to your State, that marriage will not be recognized. Those \nState laws have been sustained whether we have a constitutional \namendment.\n  I believe that my law in Delaware will also be sustained without a \nconstitutional amendment. If it isn't, then this is an issue that we \ncan revisit, and I think we will.\n  This Constitution that I hold in my hand is the work of man. I think \nit was divinely inspired. The folks who met at the Golden Fleece Tavern \nand the people in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia a long time ago \nlargely got it right the first time--not entirely, but they largely got \nit right. This Constitution has been rarely changed. It is not easy to \ndo. That is purposeful. Over 11,000 amendments have been proposed to \nthis Constitution. To date, since the adoption of the Bill of Rights, \n17 have actually been incorporated as amendments to this Constitution.\n  On the issue of marriage and divorce alone, 129 amendments have been \nproposed to the Constitution. None have come close to passage. All of \nus today and all of us who will vote today realize this proposed \nconstitutional amendment is not going to be enacted either.\n  It is an important issue that has been raised. As some have said, it \nis one that, frankly, divides us and divides us deeply.\n  When the last speech is given today, when the final vote is cast \naround 12:15 or 12:30, my fervent hope is that we will turn to some \nissues that unite us and, frankly, need to be addressed. They are \nclosely related to what we are talking about today. We need to look no \nfurther than the 1996 Welfare Act that was adopted in this Chamber \nwhich has expired and been continued with short-term extensions time \nand again. It needs to be reauthorized. We need a vote on it and, \nfrankly, to improve it. It is not perfect. We can make it better. We \ncan strengthen marriage through the provisions of that law. We can \nstrengthen families. We can increase the likelihood that more of \nAmerica's children are going to grow up in homes where both parents are \ndeeply committed to them and to their future, that they have decent \nchildcare. We can do that.\n  I hope when we finish today and this issue is behind us for a while, \nthat we will turn to another closely related issue that will truly \nstrengthen America's families. That is, to return to the issue of \nwelfare reform and pass the legislation out of committee and send it to \nthe House. Let's get on with the Nation's business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Could I ask for a brief unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield to the Senator for a request.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I believe we have been going back and forth to each side. \nI certainly want to accommodate the Senator so everyone will be able to \nbe heard, but we also have some folks on our side.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Allard be recognized \nfor 5 minutes out of the 25 minutes remaining on our side until the \nchairman comes to the floor and the leadership time is reserved under a \nprevious consent, and then Senator Santorum be recognized as our next \nRepublican speaker for 10 minutes on our side, and then finally the \nlast 5 minutes of that 25-minute segment, that Senator Sessions be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nallowing me the opportunity to speak. Just to get some business out of \nthe way, I have some materials I have submitted at the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent to print them in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     July 12, 2004.\n     To: Senator Orrin Hatch, Chair, United States Senate \n         Judiciary Committee.\n     From: Professor Teresa S. Collett.\n     Re: Response to recent concerns regarding the meaning, reach, \n         and consistency of the Federal Marriage Amendment with \n         constitutional principles.\n       Having served as a witness in favor of the Federal Marriage \n     Amendment, SRJ 40, (hereinafter ``FMA'') before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee on March 23, 2004, which was chaired by \n     Senator Cornyn, I have been asked to respond to various \n     objections regarding its passage.\n       There are four common objections to the FMA. Opponents \n     claim that the FMA is self-contradictory, with the first \n     sentence prohibiting what the second permits in certain \n     cases. Second, they claim that the amendment prohibits \n     private recognition of same-sex unions as marriages. Third, \n     they argue that the amendment is anti-democratic because it \n     removes the definition of marriage from the arena of state \n     law and creates a uniform federal definition. Finally, and in \n     contradiction to the last point, they argue that the \n     amendment will increase litigation over the meaning of \n     marriage. None of these objections have merit.\n\n\n             The Amendment is Not Internally Contradictory\n\n       The starting point for any analysis of a constitutional \n     amendment is the text, with an intention to give effect to \n     every word. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803). See also \n     Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 835 \n     (1990). As proposed, the FMA provides:\n       ``Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor \n     the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require \n     that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred \n     upon any union other than the union of a man and a \n     woman.''\n       The meaning of the first sentence of the FMA is clear. \n     Opponents typically do not dispute this. Rather they assert \n     the confusion arises because it is possible to read the \n     second sentence of the FMA as allowing legislatures to create \n     that which the first sentence clearly prohibits--same-sex \n     marriage (at least insofar as it is done, not due to \n     constitutional imperative, but rather due to some alternative \n     legitimate legislative motivation). While such a reading is \n     theoretically possible, it violates one of the most basic \n     canons of construction: ``The plain meaning of a statute's \n     text must be given effect `unless it would produce an absurd \n     result or one manifestly at odds with the statute's intended \n     effect.' '' Arnold v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 136 F.3d \n     854, 858 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Parisi by Cooney v. Chater, \n     69 F.3d 614, 617 (1st Cir. 1995)). Since such an \n     interpretation would render the FMA ``self-contradictory'' \n     and ineffectual, it should be rejected under ordinary \n     principles of construction.\n       Opponents also argue that the phrase ``legal incidents'' of \n     marriage is unclear and will require extensive judicial \n     interpretation. Yet this is a phrase that has been used \n     routinely in the discussion of marital rights. Justice \n     Brennan used it in his concurring opinion in Boddie v. \n     Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371 at 387 (1971). ``Legal incidents of \n     marriage'' is also found in various state appellate opinions \n     that have been rendered over the past sixty years. See, e.g., \n     Sanders v. Altmeyer, 58 F.Supp. 67, 68 (D.C. Tenn. 1944); \n     Adler v. Adler, 81 N.Y.S.2d 797, 800 (N.Y. Dom. Rel. Ct. \n     1948); Ramsay v. Ramsay, 90 A.2d 433, 435 (R.I. 1952); Shipp \n     v. Shipp, 383 P.2d 30, 32 (Okla. 1963); Rosenstiel v. \n     Rosenstiel, 209 N.E.2d 709, 712 (N.Y. 1965); Perrin v. \n     Perrin, 408 F.2d 107, 110 (3rd Cir. 1969); Merenoff v. \n     Merenoff, 388 A.2d 951, 953 (N.J. 1978); In re Marriage of \n     Epstein, 592 P.2d 1165, 1169 (Cal. 1979); Baker v. Baker, 468 \n     A.2d 944, 947 (Conn. Super. 1983); Koppelman v. O'Keeffe, 535 \n     N.Y.S.2d 871, 873 (N.Y. Sup.

The Volokh Conspiracy at http://volokh.com/\narchives/archive_2004_03_21.shtml. Professor Cass Sunstein, \n     another opponent to the FMA also agreed that the state \n     legislature could pass a law to establish civil unions. \n     Response to written questions propounded by Senator Dick \n     Durbin (March 23, 2004).\n\n\n The Amendment Does Not Prohibit Private Recognition of Same-Sex Unions\n\n       Perhaps the most creative argument of opponents is that the \n     FMA would allow states and other governmental bodies to \n     ``punish religious organizations and individuals for \n     performing or participating in religious marriages of same-\n     sex couples. . . .'' This argument is crafted by analogizing \n     the FMA to the Thirteenth Amendment which provides in \n     pertinent part, ``Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, \n     except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have \n     been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or \n     any place subject to their jurisdiction.'' The Thirteenth \n     Amendment is the exception to the general rule that \n     constitutional provisions are limitations on state action, \n     rather than private action. Compare Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer \n     Co., 392 U.S. 408, 438 (1968) (Congress has power under \n     Thirteenth Amendment to enact legislation to prohibit private \n     acts that erect racial barriers to the acquisition of \n     property) with Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 \n     U.S. 263, 278 (1993) (no violation of constitutional right to \n     privacy occurs absent state interference with woman's right \n     to abortion) and United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners \n     of America v. Scott, 463 U.S. 825, 831-32 (1983) (state \n     action is necessary to establish conspiracy to violate First \n     Amendment). Based upon this fact, and the absence of any \n     language in the FMA expressly limiting the amendment to state \n     action, opponents claim that any private recognition of same-\n     sex marriages would become punishable at law.\n       This ignores important differences in the language of the \n     two amendments, however. Section (a) of the Thirteenth \n     Amendment is written as a prohibition, with a narrow \n     exception. In contrast, the first sentence of the FMA is \n     written as an affirmation of the nature of marriage, with the \n     second sentence limiting the ability of courts to redefine \n     marriage in the guise of constitutional adjudication. Rather \n     than a distinct provision, the first clause functions as an \n     introduction to the second. There is nothing in the language \n     of the FMA or the legislative history to date that suggests \n     any intent to disrupt the current ability of religious \n     communities to determine their understanding of marriage and \n     divorce. See Hames v. Hames, 163 Conn. 588 (Conn. 1972) \n     (religious ceremony insufficient to constitute civil \n     marriage); Marazita v. Marazita, 27 Conn. Supp. 190 (Conn. \n     Super. Ct. 1967) (wife's religious belief in indissolubility \n     of marriage not sufficient to deprive court of jurisdiction \n     in divorce proceeding); Knibb v. Knibb, 94 N.J. Eq. 747, \n     748 (N.J. 1923) (suit for divorce due to refusal to marry \n     in Church); Victor v. Victor, 177 Ariz. 231 (Ariz. Ct. \n     App. 1993) (court without authority to order Jewish \n     divorce); In re Marriage of Dajani, 204 Cal. App. 3d 1387 \n     (Cal. Ct. App. 1988) (American court could not enforce \n     Islamic law).\n       Given the long history of detente between Church and State \n     in this country regarding the regulation of marriage and \n     divorce, the reasonable assumption is that the FMA will \n     control governmental actions related to civil marriage, and \n     religious bodies will continue to define their own entry and \n     exit requirements for marriage. To the extent there is any \n     merit in opponents' analogy to the Thirteen Amendment, its \n     interpretation supports this conclusion. In Robertson v. \n     Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275 (1897) two deserting seamen argued that \n     they could not be forced to fulfill their commitment in light \n     of the constitutional prohibition of involuntary servitude. \n     The Court disposed of this argument opining:\n       ``It is clear, however, that the amendment was not intended \n     to introduce any novel doctrine with respect to certain \n     descriptions of service which have always been treated as \n     exceptional, such as military and naval enlistments, or to \n     disturb the right of parents and guardians to the custody of \n     their minor children or wards. The amendment, however, makes \n     no distinction between a public and a private service. To say \n     that persons engaged in a public service are not within the \n     amendment is to admit that there are exceptions to its \n     general language, and the further question is at once \n     presented, where shall the line be drawn? We know of no \n     better answer to make than to say that services which have \n     from time immemorial been treated as exceptional shall not be \n     regarded as within its purview.'' 165 U.S. at 282.\n       The continuing viability of this case is evidenced by the \n     Court's reliance on it in United States v. Kozminski, 487 \n     U.S. 931, 942-44 (1988) (adopting a narrow construction of \n     coercion sufficient to constitute involuntary servitude).\n       While opponents raise the specter of organized persecution \n     of religious communities that perform same-sex marriage \n     rituals, the international experience suggests quite the \n     opposite. It is defenders of traditional marriage that have \n     cause to worry. Last month a pastor is Sweden was sentenced \n     to one month in jail based on a sermon opposing homosexual \n     conduct. In Canada there have been criminal convictions under \n     hate speech laws for publication of an advertisement opposing \n     same-sex marriage that merely cited Bible verses without \n     quoting them. The Irish Council on Civil Liberties publicly \n     threatened priests and bishops who distribute a Vatican \n     publication regarding homosexual activity with prosecution \n     under incitement to hatred legislation.'' In Spain, Madrid's \n     Cardinal Varela gave a sermon condemning gay marriage. He has \n     been sued by the Popular Gay Platform for ``slander and an \n     incitement to discrimination on the basis of sexual \n     orientation.'' In England, self defense was denied to a \n     pastor who defended himself when assaulted by several \n     attackers while carrying a sign citing Bible verses regarding \n     homosexual conduct. Last fall, an Anglican Bishop in England \n     was investigated under hate crimes legislation and \n     reprimanded by the local Chief Constable for observing that \n     some people can overcome homosexual inclinations and \n     ``reorientate'' themselves. In Belgium, an 80-year old \n     Cardinal was sued over his comments regarding homosexuality. \n     In each of these countries what began with demands for \n     ``tolerance'' has transformed into demands for acceptance at \n     the price of religious liberty.\n       A similar transformation seems plausible in light of the \n     continuing attacks on the integrity of the proponents and \n     supporters of the FMA. Opponents of the FMA consistently seek \n     to associate the effort of those who seek to protect the \n     institution of marriage with those who sought to stabilize \n     the institution of racial segregation. This charge is both \n     insulting and inaccurate. While leadership of the African-\n     American community may be divided over whether to support the \n     FMA at this time, they are not divided over whether racial \n     segregation is desirable. Although they differ in their \n     positions on the merits of the amendment itself, Rev. Jesse \n     Jackson, Rev. Walter Fauntroy, and Hilary Shelton of the \n     NAACP are all unwilling to equate defense of traditional \n     marriage with racial discrimination, as are other \n     prominent civil rights leaders. Similarly, the willingness \n     of a substantial majority of both chambers of Congress \n     just a few short years ago to vote for the federal Defense \n     of Marriage Act does not equate with bigotry, and any \n     attempts to do so are merely activists' attempts to cut \n     off public debate regarding the need of a child to be \n     raised by his or her mother and father.\n\n\nthe fma is a democratic solution to the problem of judicial usurpation \n           of the political debate regarding same-sex unions\n\n       The FMA is the only method available to preserve the \n     ability of the people and their elected representatives to \n     speak on the issue. This is because of the very real \n     possibility that the United States Supreme Court will impose \n     an obligation on states to recognize same-sex unions as \n     marriages in the guise of constitutional adjudication. \n     Building on the Court's statements in Lawrence v. Texas \n     equating heterosexual and homosexual experiences, and its \n     statements in Romer v. Evans attributing animus to those who \n     would make any distinctions, many constitutional law scholars \n     have opined that the Court appears poised to mandate same-sex \n     marriage in the upcoming years.\n       In commenting on the Lawrence opinion's relationship to \n     judicial recognition of same-sex marriage, Professor Laurence \n     Tribe of Harvard said, ``I think it's only a matter of \n     time''. Professor Erwin Chemerinsky of USC has observed, \n     ``Justice Scalia likely is correct in his dissent in saying \n     that laws that prohibit same-sex marriage cannot, in the long \n     term, survive the reasoning of the majority in Lawrence.'' \n     Prudence demands that the matter be addressed by the people, \n     before the Court takes the issue away from them.\n\n\n            the amendment is unlikely to increase litigation\n\n       Marriage has become a question of constitutional law \n     through gay activists' unrelenting attacks on marriage \n     statutes in the courts. Judges in Hawaii, Alaska, Vermont, \n     and Massachusetts have already mandated recognition of same-\n     sex marriage. The citizens of Hawaii and Alaska responded to \n     the actions of their courts by amending their state \n     constitutions to correct what was largely perceived as \n     judicial overreaching.\n\n[[Page S8070]]\n\n     Vermont legislators did not afford their citizens the \n     opportunity to correct this judicial interpretation, instead \n     passing Act 91, An Act Relating to Civil Unions.\n       The most recent and troubling ruling, however, is Goodridge \n     v. Dept. of Public Health, an opinion of the Massachusetts \n     Supreme Judicial Court declaring that state's marriage laws \n     unconstitutional. Chief Justice Margaret Marshall opens her \n     opinion with a review of the recent United States Supreme \n     Court opinion, Lawrence v. Texas. Finding there was no \n     rational reason supporting traditional marriage, she gave \n     the legislature 180 days to ``take appropriate action'' in \n     light of the opinion, which was widely interpreted as an \n     ``order'' to create a ``gay marriage''. Although a \n     Massachusetts statute prohibits the issuance of a marriage \n     license to non-residents whose home state would not \n     recognize the unions, hundreds of out of state couples \n     flocked to Massachusetts to be married. One of the first \n     Massachusetts marriage licenses was issued to a Minnesota \n     same-sex couple, who describe their relationship as an \n     ``open marriage,'' saying the concept of permanence in \n     marriage is ``overrated.'' The Massachusetts Legislature \n     is moving forward with a state constitutional amendment, \n     but the people of that state will not be allowed to vote \n     on it until fall of 2006.\n       Unfortunately Massachusetts is not the only state where \n     activists are currently demanding that judges redefine \n     marriage. At this time California, Florida, Indiana, \n     Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, \n     Oregon, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia are defending \n     their marriage laws in the courts. Based on news reports, it \n     is likely that Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Tennessee \n     may soon be defending their statutes in the courts as well. \n     Add to these fifteen states, the three states of Hawaii, \n     Alaska and Vermont that have already responded to judicial \n     overreaching on this issue, and Massachusetts which remains \n     embroiled in a political fight to return the issue to the \n     people, as well as the states of Arizona, Connecticut, Iowa, \n     and Texas where courts have resolved the issue--and almost \n     half the country's laws are, or have been, under attack by a \n     small group who want to force their will on the people in the \n     guise of constitutional adjudication.\n       It seems unlikely that the passage of the FMA, which \n     removes the definition of marriage from further judicial \n     redefinition, could increase litigation beyond the present \n     level.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Activists have been unable to succeed in changing the \n     definition of marriage legislatively so they have turned to \n     the courts. Unfortunately some judges are increasingly \n     willing to disregard the text of the laws--as well as the \n     political will of the people--in judicial efforts to remake \n     the institution of marriage to suit their own particular \n     political views. This is not the proper process to be \n     followed in a democratic republic. It is the people and their \n     elected representatives who should determine the meaning and \n     structure to marriage through the process of political debate \n     and voting.\n       The Federal Marriage Amendment, with its requirements of \n     passage by two-thirds of each house of Congress and \n     ratification by three-quarters of the states, follows the \n     Founders' model for open, yet orderly change in our governing \n     document. The text of the Amendment is clear and preserves \n     the understanding of marriage that has existed throughout \n     this nation's history, while allowing for individual states \n     to experiment with alternative legal structures as their \n     citizens deem appropriate. Unlike the hypothetical threats \n     that opponents attempt to manufacture, the FMA addresses real \n     cases and real problems that the people of this nation are \n     encountering with the judicial usurpation of the political \n     process.\n\n                      [From iMAPP, July 12, 2004]\n\n                      Is DOMA Enough? An Analysis\n\n                          (By Joshua K. Baker)\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Do we need a constitutional amendment to protect marriage? \n     Some influential elites question the need for a \n     constitutional amendment. As Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) \n     told the Boston Globe earlier this year, ``I don't at this \n     point see the need for a constitutional amendment as long as \n     the Defense of Marriage Act remains on the books.''\n       For people who define the problem as the involuntary spread \n     of same-sex marriage from one state to others, a key question \n     becomes: Are federal DOMA laws enough?\n\n\n                             Defining DOMA\n\n       The federal DOMA law contains two sections, stating:\n       Section 1. In determining the meaning of any Act of \n     Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of \n     the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United \n     States, the word ``marriage'' means only a legal union \n     between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the \n     word ``spouse'' refers only to a person of the opposite sex \n     who is a husband or a wife.''\n       Section 2. No State, territory, or possession of the United \n     States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to \n     any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other \n     State, territory, possession or tribe, respecting a \n     relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated \n     as a marriage under the laws of such other state, territory, \n     possession or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such \n     relationship.\n       The first part creates a federal definition of marriage for \n     the purposes of federal marriage law. Considerable litigation \n     is likely to arise from conflicts between federal law and \n     laws in states in which courts mandate recognition of same-\n     sex marriage, or marriage equivalents. Such cases will \n     increase the temptation for the Supreme Court to create a \n     national definition of marriage on equal protection grounds, \n     as otherwise, legally married couples in different states \n     will be treated substantially differently under federal law.\n       The second part of DOMA restates general conflict of laws \n     principles: no state is required to recognize a marriage that \n     violates its own public policy. However, it provides no \n     additional legal protection for the people of a state whose \n     judicial elites create a right of same-sex marriage in the \n     state constitution or choose to recognize same-sex marriages \n     performed elsewhere.\n     I. Is Federal DOMA Enough?\n       DOMA laws are unlikely to prevent the spread of same-sex \n     marriage from one judiciary to the other, for the following \n     reasons:\n       A. The groundwork for DOMA's demise has already been laid \n     in the scholarly literature. Legal experts argue DOMA can be \n     struck down in federal court because it violates \n     principles of equal protection, liberty/due process and \n     full faith and credit.\n       B. The legal threat to federal DOMA laws is now imminent, \n     because Massachusetts has, for the first time, given \n     plaintiffs standing to challenge the federal law. Previously, \n     courts held that absent a legal state marriage, persons have \n     no standing to challenge the federal DOMA law. Newspaper \n     reports indicate that there are now thousands of couples in \n     at least 46 states who have received marriage licenses in \n     Massachusetts, California or Oregon, and now have standing to \n     challenge DOMA in federal courts.\n       C. DOMA won't keep legal elites from creating same-sex \n     marriage in many states. Already, in just eight months since \n     the Goodridge decision, activists have filed cases across the \n     country seeking to strike down state marriage laws. Today \n     such cases are pending in at least 11 states, including six \n     states which have adopted state DOMA legislation in recent \n     years. Attorneys general and local officials in California, \n     New York and elsewhere are refusing to defend state marriage \n     laws, or are insisting that their state recognize same-sex \n     marriages performed elsewhere.\n       The New York Attorney General, following the lead of a 2003 \n     trial court judgment, has already indicated that New York law \n     ``presumptively requires'' recognition of same-sex marriages \n     from Massachusetts. When San Francisco Mayor Gavin Anderson \n     and his counterparts in a handful of other cities across the \n     country began issuing same-sex marriage licenses, the \n     California attorney general chose to simply petition the \n     California Supreme Court for ``resolution of these important \n     issues,'' rather than present an affirmative defense of the \n     state's marriage law. Shortly thereafter, the mayor of \n     Seattle in March declared that his city (and all private \n     groups that contract with the city) must recognize as valid \n     the same-sex marriages of employees, wherever performed.\n       D. There will be a national definition of marriage, \n     ultimately. The question is whose? Radically different \n     marriage laws in different states are difficult to sustain \n     over time. A federal definition of marriage that is different \n     from state definitions of marriage produces immediate \n     conflicts in many areas of law that the Supreme Court will be \n     tempted to harmonize by ordering recognition of same-sex \n     marriage on equal protection grounds. One way or the other, \n     we will soon have a national definition of marriage. If we \n     pass a marriage amendment, we will retain our shared \n     understanding of marriage as the union of husband and wife, \n     ratified by the people of the United States. If we accept \n     judicial supremacy on the marriage question, we will probably \n     end up with a judicially created and approved national \n     marriage definition that redefines marriage in unisex terms.\n       E. Legal scholars from both sides agree: Federal courts are \n     now poised to strike down state marriage laws. Speaking about \n     the recent Supreme Court decision Lawrence v. Texas, Harvard \n     Law Professor Lawrence Tribe commented, ``You'd have to be \n     tone deaf not to get the message from Lawrence that anything \n     that invites people to give same-sex couples less than full \n     respect is constitutionally suspect.'' Georgetown Law \n     Professor Chai Feldblum agreed, stating, ``[A]s a matter of \n     logic and principle, there is no reason not to provide the \n     institution of marriage for gay people. The court is leaving \n     that open for the future.'' Professor William Eskridge of \n     Yale Law School stated ``Justice Scalia is right'' that \n     Lawrence signals the end of traditional marriage laws. Jon \n     Bruning, Attorney General of Nebraska, testified before the \n     Senate in March that a federal judge is likely to soon \n     declare Nebraska's state constitutional marriage amendment \n     unconstitutional: ``This is the first federal court challenge \n     to a state's DOMA law. My office moved to dismiss the suit, \n     but last November, the Court denied our motion to dismiss. \n     The language in the Court's order signals that Nebraska \n     will very likely lose the case at trial.''\n       F. Federal lawsuits attacking marriage laws have already \n     been filed in four states. While most marriage litigation has \n     historically been based on state constitutional provisions, \n     in just the past year, cases in three\n\n[[Page S8071]]\n\n     states (Florida, Arizona, and Nebraska) have brought federal \n     constitutional challenges to both state and federal DOMA laws \n     on equal protection, due process and full faith and credit \n     grounds. In June, the same lawyers that filed the Goodridge \n     case in Massachusetts also filed suit alleging that a state \n     iaw which prevents out-of-state same-sex couples from \n     marrying in Massachusetts violates the Privileges and \n     Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n       G. It's not the full faith and credit clause, it's the 14th \n     amendment. Scholars who have testified that DOMA is \n     constitutional under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of \n     Article IV of the Constitution miss the primary threat to \n     DOMA. DOMA's greatest threat springs not from the relatively \n     settled world of Full Faith & Credit jurisprudence, but from \n     the Supreme Court's evolving view of equal protection and \n     personal liberty, as evidenced by such recent cases as \n     Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003) and Romer v. Evans, \n     517 U.S. 620 (1996). As Justice Scalia noted in his Lawrence \n     dissent, this evolving jurisprudence not only threatens DOMA, \n     but also poses a substantive threat to individual state \n     marriage laws.\n       H. A federal injunction to strike down DOMA will take only \n     minutes. A Constitutional amendment takes months or years to \n     pass. If we want to protect marriage as the union of husband \n     and wife, the time to act is now.\n     Il. Does a marriage amendment violate principles of \n         federalism?\n       Many legal analysts argue that a constitutional amendment \n     that creates a national definition of marriage violates \n     fundamental principles of federalism. In a letter to Senate \n     Constitution Subcommittee Chairman John Cornyn last \n     September, six law professors including Eugene Volokh of UCLA \n     and Dale Carpenter of the University of Minnesota wrote \n     ``[T]here is no need to federalize the definition of \n     marriage. . . . if marriage is federalized, this will set a \n     precedent for additional federal intrusions into state \n     power.'' Are they correct?\n       No, for the following reasons:\n       A. Many fundamental institutions are national in scope. The \n     Constitution already contains such fundamental institutions \n     as representative government (through the guarantee clause, \n     art. IV, Sec. 4) and private property (through the takings \n     clause, Fifth Amendment). A marriage amendment would \n     acknowledge marriage as a fundamental institution, while \n     still leaving the states significant regulatory discretion \n     (procedures, age, consanguinity, etc.).\n       B. Marriage law has always been subject to federal legal \n     oversight. This is not unlike the federalist model which \n     permits states to experiment with term limits, elected \n     judiciaries, or unicameral legislatures, subject to the \n     underlying guarantee of representative government; or varying \n     state policies on eminent domain, taxation, and rights of \n     way, subject to the underlying premise that government cannot \n     take property without compensation. A marriage amendment \n     would simply clarify that husbands and wives are an essential \n     part of our fundamental, shared American understanding of \n     marriage.\n       C. The basic definition of marriage has long been \n     considered a national question. The Supreme Court has already \n     affirmed the right of Congress to sustain a national \n     definition of marriage that excludes polygamy. Without \n     Congress' decisive intervention, upheld by the Supreme \n     Court, we would today have polygamy in some states and not \n     in others. Today, it is federal and state courts that \n     threaten our common definition of marriage. As former \n     Attorney General Ed Meese argued in favor of a \n     constitutional amendment creating a national definition of \n     marriage, ``If marriage is a fundamental social \n     institution, then it's fundamental for all of society.'' \n     As the Supreme Court stated in Reynolds v. United States, \n     ``there cannot be a doubt that, unless restricted by some \n     form of constitution, it is within the legitimate scope of \n     the power of every civil government to determine whether \n     polygamy or monogamy shall be the law of social life under \n     its dominion.''\n     III. Why not wait until DOMA has been struck down?\n       A. Waiting until the problem gets worse will not make it \n     easier to solve. A patchwork of different state and local \n     laws will sow confusion for couples, for businesses, for \n     state and local governments. If we intend to protect marriage \n     as the union of husband and wife, the time to settle the \n     question is now.\n       B. There will never be a magic moment in which to amend the \n     Constitution. Today opponents argue it is too early, because \n     DOMA still exists. Three years from now, DOMA may be struck \n     down and others will say it is too late--tens of thousands of \n     same-sex couples will have already married.\n       C. The best time for affirming a common definition of \n     marriage is before SSM becomes widespread. If it could be \n     ratified today, a marriage amendment would merely reaffirm \n     the law of 49 states, while undoing eight weeks of change in \n     Massachusetts. Looking ahead, it is difficult to foresee a \n     time where a constitutional amendment defining marriage could \n     be adopted with less legal and personal disruption.\n       D. The amendment process takes time. A federal judge could \n     enjoin DOMA tomorrow, yet it would take months and perhaps \n     years to propose and ratify the federal marriage amendment.\n       E. A constitutional amendment is not a constitutional \n     crisis. In the last century, we amended our constitution \n     twelve times, including twice in the 1930's, three times in \n     the 1960's, and again in 1971 and 1992. The amendment process \n     is, by design, not a sign of constitutional crisis, but \n     rather a great democratic and federalist process for reaching \n     national consensus on questions of great importance. Marriage \n     is worth it.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank some 19 cosponsors who are now on this amendment. \nI thank the majority leader for stepping forward and helping this \nparticular issue. I thank the President of the United States for \nstepping forward early on and articulating the principles which are \nembodied in this constitutional amendment. I particularly thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Brownback, Santorum, and Sessions, for joining me \nin the late-night session last night and for Senators Cornyn and Hatch \nfor helping manage the bill on the floor, as well as Congresswoman \nMusgrave in the House for her leadership.\n  I didn't come to the decision to introduce this legislation easily. I \nwent through a process of evaluating the issue.\n  I don't think it is unlike what many Members of the Senate are going \nthrough right now, or at some point in time went through, because as \nthe initial sponsor of this legislation, I had an opportunity to talk \nto many Members and I think their response was very much what mine was \nto start with: Why do we need to amend the Constitution?\n  We all recognize how precious that document is. When anybody comes to \nyou with an issue, to start with, you always wonder why do we need to \ndo that. That is a high standard and we all recognize that.\n  I also remember the debate with the Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, \nwhich was carried by Senator Nickles on this side, and how important \nmost Members of the Senate--85 Members--felt in that vote that we \ndefine marriage as between a man and a woman.\n  In this debate, I wanted to protect traditional marriage. I also had \nsome skepticism about amending the Constitution. But after sitting down \nwith colleagues and scholars and people who were following the courts, \nI came to the realization that there was a process going on in the \ncourts that I wasn't aware of, that I just had become aware of.\n  I understood the potential of what was going to happen in those \ncourts. It was, when I first got involved, that the courts were going \nto change the definition of marriage, which we passed by 85 votes in \nthe Senate, and on which close to 48 States passed legislation somehow \nor other supporting traditional marriage. I thought this should be \nbrought into the legislative branch--that is where the debate should \noccur--where we have elected representatives having an opportunity to \nreflect their views and the views of their constituents, whether it is \nin the Congress or the State legislature.\n  So in visiting with the constitutional scholars, academicians, \nprofessors, and whatnot, we began to put together some language for the \nConstitution, very carefully crafted, and the language has had an \nopportunity to be changed a couple of times. We brought it back into \nthe Senate and had the staff within the Judiciary Committee reflect \ntheir views and the Senators would reflect views, always working toward \na consensus. We began to realize more and more clearly what was \nhappening in the courts.\n  As we move through it this year, I think it becomes blatantly evident \nto us that there is a process going on in the courts that will exclude \nthe American citizens. We need to get them involved. We need to \nrecognize that the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote in the House \nand Senate and three-quarters of the States to ratify.\n  Our forefathers realized that during an issue such as marriage, where \na large percentage of Americans of all faiths, all ethnic backgrounds, \nsupport the idea of traditional marriage--the effort to change the \ndefinition of traditional marriage being between a man and a woman is \ncertainly only being pushed by a minority of the population in this \ncountry--the way we can express our views is through a constitutional \namendment. That is what we have before us today.\n  In this amendment I have proposed, we define marriage as a union \nbetween a man and a woman.\n\n[[Page S8072]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds to bring my \ncomments to a close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Marriage matters to our children; it matters in America. \nMarriage is the foundation of a free society. The courts are redefining \nmarriage and that will make it impossible for State legislators to \naddress marriage. This amendment puts the issue back in the hands of \nthe people. A vote not to move forward means the court will be the sole \nvoice in this matter. The people will not have a voice. We need to move \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nFederal marriage amendment because I believe this effort to amend the \nConstitution is premature, unnecessarily divisive, and denies our \nStates rights that they have long had.\n  My opposition to this constitutional amendment is, in effect, quite \nsimilar to the views stated by Vice President Dick Cheney in our debate \nduring the 2000 campaign. Mr. Cheney said then, when it comes to gay \nmarriage:\n\n       I think different States are likely to come to different \n     conclusions, and that is appropriate. I don't think there \n     should necessarily be a Federal policy in this area. I try to \n     be open minded about it as much as I can and tolerant of \n     those relationships.\n\n  He was widely applauded for those remarks, and rightly so. His wife \nLynne Cheney said this just this past Sunday:\n\n       The formulation he used in 2000 was very good.\n\n  She is right.\n\n       Marriage is an issue best left to the States in our \n     constitutional and legal frameworks.\n\n  Unfortunately, in its pursuit of this amendment, the administration \nhas abandoned the openminded and tolerant position Vice President \nCheney took in 2000 and, apparently, he, too, has done so. That is \nunfortunate and it is divisive.\n  The Constitution is, after all, our Nation's most sacred secular \ndocument. That is a combination of words that may surprise some, to \ncall something secular sacred. But we all know intuitively that is what \nthe Constitution is.\n  In a literal way, the Constitution was adopted by its own words, to \n``secure the blessings'' of liberty, which the Declaration of \nIndependence says are the people's endowment from their Creator.\n  For well over 200 years, this document has provided our Government \nwith its guiding hand, its blueprint for governing, and, equally \nimportant, a clear and enforceable articulation of the limits of \nFederal Government power.\n  Part of the genius of the Constitution lies in the fact that, as it \nunites us, it also stands above us and our elected representatives, \narticulating enduring governing principles, rather than providing a \nquick answer for every new day's question. The brilliance of our \nNation's Founders was that they drafted a Constitution but left it to \nsucceeding generations of legislators, both in Washington and in the \nStates, to decide the issues of the day, with the recognition that \nstatutes can be changed with relative ease, while a Constitution \nendures for the long term.\n  Those who wish to elevate an issue to the constitutional level, \ntherefore, in my opinion, bear a heavy burden of showing it is \nabsolutely necessary to do so. That is not just my view; it is the \nclear consensus of our Nation throughout its history. Only 27 times \nover the past 217 years has the Constitution been amended, and the \nfirst 10 of those amendments constitute our revered Bill of Rights, \npassed almost as part of the Constitution itself.\n  So I have concluded that we should accept the proposed amendment \nbefore us today only if we are absolutely convinced not just of its \nrightness but of its necessity. After looking at the laws of the land \ntoday regarding marriage and closely examining the text of the proposed \namendment before us, I conclude that burden has not been met.\n  Let me be clear. I believe marriage is a legal status that should be \ngranted only to the union of one man and one woman. I believe that \nbecause I also believe the marriage of a man and a woman is the best \nway to sustain the human race, through the procreation and rearing of \nchildren. Therefore, it is in the interest of our society to attach \nspecial benefits to the relationship of a man and a woman joined \ntogether in marriage. That is why I voted for DOMA, the Defense of \nMarriage Act, in 1996, and that is why I still support that law today.\n  DOMA makes absolutely clear that marriage, under Federal law, which \nis our area of jurisdiction, is a status that should be attainable only \nby one man and one woman, and that any State's decision to define \nmarriage otherwise has no effect on marriage under Federal law or the \nlaws of other States.\n  In other words, we already have a Federal law on the books that \nprecludes any couple other than an opposite-sex one from claiming \nFederal marriage benefits and that prevents one State from seeking to \nimpose its view of marriage on its sister States. A constitutional \namendment to that effect is therefore unnecessary at this time.\n  There is a contemporary reality, however, that this amendment does \nnot allow us the flexibility to recognize. Gay and lesbian couples \nexist. They are not going away. They also enjoy the rights promised in \nthe Declaration as the endowment of their Creator. To say these couples \nand their children should be denied any legal protections or relieved \nof all legal responsibilities would, in my opinion, be unfair and \ninconsistent with the principles that were at the basis of the founding \nof our country.\n  I presume most all of us would agree, for example, that someone \nshould not be excluded from his dying life-partner's hospital room on \nthe ground that their decades-long relationship has no legal status. \nProbably many of us who have thought about it would not want to see \nsomeone who raised her partner's biological children as her own and \nprovided the family's principal means of support be able to simply walk \naway without any financial obligations to the child if the couple ends \ntheir relationship.\n  I do not profess to know exactly how and in what form these rights \nand responsibilities should be extended to gay and lesbian couples. \nDifferent States are already providing different answers to those \ndifficult and important questions. But I do know this is a discussion \nand a debate that will and should continue to the benefit of our \ncountry.\n  I understand that some argue that the Constitution's full faith and \ncredit clause makes inevitable that one State's decision to allow gay \nmarriage will lead to gay marriage across the Nation. I respectfully \ndisagree. I believe that DOMA is constitutional, a view I hope is \nshared by the overwhelming majority of my colleagues who voted for it. \nIf DOMA is declared unconstitutional in the future and the full faith \nand credit clause found to mandate national recognition of one State's \ndefinition of marriage, there will be enough time for those of us who \noppose gay marriage to act statutorily or constitutionally.\n  In sum, this is an unnecessary amendment that wrongly and certainly \nprematurely deprives States of their traditional ability to define \nmarriage. I plan to cast my vote against it and urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe under the unanimous consent \nagreement Senator Santorum is to be recognized next. We discussed that. \nI ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak at this time for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask the question: Why are we here? The \nreason we are here is because of court rulings. The Massachusetts \ndecision took effect May 17, just a few weeks ago. That is why we are \nhere today. This is not a matter I had any intention of being engaged \nin 2 years ago or 6 years ago when I came to the Senate. We are here to \nprotect the rights of legislative bodies in all 50 States to define \nmarriage as they always have. I believe that is appropriate.\n  Some suggest there is not a real threat to marriage and the courts \nwill\n\n[[Page S8073]]\n\nnot strike down the traditional definition of marriage. I do not think \nthat is something we can say. As a matter of fact, marriage, as we have \ntraditionally known it, is without any doubt in great jeopardy by the \nrulings of the courts in America. It has already occurred in \nMassachusetts.\n  I would like to show the language of one of the opinions that is \nrelevant in this situation. In the Lawrence v. Texas case, just last \nyear, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled and said this:\n\n       In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. \n     Casey, the court reaffirmed the substantive force of the \n     liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.\n\n  That is vague language but dangerous language, in my view. They go on \nto say:\n\n       The Casey decision again confirmed that our laws and \n     tradition afford constitutional protection to personal \n     decisions relating to marriage. . . .\n\n  And then a little further on in the opinion, they say:\n\n       Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for \n     these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.\n\n  ``For these purposes'' clearly refers back to marriage in the above \nparagraph.\n  That is the U.S. Supreme Court. That decision was cited by the \nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to justify their decision under \nthe equal protection clause. Justice Scalia, in his comments in dissent \nin this case, said about Lawrence:\n\n       Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional \n     law that has permitted a distinction to be made between \n     heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal \n     recognition in marriage is concerned. . . .\n\n  He made clear his view of what that opinion was, and he was in the \nconference when the judges discussed the opinion when it was decided 6 \nto 3. They can even lose one judge on the issue and still come down \nagainst traditional marriage when a challenge comes before them.\n  Second, marriage is good, Mr. President. I had a hearing in the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. We had a host of \nexcellent witnesses who testified about the strength and importance of \nmarriage. The numbers and science are indisputable.\n  Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, who wrote one of the most important articles \nin the second half of the 20th century called ``Dan Quayle was Right,'' \ntestified. She has become an expert on the subject. She said she was at \nfirst criticized, and now everybody agrees with her statistics. She \ngathered them from independent studies around the country. She found \nthis:\n\n       On average, married people are happier, healthier, \n     wealthier, enjoy longer lives, and report greater sexual \n     satisfaction than single, divorced or cohabitating \n     individuals.\n       Married people are less likely to take moral or mortal \nrisks, and are even less inclined to risk-taking when they have \nchildren. They have better health habits and receive more regular \nhealth care. They are less likely to attempt or to commit suicide. They \nare also more likely to enjoy close and supportive relationships with \ntheir close relatives and to have a wide social support network. They \nare better equipped to cope with major life crises, such as severe \nillness, job loss, and extraordinary care needs of sick children or \naging parents.\n\n       Children experience an estimated 70 percent drop in their \n     household income in the immediate aftermath of divorce and, \n     unless there is a remarriage, their income is still 40 to 45 \n     percent lower 6 years later than for children in intact \n     families.\n\n  She goes on and on to discuss those issues.\n  No reputable scientist today would dispute the fact that although \nsingle parents do heroic jobs, and many of them overcome all the \nstatistical numbers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think it is important for us to know \nthat marriage is good, that it is in jeopardy by the courts. The \nAmerican people have a right to a legitimate constitutional amendment \nprocess--not the illegitimate process of courts amending the \nConstitution--but a legitimate process to amend this Constitution by \nallowing the States to vote. A constitutional amendment will not become \nlaw unless the States vote on it. Why is that not empowering States? \nThree-fourths of them must do so. I believe this is the right thing.\n  It has been a good debate, a good discussion. It is not going away. \nWe will be back again and again. This issue will be discussed more. It \nwill become law. We will protect marriage because it is critical to the \nculture of this country.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we have additional speakers on our side \nwho are ready, but the practice has been to go back and forth, so we \nwould be glad to allow time for our Democratic colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will share a few thoughts on the subject \nmatter at hand. We are shortly going to vote, I believe, on the motion \nto proceed on the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. I \nintend to oppose the cloture motion and oppose the underlying \nconstitutional amendment, and I will lay out the reasons why.\n  First, I believe this constitutional amendment has no place in our \nfounding document because it runs counter to our most sacred \nconstitutional traditions. According to University of Chicago law \nprofessor Cass Sunstein, who testified before the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Our constitutional traditions demonstrate that change in \n     the founding document is appropriate on only the most rare \n     occasions--most notably, to correct problems in governmental \n     structure or to expand the category of individual rights. The \n     proposed amendment does not fall into either of these \n     categories.\n\n  For example, the first 10 amendments of the Bill of Rights guaranteed \nsuch liberties as freedom of speech, assembly, and religion, the \nprotection of private property, and freedom from cruel and unusual \npunishment.\n  Other amendments corrected problems in the structure of Government \nsuch as limiting the number of terms a President could serve or \nproviding for the direct election of Senators.\n  In fact, the only time the Federal Constitution was amended not to \nexpand an individual right or to respond to structural concerns was to \nestablish prohibition and then repeal it. That is the only example in \nthe last 228 years.\n  If the proposed Federal marriage amendment is adopted and we are to \ndeny rather than confer rights upon individuals, I believe it will be a \nstep backward for all Americans concerned with the Constitution and the \nintended purpose of it. It would be difficult to imagine what our \nFederal Constitution would look like today if we had adopted \nconstitutional amendments at the rate they are being currently \nproposed.\n  I point out that as of June 15, 2004, 61 constitutional amendments \nhave been introduced in this Congress alone. In the last decade, 460 \nconstitutional amendments have been offered. Even more startling is \nthat 11,000 have been offered since the first Congress convened in \n1789. That is the bad news. The good news is only 27 of those \nconstitutional amendments have actually been adopted since 1789.\n  Some of these proposed constitutional amendments were controversial \nand divisive when proposed, and clearly discredited when viewed through \nthe prism of historical perspective. There have been constitutional \namendments to divide the country into four Presidential districts with \na President elected from each, renaming the country ``the United States \nof the World,'' and even allow for the continuance of slavery.\n  If all of the proposed constitutional amendments were adopted, our \nfounding document would resemble a Christmas tree--a civil and criminal \ncode rather than a constitution--and the United States would be a very \ndifferent nation indeed.\n  The Framers therefore had it right when they made the Constitution \nextremely difficult to amend. It is a process that ought to be very \nwell thought out and extremely deliberate. That is why of the more than \n11,000 proposals to amend the Constitution, only 27 have been adopted.\n  The Constitution was not intended to be subject to the passions and \nwhims of\n\n[[Page S8074]]\n\nthe moment. It dilutes the meaning of having a constitution in the \nfirst place if it is easy to amend, not to mention the fact that a \nlengthy constitution would be exceedingly difficult to interpret and \nenforce.\n\n  The Federal Constitution was construed to withstand incessant \nmeddling and provide a stable framework of Government in the future. \nCertainly there must be a major crisis at hand. At the very least, the \nhurdle must be passed that we face a crisis.\n  Certainly I am willing to listen to those who say the crisis we face \non this issue of same-sex marriage is so compelling that we must do \nsomething about it, and the only way we can address this crisis is by \namending the Constitution of the United States. In my view, however, \nthere is no crisis. It is a sham argument.\n  First, there has been no successful challenge to the Defense of \nMarriage Act, or DOMA. I want to direct the attention of my colleagues \nto this chart. Courts that have upheld Federal right to same-sex \nmarriage, zero; States forced to recognize out-of-state same-sex \nmarriages, zero; churches forced to perform same-sex marriages, zero; \ndiscriminatory amendments to the U.S. Constitution, zero.\n  Where is the crisis? There is no crisis. This is merely a political \nissue for some in the majority party who want to raise a question where \nfrankly the problem is nonexistent.\n  Therefore, I think the issue of a Federal Marriage Amendment is \ncertainly not ripe at all, nor is there a ``crisis'' as some of my \ncolleagues would have us believe.\n  It is unfortunate that the majority party of the Senate does not \nshare James Madison's view that the Constitution is to be amended \n``only for certain great and extraordinary occasions.'' What is ``the \ngreat and extraordinary occasion'' that warrants taking this radical \naction today? The majority party has scheduled votes on two \nconstitutional amendments prior to the August recess. Neither of these \namendments, which concern same-sex marriage and the burning of the \nAmerican flag, falls within our constitutional traditions. They have \nabsolutely nothing to do with expanding individual rights or responding \nto structural concerns. They have absolutely everything to do with \nscoring political points before an election.\n  In addition, there has not been a markup or any consideration of \nthese amendments by the full Judiciary Committee. It is extraordinary \nthat the entire Senate would be considering amending the Constitution \nwithout the amendments having gone through the normal legislative \nprocess. In fact, of the 19 constitutional amendments considered by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee since 1978, all but two have been fully \ndebated by the Judiciary Committee. The Senate considered the two that \ndid not go through the Judiciary Committee only by unanimous consent.\n  Here we are taking the exceptional route of avoiding that process. \nMost surprisingly, the majority party is paying lip service to its \ncherished principle of federalism. Since the founding of our Nation, \nmarriage has been the province of the States, and in my view it should \ncontinue to be a State issue. Yet the Federal Marriage Amendment would \ndeprive States of their traditional power to define marriage and impose \na national definition of marriage on the entire country.\n  According to Yale professor Lea Brilmayer, States now have wide \nlatitude to refuse recognition of marriages entered into in other \nStates without offending the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the \nConstitution. She argues that ``entering into a marriage is legally \nmore akin to signing a marriage contract or taking out a driver's \nlicense'' as opposed to a judicial judgment, the latter of which is \nentitled to Full Faith and Credit. Courts have therefore not hesitated \nto apply local public policy to refuse to recognize marriages entered \ninto in other States.\n\n  In addition, 49 out of 50 States allow marriage only between a man \nand a woman. The one holdout, Massachusetts, is currently working its \nway through this contentious issue in its State constitutional \namendment process. For Congress to step in and dictate to 49 States how \nthey ought to proceed in this matter runs counter to the States rights \nprinciples that many hold so dear.\n  I am hopeful cooler heads will prevail on this issue and the Senate \nwill turn its attention to more pressing concerns. Having been through \nthe process last week of trying to reform the class action system, \nwhich we spent only some 48 hours on, we have some 8.2 million out-of-\nwork Americans; 4.5 million Americans working part time because they \ncannot find a full-time; almost 2 million private sector jobs lost \nsince January of 2001; 35 million Americans living in poverty; 12 \nmillion children living in poverty; 25 million Americans who are hungry \nor on the verge of hunger; 43 million Americans without health \ninsurance.\n  How about spending a couple of days trying to address one of these \nissues? And yet here we are consuming the remaining days of this \nsession of Congress on an issue where there is absolutely no crisis.\n  As I pointed out earlier, looking at this chart once again very \nquickly, there have been no successful challenges to the Defense of \nMarriage Act. No court has upheld the Federal right to same-sex \nmarriage. No state is forced to recognize out-of-state same-sex \nmarriages. And no church is forced to perform same-sex marriages.\n  This issue is not ripe. It is not needed. It is a waste of our time. \nWe ought to be dealing with far more serious issues.\n  My hope is that my colleagues, when a vote occurs in a few short \nminutes on cloture, will vote no on cloture. Let's get back to the \nbusiness of what the Senate ought to be dealing with--namely, the \npressing issues that our country needs to address on a daily basis. \nThis is not one of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, there is no problem. We are just here \nbecause we are playing politics. We are alarmists. There is no problem \nout there. The Massachusetts Supreme Court didn't rule that the \nlegislature had to change the definition of marriage. The Supreme Court \ndidn't rule last year, for the first time, that we have fundamentally \nchanged how we are going to construe rights with respect to homosexuals \nand lesbians. No, there is no problem. America, look somewhere else. \nDon't pay attention to what is going on. Everything will be fine. Just \nleave it up to us.\n  Us? Judges. Just leave it up to the judges. The Constitution should \nnot be amended, said the Senator from Connecticut, on the passions and \nwhims of the moment. That is right. What would others like to see \nhappen? They would like to see it amended on the passions and whims of \njudges because that is what does happen. That is what is happening.\n  What has changed? The courts have changed. The courts have decided it \nis now their role to take over the responsibility of passing laws. What \nhas changed? What has changed is that they now create rights and change \nthe Constitution without having to go through this rather cumbersome \nprocess known as article V. We actually have to amend it, have to get \ntwo-thirds votes, have to get three-quarters of the States. That is \nwhat has changed.\n  We can sit back and deny it. No, everything is fine, zero, zero, \nzero--I say one, Massachusetts; two courts right now considering \nwhether to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. None have done it, but \nthe cases were just filed. Why were they just filed? Because the \ndecision was just last year.\n  Oh, we can wait. We can wait until more and more people enter into \nthese unions in more and more States, after they become adopted. Then \nwe can wait. Then, when we wait long enough, we say: Now we can't take \nthese rights away from people. How can we be discriminatory? People \nhave already invested in these rights.\n  Let's wait. Let the courts do it for us. Let's go out here and \nprotest that we are for traditional marriage, and then do absolutely \nnothing, absolutely nothing to make sure it is preserved.\n  In fact, all but one--Senator Kennedy said he is for the \nMassachusetts decision, but I don't know of any other Senator who has \ncome out here and said they are against the traditional definition of \nmarriage. Every other Senator to my knowledge has said they are for the \ntraditional definition of marriage. Yet those of us who are proposing \nthis amendment have been\n\n[[Page S8075]]\n\ncalled divisive, mean-spirited, gay bashing, shameful, notorious, \nintolerant--I could go on. Wait a minute, don't we all agree on this? \nDon't we all agree on the definition of marriage? If we all agree on \nthe definition of marriage, and we just have different approaches to \nsolving it, then why, if we all agree on the substance, are those of us \nproposing the marriage amendment divisive, mean-spirited, gay bashing, \net cetera? Why?\n  Maybe we have to question whether there really is a desire to protect \ntraditional marriage and whether we are just sort of laying back, \nhoping this issue is taken from us, that the courts will do our dirty \nwork, that the courts will go about the process, which they have been \nnow for the past couple of decades, and simply change the Constitution \nwithout the public being heard. That is what this amendment is all \nabout.\n\n  Article V says Congress shall propose. We are proposing. We are not \npassing anything. We are not forcing anything on the States. As to this \nidea that somehow or another this is against States rights, 38 State \nlegislatures have to approve this amendment for it to become part of \nthe Constitution. This is not forcing anything on the States. This is \nnot an abdication of States rights. This is allowing the States a \nfighting chance to preserve what every State in the Union says they \nwould like to preserve, and that is the institution of marriage.\n  The idea, somehow or another, and I know others have talked about \nthis, that James Madison would be against this because ``this is not a \ngreat or extraordinary occasion''--I would say the fundamental building \nblock of any society is marriage and the family, and the destruction of \nthat building block is a fairly extraordinary occasion. But even if \nsome do not believe it is, let me refer you to the last amendment to \nthe Constitution, the 27th amendment, which states:\n\n       No law varying the compensation for the services of the \n     Senators and Representatives shall take effect until an \n     election of Representatives shall have intervened.\n\n  Members of the Senate and House cannot get pay raises until their \nelection. That was the 27th amendment. That was the great and \nextraordinary occasion that we amended the Constitution.\n  By the way, for those who say Madison would surely have opposed that \nbecause it is not a great and extraordinary occasion, what was the name \nof this amendment? The Madison amendment. James Madison proposed this \namendment. This is a great and extraordinary occasion.\n  I would argue, the future of our country hangs in the balance because \nthe future of the American family hangs in the balance. What we are \nabout today is to try to protect something that civilizations for 5,000 \nyears have understood to be the public good. It is a good not just for \nthe men and women involved in the relationship and the forming of that \nunion, which is certainly a positive thing for both men and women, as \nthe Senator from Alabama laid out, but even more important to provide \nmoms and dads for the next generation of our children. Isn't that \nimportant? Isn't that the ultimate homeland security, standing up and \ndefending marriage, defending the right for children to have moms and \ndads, to be raised in a nurturing and loving environment? That is what \nthis debate is all about.\n  I ask my colleagues who come here and rail against those of us who \nwould simply like to protect children, those of us who would simply \nlike to give them the best chance to survive in a very ugly, hostile, \npolluted world that we live in--with respect to culture--I would ask \nthem this question: What harm would this amendment do? What harm would \nit do?\n  We don't need it; it is not ripe; it is not ready; it is divisive. \nWhat harm would an amendment which simply restates the law of every \nState in the country and protects them from judicial tyranny, what harm \nwould it do? What harm will it do to do something that we know will \nactually protect the family? This idea that it is not ripe, this idea \nthat it is unnecessary, this idea that it is divisive when all but at \nleast one Member, that I am aware of, only one Member disagrees with \nthe substance of the amendment, that is divisive? I can't think of very \nmany things that happen around here that pass 99 to 1. It is not \ndivisive. It is simply a restatement of what we have held true in this \ncountry since its inception and in every civilization in the history of \nman. What is the reluctance? Is it because this Constitution is so \ngreat and so lofty that we dare not amend it? Obviously not.\n  Then, what is it? Why do we hold back? Why aren't we willing to stand \nup and say children deserve moms and dads? The people have a right to \ndefine for themselves what the family is in America. Let the people \nspeak. Let the people participate in this document. This is the \nConstitution, and judges should not be rewriting it without the \npeople's consent. That is what article V is all about. That is what \nthis amendment is all about. It is not about hate. It is not about gay \nbashing. It is not about any of those things. It is simply about doing \nthe right thing for the basic glue that holds society together.\n  I plead with my colleagues. I know they have given speeches. I know \nthere are lots of pressures out there. Certainly, the popular culture \nis not supporting those of us who have stood and supported this \namendment. But just think about what America will look like, as we have \nseen in other countries around the world that have changed the \ndefinition of marriage, what America will look like with growing \nnumbers of people simply not getting married; growing numbers of \nchildren growing up in nonmarried households.\n  I suggest you look at the neighbors of America where marriage is no \nlonger a social convention, where marriage is no longer something that \nis expected, particularly of males, and see what the result is in those \nsubcultures, see what the result is, see the role that government and \ncommunity organizations have to play to save the lives of children, to \ngive them some shred of hope because mom and dad aren't there.\n\n  That is the world we are looking at. That is the world that is simply \naround the corner if we choose to do nothing.\n  I said last night and I will repeat today--I ask for an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that will be taken off the Republican time; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Christopher Lasch says we get up every morning and we \ntell ourselves little lies so we can live. Today, we have gotten up and \nwe have told ourselves a little lie. Oh, the family is OK. Oh, this \nisn't right. Oh, whatever the lie is--but sometime or another we are \njust not going to come around to doing what we say we believe. Somehow \nor another we will deny what we know is true. We know that marriage \nbetween a man and a woman is true and right. It is not discriminatory \nand divisive. It is simply a fact. It is common sense. Yet somehow, \njust so we can move on to homeland security or to the next bill, we are \ngoing to deceive ourselves into believing that everything will be OK if \nwe just do nothing. Nothing doesn't cut it. Let the people speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the remaining 30 \nminutes shall be allocated in the following order: Senator Leahy, 10 \nminutes; Senator Hatch, 10 minutes; the Democratic leader, 5 minutes; \nand the majority leader, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Dodd has time remaining--5 or 6 \nminutes. We yield that to Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am privileged to represent a State that \nvalues families and the tradition of this country as much or more than \nany State in our Nation. We are the 14th State in the Union. We are a \nState that values and respects not only our families, but our duties to \nthe rest of the country. In fact, during the current war in Iraq, \nVermont has lost on a per capita basis more soldiers than any other \nState in the country. We are a very special State.\n  We also have a wonderful constitution, the shortest constitution, I \nbelieve, of any State in the Nation. We hold to it as we do the U.S. \nConstitution. We have provisions in our Vermont State Constitution \nwhich\n\n[[Page S8076]]\n\nmake it very difficult to change, for a reason. It has guided us for \nwell over 200 years, just as our U.S. Constitution has guided the \nnation as a whole.\n  When you change the fundamental role of the Federal Government to \nhave it intrude into the lives of our people and into our separate \nreligious institutions, that is wrong. Doing so preemptively, based on \nthe false premise that the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of \nChief Justice Rehnquist and Justice O'Connor, is going to reach out and \nrequire States to approve same-sex marriages, is ill founded. Doing so \nin order to write discrimination into the Constitution is abhorrent.\n  Instead of a respectful and deliberative process with respect to the \nU.S. Constitution, we have something else going on here, something that \nSenator Durbin and Senator Feingold and others spoke of yesterday. None \nof the various proposed constitutional amendments have gone through the \ntraditional process to help the Senate determine whether a proposed \namendment is ``necessary,'' as, of course, the Constitution requires. \nChanging the fundamental charter of our Nation should not be proposed \nin this haphazard manner.\n  Everybody here knows that this is a political exercise being carried \nout on the fly. It shows little respect for the Constitution or the \npriorities of the American people.\n  Instead of taking action against terrorism, providing access to \nprescription drugs at lower prices, improving the criminal justice \nsystem, engaging in oversight to get to the bottom of the Iraq prison \nabuse scandal, providing a real Patients' Bill of Rights against the \nHMOs, or just fulfilling the basic requirements of the Senate by \npassing a budget and determining the 12 remaining appropriations bills \non which the Senate has yet to act, the Republican leadership in the \nSenate has frittered away another week, with only 5 weeks left in the \nsession. We have lost another week, but they know on the vote they will \nnot win.\n  The American people have felt the need to amend the Constitution only \n17 times since the adoption of the Bill of Rights. You would not \nrecognize that tradition of restraint in looking at this Congress, in \nwhich dozens of proposed amendments to the Constitution have been \nintroduced. The Senate has voted to increase the democratic rights of \nour citizens on several occasions, but we have only voted once to limit \nthe rights of the American people. That was prohibition. We know that \nfailed, and we had to come back in an embarrassed way and vote to \nrepeal it.\n  This is a motion to proceed to the third version of the Federal \nMarriage Amendment that has been introduced in this Congress. Senator \nDaschle and the Democratic leadership offered a fair up-or-down vote on \nthis amendment, but the Republican leaders refused. Instead, they want \nto have a constitutional convention on the Senate floor, with multiple \nvotes on a variety of versions of constitutional amendments.\n  Yesterday, the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, \nindicated he was not insisting on a vote on his version of a \nconstitutional amendment. I have not heard the distinguished senior \nSenator from Utah insist on a separate vote on an alternative version. \nI really do not understand why the Republican leadership wouldn't agree \nto an up-or-down vote at a certain time on this amendment, as Senator \nDaschle offered. It almost seems as if the Republican leadership can't \ntake yes for an answer on this procedural matter.\n\n  Are we facing crises here in the United States? I suppose that we \nare, but they are not constitutional crises. They are real-world \nproblems. They have more to do with international terrorism and \ndifficult economic times for America's working families than how the \npeople of the State of Massachusetts will determine how to work out a \nState constitutional amendment or other approaches to the question of \nmarriage in their State.\n  No constitutional crisis exists demanding constitutional changes. \nLook at two of our largest States, California and New York. They have \nRepublican Governors. Their Republican Governors are not asking us to \nchange the Constitution. Many of the Republican Senators in this \nChamber know there is not a constitutional crisis, and I commend their \ncourage in opposing this amendment.\n  I compliment the Log Cabin Republicans for their forthrightness and \ncourage. They are right that marriage is an issue for the States and \nfor our religious institutions within their separate spheres. In fact, \nthey are right that Vice President Cheney and I agree on this, even \nthough the Vice President is uncharacteristically silent at this \nmoment.\n  I began this debate last Friday by urging that our Constitution not \nbe politicized. I am saddened to see the proponents of this amendment \nand those trying to make this an election year issue see nothing as off \nlimits or out of bounds, not even the Constitution. They propose \nturning the Constitution of the United States from the fundamental \ncharter preserving our freedoms into a kiosk for political bumper \nstickers. They would reduce it to a device--in their words--to ``stand \nup against the culture.''\n  The real conservatives, the conservatives of Vermont and other \nStates--know that conserving the Constitution is among the most \nimportant responsibilities we have. Our oath as Senators--an oath I \nhave taken five times, and I can remember each one of them as though it \nwas yesterday--is to ``support and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States.''\n  Where is the respect for our States here? The Republican-appointed \njudges in Massachusetts changed their rules on marriage. But \nMassachusetts can decide for Massachusetts. They can change their \nconstitution. But, of course, what we do here is going to force other \nStates to ignore their own constitution or their own laws. Whether they \nlike it or not, we will tell them what they have to do.\n\n  I hear many say Republicans and others on the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt endangered marriages. If I may be personal for a moment, I have \nbeen married for 42 years, to the most wonderful person I have ever \nknown. In my mind, she is the most wonderful wife anyone could have. I \nsometimes ask myself why she has put up with me for 42 years, but she \nhas. We have three beautiful children, two wonderful daughters-in-law, \na wonderful son-in-law, all of whom we love. We were blessed this past \nweekend with our third grandchild. How wonderful it was to hold her \nliterally minutes after she was born.\n  Like the former senior Senator from my State, Senator Stafford, I \ncould say that everything I have accomplished in my life that has been \nworthwhile has been with the help of my wife Marcelle. We do not find \nour marriage endangered.\n  I do find a Constitution endangered if we start using it for bumper \nsticker slogans. That is what we are doing, and we must stop. The \nConstitution is too great a part of our heritage and our freedoms and \nour diversity and the democracy we love to tarnish it in this fashion.\n  When we vote today, we will not be voting to preserve the 42-year \nmarriage of Patrick and Marcelle Leahy. She and I will not be affected \nby this vote, but millions of Americans will be. Remember those gay and \nlesbian Americans across the Nation who are looking to the Senate today \nto see whether this body is going to brand them as inferiors in our \nsociety. Those who vote against cloture recognize the fullness of their \nworth and their citizenship. I will not vote to diminish other \nAmericans in the Constitution. I urge all Senators to vote ``no.''\n  I have to wonder what Americans are thinking as they watch the Senate \ndevote its limited time to debate the Federal marriage amendment. Do \nthey think the Nation is in a midst of a crisis that only a \nconstitutional amendment can resolve? Are they pleased that the Senate \nhas turned away from legislation that could improve their daily lives \nto engage in this debate? I doubt it.\n  Let me review the current legal landscape in America. Massachusetts \nis the only State in the Union providing marriage licenses to same-sex \ncouples, and its citizens are in the midst of the State constitutional \nprocess to overturn that policy. In addition, Massachusetts has limited \nsame-sex marriage to couples who reside or intend to reside there. \nMeanwhile, none of the other 49 States has moved to legalize gay \nmarriage during the many months\n\n[[Page S8077]]\n\nthat have followed the Goodridge decision in Massachusetts.\n  I think most Americans would agree with me that the sky has not \nfallen during the 2 months during which same-sex couples have married \nin Massachusetts. They may support gay marriage, or like me, they may \nbelieve that civil unions are the appropriate way to recognize the \nseriousness of gay and lesbian relationships. Or they may oppose any \nrecognition at all for same-sex couples. But at a fundamental level, \nthey understand that States should have the authority to decide who can \nmarry, and that the relationships being formed between consenting \nadults in Massachusetts have not harmed their own marriages or their \nown families.\n  The Rutland Herald, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper in my State, \nwrote the following in an editorial last month:\n\n       [A] remarkable thing has happened since gay marriages began \n     legally in Massachusetts last month: nothing. Gay and lesbian \n     couples who have trooped to their town clerks or church \n     altars have joined in the most significant relationship of \n     their lives, and it has not been nothing to them. But no \n     cataclysmic shock to society has occurred. Marriages happen \n     as a matter of course, and though they are one of the most \n     significant events in the life of the individual, they are a \n     routine matter in the life of a community. Now gay marriage, \n     too, has become routine, at least in Massachusetts.\n\n  As The Rutland Herald suggests, most Americans have not felt any \neffects from developments in Massachusetts, and many are surely \nmystified and dismayed by the Senate's fascination with the topic.\n  So why are we here today? We are certainly not here to legislate. \nEveryone in this chamber knows the Senate will not adopt this \namendment. If you listen to Senator Santorum or Senator Hatch, you know \nthey say we are here to ``put people on record,'' apparently including \nthe many Republicans who have expressed reservations about the FMA or \noppose it outright.\n  Obviously, the Senate leadership has decided that forcing a vote in \nrelation to the FMA will benefit the Republican Party politically, from \nthe race for the White House to the Senate races that will determine \nwhich party controls the agenda for the 109th Congress.\n  Ever since President Bush publicly embraced amending the Constitution \nto ban same-sex marriage, it has been obvious that he considered the \nissue of gay marriage crucial to his re-election campaign. The \nPresident's plan was clear: his right-wing base may have been alienated \nby his calls for immigration reform or a mission to Mars, but he would \nwin them back by aggressively promoting a marriage amendment. And since \nthe President's opponent is a Member of this body, it was only a matter \nof time before this amendment reached the floor, regardless of what \nprocedural traditions had to be sidestepped to do it.\n  Of course, the President has never said what words he wants to be \nincluded in the Constitution. His Department of Justice has never \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee of the House or Senate, and \nhas never said what words it believes would be appropriate to include \nin the Constitution. The President and his administration want the \nbenefit of supporting this discriminatory amendment without getting \ntheir hands dirty by delving into the specific and ugly words. This \nlack of concern about the language of the amendment is of course not \nlimited to the White House. As I stressed in my opening statement, the \nlanguage of this amendment is rather beside the point for its \ncongressional supporters, too.\n  The President addressed the issue of gay marriage in his State of the \nUnion address in January. He said, ``If judges insist on forcing their \narbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people \nwould be the constitutional process.'' Yet, on February 24--barely a \nmonth after the State of the Union address--and without any additional \ncourt anywhere in the country ruling on gay marriage, the President \nflip-flopped and endorsed putting a ban on gay marriage in the \nConstitution. I can only assume that something turned up in the White \nHouse's polling to prompt such a dramatic about-face. Or perhaps Karl \nRove's phone simply would not stop ringing with calls from the hard-\nright groups that compose the core of the President's support.\n  In any event, the day after the President endorsed the concept of a \nconstitutional amendment, I wrote him and asked what specific language \nhe wanted us to add to the Constitution. After all, we have only \namended the Constitution 17 times since the Bill of Rights. If the \nPresident was calling on Congress to amend it for an 18th time, I \nthought the least he could do is make clear what language he seeks. I \nhave waited in vain for a response.\n  I am not surprised by the President's conduct in this matter. He has \nproven himself willing over the last 3\\1/2\\ years to take whatever \nmeasures he finds politically expedient. He has also shown that he is \nmore than willing to play political games with the Constitution, as we \nsee with today's debate and we will see again in the upcoming debate on \na constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration an issue that Vice \nPresident Cheney has been campaigning on recently. The President, the \nVice President, and the rest of the administration have withheld \ninformation from Congress and the public whenever it suits them. And \nfacts have proven to be awfully malleable things when they have stood \nin the way of the President's political priorities. For this \nadministration, it is all politics all the time regardless of the truth \nor the consequences. Let me provide three of the many possible \nexamples.\n\n  When the facts got in the way of the President's prewar statements \nabout Iraq, and Joseph Wilson pointed out the flaws in the President's \n2003 State of the Union address concerning Iraq's alleged efforts to \nobtain uranium in Niger, someone in the Administration apparently told \nthe press that Wilson's wife was an undercover agent at the CIA. The \nPresident promised that the perpetrator would be discovered and \npunished. But if he has made any efforts to discover the leaker's \nidentity, we are unaware of them. Instead, he has retained counsel and \nallowed the investigation to grind on, perhaps in the hope that the \nissue will not be resolved until after election day.\n  When the facts got in the way of the President's proposal to expand \nMedicare to provide prescription drug benefits, his Department of \nHealth and Human Services simply withheld those facts from Congress. \nWhen Congress considered the prescription drugs bill last fall, it \nreceived an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office that the cost \nof implementing the new program would be about $395 billion. It has \nsince come to light that Richard Foster, the chief Medicare actuary, \ncompleted a cost estimate for the Bush administration last fall that \nshowed the new prescription drug benefit would cost $550 billion, \ndrastically more than the CBO estimate. In testimony before Congress, \nMr. Foster explained that he was told that if he made his cost analysis \npublic, he would be fired. The Congressional Research Service recently \nreported that it believes the Bush administration violated the law by \nwithholding Mr. Foster's report and stated that it is clear that \nCongress has the right to receive truthful information from Federal \nagencies to assist in its legislative functions. It was a breach of \ntrust with this Congress and with the American people.\n  And in today's papers we learn that there are administration \nestimates that when the purported prescription drug benefits are \nsupposed to finally kick in around 2006, what is likely to happen is \nthat almost 4 million retirees will, in fact, lose prescription drug \nbenefits. That means that the Bush administration is now withholding \nits own estimates that one-third of all retirees with employer-\nsponsored drug coverage will, in fact, suffer more rather than be \nhelped by the bill they forced through the Congress to benefit large \ninsurance and pharmaceutical companies at the expense of our seniors.\n  Finally, when we in Congress raised legitimate concerns about the \nadministration's policies on the abuse of prisoners abroad and \nrequested documents that would shed light on the administration's \npolicies regarding the treatment and interrogation of detainees, the \nWhite House released a small number of self-serving documents and chose \nto hide the rest. Then it ``disavowed'' the Office of Legal Counsel \nmemo that laid out a strategy for evading the limits of the Torture \nConvention as if that document, which is legally binding on\n\n[[Page S8078]]\n\nthe Executive Branch, had been nothing more than the doodling of an \noverly imaginative young lawyer at the Department of Justice. The \nadministration obviously does not want the Congress or the American \npeople to know the facts about its actions abroad or its slippery \ncommitment to upholding American values.\n  Let there be no mistake: We are here today because the President \nwants to distract the American people from the facts of the weakened \neconomy and reduced standing abroad that his administration has \nproduced. He and the Senate Republican leadership prefer a political \ncircus and seek to whip the American people into a frenzy based on the \nactions of a single State.\n  I am not so sure their political calculations are correct. I believe \nthe American people regardless of their position on gay marriage--will \nbe disappointed by the majority's overreaching. They will see this \ndebate for what it is--a show produced to benefit Republicans \npolitically while doing nothing to enhance or protect the sanctity of \nmarriage. Senator Chafee predicted months ago that his leadership might \nbring the amendment up ``just for political posturing.'' He has proved \nprescient.\n  As I said at the fourth and final hearing the Judiciary Committee \nheld on gay marriage, this debate is not about preserving the sanctity \nof marriage. It is about preserving a Republican White House and Senate \nand about doing so by scapegoating gay and lesbian Americans. I oppose \nthis amendment, and I again urge my colleagues to oppose it as well.\n  This debate perfectly illustrates the Senate's priorities. We are \nspending days on a Federal marriage amendment that we all know does not \nhave the votes to pass the Senate and that the House may never even put \nto a vote. I have spoken before about the divisiveness of this debate \nand the contempt that it shows for our constitutional traditions. This \ndebate, however, also demonstrates the Senate Republican leadership's \ndisregard for the needs of the American people and the institutional \nresponsibilities of this body.\n  The Senate has been unable to get its own house in order. It is mid-\nJuly and we have still not passed a budget. The Senate has passed only \none of 13 appropriations bills, and the leadership has suggested they \nmay not be able to find the time to pass the others as individual \nbills. I do not believe we have ever passed only one appropriations \nbill in the Senate before the August recess, but we certainly seem to \nbe headed in that direction.\n  A July 7 editorial in Roll Call lamented what it called the ``Big \nMess Ahead.'' We are now stuck in that big mess. Roll Call noted that \n``July should be appropriations month in the Senate.'' I agree. July \nhas traditionally been when we got our work done and made sure that \nfunding for the various functions of the Federal Government would be \nappropriated by the Congress as it exercised its responsibilities and \nthe power of the purse. Not this year.\n  We have not done our part to help American employers create jobs. We \nhave not completed work on a highway bill that could create 830,000 \njobs, or on the FSC-ETI bill, subjecting American businesses to \nretaliatory tariffs that are increasing monthly. At the same time we \nhave dallied on measures to expand the economy, and we have refused to \nextend unemployment benefits, even as 2 million Americans have \nexhausted their unemployment insurance.\n  We have not addressed the health care needs of our citizens. The \nmajority has refused to take up either a drug reimportation bill that \nhas the support of a majority of Senators, or mental health parity \nlegislation that has 68 sponsors. Meanwhile, the Senate has done \nnothing to address the fact that 43 million Americans have not had \nhealth insurance for more than a year.\n  We have failed those hardworking Americans who struggle every day to \nmake ends meet on wages that barely reach the poverty line. We have not \nincreased a minimum wage that has remained unchanged since 1996. As \ninflation has risen and the economy has worsened, the working poor must \nstruggle to live on the same wage Congress passed 8 years ago. The core \ninflation rate rose 2 percent in the first quarter of this year alone. \nIn addition to allowing the minimum wage to stagnate, the majority has \nabandoned efforts to reauthorize the welfare reform law, leaving \nthousands of families in desperate need of quality childcare behind.\n  We have also failed our veterans. This failure begins at the top. The \nPresident has consistently proposed underfunding veterans' programs. \nHis budget request for this year failed to maintain even the current \nlevel of services. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Principi recently \ntestified that his department asked the White House for an additional \n$1.2 billion, but that request was denied. Forced to choose between our \nveterans and the President, the majority has sided against our \nveterans.\n  During consideration of this year's budget resolution, Senator \nDaschle offered an amendment to fund veterans programs at the level \nrecommended by veterans' groups in the Independent Budget. \nUnfortunately, only one Republican voted in favor of this amendment, \nand it was defeated. A second amendment, offered by Senator Bill \nNelson, would have increased funding for veterans by $1.8 billion. It \ntoo was defeated. Not a single Republican supported the Nelson \namendment. My friends on the other side of the aisle then offered a \n``smoke and mirrors'' amendment on veterans' care. Although this \namendment made it seem that the Senate was voting to provide more money \nfor veterans, we all know that this amendment did not add one red cent. \nThe main purpose of this amendment was to provide political cover for \nthe November election.\n  While the administration is shortchanging VA funding, out-of-pocket \nexpenses for veterans are skyrocketing. Under the Bush administration, \nthese expenses are projected to rise by an incredible 478 percent. \nCertain Priority 8 veterans are blocked from VA health care altogether, \nwhile others cannot receive treatment unless they pay a ridiculously \nhigh co-payment. Instead of debating polarizing issues like the Federal \nmarriage amendment, we should be acting to provide real resources for \nthe men and women who served this country with honor.\n  Unlike in 2000, the Republican majority has not even made the \npretense of addressing the priorities of our Nation's immigrants. The \nmajority leader engaged in parliamentary tricks last week to avoid a \nvote on Senator Craig's immigration reform bill and has found no time \nfor the bipartisan DREAM Act, which would help thousands of immigrant \nstudents in our Nation. The prospect of comprehensive immigration \nreform is even more remote.\n  Sadly, the list of what we are not accomplishing goes on and on. Roll \nCall observed in its editorial last week that ``the second session of \nthe 108th Congress is poised to accomplish nothing.'' The way things \nare going, under Republican leadership this session will make the ``do \nnothing'' Congress against which President Harry Truman ran seem like a \nlegislative juggernaut.\n  The days we spend on this amendment could be spent more productively \non any of the matters I just mentioned, but instead we are debating the \nFMA. We have followed this course even though there are only 6 weeks \nremaining in the Senate's scheduled work year.\n  I fear that at this point in an election year, floor time is only \navailable for matters that advance the majority's narrow political \nagenda. This is a sad contrast from 1996, when we passed a minimum wage \nincrease, a welfare reform bill, and other matters in a productive \nsummer during which we occasionally put the election aside and took \ncare of business for the American people. I supported some of those \ninitiatives and opposed others, but I believed they were important \nmatters that deserved the Senate's extended attention.\n  This summer, the Senate seems content to act as an extension of the \nPresident's reelection campaign. Why else would we be considering an \namendment prompted by gay marriages in Massachusetts, 2 weeks before \nDemocrats convene in Boston for their national convention? In light of \nall the talk about potential terrorist activity at the political \nconventions, we should be spending time passing appropriations bills \nfor the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. Instead,\n\n[[Page S8079]]\n\nthis Senate will grind to a halt and ignore its pressing duties to \nconduct a debate whose outcome we all know.\n  I am not naive. I know that politics has always influenced Congress. \nIt could not be otherwise. I fear, however, that the Republican \nleadership has taken the politicization of the Senate to new heights. \nHave we ever taken up a constitutional amendment that did not have the \nsupport even of a firm majority of this body, over the objection of the \nminority party, without even having the Judiciary Committee consider \nit?\n  We should reject this amendment and move on to the matters that make \na difference in the daily lives of our constituents.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President. I wish to discuss, regrettably, the so-\ncalled Federal marriage amendment.\n  Regret is a key word when it comes to this amendment, for several \nreasons.\n  It is regrettable that, in this case, the United States Senate is \ndebating an amendment that intends to turn a revered, sacred document \ninto a political weapon.\n  It is unfortunate that a misinformation campaign about the \nconsequences of this amendment has been waged upon the American public \nby organizations that want to play politics at the expense of gay and \nlesbian Americans.\n  Furthermore, it is regrettable that at a time of challenge and \ndifficulty for our country--when soldiers are at risk abroad, we face \nthreats to face our domestic security, and middle class families \ncontinue to get squeezed financially--the United States Senate is not \ndiscussing the issues that really affect American families.\n  The American people are a diverse lot. As I have traveled around this \ncountry, I have come to notice the vast differences that mark our Union \nof States.\n  I have always seen this diversity as one of our country's strongest \npoints. The Constitution recognizes this as well. The political system \nin this country has survived for well over 200 years, because it \nappreciates diversity, and in fact celebrates the variety of cultures, \nethnicities and lifestyles that make up America.\n  Our Constitution guarantees the right to celebrate and vocalize those \ndifferences. It enumerates, protects and expands the inalienable rights \nto life, liberty and pursuit of happiness that Thomas Jefferson had in \nmind when he penned the Declaration of Independence.\n  However, the spirit of the Constitution is threatened today by the \namendment that is before the United States Senate.\n  As you know, some people are portraying what is happening on this \nissue in Massachusetts as a crisis. This is a blatantly political \ntactic that is used to energize political bases. In an election year, \nwe find such a tactic being used far too often.\n  Unfortunately, when politics is at play--as it is in this case--good \npublic policy often suffers. That is what we are witnessing today.\n  Many are trying to set off the crisis alarm by falsely claiming that \nthe entire country will have to recognize gay marriages conducted in \nMassachusetts. Let me be clear, this assertion is wholly untrue.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act, passed by Congress in 1996, clearly \naffirms the individual states' rights to their particular definition of \nmarriage.\n  Unfortunately, many of my colleagues have come to the floor to \n``predict'' that this law will be overturned on constitutional grounds.\n  This is a hypothetical argument--and a disingenuous one at that--\nbecause several of the individuals who are now claiming that DOMA will \nbe found unconstitutional are some of the same people who actively \nsupported the passage of DOMA, and endorsed its constitutionality, \nalmost a decade ago.\n  The exaggeration of the situation in Massachusetts and empty \npredictions about DOMA being overturned, are all part of a \nmisinformation campaign being waged on behalf of this amendment.\n  Another example of this misinformation campaign is the argument that \nthis amendment does not threaten states' rights to recognize gay and \nlesbian couples through other legal mechanisms, such as civil unions \nand domestic partnerships.\n  In reality, it is far from clear that this amendment will not \nrestrict gay and lesbian couples' rights as its supporters claim.\n  In fact, according to the National League of Cities, the plain \nlanguage of this amendment will result in the elimination of several \nrights and benefits that are guaranteed by states and municipalities \nacross the country.\n  The second sentence of this amendment, as it sits in front of me, \nreads ``Neither this Constitution nor the constitution of any state, \nnor state or federal law, shall be construed to require that the \nmarital status or legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried \ncouples or groups.''\n  What, precisely, is a ``legal incident?'' It doesn't take a legal \nscholar to understand that this sentence threatens gays' and lesbians' \nrights to visit each other in the hospital, share health insurance, or \ninherit each other's property.\n  To this amendment's drafters, ``legal incident'' may just be empty \nwords. However, we know that every word in the Constitution has \nmeaning.\n  I am reminded of a couple from New Jersey, to whom a so-called \n``legal incident'' is more than just empty words.\n  This couple was together for 6\\1/2\\ devoted years.\n  However, their partnership came to a tragic end 6 years ago when one \nwoman, who was pregnant, was killed by a drunk driver.\n  As their relationship was not legal, the hospital did not contact her \npartner. They instead contacted the injured woman's parents. However, \nthe injured woman's parents did not approve of the relationship, so \nthey did not call her partner to tell her that her companion was \ncritically injured.\n  It took a long time before anyone finally called to inform her of her \npartner's failing condition. She finally arrived at the hospital \nfifteen minutes before her partner passed away. Because her visitation \nrights were not protected by law, however, she had no right to see her \npartner.\n  This woman was not allowed to see her partner before her untimely \ndeath. In fact, she was prevented from moving past the waiting area.\n  In addition, the injured woman's parents did not inform the doctor \nthat their daughter wanted to be an organ donor, something their \ndaughter had shared with her partner.\n  They also took all her belongings from the couple's house, some of \nwhich had been accumulated together by the couple.\n  This couple had done all they could under current law to formalize \ntheir relationship. They had formalized health care proxies and powers \nof attorney, but the hospital chose instead to recognize the injured \nwoman's parents and ignore the couple's long term partnership.\n  These are ``legal incidents'' that are under threat: the right to see \none's dying partner in the hospital, the right to make medical \ndecisions for one another, the right to inherit property.\n  I am proud to note that in my home State of New Jersey, the Governor \nsigned a domestic partnership bill that went into effect this past \nweekend.\n  The new law in New Jersey will make sure that such a situation never \nhappens again.\n  It will ensure that committed gay and lesbian couples will never be \nstopped from spending their last moments together.\n  It will ensure that committed couples can make joint financial and \nhealth decisions. And committed couples will be able to own and inherit \njoint property.\n  However, the constitutional amendment we are considering this week \ncan and will take away the rights protected by New Jersey's domestic \npartnership laws. Any statements to the contrary represent a \nfundamental misunderstanding of the vote that members of this body will \nbe making.\n  If the Senate is to consider the legal status of gay and lesbian \nAmericans, let's have that debate. This body should consider the unique \nchallenges faced by gay and lesbian Americans, rather than toss them \naround like a political football.\n  If we are going to talk about strengthening American families, let's \nhave that debate as well. While I have heard a lot of posturing about \nhow this amendment strengthens families, I don't understand how beating \nup on gay couples accomplishes that.\n  I do know that families are stronger when our homeland is secure, \nhealth\n\n[[Page S8080]]\n\ncare is affordable and well-paying jobs are plentiful.\n  New homeland security threats are becoming clearer by the day. Just \nlast week, all Americans were reminded that we are still squarely in \nthe crosshairs of a hidden enemy. A sobering statement from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security acknowledged that members of al-Qaida \nhave the intention and capability to carry out a devastating attack \nwithin the borders of the United States.\n  All the while, the homeland security appropriations bill sits and \nwaits. A bill I drafted that would bolster security at chemical plants \nsits and waits. The assault weapons ban sits and waits.\n  Health care and tuition costs are going through the roof, but we are \nnot considering meaningful legislation to address these pressing needs \nfor middle class families.\n  These are the priorities of the American people. Unfortunately, they \ndo not seem to be the priorities of the United States Senate.\n  Why are we considering this amendment when we all know it is destined \nto fail? Why are America's economic and security priorities being \nshelved in favor of empty rhetoric on this amendment?\n  I wish I had a better response. However, it seems the answer is \nrooted in the politics of an election year.\n  This amendment undermines the Constitution, discriminates against gay \nand lesbian Americans, tramples States' rights, and is distracting this \nbody from the important priorities that our country should be \naddressing.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to join me in voting against this \namendment so that we may put the United States Senate on the record as \nresoundingly opposed to using our Nation's constitution as a political \nweapon.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, over the past several months there has \nbeen much debate about the issue of gay marriage. My record as a \nsteadfast supporter of traditional marriage and strong family values is \nclear and consistent. I believe marriage should be reserved to \nrelationships between a man and a woman.\n  That is why I voted for the Defense of Marriage Act which became \nFederal law in 1996. This law gives States the authority to refuse to \nrecognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. North Dakota \nhas already passed laws to make it clear that North Dakota will not \nrecognize same-sex marriages. So have 37 other States.\n  I strongly support these efforts by States to protect the important \ninstitution of marriage. States have historically regulated marriage, \nand I agree with Vice President Cheney's statement during the 2000 \nelection that marriage should continue to be left up to the States.\n  The question before us is not whether we support traditional \nmarriage, as I do. It is not whether we support families and family \nvalues, as I do. The question before us is whether an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States is necessary and appropriate to \naddress the issue of gay marriage.\n  I believe the Constitution of the United States is one of the \ngreatest documents in human history. It is the framework and the \nfoundation upon which all of our freedoms as Americans are based. The \nFounding Fathers deliberately made amending the Constitution a \ndifficult and lengthy process to preserve the integrity of the document \nand the freedoms it embodies. Congress has amended the Constitution \nonly 27 times in more than 200 years, although more than 10,000 \namendments have been proposed.\n  Throughout my career, I have held the principled position that the \nConstitution should be amended only when all other legislative and \njudicial remedies have been exhausted. Because the Defense of Marriage \nAct is the law of the land and has never been found to have any \nconstitutional problems, I do not believe a constitutional amendment is \nneeded. For that reason, despite my strong support for marriage, I will \nvote against the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are less than 2 weeks away from our \nsummer recess, and we will soon attend our respective parties' \nconventions. It is important to ask what we have accomplished so far \nthis year. Very little.\n  We have hundreds of thousands of troops getting shot at in Iraq with \nno plan in place to stabilize that country.\n  We have sky-rocketing healthcare costs with no plan in place to help \nAmericans get the healthcare they deserve.\n  And we have not done our work around the Senate: we have no budget, \nwe have not done our appropriations, and instead of dealing with these \nreal threats to the American people we are taking up the Senate's time \non an issue that is not going to create one job, bring one soldier \nhome, educate another child, or get a senior affordable prescription \ndrugs.\n  So what are we doing? A constitutional amendment to ban States and \nlocal governments from extending legal marriage rights, \nresponsibilities and obligations to same-sex couples.\n  With all the challenges we as a country currently face, this is one \nof the last things on which the Senate should be working. This is \nelection-year politics pure and simple, in its crassest and worst form.\n  The proponents of this amendment are trying to rally those who \nadamantly oppose gay marriage before the fall elections and distract \nfrom an inability to deliver on the priorities of the American people.\n  It takes 67 votes in favor of a constitutional amendment for it to \npass the Senate.\n  There is no expectation it will pass, yet they are stealing valuable \nwork time from the Senate to play election-year politics.\n  Since this side of the aisle is not in control, we have to take what \nthe majority brings to this floor, so we should address the basic \nquestion in this debate, which is, Should we amend the Constitution on \nthis matter?\n  I say we should not. Our Founding fathers made the constitutional \namendment process a difficult one. Two-thirds of both Houses of \nCongress, along with three-quarters of the State legislatures, must \napprove an amendment. Although it has never occurred, a convention can \nalso be called by the States to amend the Constitution.\n  Since adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1791, the Constitution has \nonly been amended 17 times. Our Founders wanted to use this process \nonly in pressing matters that were serious crises impacting our \nRepublic. As a result, in the 203 years since the passage of the Bill \nof Rights, amending the Constitution has always been used to protect \nand expand rights, not limit them. One exception was prohibition, but \nwe repealed that amendment 14 years after it was ratified.\n  So we have used the constitutional amendment process to address real \nconcerns: to establish our Bill of Rights; to end slavery; to grant \nwomen the right to vote; and to establish Presidential succession. \nThese were real-world problems. These were issues that needed to be \naddressed.\n  The amendment we have in front of us would break with tradition--215 \nyears worth of it--and would restrict liberties and would actually \nwrite discrimination into the Constitution. This amendment would \nrestrict the rights not of all Americans but of one specific group. A \ngroup to whom this Senate 3 weeks ago extended hate crimes protection \nto as part of the Department of Defense Authorization bill.\n  Furthermore, unlike the pressing reasons why we have amended the \nConstitution in the past, invoking the process in this case is based on \na hypothetical. One State--Massachusetts--had a State judicial ruling \nthat their State constitution must allow same-sex marriage.\n  Again, despite the rhetoric on the other side, these are State judges \ninterpreting state law.\n  Currently 38 States, including Washington State, prohibit marriage \nbetween people of the same sex.\n  Congress passed, and President Clinton also signed, the Defense of \nMarriage Act, DOMA, in 1996, which made it clear that on the Federal \nlevel marriage is defined between a man and a woman.\n  At least seven States will also decide this year whether to approve \nState constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage.\n  The national conversation on this issue is still evolving, and we \nshould not move forward with a constitutional change that would stop \nthis discussion dead in its tracks. This is an issue that should be \nleft to the States to decide.\n\n[[Page S8081]]\n\n  States can choose how they want to define marriage, something they \nhave traditionally done, and DOMA allows one State to reject another \nState's recognition of same-sex marriage.\n  There is a law on the books that allows States to do as they see fit. \nMarriage has always been within a State's jurisdiction. There is no \ngood reason, other than politics, to try to change that.\n  I thought the proponents of this amendment claim to be strong State's \nrights advocates.\n  The hypothetical they have invoked in this process, the supposed \nconstitutional crisis, is that the Supreme Court or a Federal court may \nrule these State laws or DOMA unconstitutional. That has not happened, \nnor is there any indication it will happen in the near future.\n  So here we are, using precious floor time, on a hypothetical. \nSomething on which we have never used the amendment process.\n  This is no crisis. There is no constitutional problem. So I reject \nthis amendment. We should not be using the amendment process on this \nissue. We should not be using the Constitution to restrict rights.\n  What we should be doing is addressing the real issues that impact the \nlives of Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to not support this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today the Senate is deciding whether to \nadd an amendment to our United States Constitution that would prohibit \nsame-sex marriages.\n  I agree that the subject of marriage is an important matter. So, too, \nis the prospect of amending the United States Constitution.\n  I also agree with those who say that marriage is an institution that \nshould be reserved for a man and a woman living as a husband and wife. \nI voted for that position when I supported the Defense of Marriage Act \npassed by the U.S. Congress in 1996. That is now Federal law and it \nclearly defines the institution of marriage for our country.\n  In recent months, there have been some challenges to State laws \nprohibiting same-sex marriages. In Massachusetts, the State Supreme \nCourt has ruled that the prohibition of same-sex marriages violates \nthat State's constitution. In California, New York, and New Mexico, \nsome have tried to perform same-sex marriages in violation of State \nlaw, and authorities have taken legal action to stop same-sex \nmarriages.\n  As a result, the only State in our country where same-sex marriages \nare now being performed is Massachusetts. But that State's legislature \nhas begun a process to amend the State's constitution to prohibit same-\nsex marriages. When that is done, there will be no jurisdiction in \nAmerica where same-sex marriages will be legal. I believe that the \nState governments, as has been the case for over two centuries, are \nresolving this issue in a manner that protects the institution of \nmarriage as one that applies only to men and women united as husband \nand wife. Because of that, there is no need at this time to amend the \nUnited States Constitution.\n  The U.S. Constitution is the basic framework for the greatest \ndemocracy on Earth. Some of my colleagues find it easy to amend it. I \ndon't. There have been over 11,000 proposals to change it over the \nyears, 67 of them introduced in this Congress alone. But in almost 220 \nyears we have only approved seventeen amendments to the Constitution \noutside of the Bill of Rights.\n  I am very conservative when it applies to altering our U.S. \nConstitution. I believe it should be amended only as a last resort. And \nin this case, the goal of prohibiting same-sex marriage is being \nachieved without the requirement to amend the U.S. Constitution.\n  I respect those who differ with my judgment, but I simply cannot \nbelieve it is in our country's interest to amend the United States \nConstitution unless it is the only alternative available to solve a \nproblem that is urgent. The work of Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, \nMason, Madison, and others is a document that has given life to the \nmost wonderful place in the world to live. ``We the people'' should \ndedicate ourselves to protecting that Constitution and the things it \nstands for. We should not rush to alter the foundation of our \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, when the Supreme Court in Massachusetts \nissued its ruling on marriage it did what no court ought to do. It set \nitself apart from and above the State and Federal legislatures, and \nwent so far as to order the Massachusetts Legislature to produce a \nremedy in a time period it knew was unworkable and unfair. Even if the \nlegislature is able to draft a change in the law that is acceptable to \nthe court it will be impossible to bring the issue before the voters to \nobtain their consent and approval of the legislature's intrusion on the \nimportant tradition of marriage.\n  Regardless of what we may believe about the institution of marriage, \nthe process of amending the Constitution, or the rights of same-sex \ncouples to marry, there is no question that this is not what the \nFounding Fathers intended when they originally drafted the Constitution \nand established the principles of separation of powers and the right of \nthe governed to have a voice in the laws that are written to govern \nthem. The amendment we have before us is an attempt to remedy that \nsituation and provide guidance and direction from the people of the \nStates to the courts on this matter.\n  As we begin our consideration of this issue, we cannot help but frame \nthe argument in terms of our own experience of marriage and our \nmemories of the marriage of our own mother and father.\n  I was fortunate to have a pair of remarkable parents who worked hard \nand did everything they could to raise their family with a strong \nawareness of the principles and values of the time. One of those \nprinciples was undoubtedly the bonds that tied them together as man and \nwife. I know I am not the only one with such memories of growing up, or \nlater, repeating much of the same modeling when we had families of our \nown. Now, as a grandfather, I am watching the traditions repeat \nthemselves as my son and his wife raise the next generation of our \nfamily.\n  Simply put, that is what this legislation means to me--providing the \ngenerations to come with the same kind of advantages I had in my own \nlife. It is not about denying rights to any group--it is about ensuring \nmarriage, and its importance in our society continues to be encouraged \nand promoted.\n\n  As I have listened to the debate, I have heard it said that this is \nan issue that the States, not Congress, ought to be deciding. I could \nnot agree more that the States need to be heard on this issue. That is \nwhy we are pursuing the remedy of a constitutional amendment in this \nmatter. Even if we were to pass this legislation, however, it would \nstill require the consent of three-fourths of the States.\n  In other words, the debate we begin here will be finished by the \nStates. That way we will ensure that such a radical departure from our \ntraditions and the norm of the institution of marriage will not be \nchanged by the ruling of a court, but by the will of the people who \nwill make their will known through their State legislatures.\n  One argument that has been raised in opposition to the legislation \nbefore us has to do with the rights of same-sex unions as defined by \nthose States that have established civil unions. This bill will do \nnothing to change or alter that process. The States can continue to \nestablish these programs as determined by the will of the people of the \nStates that produce them.\n  This line of reasoning tries to obscure the point that a marriage is \nquite different from a civil union. Marriage is the union of a man and \na woman in a partnership aimed at producing children and nurturing \ntheir growth and development. It is not about social acceptance, or \nabout economic benefits, or an exercise in civil rights, as some would \ntry to lead us to believe. A civil union, on the other hand, is a legal \nagreement that establishes a partnership between two people of the same \nsex to ensure their rights as ``partners'' are preserved in the eyes of \nthe law. A civil union is concerned with matters like the right to an \ninheritance, retirement, death benefits, health insurance and the like. \nMarriage is concerned with matters involving the birth and raising of \nchildren. That is the main difference between the two. Simply put, life \ncomes from the marriage of a man and a woman. No life can come from a \ncivil union.\n  Society clearly has an interest in promoting and encouraging marriage\n\n[[Page S8082]]\n\nand the life it produces because it is the cornerstone upon which all \nour institutions are based. The family is also the main building block \nthat helps form the very structure of our society. If all politics is \nlocal, you cannot get any more local than protecting and preserving the \ninstitution of marriage and the family unit it creates. The family is \nthe basic unit from which neighborhoods are developed and strong \ncommunities are created. That is why society must continue to promote \nmarriage and to afford it all the protections it can. Again, marriage \nis more than just a bond between a man and a woman, it is the basis \nfrom which life is created and children become a part of our world.\n\n  I have often heard it said that if we do not do a good job of raising \nour children, nothing else we accomplish during our lives will matter \nvery much. Studies have shown that a child is better prepared for life \nif that child is raised in a loving, caring environment, with a father \nand a mother. The bonds that are formed, and the lessons learned about \nlife from mom and dad help a child to understand his or her role in the \nworld. It also helps a child begin to develop relationships with \nmembers of the opposite sex. A mother and father serve as role models \nfor a child that help children understand their own role in the world \nas it shapes their relationships with their peers as they grow up and \nbecome adults.\n  Some may try to respond to those points by promoting the cause of \nsame-sex parents. That argument tries to change the subject because \nthat is not what this legislation is about. It is about protecting the \ndefinition of marriage as it was developed and handed down to us for \nmore generations than any of us could count.\n  If we abandon marriage, we abandon the family. And when we convert \nmarriage into a civil right for the sole purpose of indulging a \nperceived ``protected sphere of individual sexual autonomy,'' as some \ncourts have tried to do, we abandon hope, not just for ourselves, but \nespecially for future generations. If we lose our connection across the \ngenerations that have held marriage dear for so long and, as a result, \nthe hearts of fathers and mothers are no longer turned to their \nchildren, and the hearts of children are no longer turned to their \nfathers and mothers, we will have suffered a great and terrible loss, \nindeed.\n  It was just over 10 months ago that I came to the Senate floor to \nannounce the birth of my latest hope for the future, my grandson Trey. \nI shared my dream of his future and welcomed him into this world of \npromise and hope and love.\n  A number of my colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, came to me \nafter that speech and shared with me their own hopes for the future as \nseen in the pictures of their grandchildren. My conclusion from those \nconversations is that all moms and dads, grampas and grammas know what \nit means to have that connection--the ties that bind each generation of \neach family together.\n  From where did that connection come? It was taught to us as we \nlearned about families from our own parents and grandparents who took \nus under their wing and taught us what it means to be a part of a \nfamily. Simply put, they led the best way, by example, and what they \ntaught us continues to guide us and direct us today. As I look back on \nthose days I can see that I was their hope for the future, and they \nwere willing to sacrifice today so that I might have a better tomorrow. \nIt would be a tragedy for the courts to take that same opportunity away \nfrom me and my grandchildren.\n  The legislation we are considering today has one goal in mind--to \nprotect the definition of marriage as it was developed and handed down \nto us from generation to generation. The enactment of this amendment \nwill ensure that we pass that gift on to our children and our \nchildren's children, just as we received it.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I address the issue that has \nbeen before the Senate for the past several days, the proposed \namendment to the U.S. Constitution with regard to marriage.\n  Let me be clear. I support the definition of marriage as a union \nbetween a man and a woman. I fully support the concept of marriage as a \nsacred and solemn social institution. I support the Nebraska \nconstitutional amendment on marriage and I support the Federal law \ndefending marriage. But, I am not convinced we need a Federal \nconstitutional amendment on this issue at this time.\n  As a former Governor, I am intimately familiar with instances where \nthe Federal Government, Congress in particular, has interfered with the \nrights of States to govern. There are countless unfunded and \nunderfunded federal mandates passed along to the States without the \ndollars to back them. There are tax laws and regulations that supersede \nstate law. This is not what our Founding Fathers intended.\n  Thomas Jefferson, Founding Father and American President, fiercely \ndefended the rights of States and believed that the States had the \nright to govern themselves on matters that were not directly authorized \nas the jurisdiction of the Federal Government by the U.S. Constitution.\n  I was pleased to see the good Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, come \nto the floor to express his concerns about this amendment. I echo his \nsentiments by also quoting from the Federalist Paper 45, in which James \nMadison wrote ``the powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to \nthe Federal Government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain \nin the State Governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will \nbe exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, \nnegotiation and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation \nwill for the most part be connected. The powers reserved to the several \nStates will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of \naffairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people, and \nthe internal order, improvement and prosperity of the State.''\n  I agree. Amending the U.S. Constitution, the document most sacred to \nthose who love freedom and liberty, is a delicate endeavor and should \nbe done only on the basis of the most clear and convincing evidence \nthat a proposed amendment is necessary.\n  Proponents of this amendment predict activism in the Federal courts \nwill result in the overturning of State constitutional amendments like \nNebraska. I share that concern, but at this time there has been no \ncourt action overturning a State law on this matter and I remain \nunconvinced that this threat meets the level of urgency required for a \nFederal constitutional amendment at this time.\n  However, I plan to closely monitor the Federal courts and if evidence \nof judicial activism on this issue arises, I reserve the right to \nrevisit this issue and reconsider a Federal constitutional amendment.\n  To the supporters of the amendment I say that I am in agreement with \nyou; I am on your side of this issue. I have been contacted by several \nthousand Nebraskans over recent days, on both sides of the issue. I \nknow that this issue sparks an emotional reaction in most. I appreciate \nhearing from constituents on this issue.\n  Senators are pressured by many and on various issues. Since coming to \nthe Senate I have only felt the pressure to do what is right. In this \ncase, the infringement on States rights is paramount. Until the rights \nof States are overruled by the courts, I believe that opposing this \nconstitutional amendment at this time is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. I rise today in strong support of S.J. \nRes. 40, the Federal marriage amendment. Unfortunately, because some \nare unwilling to address the actual amendment, we are instead holding a \ncloture vote on the motion to proceed to the amendment.\n  I have said it many times before, but I believe it is worth \nrepeating: I do not take amending the United States Constitution \nlightly. This issue was forced upon the United States Congress, \nhowever, by a number of recent events.\n  The most visible, and disturbing event, was the decision by the \nactivist Massachusetts Supreme Court in which they created a right not \nfound in the State constitution or in State law. This is not the only \nevent that has forced us to consider the drastic step of amending the \nConstitution. As you may know, we recently had a situation in my home \nState of New Mexico in which who defines marriage was made very real.\n\n[[Page S8083]]\n\n  A county clerk in New Mexico decided that she would take matters into \nher own hands by issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. She did \nthis despite the fact that neither the New Mexico Constitution nor New \nMexico statutes recognize same-sex marriage. Put another way, the \npeople of New Mexico, as represented by the New Mexico State \nLegislature, have not chosen to recognize same-sex marriage.\n  Instead, we risk a situation like that which took place in \nMassachusetts, where an activist court legislated from the bench. I am \nhopeful that the New Mexico courts will not follow the activist \nMassachusetts court, but it is not a certainty.\n  The Federal marriage amendment that we are considering today would \nensure that the state legislatures, as elected representatives of the \npeople entrusted with the legislative powers, get to decide. It is also \nimportant to remember: from a procedural standpoint, passage of a \nconstitutional amendment by the Senate and the House of Representatives \nis only the first step.\n  When an amendment passes both Chambers with at least two-thirds of \nthe membership present voting for passage, it is sent to the States for \nratification. Then three-fourths of the State legislatures must ratify \nan amendment before it becomes part of the United States Constitution. \nThis means that the States, through the elected representatives of the \npeople, get two different chances to decide the issue.\n  I believe our Founding Fathers were particularly brilliant both in \nproviding a mechanism by which the Constitution can be amended and in \nensuring that it is difficult to do. Unfortunately, I am convinced the \nactions of a few nonlegislators have put us in the position where we \nmust use the process of amending the Constitution.\n  Therefore, I will vote in favor of cloture so the Senate can have the \nopportunity to vote to send this amendment to the States so the State \nlegislatures can act on behalf of the American people in deciding \nwhether to ratify this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Constitution is a document that should \nonly be amended with great caution. This is one of those moments when \nwe would be wise to submit the strong feelings on this issue to careful \ndeliberation.\n  Unfortunately, proponents have chosen to do otherwise. The language \nwe are debating was introduced less than 4 months ago. It is not clear \nwhat text we would even be voting on. The proposed language changes \nalmost daily, like the weather. The amendment was not voted on by the \ncommittee of jurisdiction and we do not have the benefit of a committee \nreport laying out the pros and cons of the amendment.\n  For purposes of comparison, the Congressional Research Service looked \nat constitutional amendments originating in the Senate over the last 40 \nyears. Since 1963, 691 constitutional amendments have originated in the \nSenate. Including cloture votes, only 19 of these measures were voted \non in the Senate. According to CRS, only four times in those 40 years \nhas a constitutional amendment that originated in the Senate been \ndebated in the Senate without first being reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. And of those four times, only the amendment providing \nCongress the power to limit campaign expenditures, versions of which \nwere considered by the full Senate in the 100th, 105th, and 107th \nCongresses, came to the floor without earlier amendments on the same \nsubject having been reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. And \nthat amendment was not adopted. The amendment we are currently debating \nhas received less consideration than any constitutional amendment \noriginating in and voted on in the Senate in at least the last 40 \nyears, with the possible exception of one which was defeated.\n  In 1979, a constitutional amendment providing for the direct election \nof the President and Vice President was brought directly to the Senate \nfloor. Senator Thurmond, then ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, protested the tactic, saying ``The Judiciary Committee is \nthe proper machinery for referral of this resolution. It is set up \nunder our rules for considering a measure of this kind. It should be \nutilized and should not be sidestepped as it attempted to do here with \nthis procedure.'' He was joined by the then ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on the Constitution, Senator Hatch, who said ``To bypass \nthe committee is, I think, to denigrate the committee process, \nespecially when an amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nof America, the most important document in the history of the Nation, \nis involved.''\n  Senators Thurmond and Hatch's efforts to encourage thoughtful \nconsideration were successful and the amendment was referred with \nunanimous consent to the Judiciary Committee for its consideration. Our \nconsideration of the pending amendment would also benefit from such a \nprocess.\n  One purpose of the pending amendment is stated to be to protect one \nState from imposing its view of marriage on other States. But this \ndebate is taking place before the courts have even had the chance to \ndetermine the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, which \nalmost all of us voted for, which says that ``No State . . . shall be \nrequired to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial \nproceeding or any other State . . . respecting a relationship between \npersons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of \nsuch other State . . . or a right or claim arising from such \nrelationship.'' Defense of Marriage Act defines ``marriage'' as ``only \na legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.''\n  Even though the Defense of Marriage Act has yet to be tested in \ncourt, some proponents of the pending amendment have claimed the act \nwill be ruled unconstitutional and that the full faith and credit \nclause of the Constitution will force States opposed to same-sex \nmarriages to recognize same-sex marriages established in other States. \nHowever, many experts disagree.\n  In her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, \nProfessor R. Lea Brilmayer, a Yale Law School expert on the full faith \nand credit clause, cited the Supreme Court in Pacific Employers \nInsurance Company v. Industrial Accident Commission, 1939: ``We think \nthe conclusion is unavoidable that the full faith and credit clause \ndoes not require one state to substitute for its own statute, \napplicable to persons and events within it, the conflicting statute of \nanother state, even though that statute is of controlling force in the \ncourts of the state of its enactment . . .'' Professor Brilmayer \ntestified that less formal legal instruments, such as marriage \nlicenses, have been ``entitled to less recognition even than \nlegislation'' and that ``marriages entered into in one state have never \nbeen constitutionally entitled to automatic recognition in other \nstates.''\n  Amending the Constitution should be a measure of last resort. The \nDefense of Marriage Act should be tested in court before a \nconstitutional amendment is considered, the purpose of which is to \nachieve the purpose of the statute.\n  In addition, the language of S.J. Res. 40 itself contains a host of \nproblems. The amendment reads, ``Marriage in the United States shall \nconsist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither this \nConstitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be construed to \nrequire that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon \nany union other than the union of a man and a woman.''\n  Not surprisingly, given the lack of deliberation, there appear to be \ndifferences of opinion on what the amendment provides.\n  Some have argued that the amendment's language relative to ``legal \nincidents'' of marriage does not ban civil unions or the extension of \nother rights to same-sex couples. But here is what Professor Cass \nSunstein, a leading constitutional scholar at the University of Chicago \nLaw School, has to say:\n\n       What is meant by ``the legal incidents thereof''? Does this \n     provision ban civil unions? Does it forbid States from \n     allowing people in same-sex relationships to have the \n     (spousal) right to visit their partners in hospitals? Does it \n     bear on rules governing insurance? At first glance, the term \n     ``legal incidents thereof'' appears to forbid States from \n     making cautious steps in the direction of permitting civil \n     unions. And does the word ``require'' include ``permit''? Or \n     consider the recent Allard amendment, which says that neither \n     the federal Constitution nor any state Constitution shall be \n     construed to require that marriage or ``the legal incidents \n     thereof'' must be ``conferred'' on same-sex marriages. The \n     most serious difficulty is that the words ``legal incidents \n     thereof'' raise the same questions about civil unions and \n     spousal benefits and privileges.\n\n\n[[Page S8084]]\n\n\n  For all these reasons, I will vote no.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today the Senate faces a cloture vote which \nwe should never have faced. We have been put in this position by a \nmajority leadership that is toying with the faith and the trust of \npeople across this country. I share their faith, and I share their \nbelief in the sanctity of marriage. I am very disappointed that we have \na procedural vote, instead of a vote in direct consideration of a \nconstitutional amendment. What these people want is a vote, up or down; \nwhat they are going to get is more rigamarole in this Senate. The \nmajority party is manipulating the faith of many Americans, with the \nunwitting aid of many well-meaning religious leaders, which is one of \nthe most disappointing aspects of this issue.\n  The majority party does not expect to win this cloture vote. In fact, \nthe majority party likely does not want to win this cloture vote. The \nWhite House and the Republican leadership want to campaign on the fact \nthat Democrats blocked this amendment, that Democrats somehow oppose \nmarriage. How ludicrous. Yet, the Republican leadership will try to \ncapitalize on this procedural vote with fundraising letters, campaign \nstops, and election-day votes. It is an abomination, an absolute \nfailure of trust, to hatch such calculated political schemes on those \nAmericans who genuinely believe in this issue.\n  The majority party wants this cloture motion to fail. I, for one, \nwill not help in that effort. I will not help to manipulate the \nchurches and the pulpits across this country. I will call that bluff, \nand vote for cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  While I strongly support, and will continue to staunchly defend, \nefforts to strengthen and preserve marriage in our society, I oppose \namending the U.S. Constitution based on the resolution that is before \nthis Senate. The resolution is rife with contradictions and ambiguities \nthat would, with certainty, lead to nothing but confusion and endless \nlitigation in the future. I had hoped that the Senate would have been \ngiven the opportunity to debate and to vote clearly, yes or no, on that \nproposal, and not cloud the debate with procedural votes that few \noutside of this Capitol understand.\n  We are in a phase in this country's history that seems to tend toward \nthe belief that cultural conflict, deep wrenching questions about right \nand wrong, should be fodder for political games. That view is high \nfolly when the legislative vehicle is the Constitution of these United \nStates. As much as I sympathize with the deep personal and religious \nconvictions of those who revere the institution of marriage, we must \nnot start down the road of using our national charter to win political \nor culture wars. Such a course could lead to the unraveling of \nindividual freedoms and eventually could leave our Constitution in \ntatters and disrepute--making our beloved Federal charter the most \ntragic and dramatic victim of the fierce, unprincipled, political \nconflicts that rage in our land today.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to join the bipartisan \nmajority in this Senate in opposition to the motion to proceed to S.J. \nRes. 40, the Federal marriage amendment, to the United States \nConstitution. I strongly support, and have voted for, Federal \nlegislation that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman; \nhowever, there is no need at this time to take the extraordinary step \nof amending our Constitution. Since l996, Federal law has allowed the \nrespective States to refuse to recognize another State's gay marriage \nlaws, and it also expresses the congressional view that the institution \nof marriage should be limited to a union between a man and a woman.\n  I have recently been contacted by a great many religious \norganizations, including the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, \nELCA, my own denomination, as well as the Alliance of Baptists, the \nEpiscopal Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the United Church of \nChrist, among others, asking me to oppose this proposed constitutional \namendment. While I do not ``take orders'' from any religious group, \nincluding my own, this does confirm that my opposition to this \namendment is consistent with the views of millions of devout Christians \nthroughout South Dakota and America.\n  Further, because Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist was unable to \nsecure any consensus behind the specific language of any one marriage \namendment, he will not allow the Senate to take a direct up-or-down \nvote on a marriage amendment. I commend Senator Tom Daschle for asking \nfor a direct vote on this matter. However, Senator Frist objected, and \nnow we find ourselves in an incredible situation where Senator Frist \nwants the Senate to vote on a wide range of possible amendments which \ncould profoundly impact the Constitution. If this motion to proceed \nprevails, we would have endless amendments offered to the Constitution \non any topic under the sun. That is utterly irresponsible, and I will \nhave nothing to do with helping to pass Senator Frist's motion to \nproceed.\n  Lastly, I take issue with the timing of this debate. After this vote \nwe will have a mere 26 legislative days left in the 108th Congress. \nCurrently, 9 of the 13 appropriations bills have not even received \ncommittee approval. Only two of those bills have passed the full \nAppropriations Committee and only one has passed the full Senate. Time \nis short. Knowing that this amendment will not even be voted on, and \nthat the motion to proceed will be defeated by bipartisan opposition, \nthere are significantly more important matters this body should be \nattending to. I am enclosing a relevant editorial on this issue from \nthe highly respected New York Times.\n  There are real problems facing our Nation--job losses, health care, \neducation, senior citizen challenges and agricultural issues among \nthem. Yet the Senate has spent days debating an amendment that even \nSenator Frist concedes will not come even close to passage. This is a \npolitically inspired amendment--one that has not even been considered \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee. The American people deserve better \nthan this mockery of a legislative process.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced editorial in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 14, 2004]\n\n                        Politicking on Marriage\n\n       It is heartening to see that the Republicans who had hoped \n     to score political points today by holding a Senate vote on \n     adding a ban on same-sex marriage to the Constitution have \n     run into unexpectedly broad resistance across the ideological \n     spectrum. Liberals and moderates opposed to writing bigotry \n     into the Constitution are being joined by a growing number of \n     conservatives who see nothing conservative about federalizing \n     marriage law or turning America's most essential legal \n     document into an election-year football. With support for the \n     amendment now well below the necessary 67 senators, the calls \n     to put it to a vote just before the Democratic National \n     Convention are nothing more than divisive politics. The \n     Senate should let the Federal Marriage Amendment die a quite \n     death.\n       Early in the election season, Republicans seized on gay \n     marriage as a promising cultural issue to use against \n     Democrats. Republicans have been working hard to put \n     referendums against gay marriage on individual state ballots \n     to draw religious conservatives to the polls in November. In \n     Washington, Congressional Republicans have been eager to \n     schedule a vote on the Federal Marriage Amendment to force \n     Democrats--particularly Senators John Kerry and John Edwards, \n     who oppose both gay marriage and the amendment--to take a \n     public stand.\n       One great surprise of this campaign, however, has been just \n     how little traction the issue is getting. Polls show that \n     even many voters who oppose gay marriage do not favor the \n     drastic step of amending the Constitution to prohibit it. And \n     most Americans have the good sense to realize that, whatever \n     their feelings about same-sex marriage, issues like the \n     economy and the war in Iraq matter much more. When President \n     Bush campaigned recently in Ohio, where conservatives are \n     trying to put a gay-marriage ban on the ballot, he was \n     greeted by a newspaper advertisement taken out by a gay-\n     rights group that said: ``Jobs lost in Ohio since 2001: \n     255,000; gay marriages in Ohio: 0. Focus on Americans' real \n     priorities, Mr. President.''\n       Even many conservative Republicans, it turns out, do not \n     favor a constitutional amendment. In Washington State, George \n     Nethercutt, the conservative Republican congressman running \n     against Senator Patty Murray, has joined Ms. Murray in \n     opposing it. Lynne Cheney, the vice president's wife and a \n     leading cultural conservative in her own right, said recently \n     that states should take the lead in deciding issues relating \n     to marriage.\n       Now it appears that the Federal Marriage Amendment may not \n     have the support of a Senate majority, much less the two-\n     thirds that constitutional amendments need. Since\n\n[[Page S8085]]\n\n     the effort appears futile, backers of the amendment seem to \n     be trifling with the issue simply to rally their base. The \n     Constitution, the embodiment of American democracy, deserves \n     better than that.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to ensure that all voices are \nheard in the debate over the proposed amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution on the issue of marriage. I have received compelling \ncorrespondence from Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Local Officials, GLBLO--a \ncaucus of the National League of Cities--the full text of which \ndeserves to be included in Senate consideration of this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter from \nthe Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Local Officials, GLBLO, board of \ndirectors be printed in the Record.\n                                                    July 14, 2004.\n       Dear United States Senator: On behalf of the Gay, Lesbian \n     and Bisexual Local Officials (GLBLO) Board of Directors and \n     members, a caucus of the National League of Cities working to \n     influence federal policy and municipal relations, we are \n     writing to urge you to vote ``NO'' on S.J. Res. 30 and S.J. \n     Res. 40, respectively, a proposed constitutional amendment to \n     ban same-sex marriage. We are also asking for a vote against \n     ``cloture'' so that the Senate may engage in a full debate of \n     the issue.\n       The first sentence of the ``Federal Marriage Amendment'' \n     provides, ``Marriage in the United States shall consist only \n     of the union of a man and woman.'' GLBLO is opposed to the \n     federal preemption of states to determine marriage. The 10th \n     Amendment of the Constitution clearly confers upon states the \n     authority to determine marriage. The federal intrusion into \n     the state's authority to define marriage is unnecessary. \n     Unfortunately, this proposed preemptive language would also \n     reverse the constitutional tradition of expanding and \n     protecting individual liberties.\n       Second, GLBLO is opposed to the wording of the second \n     sentence of the proposed amendment which would prohibit the \n     federal government and states from conferring ``the legal \n     incidents'' of marriage on unmarried couples. The proposed \n     language could have the far-reaching negative effect \n     preempting state and local laws, as well as private \n     businesses that provide benefits to the partners of their \n     employees. This is particularly troubling given the fact that \n     neither the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution nor the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee vetted the impact of the language. \n     The Constitution of the United States deserves more careful \n     consideration by the Senate, especially when the proposed \n     amendment would break from the traditional historical civil \n     rights practice of allowing stronger state laws.\n       In closing, we ask the Senate to redirect its energies to \n     address the priorities of the nation's cities--such as \n     homeland security, transportation reauthorization, and full \n     funding of social service programs, before taking this \n     historical step of eroding the role of state governments in \n     protecting same-sex and unmarried couples in their states.\n           Sincerely,\n     Greg Pettis,\n       Mayor Pro Tem, Cathedral City, California, At-Large Board \n     Member, Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Local Elected Officials \n     (GLBLO).\n     Rand Haglund,\n       Councilmember, Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, At-Large Board \n     Member, Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Local Elected Officials \n     (GLBLO).\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S.J. Res. 40, the \nFederal Marriage Amendment to the Constitution. Let me begin my remarks \nby plainly stating my position on the issues raised by this amendment.\n  First, it is my strong personal belief that marriage is between a man \nand a woman. Second, principles of federalism dictate that the right \nand the responsibility to define marriage belong to the States. Third, \nthe proper role of the Federal Government is to ensure that each State \ncan exercise that right and responsibility by preventing, as the \nDefense of Marriage Act does, one State from imposing its view on \nothers.\n  The amendment under consideration would potentially affect two types \nof relationships that are fundamental to our society. The first is the \nunion between a man and a woman. The second is the compact between the \nStates and the Federal Government. In our zeal to protect the former, \nwe must not do unnecessary violence to the latter, as it is the bedrock \nof our country's unique and highly successful Federal system.\n  We also must not overreact to the decision of a single court in a \nsingle State by rushing to amend the Constitution and stripping away \nfrom our states a power they have exercised, wisely for the most part, \nfor more than 200 years. Let us remember that no State legislature has \nsanctioned same-sex marriage. Nor has there been a popular referendum \nto that effect in any State. Indeed, this amendment is a response to a \nsingle court decision--and a 4-3 decision at that. If just one judge on \nthe Massachusetts court had a different view of this issue, we would \nnot be contemplating the dramatic action of amending the Constitution.\n  Put differently, where is the evidence that we cannot trust the \nStates in this area? More than 40 States have enacted laws or \nConstitutional amendments that expressly limit marriage to the union of \none man and one woman. Maine law explicitly states that ``[p]ersons of \nthe same sex may not contract marriage,'' and further provides that \nMaine will not recognize marriages performed in other jurisdictions \nthat would violate the legal requirements in Maine. Thus, even if \nlawfully performed in another State, a same-sex marriage will not be \nvalid in Maine.\n  In short, I respect the right of the people of Maine and the citizens \nof other States to define marriage within their boundaries. Were I a \nmember of the Maine legislature, I would vote in favor of a law \nlimiting marriage to the union of one man and one woman.\n  This does not mean that Congress can play no role in this area. To \nthe contrary, Congress has two very important roles. The first is to \nprotect the right of each State to define marriage within its own \nborders, and the second is to define marriage for Federal purposes.\n  To its credit, Congress did both of these when it enacted the Defense \nof Marriage Act, or DOMA, in 1996. Signed into law by President \nClinton, DOMA enjoyed broad, bipartisan support in both chambers of \nCongress, passing by a margin of 85-14 in the Senate and 342-67 in the \nHouse. The statute grants individual states autonomy in deciding how to \nrecognize marriages and other unions within their borders, and ensures \nthat no State can compel another to recognize marriages of same-sex \ncouples. Of equal importance, DOMA defines marriage for Federal \npurposes as ``the legal union between one man and one woman as husband \nand wife.'' I strongly endorse both of the principles codified by DOMA, \nand should legislation come before the Senate reaffirming DOMA, I would \nvote without reservation to support it.\n  Even though DOMA has not been successfully challenged during the 8 \nyears since its enactment, many supporters of the Federal marriage \namendment point to the Supreme Court's recent decision in Lawrence v. \nTexas as presaging DOMA's ultimate demise on Constitutional grounds. \nThey argue that DOMA's vulnerability necessitates approving the \namendment under consideration.\n  I reject that argument for two reasons. First, the conclusion that \nDOMA is inevitably destined to die a Constitutional death is \ninconsistent with language in the Lawrence decision. In striking down a \nTexas statute criminalizing certain private sexual acts between \nconsenting adult homosexuals, the majority opinion written by Justice \nKennedy was careful to note that the case before the Court:\n\n     . . . does not involve whether the government must give \n     formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual \n     persons seek to enter.\n\n  In her concurring opinion, Justice O'Connor was even more explicit \nwhen she observed that the invalidation of the Texas statute:\n\n     . . . does not mean that other laws distinguishing between \n     heterosexuals and homosexuals would similarly fail. . . \n     .Unlike the moral disapproval of same-sex relations--the \n     asserted state interest in this case--other reasons exist to \n     promote the institution of marriage beyond mere moral \n     disapproval of an excluded group.\n\n  These statements persuade me that the Supreme Court is, in fact, \nunlikely to strike down DOMA.\n  Second, even if DOMA is eventually invalidated, the answer is not to \nabandon our principles of federalism but rather to enshrine them in the \nConstitution. Thus, if we ultimately have to address this matter as a \nConstitutional issue, and we should do so only as a last resort, it \nshould not be to strip the States of the right to define marriage but \nrather to expressly validate a role they have been playing for more \nthan 2 centuries.\n\n[[Page S8086]]\n\n  Let me end where I began. This amendment is not just about \nrelationships between men and women but also about the relationship \nbetween the States and the Federal Government. I would not let a one-\nvote majority opinion of a single state court lead us to ascribe to \nWashington a power that rightfully belongs to the states. To the \ncontrary, our role should be to safeguard the ability of each State to \nexercise that power within its own borders.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Joint \nResolution 40, the Federal Marriage Amendment. The Judiciary Committee, \non which I serve, has held four hearings on the Federal Marriage \nAmendment. In addition, other committees have held three more hearings \non the FMA. We have heard substantial and compelling testimony on the \nimportance of traditional marriage. The time has come for this body to \nact. Marriage is an institution cultures have endorsed and promoted for \nthousands of years. It is important for us to stand up now and protect \ntraditional marriage which is under attack by a few unelected judges \nand litigious activists.\n  Last year, the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts announced the \nMassachusetts State Constitution requires the state to grant marriage \nlicenses to same-sex couples. Through their activism, the court ignored \nthe will of the people and created a new state constitutional right. \nThis violation of the democratic process calls for a response.\n  I have special sympathy for the plight of the people of \nMassachusetts, because I see courts deciding cases wrongly on an all-\ntoo-frequent basis. Of the cases appealed and decided from the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals this term, the circuit with jurisdiction over \nIdaho, the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned 15 while affirming 9. \nJudicial activism of the type we see in Massachusetts is not new, but \nthis is a uniquely deep cut to the heart of society. We need to pass \nthe Federal Marriage Amendment to restore the people to their proper \nand constitutional role as the only sovereign in our great nation.\n  I am cautious about amending the U.S. Constitution. It has served us \nwell for more than two centuries, and I expect it to last for centuries \nto come. One reason it endures is its resilience in the face of \nchanging times, thanks in large part to its amendability. We have seen \nfit to amend our Constitution 27 times on 17 different occasions. Each \nof these has addressed an issue of importance to the people. Marriage \ntoo, is an important issue to the people.\n  Some opponents speak of this proposed amendment as an attempt to take \nrights away. That is neither the purpose nor effect of S.J. Res. 40. \nAmending our Constitution is the way the people can correct the courts \nwhen the courts get an issue wrong. For instance, the states ratified \nthe Thirteenth Amendment 7 short years after the Dred Scott v. Sanford \ndecision by the U.S. Supreme Court, righting the wrong of slavery that \nhad been perpetuated by the courts.\n  The amendments to our Constitution blaze a clear trail extending the \npeople's right of self determination. The Fifteenth, Nineteenth, and \nTwenty-Sixth Amendments all extended the franchise to new groups. Yet \nwhat good is the franchise, if that voice falls on deaf ears because a \nfew activist judges choose to replace the will of the people with their \nown? Though I am cautious about amending our Constitution, preserving \nthe sovereign right of the people warrants an amendment and our \nsupport.\n  My colleagues have eloquently set forth many good reasons to support \nthe FMA and I will reiterate only one. We need to pass this amendment \nfor the sake of children. Marriage encourages people to organize in the \nway that is best for those who may issue from, or enter into, that \nrelationship, according to researchers studying family structures for \nraising children. This amendment does not criticize or undermine other \nkinds of families, but it acknowledges society's interest in promoting \ntraditional marriage as the environment for child rearing.\n  There are several reasons I support this amendment at this time. No \nfewer than 42 States have defined marriage as being between one man and \none woman. This amendment to the U.S. Constitution is the only way to \nkeep this issue in the hands of the people and their elected \nrepresentatives. This amendment allows the citizens of each state to \nestablish systems to recognize same-sex relationships if they so \nchoose, walking the appropriate line through federalism and separation \nof powers.\n  My colleagues and I did not choose the time for this debate. The \njudicial activists of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court have \nbrought this issue to a head. Passing S.J. Res. 40 will give the people \nand the states the ability to protect children, bolster traditional \nmarriage as a social building block, and preserve the role of the \npeople as the sovereign in our political system. I encourage my \ncolleagues to also support S.J. Res. 40.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to discuss my \nvote and views on the Federal marriage amendment. I am voting in favor \nof cloture on the motion to proceed to this amendment. I do so \nprimarily to ensure that our debate on this mater be concluded and that \nwe return our attention to the other pressing issues of the day, \nincluding the announcement by Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge \nthat it is anticipated that al-Qaida will attack the U.S. again before \nthe next election. We in this Chamber must grapple with many very \nserious issues including national security, terrorism, the economy, and \nour appropriations bills. It is time to return to this important work.\n  Voting for cloture to cut off debate means only that we take up the \nsubstance of the amendment to conclude the Senate's consideration of \nthe matter. While the cloture vote is only procedural, I do want to \naddress the merits of the amendment.\n  When the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld same-sex \nmarriage earlier this year, I stated that I believed marriage was a \nsacred institution between a man and a woman, as evidenced by my vote \nin favor of the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. At that time, I \nfurther stated that I thought that Massachusetts would amend its State \nconstitution, which was the basis for the Massachusetts decision, that \nthe full faith and credit clause did not apply, and that the Federal \nDefense of Marriage Act trumped State court decisions. I added that if \nthe States could not uphold the sanctity of marriage between a man and \na woman, I would consider a U.S. constitutional amendment. That \ncontinues to be my position today.\n  Both the Federal Defense of Marriage Act and the Federal marriage \namendment seek to preserve the traditional definition of marriage as \nthe union between one man and one woman. Yet amending the Constitution \nraises a number of issues that were not raised by legislation. All of \nus in this body must pause and ask ourselves whether the problem before \nus necessitates this extra and most serious step.\n  As a matter of traditional and sound constitutional doctrine, an \namendment to the Constitution should be the last resort when all other \nmeasures have proved inadequate. In Federalist No. 43, James Madison \nwarned ``against the extreme facility'' of constitutional amendment \n``which would render the Constitution too mutable.'' In Federalist No. \n49, Madison returned to this theme, noting that amendments to the \nConstitution should be reserved for ``certain great and extraordinary \noccasions.''\n  Madison's caution has been carefully followed throughout American \nhistory. To date, 11,212 resolutions to amend the Constitution have \nbeen introduced in Congress. Yet the Constitution has been amended only \n27 times.\n  In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last March, \nProfessor Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School noted \nthat all but two of these 27 amendments fall into two traditional \ncategories. Most amendments to the Constitution have expanded \nindividual rights. In this category fall the first 10 amendments--the \nBill of Rights--as well as the post-Civil War amendments and the \namendments extending the right to vote to women and lowering the voting \nage to 18. The rest of the amendments have remedied problems in the \nstructure of government itself, such as clarifying the functioning of \nthe Electoral College, establishing the popular election of Senators, \ncreating the income tax, and placing term limits on our Presidents.\n\n[[Page S8087]]\n\n  To date, only two amendments have fallen outside of these two \ncategories of expanding individual rights and fixing structural \nproblems. The first such amendment was the eighteenth amendment, which \nprohibited the manufacture or sale of ``intoxicating liquors'' in \nAmerica. The second amendment to fall outside of the two traditional \ncategories was the twenty-first amendment, which repealed the \neighteenth amendment and ended prohibition.\n  As this history illustrates, when the Constitution is amended to \nincorporate the majority's position on the controversial issues of the \nday--and not to expand rights or fix a structural problem--the results \ndo not withstand the test of time. We all must bear this in mind \nwhenever we contemplate amending our Constitution. The Senate, after \nall, is intended to be the saucer that cools the tea, the necessary \nfence between the passions of the day and our Constitution and laws. We \nmust pause where others would rush in.\n  We are having this debate on the Federal marriage amendment today \nbecause on November 18, 2003, Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court \ndecided in the case of Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that \nsame sex couples have the right to marry. In determining whether this \ncourt's recognition of same-sex marriage is one of the ``great and \nextraordinary occasions'' that warrants an amendment to our \nConstitution, we must at the outset consider whether there are other, \nlesser alternatives to deal with the issue. If lesser alternatives will \nwork, then we clearly should not tinker with our Constitution. If, \nhowever, we cannot preserve the sanctity of marriage between a man and \na woman by other means, then an amendment to the U.S. Constitution may \nvery well be necessary.\n  Before we even look to the Federal Government for a solution, we must \nfirst evaluate whether the States themselves have the power to stop \nsame-sex marriages. The fact is that those States in which there have \nbeen same-sex marriages have already mobilized to stop them. The \nMassachusetts legislature has already passed an amendment to the \nMassachusetts State Constitution prohibiting same-sex marriage. This \namendment must be passed a second time in 2006, and then approved by \nthe voters, before it is finally ratified. But few doubt the eventual \noutcome.\n  Some may argue that waiting until 2006 to stop same-sex marriage in \nMassachusetts is simply too long. Yet it is clearly simpler, more \ndirect, and faster to deal with this issue by amending one State \nconstitution than by amending the U.S. Constitution. To enact an \namendment to the U.S. Constitution, three-quarters of the States--38 \nStates--must ratify the amendment after two-thirds passage by the \nSenate and the House of Representatives. The average time of \nratification is approximately 2 years, with some amendments taking as \nlong as 3 years until ratification.\n  When a couple of cities outside of Massachusetts recently sought to \nrecognize same-sex marriages, the State courts have moved in quickly \nand effectively to stop them. In February, 2004, Gavin Newsom, the \nmayor of San Francisco, permitted his city to issue marriage licenses \nto same-sex couples. The California Supreme Court issued an injunction \nordering San Francisco to stop issuing these marriage licenses. Also in \nFebruary, 2004, Jason West, the mayor of New Paltz, NY, conducted a \nnumber of same-sex marriages without licenses. The New York State \nSupreme Court issued an injunction ordering Mayor West to stop \nperforming these ceremonies.\n\n  The fact is that most States in the Union have already taken some \naction to prevent same-sex marriage. Even before the Goodridge decision \nin Massachusetts, 38 States had passed laws similar to DOMA which \ndefine marriage as a union between a man and a woman and refuse to \nhonor same-sex marriages from other States. Three States--Alaska, \nNebraska and Nevada-- had ratified constitutional amendments banning \nsame-sex marriage.\n  Since the Goodridge decision, 21 States have taken additional action \nto prohibit same-sex marriage, by strengthening prior prohibitions or \nenacting new ones: Seven State legislatures have adopted legislation \nthat, if approved by the people in a referendum, would amend the State \nconstitution to prohibit same-sex marriages; three State legislatures \nhave adopted similar constitutional language which must be re-approved \nin a subsequent legislative session before being placed on the ballot; \nsix States have citizen-initiated ballot measures to change the State \nconstitution to prohibit same-sex marriage; and five States have \nadopted legislation that declares or reaffirms that same-sex marriages \nwill not be honored in the State.\n  Thus the States are moving effectively to preclude same-sex \nmarriages. Even if a state fails to stop same-sex marriage, however, it \nis important to remember that there is a second line of defense: the \nremaining States of the Union would not have to recognize such \nmarriages. In 1996, Congress enacted, and President Clinton signed, the \nDefense of Marriage Act, DOMA. DOMA defines marriage as a legal union \nbetween one man and one woman and specifically provides that:\n\n       No State. . . shall be required to give effect to any \n     public act, record or judicial proceeding of any other State. \n     . . respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex \n     that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other \n     State. . . or a right or claim arising from such \n     relationship.\n\n  DOMA is good law. In fact, to date no significant challenge to the \nconstitutionality of DOMA has been filed. No civil rights group or \nnational advocate of same-sex marriage has sought to challenge this law \nin court. Those challenges that have been filed to date have been \nlocalized, individual efforts. It has been reported that a private \npractitioner in Florida has recently filed a case challenging the \nconstitutionality of DOMA in the District Court in Miami. It has also \nbeen reported that DOMA has been challenged in connection with a case \nin bankruptcy court in Washington State where the defendant is \nrepresenting herself.\n  Thus DOMA appears poised to remain the law of the land. Even if DOMA \nwere one day found to be unconstitutional, however, the full faith and \ncredit clause would not obligate States to recognize out-of-State same-\nsex marriages. The full faith and credit clause applies to ``public \nActs, Records, and judicial Proceedings.'' 28 USC 1738, which \nelaborates on the items to be accorded full faith and credit, specifies \n``acts of the legislature,'' and ``the records and judicial proceedings \nof any court.'' Marriage is neither an act of the legislature nor a \n``judicial proceeding.''\n  Traditionally, States have not been bound to recognize marriages if, \na, they have a significant relationship with the people being married, \nand, b, the marriage at issue violates a strongly held public policy. \nFor example, section 283 of the Second Restatement of Conflict of Laws \nprovides that a marriage will be valid everywhere so long as it is \nvalid in the State where it was performed, ``unless it violates the \nstrong public policy of another State which had the most significant \nrelationship to the spouses and the marriage at the time of the \nmarriage.''\n  On this basis, States have refused to recognize the marriage of a \nperson who has recently divorced without an intervening waiting period \nwhen such marriage violates their public policy. Other States have \nrefused to recognize marriages between certain types of relatives, even \nthough they were legal in the State in which they were preformed. There \nis no Supreme Court ruling to the effect that the refusal to recognize \nmarriages from other States on public policy grounds violates the full \nfaith and credit clause.\n  On this state of the record, it is premature to consider altering the \nConstitution, the most successful organic document in history which has \npreserved and enshrined the values of our Nation. If the States cannot \npreserve the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman, I would \nconsider an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I support S.J. Res. 40, the Federal \nmarriage amendment. The Constitution provides the basic framework under \nwhich our society will function. With its profound implications for the \nordering of society, and especially the upbringing of children, the \nproper meaning of marriage is no less important and deserving of \nprotection than other basic principles protected by the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S8088]]\n\n  Two decades of modern social science have arrived at the conclusion \nborne out by at least two millennia of human experience: that family \nstructure matters for children and hence for society, and the family \nstructure that helps children the most is a family headed by a mom and \na dad. There is thus value for children in promoting strong, stable \nmarriages between biological parents.\n  A bare majority of judges in one State, however, recently ignored the \nsincere and well-formed beliefs of their fellow citizens on this issue \nand have redefined the ages-old meaning of marriage for their State. In \nthe process, these judges gave short shrift to the State's rational \ninterest in wanting to encourage traditional marriage to ensure the \noptimum environment for children, terming the people's belief in \ntraditional marriage as ``rooted in persistent prejudices.''\n  In our highly mobile and inter-connected society, these judges' \nredefinition of marriage risks the reordering of that institution for \nthe rest of us. And these judges are not alone. There are currently \nmore than 35 lawsuits in 11 States challenging State and Federal \nDefense of Marriage Acts and State constitutional provisions that \nprotect the institution of marriage as it has always been known. By \ncomparison, just a year ago, there were only five such cases.\n  The question, then, is whether the American people, through the \ndemocratic process, will be allowed to continue to encourage and \nformally sanction this ideal family structure--the union of one man and \none woman--to the exclusion of other relationships that adults may \nchoose to enter into. The issue of whether our Nation will continue \nunder this time-tested societal order is thus before us. It is an issue \nnot of our own making, and its timing is not of our choosing.\n  Just a few years ago, it was beyond dispute that the American people \nhad both the right and the capacity to define marriage. Our \nconstitutional structure does not leave all the important questions to \nthe courts with the people and their elected representatives relegated \nto dealing with the mundane and the trivial.\n  Nor is this question--``What is marriage?''--something only judges \nare smart enough to decide. As lawyers, jurists are not experts in \ntheology or religion or sociology. While they are entitled to express \ntheir wishes on matters like the meaning of marriage, they should do so \nat the ballot box, just like everyone else. Their failure to do so \nshows both a disdain and a distrust for the views of the people.\n  Opponents of this measure show a similar distrust, although they \narticulate other reasons for opposing it. First, they say the issue of \nmarriage does not rise to a level of importance worthy of amending the \nConstitution. Really? We last amended the Constitution in 1992 with the \n27th amendment, which had to do with pay raises for Members of \nCongress. Are we saying that pay raises for Representatives and \nSenators is more important than our most basic societal institution?\n  The experience of the countries that have departed from the marriage \ntradition, like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, demonstrates the risks in \nfailing to protect traditional marriage. According to Stanley Kurtz, a \nresearch fellow at the Hoover Institution, the onset of gay marriage in \nthese countries has not simply accelerated a decline in the number of \ntraditional marriages; rather, it has accelerated an abandonment of the \ninstitution itself, with the attendant problems of increased family \ndissolution rates and out-of-wedlock births.\n\n  Norway and Sweden instituted de facto gay marriage in 1993 and 1994, \nrespectively. Between 1990 and 2000, Norway's out-of-wedlock birthrate \nrose from 39 to 50 percent, while Sweden's rose from 47 to 55 percent. \nThus, most children in Norway and Sweden are now born out-of-wedlock. \nIn addition, Denmark has seen a 25 percent increase in cohabiting \ncouples with children since the advent of de facto gay marriage in \n1989. In fact, 60 percent of first-born children in Denmark now have \nunmarried parents. Mr. Kurtz reports that the Netherlands has also had \na steady increase in out-of-wedlock births since its adoption of \nregistered partnerships and then gay marriage within the last 7 years.\n  If these statistics were not troubling enough, studies show that \ncohabiting couples with children break up at two to three times the \nrate of married parents. Thus, since the marital union is a bulwark \nagainst family dissolution, an increase in cohabitation and unmarried \nparenting will result in increased family dissolution.\n  The ultimate victims when that occurs are children, who suffer deep \nemotional pain, ill health, depression, anxiety, even shortened life \nspans. More of these children drop out of school, less go to college, \nand they earn less income, develop more addictions to alcohol and \ndrugs, and engage in increased violence--or suffer it--within their \nhomes.\n  The problems posed by a reordering of marriage are grave. So \nopponents of this measure are sorely mistaken when they assert that \npreserving traditional marriage is a subject that is not worthy of our \ntime.\n  Second, opponents of the proposal contend that this issue is not ripe \nfor our consideration. But the amendment process takes time, and with \nthe onset of gay marriage in Massachusetts and the flurry of legal \nchallenges to traditional marriage laws across the country, those who \nseek to protect the institution need not wait until the last possible \nmoment to do so.\n  Lastly, opponents of S.J. Res. 40 argue that the meaning of marriage \nis a matter left to the several States. But if the past predilections \nof judges on important social issues are any guide, the people of the \nStates won't be given this chance, just as they were denied it in \nMassachusetts. And even if they were allowed to decide, would we really \nwant a country with a patchwork of meanings on so fundamental an \ninstitution as marriage?\n  The best process for answering this question is the constitutional \namendment process. It is the closest thing we have to a national \nreferendum, as any proposed amendment ultimately must be approved by \nthree-fourths of State legislatures--the democratic institutions that \nare closest to the people.\n  In closing, Mr. President, to let four lawyers on the Massachusetts \nSupreme Court decide the meaning of marriage for the rest of the Nation \nis profoundly undemocratic. The Allard amendment allows the people to \ndecide if they want to continue with our long-standing understanding of \nmarriage, while allowing the States, as they often are, to be the \nlaboratories of experiment in deciding whether and how to officially \nsanction other relationships. I believe the lessons from Scandinavia \ncounsel against experimenting with marriage though. I believe the \nAmerican people will agree with me. But if nothing else, they deserve a \nchance to be heard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 10 minutes, the \nSenator from Vermont has 4 minutes 46 seconds, and each of the leaders \nhas 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have heard that this amendment has been \ncompared to prohibition, kiosks, and bumper stickers. We have heard \nsome eloquent and passionate speeches in the Senate these past few \ndays. It is obviously an issue many feel strongly about. I make a \ncouple of things clear before we vote on whether we can even debate \nthis amendment postcloture.\n  First, the proponents of this amendment are not seeking a policy \nchange. We are simply trying to preserve more than a 5,000-year-old \ninstitution, the most fundamental in all of our society, that a few \nunelected, activist judges are trying to radically change.\n  Some of my colleagues suggest we do not need a national policy on \nmarriage. Guess what. We have always had one. When my home State of \nUtah wanted to enter into this great Union, the Federal Government \nconditioned such acceptance on our adoption of a one-man, one-woman \nmarriage policy. The Federal Government understood then what we still \nknow today, that children are best off having a mother and a father.\n  Most of my colleagues agree. Some argue it does not belong in the \nConstitution. The Constitution properly deals with foundational \nquestions of how our Nation should be organized.\n  Traditional male-female marriage is the universal arrangement for the \nordering of society and ensuring future\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\ngenerations. If a foundational institution such as this is not \ndeserving of our protection in our Constitution, then I don't know what \nis.\n  There are others who agree on preserving traditional marriage and \nagree an amendment may be necessary at some point in the future. We do \nnot need to wait. Judges have already sanctioned marriage licenses for \nsame-gender couples and those couples have spread to 46 States. Folks, \nmarriage has already been amended by the Massachusetts Supreme Court.\n  Some of my colleagues say the Defense of Marriage Act will contain \nthe spread to other States, but we know this is a flimsy shield, at \nbest. There are multiple actions pending against it now and legal \nscholars across the political spectrum agree it is only a matter of \ntime--not if, or when--the Defense of Marriage Act will be struck down.\n  We should be wary of those who argued back in 1996 that the Defense \nof Marriage Act was unconstitutional and now are hiding behind this act \nto argue against the need for a constitutional amendment. Members \nsimply cannot have it both ways. If Members believe a marriage should \nbe between a man and a woman and Members believe the Federal Defense of \nMarriage Act is unconstitutional, then they should support the Federal \nmarriage amendment.\n  We know from other countries that have undermined marriage the way \nthe Massachusetts Supreme Court did that a message is sent to everyone \nthat marriage is not important. Fewer couples get married, out-of-\nwedlock births skyrocket. We do not need to wait for these disastrous \nresults to happen to our country.\n  We have the chance to send the message here that marriage and family \ndo matter. This is not an irrational fear derived from an extreme \nreligious agenda, as my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, \nsuggested yesterday. We know from the benefit of experience in \nScandinavia, Denmark, and elsewhere, what happens. Everyone in society \nbenefits when we strengthen the family.\n\n  As far as I am concerned, this debate has been a triumph for \ndemocracy. We have debated these issues. I, for one, have learned quite \na bit from listening to my colleagues. I hope the American people have, \nas well.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to proceed. If there \nis a way to improve the language, the only way we can do so is to vote \nfor cloture and have a real debate rather than the filibuster we are \nputting up with.\n  I make it clear nobody wants to discriminate against gays. Simply \nput, we want to preserve traditional marriage. Gays have a right to \nlive the way they want. But they should not have the right to change \nthe definition of traditional marriage. That is where we draw the line.\n  I compliment people on both sides of the debate for at least debating \nas much as we can, but it would be far better to vote cloture and have \na full-fledged debate on this amendment. If it needs to be changed or \nmodified, or if it can be made better, both sides then will have an \nopportunity to try and amend it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, the majority leader asked I take a few \nmoments perhaps even of his time to offer some closing remarks on this \nimportant debate.\n  I believe he asked me to do this because I have been a Republican \nSenator since the beginning of my service in this Chamber who has been \nan advocate for gay rights. I have been an advocate for gay rights \nwhile still believing the right to defend traditional marriage.\n  Because of that, I was drawn with interest to an editorial of the New \nYork Times back on April 2, 2004. It frankly reflected many of my \nfeelings. It noted in the editorial:\n\n       The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research \n     and advocacy group, has been collecting poll results on gay \n     issues going back three decades. The numbers document a \n     profound change in attitudes, most strikingly on employment \n     issues but also in areas like adoption rights, legal benefits \n     and acceptance of gay relations.\n\n  The Times goes on to note, however:\n\n       There are lots of theories to explain these more tolerant \n     attitudes. Our own guess is that as more and more gays have \n     acknowledged their sexual orientation, straight Americans \n     have come to see that gays are not deviants to be feared, but \n     valued friends, neighbors, and colleagues, who are not much \n     different from anyone else.\n\n  I believe that, too. The Times then notes:\n\n       Sadly, the poll data shows little easing of opposition to \n     gay marriages in recent years, with roughly three-fifths or \n     more of the public still opposed.\n\n  Everyone has their own theory as to why the American people remain \nopposed.\n  I would offer my theory as this: In the inner recesses of the \nAmerican conscience, I think the American people understand that when \nwe tinker with the most basic institution that governs relationships of \nmen and women, we are tinkering with the foundations of our culture, \nour civilization, our Nation, and our future.\n  I think the American people understand what the great Roman Senator \nCicero, a pagan, once described to the Roman Senate: that marriage is \nthe first bond of society.\n  I think many of my colleagues have come with very interesting reasons \nfor their positions on these votes. One of them is States rights. I say \nthis respectfully--and I include myself in the accusation--we all \ninvoke States rights when it serves our political ends.\n  My concern, however, is this: that by standing behind States rights \non this issue, they are just standing aside while their States rights \nget rolled.\n  Make no mistake, our Constitution is being amended. The question is, \nby whom? Should it be done by a few liberal elites? Should it be done \nby four judges in Massachusetts? Should it be done by a few rogue \nmayors around the country, or by clandestine county commissioners, \nwithout public notice or public meeting, changing hundreds of years of \nState law and centuries of human practice?\n  I think many would argue reasonably that ripeness is an issue. Is it \ntime for us to begin this debate and have this vote? I would suggest, \nwhether it is ripe now, if I am right as to what the Federal courts \nwill do--specifically, the Ninth Circuit that governs my State--I \nbelieve it will eventually come to every Senator to answer this basic \nquestion, and it is this; Shall marriage in the United States consist \nonly of the union of a man and a woman? Today, I answer yes. It is just \non a procedural vote, but the substance of my vote is yes. It is yes \nbecause I believe marriage, as traditionally practiced, is an ideal \nworth preserving. However imperfectly practiced, it is perfect in \nprinciple. And it is perfect in principle because it involves more than \njust consenting adults. It involves the creation of children and their \nnatural nurture and rearing.\n  I believe in the United States, boys and girls still need the ideals \nof moms and dads.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, as so many of my colleagues have stated \non the floor over the course of the last couple of days, marriage is a \nsacred union between a man and a woman. That is what the vast majority \nof Americans believe. It is what South Dakotans believe. It is what I \nbelieve.\n  In South Dakota, we have never had a same-sex marriage, and won't \nhave any. It is prohibited by South Dakota law, as it is now in 38 \nother States. There is no confusion. There is no ambiguity. As others \nhave noted, in 1996, Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act. It \ndefines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. It protects \nStates from any actions taken by another State that could in any way \nundermine the law of their State.\n  What is overlooked by many is that it has never been challenged in \ncourt successfully--not once. It is the law of the land. It has been \nnow for 8 years, and it has not once been challenged successfully.\n  The question then is, Is there some urgent need now, absent even one \nsuccessful challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act, for us to amend \nthe U.S. Constitution?\n  We have differences of opinion about the legal necessity, but there \ncan be no difference of opinion with regard to how extraordinary a step \nthat is. In 217\n\n[[Page S8090]]\n\nyears, we have amended that sacred document only 17 times, although \nthere have been 11,000 separate attempts. Madam President, 11,000 \namendments have been offered; and 67 amendments are pending right now \nhere in the 108th Congress to amend the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Given all the facts, given the reality of the constitutional strength \nof the Defense of Marriage Act, the answer to the question, Is it now \ntime to amend the Constitution, is no. This fundamental responsibility \nlies with the States. It has for two centuries.\n  Now, some of our Republican colleagues wish to usurp the 200-year-old \npower of the States to create their own laws, including those in South \nDakota.\n  Last night, the distinguished Senator from Arizona came to the Senate \nfloor and talked about that very issue. Here is what he said:\n\n       The constitutional amendment we are debating today strikes \n     me as antithetical in every way to the core philosophy of \n     Republicans. It usurps from the States a fundamental \n     authority they have always possessed, and imposes a Federal \n     remedy for a problem that most States do not believe \n     confronts them, and which they feel capable of resolving \n     should it confront them . . . according to local standards \n     and customs.\n\n  Madam President, he is right. We are sworn, every time we are \nelected, to protect, uphold, and defend the Constitution. It is the \nbackbone of our Republic. That means insulating it at times like this \nfrom political condition or motivation. It means amending it only after \ncareful and exhaustive deliberation, not 2 days on this Senate floor \nwith an amendment that did not even come through the Judiciary \nCommittee. That is our solemn responsibility. We have not met that test \ntoday, not by a mile. Senator McCain is right. We should oppose this \namendment today.\n  I yield the floor and yield back all of the Democratic time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, since Friday, we have had a good and \nproductive debate about marriage, the bedrock of our society. I applaud \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the civil discussion, for \nthe judicious discussion we have had.\n  The issue, very appropriately, has been elevated to this body as \nrepresentatives of the American people. The issue is being clearly \ndefined. And the fundamental issue is, Do we let four activist judges \nfrom Massachusetts define marriage, the bedrock of our society, or do \nwe let the American people? Do we listen to their voices through their \nelected representatives?\n  We come, in a few moments, to a vote. And the question before us, in \nterms of the vote is, Should we consider a constitutional amendment to \nprotect marriage as the union of a husband and a wife. If 60 Senators \nvote yea, we will begin to debate the specifics of the constitutional \namendment. Not everyone is going to agree with every single word or \nevery sentence of the amendment that is before us, but by voting yes \ntoday, you are agreeing that the amendment deserves to be debated, and \npossibly amended. If you vote no, you are saying the Senate should not \neven consider an amendment to protect marriage as the union between a \nman and a woman.\n  We did not ask for this debate, and we would gladly sort of wish it \naway and say other people can take care of it, but four activist judges \non the Massachusetts Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage on May \n17. That is where the debate began, and that is why we act today.\n\n  It has become clear to legal scholars on the left and on the right \nthat same-sex marriage will be exported to all 50 States. The question \nis no longer whether the Constitution will be amended; the only \nquestion is, who will amend it and how it will be amended. Will \nactivist judges, not elected by the American people, destroy the \ninstitution of marriage or will the people protect marriage as the best \nway to raise children?\n  My vote is with the people, and thus, as majority leader, I felt and \ncontinue to feel that it is important that discussion and debate go on \non the floor of the U.S. Senate which does represent the American \npeople. Americans understand that children need mothers and need \nfathers. We would be foolish to permit a vast, untested social \nexperiment on families and children to occur, untested on that \ninstitution of marriage, the bedrock, the cornerstone of our society.\n  I recognize that amending the Constitution is a serious matter. Again \nand again, people have asked why we are addressing marriage on the \nSenate floor or talking about changing the Constitution. It is a \nserious matter, and we should do not do it lightly. That is, indeed, \nwhy we should debate the issue. It was the 27th amendment to the \nConstitution that addressed regulating salaries, how much Members of \nCongress are paid; thus, it is not too much to ask that the 28th \namendment be about protecting marriage and children. Do we let four \nactivist judges define marriage for our society or do we let the \nAmerican people decide? I implore my colleagues, let the Senate debate \nthe best way to protect marriage. Let us proceed to a civil and \nsubstantive debate, but let the debate on the amendment begin. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote yea.\n  I yield the floor and yield back all the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order--pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 620, S.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S.J.

Mr. President, on the last vote, as I recall, there was no \nmotion to reconsider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 2652 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                        Pending Senate Business\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about some of the \nissues which are pending before this Senate which are not being \nconsidered because the other side of the aisle refuses to take them up. \nI am going to stay on narrow issues which have not received a lot of \npublic attention.\n  Obviously, there have been a lot of issues such as medical \nmalpractice, such as the just recent decision not to go forward with \nthe debate on the constitutional amendment, that have received a fair \namount of visibility as a result of the obstruction coming from the \nother side and the other side deciding it does not wish to address \nthose issues, which are quite often critical to the American people. \nThere have, however, been four items reported out of the committee \nwhich I have the good fortune to chair, the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pension Committee. It is a committee of fairly disparate views--to \nbe kind. I chair it. I have as my honorable colleague on the other side \nof the aisle, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts. To say that we have a \nphilosophical identity would be an imaginative view.\n  As we go down the membership of the committee, the differences of \nopinions relative to philosophy of governance are rather significant. \nWe have some of the best Members of the Senate--obviously, there are \nmany good Members there--but we have some of our most aggressive and \nconstructive Members serving as members of the committee, and I enjoy \nthat. It makes the committee an interesting and challenging place in \nwhich to work. But the views are different within that committee, the \nviews of how we approach governance.\n  Therefore, when we as a committee reach an agreement on something, it \nmeans it is a pretty good work product. It means there has been a \nconsensus reached the way consensus should be reached within the \nCongress, which is that the different parties have sat down, they have \nrecognized the problem, they have brought to bear their philosophies on \nthat problem, their ideologies on that problem, and the practical \nnature of the way that you can resolve that problem, and they have \nreached what is, in most instances, a pretty good, commonsense solution \nto how we should move forward.\n  In four areas right now pending before this Senate, the committee has \nreached consensus. It has had a unanimous vote on a piece of \nlegislation. Some of those have even come to the floor. We have had a \nunanimous vote, for example, on how we should reauthorize and \nrestructure the special education laws of this country. It was called \nIDEA. It is a very complex issue, a very important issue, especially to \nchildren or parents of children who have special needs.\n  I can't think of anything more important than a parent who has a \nchild who has some unfortunate issues relative to their ability to \nlearn. For that parent and for that child, the most important event of \neach day is going to school and making sure that child's schooling \nexperience is a positive one, and that it moves that child forward as \nthat child tries to deal with the issues of learning and especially \nissues of life.\n  So the special education bill is a critical piece of legislation. It \nwent through our committee with unanimous support. It came to the floor \nof the Senate. It was debated, debated aggressively, and passed. But it \nsimply sits.\n  A second bill has been stopped because the other side of the aisle \nhas refused to allow us to appoint conferees. The second bill which \nfalls in the same area is the Work Investment Act. This is basically a \nbill which came out of our committee again in a unanimous way, worked \non primarily by Senator Enzi of Wyoming. He did a great job on it and \nworked across the aisle with a number of Senators. As a result, it was \nunanimously passed out of our committee, came across the floor of the \nSenate, and again this bill has been stopped because conferees have not \nbeen appointed.\n  Then reported out of our committee as another very important piece of \nlegislation relative to education is the Head Start bill. Head Start \naffects a lot of kids in this country today. It gives low-income kids \nin our country a nurturing environment during those very formative \nyears and allows them an environment where they get decent health care \nand they get decent custodial care during the daytime. They have \ndaycare services, and it teaches them socialization patterns. We have \ntaken that concept and we have added to it an education, academic \ncomponent so the kids going to Head Start will now also come out of the \nHead Start program after they are 3 or 4 years old moving into \nkindergarten and preschool. They will hopefully be up to par with their \npeers academically so they know their alphabet and are ready to learn.\n  This is an important initiative. This bill is structured to put that \nnew component into Head Start and make that part of that initiative.\n  Again, this bill came out of our committee unanimously. It came to \nthe Senate and has stopped--stopped. We negotiated to try to get it \nbrought up in reasonable ways, one of which would allow us to give both \nsides amendments if they wanted them and then move it to conference. \nNo, it hasn't happened, so that bill has been stopped.\n  The fourth bill which I want to talk about is the Patients Savings \nAct. We know that there is a problem, unfortunately, in our health care \ncommunity with mistakes--unintended mistakes, but mistakes--that end up \ncausing people harm because health care is delivered inappropriately or \nincorrectly to people. In fact, the estimate is that literally tens of \nthousands--potentially more than 100,000 people--die each year as a \nresult of that type of situation.\n  One of the ways to address that is to allow the medical community to \ncommunicate with each other as to what these problems are so they can \nlearn from each other and so we can set up a regime where if somebody \nhas a system in place which avoids a problem, a mistake or an error \noccurring, they can share that with other medical providers. If there \nis, on the other hand, a mistake that has occurred or error that has \noccurred, the information relative to the investigation of that and how \nit can be mitigated can be shared with other providers. This sharing of \ninformation is absolutely critical if we are going to get control over \nthe issue of how we deliver better health care in this country. \nUnfortunately, there are antitrust and other laws which limit the \nability of that information to be shared. So we have set up this \nPatients Safety Act which is essentially an attempt to give patients \nmore protection when they are in a health care facility.\n  This bill again was worked on effectively and aggressively by both \nsides of the aisle. The thoughts and initiatives were brought together. \nIt was passed out of committee unanimously. This is a very important \npiece of legislation. We need to get this piece of legislation in \nplace. Unlike the other pieces of legislation which I mentioned--the \nWIA bill, the IDEA bill, and the Head Start\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\nbill, which already have programs up and running, which are effective, \nbut can be improved significantly by those bills--in the case of \npatient safety there is nothing out there today which allows these \nmedical providers to take advantage of what this law is going to bring \nto bear and thus reduce injuries to people. Literally, the longer this \nbill is kept from passing and becoming law, the more people are harmed. \nThere is a direct numerical relationship, direct formula, direct factor \nrelationship where if this bill were passed today, fewer people would \nbe harmed tomorrow. It is that simple.\n  This bill needs to be taken up. It needs to be passed. Yet although \nit came out of committee unanimously, it has disappeared into the \nopposition on the other side of the aisle which says we are not going \nto listen to that. We are not going to bring that up. If you want to \npass something such as that, you will have to throw on everything else \nand the kitchen sink that has no relationship to it. You are not going \nto be allowed to pass a bill that was unanimously passed out of \ncommittee.\n  A couple of days ago, I was reading a pamphlet which was sent to me \nby an ever inquisitive and creative and very unique individual in his \nenergy level, which is much higher than mine, the President pro \ntempore, Senator Stevens. He had go to some lecture or some meeting \nwhere they had been talking about quantum physics. He sent us a booklet \non quantum physics. I have never understood even the term ``quantum \nphysics.'' I opened it to the first page and read the first paragraph. \nI quickly got lost in the theory. But the basic statement about quantum \nphysics was that the universe is 96 percent anti-matter. Maybe it is 98 \npercent. The universe--and this is a shock. This is a new theory. The \nuniverse is 98 percent anti-matter or, in other words, a black hole.\n  I have to tell you, under the Democratic leadership in this Senate, \nthe Senate is becoming 98 percent anti-matter, or a black hole. When \nbills come out of committee, they are unanimously passed by a committee \nwhich has such a diverse viewpoint philosophically, ideologically, and \nregionally as our committee has, when those bills come out of that \ncommittee unanimously and will significantly improve kids going to \nelementary school, getting ready for school, kids in their early years, \nkids who have problems and who have significant issues, special-needs \nkids going through their school systems, people who need to be \nretrained in a workplace that requires constant retraining or, as in \nthe case of the patients safety bill, will actually save lives because \nit will allow us to do a better job of delivering medical care--when \nthey come out of committee and are unanimously supported by the full \ncommittee, they are unanimously supported to the extent they went \nthrough the subcommittee, to the full committee, unanimously supported, \ncome to the floor of the Senate, and the other side of the aisle says \nthat bill is going to be assigned to the black hole.\n  That bill disappears into what you might call ``Daschle Land'' where \nnothing comes back. Send the bill out and it is gone. Where did it go? \nI do not know. It went to ``Daschle Land.'' This can't continue. These \npieces of legislation have to be taken up. We should consider them. We \nshould pass them. After all, if they have unanimous approval from the \ncommittee of jurisdiction when that committee has some divergent views \non it, they have to be pretty well worked out as a piece of law.\n  I have asked that we get the IDEA bill and the special education bill \nto conference. It hasn't happened. I have asked that we be able to \nbring up the Head Start bill. It hasn't happened. I have asked that we \nbe able to go to the WIA bill and send it to conference. It hasn't \nhappened.\n  Today I would like to ask that we be able to bring up the Patients \nSafety Act and pass it out of this Senate under a reasonable plan, \nunder a reasonable set of options where we will essentially say people \nget a right to amend it on the substance of the bill and then move to \nconference.\n  I would like to present the following unanimous consent request \nrelative to the Patients Safety Act.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 663\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 663, the \nPatients Safety bill, and the Senate proceed to its consideration; \nprovided that upon reporting of the bill Senator Gregg be recognized to \noffer a substitute amendment, the text of which is at the desk; \nprovided further that there be one first-degree germane amendment in \norder to be offered by Senator Kennedy or his designee and that that \namendment be subject to a germane second-degree amendment to be offered \nby Senator Gregg or his designee, with no further amendments in order.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 2 hours for \ndebate, and following the use or yielding back of the time the Senate \nproceed to a vote on or in relationship to the second-degree amendment, \nto be immediately followed by a vote on or in relationship to the \nfirst-degree amendment, as amended; provided that following disposition \nof the amendments, the substitute amendment, as amended, if amended, be \nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read the third time, and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the passage of H.R. 633, as amended, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following passage, the Senate \ninsist upon its amendment, request a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees on behalf of the Senate with a \nratio of 5 to 4.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, first, I understand the \nfrustration of the distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire. We \nhave spent a lot of time doing nothing. This afternoon is a good \nexample. The Senator can add up the days as well as I can on this \nmarriage amendment.\n  Prior to that, we wasted a week on class action. I have said before, \nthe Republicans had a 5-foot jump shot. Not only were they afraid to \ntake the shot, they walked away from it.\n  I understand the frustration. But also understand our frustration. \nThe schedule is set by the majority. I make a counterproposal to my \nfriend, for whom I have the greatest admiration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the request by the Senator from New \nHampshire be modified, modified to have the matter, the Patients Safety \nAct, H.R. 663--that the HELP Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of H.R. 663, the patients safety bill, and the Senate \nproceed to its consideration, the bill be read the third time, the \nSenate proceed to vote on passage of H.R. 633, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  Before my friend responds, we think the bill we got from the House is \na good bill. We don't think there needs to be any amendments. We are \nwilling to complete that right now. It would take no further action. We \nwould not need a conference committee. Then any other matters the \nSenator thinks should be tied up that are at loose ends, maybe we can \nadd to one of the appropriations bills or something like that.\n  I ask consent the request by my friend from New Hampshire's; Senator \nGregg's request be modified as indicated by my previous statement.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I simply note that I don't \nknow whether we took the 5-foot jump shot, but I state right now, if we \ntake up this bill, it will be a 2-foot slam dunk.\n  That is all we need to do. This bill came out of our committee. It \ncame out of a Senate committee unanimously. It is reasonable that the \nSenate should insist on hearing its bill on the floor and that the \nSenate should pass its bill on the floor. That is all we are asking.\n  That is why I must object to the Senator's proposal to modify my \namendment. I would presume that the Senator, having come from the House \nand knowing the vagaries of the House--which is why he came to the \nSenate because he so much more appreciated the intelligence and \nthoughtfulness of the Senate--would want to hear the Senate bill on the \nfloor rather than to simply accept the House bill in its present form.\n  Therefore, although I greatly admire the Senator's attempt to be \nconstructive in his initiative, because it is a constructive step, I am \nforced to object. I believe we should take up the\n\n[[Page S8093]]\n\nSenate bill under the context of what we have proposed, which would be \na bill that was unanimously approved by a Senate committee of \njurisdiction subject to the amendment process which is outlined.\n\n  In fact, should the Senator from Massachusetts agree with the Senator \nfrom Nevada that the House bill is better than the Senate bill--which I \nwould find interesting since he supported the Senate bill as it came \nout of committee--he may offer that as his germane amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection to the modification is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in this legislative body we rarely deal with \nanything that is perfect. Legislation is the art of compromise.\n  While the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire may have some good \nideas on how to improve the bill we got from the House, we should look \nat what we will have if we could agree to do the House-passed bill.\n  Basically on our side, the bill was prepared by Senator Jeffords and \nothers. As I understand it, it is S. 720 over here. It is a bill to \nprovide for the improvement of patient safety and to reduce the \nincidence of events that adversely affect patient safety.\n  I have no doubt, with the experience my distinguished colleague from \nNew Hampshire has had as a Member of the House, as a Governor of the \nState of New Hampshire, and certainly a senior Senator over, that he \ncan figure out ways to improve what the House has done. I have no doubt \nthat is true.\n  But in the interim, knowing we are not going to be able to arrive at \nthat point, I think we would be well advised to move forward with the \nwork the House has done. As imperfect as it may be, it is still much \nbetter than nothing. Then I would be happy to work with my friend from \nNew Hampshire on what he thinks can be done to improve this legislation \nthat the House passed.\n  I met with the distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate this \nafternoon. He thinks there is a program that he and Senator Byrd have \ncome up with that we can do all the appropriations bills before we \nadjourn in this session. If that is the case, there would be ample \nopportunity--and I would be happy to work with my friend from New \nHampshire on even the appropriations bills to see if we could work \nsomething out. If not, there are other matters we could go through \nhere.\n  We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good in this instance. \nWe would be well advised to accept what my friend from New Hampshire \nsaid we need improvement in, and accept what the 435 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives have done.\n  A few minutes ago there were four former House Members on the floor: \nSenator Carper walked off, the distinguished Member from New Hampshire, \nand the Senator from Nevada have all served in the House. They are good \nlegislators.\n  I learned when I first came to the House of Representatives, House \nMembers are usually better legislators than Senators. Why? The reason \nbeing, their jurisdiction is narrow compared to ours. We are a jack of \nall trades and master of none. In the House, they have a few masters. \nWe should accept that.\n  As to this bill, with the considered experience we have had over \nhere, we could probably improve what they have done. What they have \ncome up with is certainly not that bad. In fact, it is good. It is a \nlot better than nothing. I hope my friend would reconsider the offer I \nmade.\n  Let's pass right now this House-passed bill. It would be a step \nforward. Today we would have accomplished something. We would have \naccomplished making patients safer in America today--not as safe as my \nfriend from New Hampshire thinks they should be but a lot safer.\n  I hope he will reconsider. I have always found him to be a very \nreasonable person, someone for whom I have great respect and \nadmiration. I say it publicly all the time.\n  In this instance, I repeat, we should not let the perfect be the \nenemy of the good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from New Hampshire?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the assistant Democratic \nleader's constructive suggestion in an attempt to move this process \nalong relative to offering the House amendment.\n  However, there really is no reason we should just take the House \nlanguage as it stands. The two bodies have both propounded bills which \nare substantive. This proposal which I have put forward requires only 2 \nhours in order to put it across the floor and we can go into \nconference. As a result of that, we can meet in conference and, \nobviously, reach a conclusion--I think, fairly quickly--which will make \na very good bill. There is no reason in this instance we should not \nhave a very good bill.\n  I do regret we cannot move forward at this time on this bill in the \nregular course under regular order as it would be presented in the \nunanimous consent request which I presented.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada. As in the past, his courtesy is \nalways very generous. He is obviously a very effective spokesman for \nthe Democratic membership of this Senate, and I admire his work.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n              United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the United States-\nAustralia Free Trade Agreement. I support the agreement because 8,000 \nMinnesotan manufacturers, which employ some 350,000 families in my \nState, list the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement as a top \npriority in maintaining good-paying Minnesota jobs, and that is \nimportant.\n  Like the JOBS bill, the highway bill, the Energy bill, as well as \nclass action, medical malpractice, and asbestos reform litigation, the \nAustralia Free Trade Agreement is about jobs. I was always fond of \nsaying, when I was a mayor--and I am fond of repeating as a Senator--it \nis about jobs. The best welfare program is a job. The best housing \nprogram is a job. Access to health care comes with a job. Jobs are \nimportant.\n  While we have seen the hopes of our Nation's manufacturers dashed \ntime and again on these other top priorities--we are still waiting for \nthe JOBS bill to get done; we are still waiting for asbestos reform \nlegislation to get through; we are still waiting for class action \nreform legislation to get through a filibuster--the reality is, we \nstill have an opportunity to salvage the hopes of millions of working \nmen and women in this country, men and women who could not care less \nabout who gets the credit for keeping the economic recovery going, just \nas long as it keeps going.\n  We have grown over 1.5 million jobs in the past 10 months and in part \nbecause of the policies of this administration: the tax cuts that put \nmoney in the pockets of moms and dads, the tax cuts that allowed \nbusinesses to invest and to reinvest, the increasing expensing \noperations, the bonus depreciation, those things that lowered capital \ngains, those things that allowed businesses to say: We are going to \ninvest, we are going to put it back in the business.\n  In the end, when business grows, when moms and dads have more money \nin their pockets, they spend that money on a good or a service, and the \nperson who produces that good or service has a job. And that is a good \nthing.\n  So we have seen more than 1.5 million jobs in the past 10 months, but \nwe cannot afford to rest on our laurels or wait out the results of a \nPresidential election. The time to act on the jobs agenda, as laid out \nby President Bush, is now. It is now.\n  The Australia Free Trade Agreement is just one component of the \nPresident's jobs agenda. This agreement builds on the $12 billion in \nmanufactured U.S. exports to Australia and the 160,000 American jobs \nowing to our trade with that very important friend and ally in the \nglobal war on terror.\n  According to the National Association of Manufacturers, by tearing \ndown Australian tariffs imposed against 99 percent of U.S. manufactured \nexports--which accounts for 93 percent of everything we sell to that \ncountry--our Nation's manufacturers stand to gain $2 billion a year in \nincreased exports to Australia, giving us a leg up on Europe, Japan, \nand China.\n\n[[Page S8094]]\n\n  This is not pie-in-the-sky stuff. This is very real to Minnesotans. I \nhave 6,700 exporting companies in my State. In fact, 1 out of every 5 \nmanufacturing jobs in Minnesota is owed to exports, and Australia is \nour 10th largest export market.\n\n  Let me give you some real-life examples because I think the problem \nmost often with trade is that we vividly see jobs lost or businesses \nshut down, sometimes due to trade, and we need to understand that, we \nneed to see that, we need to know the impact, and then we need to do \nthose things to lessen that impact. But rarely do we see or hear about \nthe jobs created or the businesses born as a direct result of our trade \npolicy.\n  It is kind of like talking about tax cuts. We talk about them in \nabstract. We sound like accountants. We talk about trade and sound like \neconomists. But the reality is, there is a mom or a dad who has a job \nopportunity because of the trade opportunities we create.\n  Polaris is a good example. It is a Minnesota company of which I am \nextremely proud. It is located way up in the northwest part of the \nState, about 10 minutes from Canada in a town called Roseau. Roseau has \nabout 2,756 people at last count, the most famous being the former \nSecretary of Agriculture under President Carter, Bob Berglund, who is a \nvery good friend of mine. They also grow a lot of hockey players, \nreally talented hockey players in Roseau, MN.\n  Talking about former Secretary of Agriculture Berglund, lots of \nfolks, when they get through being a Congressman or a Senator or a \nSecretary of this department or that department, retire to some beach \nin Florida, but not Bob Berglund. He went home to give back to the \npeople of Roseau all the support he had received through his years of \ndistinguished service.\n  Roseau suffered from some terrible floods not too long ago, and there \nwas former Secretary of Agriculture Bob Berglund leading a group of \nfolks in the town, figuring out how to deal with the flooding issue on \na long-term basis. So we were not literally sticking our fingers in the \ndike, but we were looking beyond that. That is Bob Berglund.\n  In any case, Roseau would not be the town it is if it were not for \nguys like Bob Berglund, an indomitable spirit that pervades that place \nand everyone I have ever met there, and a company called Polaris.\n  I will go back to the flooding. When the flooding happened, the folks \nfrom Polaris did not abandon them. They were there working in the \ncommunity, seeking to make a difference. They have had serious flooding \nover the years, and we have had to work to rebuild that town. We are \nstill at it, and so is Secretary Berglund and so is Polaris, which is \ncelebrating, just this year, 50 years of business. Here is what the \npresident of Polaris, Tom Tiller, had to say about the Australia Free \nTrade Agreement:\n\n       In 2004, Polaris will do over $10 million in sales to \n     Australia. While the majority of those sales will be \n     conducted by Polaris Sales Australia, all of the machinery \n     sold in that distribution network is manufactured in \n     Minnesota . . . so increased sales in Australia means more \n     jobs in Minnesota.\n\n  Polaris is especially excited about the opportunity to sell all-\nterrain vehicles to the Australians under the new access granted under \nthis agreement.\n  I cannot mention Polaris without mentioning another very important \nmanufacturer in the State of which I am so proud, Arctic Cat. Arctic \nCat is also located in northwest Minnesota, maybe about an hour away \nfrom Canada, in a town called Thief River Falls. Chris Twomey, with \nArctic Cat, points out that:\n\n       Due to high tariffs, Arctic Cat sells less than $5 million \n     in products to Australia. The Australia Free Trade Agreement \n     makes it a lot easier for us to increase our sales there and \n     increase our production here at home.\n\n  This is another top-of-the-line all-terrain vehicle coming from \nanother top-of-the-line all-Minnesota company. I am proud of those \ncompanies. I am proud of the people they employ. And I am proud of the \nexpanded opportunity they will have to sell, to grow jobs, to make \nprofit, to strengthen the lives of their employees and the lives of \ntheir communities--all of which are enhanced by the Australia Free \nTrade Agreement.\n  My paper and wood products industry is also very important to my \nState, starting a little west of where Polaris and Arctic Cat call home \nand extending all the way over to northeastern Minnesota. But for this \nindustry and all the jobs it has provided over the years, northern \nMinnesota--which has seen some tough times--would have been in dire \nstraits. Minnesota's International Paper and Blandin United Paper Mill \nare strong supporters of the Australia Free Trade Agreement because it \nwill open the doors of Australia and the Pacific Rim to our paper and \nwood products industries. Again, those industries are part of the \neconomic lifeblood of those communities. I want them to prosper. I want \nthem to grow. I want them to have expanded opportunity. And they will \nget that from this agreement.\n  But it is not just northern Minnesota with a stake in the passage of \nthis agreement. Eagan, MN, a growing suburb just south of St. Paul, \nalso has a stake, as do communities all over my State. The Lockheed \nMartin manufacturing facility in Eagan had $40 million in international \nsales last year alone, with a part of that figure owing to the \nconstruction and sale of the P-3 Maritime Patroller to Australia. \nCurrently, Eagan is in the running for another contract with Australia \nworth over $30 million to that community, and, according to Lockheed \nMartin, passage of the Australia Free Trade Agreement puts us one step \ncloser to securing that contract.\n  And 3M, which not everyone knows stands for Minnesota Mining and \nManufacturing, a great St. Paul company--in the neighborhoods of St. \nPaul they call it ``the mining,'' but it is Minnesota Mining and \nManufacturing--notes that Minnesota companies alone will save some $5 \nmillion in Australian tariffs when they come down under this agreement.\n  This is not an abstract topic for Minnesota. It is very real. The \nAustralian Free Trade Agreement has the potential to sustain and grow \nreal, good-paying Minnesota jobs. For me, that is decisive because jobs \nare what it is all about. I don't want to oversell this agreement \nbecause that has been done too often with respect to trade agreements. \nThat is important to repeat. Far too often on both sides we look at a \ntrade agreement and we oversell it. And then if we don't reach those \nhigh expectations, people say: Well, it didn't work; it is no good.\n  We are talking about moving the ball forward. We are talking about \nmoving the economy. We are talking about more progress, more economic \ngrowth, and more opportunity. We are talking about more jobs. I am not \ngoing to sell. A lot is promised under these agreements and, frankly, \nthey usually fall somewhat short of the mark.\n  Let me say what I have heard from my manufacturers, what I have heard \nfrom Polaris, Arctic Cat, International Paper, and Lockheed. They have \nsaid the Australian agreement means opportunity, give us that \nopportunity. So today in the United States we have a chance to do just \nthat. We ought to and, fortunately, I expect that we will. We will give \nthem the opportunity when we consider the Australia Free Trade \nAgreement and get it passed.\n  Having said that, I would be remiss if I did not take this \nopportunity to underscore a very important point that I hope is not \nmissed by my colleagues, particularly by those who are in charge of \nnegotiating this agreement or any other trade agreement; that is, the \nimportance of U.S. agriculture to trade. Their success is mutually and \ninextricably linked. I do not believe U.S. agriculture can succeed \nwithout moving forward on trade, nor do I believe that trade can move \nforward without U.S. agriculture.\n  With Minnesota in the top 10 among States for the production of \nnearly every commodity that can be produced in our climate, the success \nof my farm families is extremely important to mainstream Minnesota. It \nis important to me.\n  Let me begin with sugar. Few folks realize Minnesota is the No. 1 \nsugar-producing and processing State in the country. Folks sometimes \nthink about Florida, Louisiana, and other places, but it is sugar beets \nwhich makes the same kind of sugar you buy in your local store. And \nmore sugar is produced from sugar beets than from cane sugar. Minnesota \nfarm families own both the production and processing sides of our\n\n[[Page S8095]]\n\nState's sugar beet industry, an industry that is directly or indirectly \nresponsible for $2 billion in economic activity and about 30,000 jobs. \nThe exclusion of sugar from the Australian agreement has been much \nmaligned by folks inside and outside the Chamber, but not by this \nSenator. Let me tell you why.\n  The fact is, the reason we are able to stand here now on the cusp of \npassing the Australia Free Trade Agreement is in part or in whole owing \nto how this administration wisely handled sugar. Today, the Australia \nFree Trade Agreement is on the move. The sad reality is that CAFTA is \nup on the blocks. CAFTA is another great opportunity. We need to work \nto strengthen our trade opportunities with our friends in Central \nAmerica. We have seen the flourishing of democracy there. Our Central \nAmerican friends and allies deserve the benefit of expanded trade \nopportunity. CAFTA is up on the blocks. We have to figure a way to move \nit forward and to deal with the sugar problem in CAFTA.\n\n  When I say ``deal with,'' this is not about parochialism or \nprotectionism. It is about common sense and equity. Common sense says \nif you have a world problem, as the distortion in the sugar market most \ncertainly is, you handle the problem in a global context. In other \nwords, the right place to deal with sugar is in the World Trade \nOrganization, not in these bilateral and regional agreements. Equity \nrequires that when our trade team rightly decided that discussions \nconcerning the farm bill's safety net for other commodities, such as \ncorn and soybeans, should be reserved for the WTO and excluded from \nbilateral or regional agreements, the same should hold true for sugar: \nCommon sense and equity.\n  In regard to the farm bill, I would point out that this legislation \nis to our farm families in rural America what the JOBS bill we just \noverwhelmingly passed is to our Nation's manufacturers. To anyone who \nhas gone to see the new World War II Memorial, you will notice all the \nwreaths that represent the two pillars of industry and agriculture. \nThose responsible for both are critical to this country. We must not \nunilaterally disarm against either in global competition, which today \nis not always free and not always fair.\n  As for my State's sugar farmers, they are among the most competitive \nin the world. In fact, America's sugar farmers are among the top one-\nthird in the world in overall efficiency, as measured by the cost of \nproduction. But what they face is a dump market where the average world \ncost of production per pound is 16 cents while the average selling \nprice per pound is only 6 cents. As the saying goes, something is \nrotten in Denmark. I don't want to blame the Danes on that, just an \nexpression.\n  Meanwhile, the U.S. sugar policy has been good to taxpayers and \nconsumers alike. The U.S. sugar policy costs taxpayers nothing and, in \nfact, the two times in recent history where the U.S. had no sugar \npolicy, consumer prices received the brunt of it when prices spiked to \nrecord highs. So my deepest thanks and appreciation go out to the Bush \nadministration and its trade team for doing what is right by America's \nsugar farmers, right by Minnesota, and right by this Senator. You have \na good model now on sugar, one that moves the trade agenda forward. We \nought to stick with it.\n  Dairy is another important industry in Minnesota--we are fifth in the \nNation--and here again our trade team deserves thanks for working with \nme and other interested Senators, as well as our Nation's dairy farm \nfamilies, in arriving at a more workable although not perfect solution. \nMaintaining the second tier tariff for Minnesota dairy farmers is an \nabsolutely essential part of this agreement. I am pleased that we have \nworked with our trade team on this issue. I don't want to get into \ndiscussions of the complexity of dairy policy on the floor of this \nbody, but this issue of a second-tier tariff was important to my dairy \nfarmers and dairy farmers throughout America. We managed to make sure \nthat we maintained that second-tier tariff. That was a good thing.\n\n  Under the agreement, in-quota dairy imports are estimated to equal \nonly 0.17 percent of the annual value of U.S. dairy production, and \nonly about 2 percent of the current value of imports. Finally, \nassurances by our trade team that imports will not affect the operation \nof the milk price support program are extremely important to me and to \nAmerica's dairy farmers.\n  Today I have 6,000 hard-working dairy farm families who milk about \nhalf a million cows every morning and night, who can breathe a little \neasier, thanks to the efforts of our trade team. I stress, less than 10 \nyears ago we had about 14,000 Minnesota families. So we have lost over \nhalf the dairy farmers in our State. I presume that pattern has been \nshown in other parts of the country. But those 6,000 hard-working dairy \nfarm families can sleep a little easier tonight thanks to the efforts \nof our trade team.\n  Again, it is not a slam dunk. This agreement is not perfect, but it \nis more workable to my dairy farmers and cooperatives at home because \nsecond-tier tariffs were maintained and in-quota imports are expected \nto be low.\n  My cattlemen are about where my dairymen are. They are relieved, but \nI would say our trade team had to overcome a very difficult issue. On \nthe whole, they worked very hard to address the concerns of Minnesota's \ncattlemen. They phase down U.S. tariffs over an 18-year period and \nphase up the amount of in-quota access, all the while providing \nsafeguards to protect against import surges that would disrupt U.S. \nmarkets. And at the end of the 18-year period, another safeguard is put \nin place to protect against import surges that would otherwise depress \nU.S. beef prices.\n  As a Senator representing nearly 16,000 cattlemen and a State that \nranks sixth in beef production, my support for this agreement is \ncouched in part on my reliance that these safeguards for U.S. beef \nwill, in fact, be allowed to work as intended and that any waiver would \nbe undertaken only in the rarest of circumstances, circumstances that \nI, frankly, can't conceive of now as I speak.\n  Steve Brake, a good friend of mine, is president of the cattlemen. \nWhenever I get to cattle country, I touch base with him to where things \nare. He understands. It is extremely important to him and his fellow \ncattlemen that we strictly enforce these safeguards. I know I will hear \nfrom Steve if we don't. If I hear about it from Steve, our trade team \nis going to hear about it, too. The safeguards are in place. I have \ngreat respect for what has been done, and I think our cattlemen can \nsleep easier tonight.\n  I am pleased that the sanitary and phytosanitary issues that stood in \nthe way of our pork producers' access to the Australian market have \nbeen favorably resolved, leading to the endorsement of the agreement by \nmore than 6,000 Minnesota pork producers. I will repeat that. These \nissues have been resolved and have led to the endorsement of the \nagreement by my more than 6,000 Minnesota pork producers.\n  I also appreciate the work of our trade team in pressing the issue of \nthe Australian Wheat Board, a monopolistic state trading enterprise \nwhose time has passed. While I am disappointed we were unable to do \naway with the board under this agreement, I am pleased the Australians \nhave agreed to discuss this issue in the Doha Round of the WTO.\n  Overall, I believe this administration had a tough job to do and it \ndid it reasonably well--job well done--something evidenced by the \nlikely passage of this agreement. The Australia Free Trade Agreement is \na good precursor to the WTO discussions that will take place in Geneva \nyet this month because it underscores a point: You don't have to give \naway the farm to negotiate a good agreement, and you may not pass one \nif you do.\n  So the Australia Free Trade Agreement that President Bush has sent to \nCongress is about sustaining and growing American jobs. It is about \nbolstering support in the economic opportunity of our rural families, \nour rural communities, and the incredible work they do to produce the \nsafest, most affordable food supply in the world.\n  So to the President and our trade team, I say: Job well done. To our \nMembers and colleagues in this body, I say: Let us move forward and \npass the Australia Free Trade Agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8095-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8095-S8104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow stand in recess until 4 p.m. today.\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\n  There being no objection, at 3:02 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n4:01 p.m., and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding \nOfficer (Mr. Cornyn).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nTexas, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss yet another \nrevision by the administration to the new Medicare law. We all know the \nadministration refused to give Congress an estimate on how much the \nMedicare bill would cost. We later found OMB estimated that the \nMedicare law would cost $534 billion over the next 10 years, $134 \nbillion more than was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  We also know the CMS actuary, Richard Foster, said the high cost \nprojection was actually known before the final House and Senate votes \non the legislation last November. But Mr. Scully told him, ``We can't \nlet that get out.''\n  In an e-mail to colleagues at CMS, Foster indicated he believed he \nmight lose his job if he revealed the administration's cost estimates \nfor the Medicare legislation.\n  Now we are getting another round of revised numbers. In last year's \ndebate, Republicans repeatedly claimed the new drug benefits would be \ncompletely voluntary, that seniors happy with the current Medicare \nsystem should be able to keep their coverage the way it is. In fact, we \nhave heard President Bush say that over and over again. He said that in \nthe State of the Union Message in 2003.\n  But many of us warned at the time that because of the way the benefit \nwas structured, employees with good retiree coverage would lose it. \nPeople who currently have coverage, currently have prescription drug \nassistance, actually could lose it. At the time the Congressional \nBudget Office estimated 2.7 million seniors and disabled could \npotentially lose--they indicated would lose--their retiree drug \ncoverage because of the way this was written, in terms of the interface \nwith the private sector retiree coverage. But once again the numbers \nare coming back even worse than was thought.\n  In today's New York Times, Health and Human Services now has \nestimated that not 2.7 but 3.8 million retirees will lose their \nprescription drug benefits when Medicare offers the coverage in 2006. \nHHS admitted this represents one-third of all retirees with employer-\nsponsored drug coverage.\n  I know CMS Administrator McClellan has released a press statement \ndisputing the article.\n  I hope we get to the bottom of what is going on with this revision. \nBut certainly what has happened up to date does not give us confidence \nin the information they have given to us. The administration certainly \ncan't possibly think seniors will be happy to hear that up to one-third \nof those who have current coverage will lose it when this new Medicare \nlaw takes effect.\n  When you think about folks who have worked all their lives, and \nprobably paid attention to the fact they had health insurance and \nretirement benefits, planned for that possibly over the life of their \nworktime, they took pay cuts in order to guarantee they had that \nretirement benefit, or wage freezes as people are being asked today, \nmake sure in their retirement they had that coverage, and now this law \nis estimated to actually lose the private retiree coverage up to one-\nthird of those who have it today.\n  My mother is one of those folks, a retired nurse. She followed the \ndebate we had in great detail. One of the questions she had for me \nafter the passage of this law was whether she would lose her benefits. \nI had to honestly say: Mom, I don't know.\n  One of the things we heard was those who may be in a situation most \nlikely to lose may, in fact, be those who are nurses or police officers \nor retired firefighters or others who are in local or State government \nwith all of the cutbacks where State and local governments are being \nforced to cut back.\n  It is amazing to me that in light of what we are seeing, point after \npoint--information that wasn't given, information that wasn't accurate, \nthe inability to negotiate group discounts under Medicare, the \nconfusion on the prescription drug card--I hate to even call them \ndiscount cards because we know from AARP and from Families U.S.A. and \nfrom all of the groups that watched this that, in fact, the drug \ncompanies increased their prices very rapidly knowing they were going \nto be asked to give a discount through a discount card--we have seen \nprices go up 10, 20, 30 percent since we passed the law back in \nNovember, so they could then provide a card with a 15-percent discount \nor a 20-percent or a 25-percent discount. Seniors know after they \nwatched this happen that it was not really a discount.\n  We have seen the confusion about how to even wade through the 40, 50, \n60, or 70 different cards you may be able to choose from as a Medicare \nbeneficiary to see if you can even begin to get a discount. We have \nseen the confusion of low-income seniors who actually have the most to \ngain because there is a $600 credit to buy prescription drugs attached \nto the card, and yet there is such confusion about how to even sign up \nand qualify, and that those who probably need it the most will be the \nones least likely to receive it.\n  We have seen confusion and misinformation and threats to people about \nlosing jobs if they tell us the truth and bad policies that over and \nover again have been put into place to help the industry instead of \nhelping seniors and helping the disabled.\n  While all of this is going on, prices just keep going up. People need \ntheir medicine every day. Whether it is confusing or not, whether \npeople are going to lose their coverage or not, today folks walk into \nthe pharmacy trying to get their medicine, or maybe they didn't go in \nbecause they couldn't afford it, or maybe they went into the pharmacy \nbut not the grocery store because they couldn't afford to do both, or \nmaybe, as the couple I talked to not too long ago who were on the same \nmedicine, the husband takes it one day and the wife takes it another \nday.\n\n  We can do better than that. This is the greatest country in the \nworld. Shame on us for not being able to get this right and not being \nable to do it now.\n  The good news is we can do it now. We have a proposal in front of us \nthat will allow the competition necessary in the pharmaceutical \nindustry to bring prices down immediately. It is called reimportation \nof prescription drugs. We have talked about it so many times. I have \nbeen talking about it since being a House Member, and talking about \ntaking bus trips to Canada. Now in my fourth year in the Senate, we are \nstill talking about what ought to be done to bring down prices. But the \ngood news is that things are beginning to move.\n  I was pleased to join with the AARP and with colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, Senator Snowe, Senator McCain, Senator Dorgan, and I \ntoday to talk about the fact that we believe we have the votes now in \nthe Senate to be able to pass meaningful, safe, reimportation of \nprescription drugs. All we need is the opportunity to vote on it. All \nwe need is the opportunity to make the case to our colleagues.\n  There was a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today. We understand \nthat the HELP Committee will be meeting hopefully to report out a bill \nlater this week. That bill has been introduced and hearings are \nscheduled, and rescheduled. Hopefully, that will happen this week.\n  While we are talking about it, while ineffective Medicare legislation \npassed with all this confusion and information, there is a sense of \nurgency on the part of every single person using medicine today because \nthey are paying too much. It is not just our seniors, who certainly use \nthe most medicine, or the disabled; it is also the family who has a \nchild with a chronic disease, or it is a person of any age who is using \nmedicine, or it is the businesses that have seen their premiums \nskyrocket in large part because of the skyrocketing prices of \nprescription drugs.\n  I come from a great State that makes automobiles. We are very proud \nof that. When I sit down with the Big Three automakers which are \ndesperately concerned about the cost of\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\nhealth care and what needs to be done, they show me numbers. One-half \nthe increase in their health care costs is because of prescription \ndrugs. I know this is also true with small businesses which, on \noverage, have seen their premiums double at least in the last 5 years. \nIn fact, it is more likely to be doubling every 3 years.\n  The opportunity we have to create more competition and to open the \nborders is something that not only would help our seniors, many of whom \nare incredibly disillusioned and, frankly, angry that a Medicare bill \nwas passed that may not be of much help at all to them. But we can also \nbe helping every single American from the youngest to the oldest as \nwell as businesses if we do this and do this now.\n  We have 1 more week before we break for the summer. We know there are \nprecious few weeks when we come back in the fall. This needs to get \ndone now.\n  There are 31 in the Senate on both sides of the aisle from all \ndifferent political beliefs who are cosponsoring this reimportation \nbill. Our bill provides substantial safeguards and assures quality and \naffordability. Our bill ensures that licensed pharmacists in the United \nStates can do business with licensed pharmacists in Canada and in other \ncountries with strong safety standards.\n  Our bill provides for inspections for anticounterfeiting technologies \nand chain of custody. Our bill is a well-thought-out, well-designed \npiece of legislation that meets and addresses every legitimate concern \nthat has been raised.\n  There is no reason Americans should not have access to safe, FDA-\napproved drugs that come from FDA-inspected facilities in our country \nor other countries. We have been debating this issue far too long. I am \nextremely hopeful we will be able to see a debate in the Senate and a \nvote before we leave this summer.\n  Researchers at Boston University have told me that in the 1-month \ndelay for the markup of the HELP Committee--the bill was on the agenda \na month ago; now it will be on this next week--we could have saved over \n$5 billion by simply allowing citizens to do business with Canadian \npharmacies.\n  That means $5 billion has been spent, coming out of the pockets of \npeople choosing between food and medicine, caring for their children, \nworried about being able to have medicine for their disability, or a \nsmall business struggling to make it through insurance premium \nincreases, or a large business. That is $5 billion just by not acting \nthis last month. I assume that means $5 billion next month and $5 \nbillion the month after.\n  The legislation we have put together on a bipartisan basis will make \na real difference. It is something we can do now.\n  I commend my House colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have not \nonly passed legislation similar to the legislation we now have worked \non and developed on a bipartisan basis, but they have, once again, \nplaced language in the Agriculture appropriations bill that would stop \nany enforcement against reimportation and allow it to continue. This \npassed the House of Representatives just yesterday.\n  It is time for the Senate to step up and to make this happen. In the \npast, there has been an effort to require certification by Health and \nHuman Services regarding safety. That, unfortunately, has been a \nbarrier by those who simply do not want to do this. So we have taken a \ndifferent route this time. We have decided to sit down and go through \nall the safety standards and regulations and put it in the statute. \nThat is what we have done.\n  We have also included in the bill an effort that Senator Feinstein \nhas worked on regarding Internet drug efforts and safety requirements.\n  There is no reason substantively not to pass our drug reimportation \nbill if the goal is to help lower the costs of prescription drugs \nthrough competition and to lower prices for our seniors and for our \nfamilies and for our businesses. We have the tool. Let's not wait \nanother month and another $5 billion, or another 2 months, $10 billion, \nor $15 billion or $20 billion, when we have the ability to join with \nthe majority of our House colleagues and get this done now.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, are we presently acting as in morning \nbusiness?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the motion to proceed to S.J. \nRes. 40.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent the pending business be put \naside and that I have 15 minutes to present my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  ISRAEL-BASHING AT THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a serious \nproblem that faces our world, one that is reflected directly in the \nactivities at the United Nations. It is anti-Semitism. It is what we \nsee at the U.N., the distinctly unjust treatment of 1 of its 192 member \ncountries, the State of Israel.\n  A historic moment occurred last month. For the first time in its six-\ndecade history, the U.N. actually convened a conference to discuss the \ngrowing problem of anti-Semitism worldwide. While it is heartening to \nsee this development, the fact remains that since its creation in 1946, \nthe U.N. has never produced any resolutions specifically aimed at anti-\nSemitism. Nor have any of its ancillary bodies ever issued any report \non the subject of discrimination against Jews and Israel.\n  At the conference I just mentioned, Columbia Law School professor \nAnne Bayefsky delivered a remarkable speech. I ask unanimous consent \nthat her speech be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, Professor Bayefsky highlighted the \nhistory of the intolerance of the United Nations and outright \ndiscrimination against Israel.\n  Now, what does discrimination to Israel mean? It is exemplified in \ndenying Israel and only Israel admission to the vital negotiating \nsessions of regional groups held daily during meetings of the U.N. \nCommission on Human Rights. It means devoting 6 of the 10 emergency \nsessions ever held by the General Assembly to repudiating Israel.\n  In contrast, no emergency session was ever held on the Rwanda \ngenocide, estimated to have killed 1 million people, or on the so-\ncalled ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands of people in the former \nYugoslavia, or on the atrocities committed against millions of people \nin Sudan in past decades.\n\n  More than one-quarter of the resolutions adopted by the Human Rights \nCommission over the last 40 years condemning the human rights record of \nvarious nations have been directed solely at Israel. There has not been \na single resolution critical of China for suppressing the civil and \npolitical rights of its 1.3 billion people. There has not been a single \nresolution condemning the deadly racism in Zimbabwe that has brought \n600,000 people to the brink of starvation.\n  It seems that anti-Israeli sentiment pervades the top levels of the \nU.N. hierarchy. The Secretary-General publicly condemns the tactics \nIsraelis are forced to use to defend themselves, but he never once \nmentions the terrorist attacks that precipitate the response.\n  Because of this blatant bias, it is not surprising that last Friday \nthe International Court of Justice--the U.N.'s court--squarely found \nthat the barrier the Israelis are building to protect themselves \nviolates international law. The ICJ demanded it be torn down and \ninsisted that Palestinians be compensated for any damages.\n  Now, make no mistake, I believe an organization comprised of nations \naround the world must exist. I believe the United Nations is that \norganization. But it must operate fairly and be balanced. It is \nprecisely because of my idealism regarding the role of the U.N. and the \nICJ in international affairs that I am so disappointed in the court's \none-sided decision last week.\n  The bias emanates not so much from the decision itself but from what \nthe\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\njudges neglected to mention. They remained absolutely silent about the \nsuicide bombers, the terrorist attacks that have killed over 1,000 \nIsraelis in the past 4 years. In relative terms, it would be the \nequivalent to over 46,000 Americans.\n  I think it is informative that 1 week earlier, Israel's own Supreme \nCourt also ruled on the barrier. The Israeli Supreme Court determined \nthat the barrier is defensible as a security measure but ordered the \nIsraeli Army to reroute a section of it in response to Palestinian \nconcerns and make it hew more closely to the pre-1967 Green Line.\n  The justices wrote:\n\n       We are aware that this decision does not make it easier to \n     deal with that reality, [but] is the destiny of a democracy.\n\n  They added that a democracy such as Israel's:\n\n       does not see all means as acceptable, and the ways of her \n     enemies are not always open before her. A democracy must \n     sometimes fight [back] with one arm tied behind her back.\n\n  The Israeli Supreme Court sent the strongest message, perhaps, to \nIsrael's enemies of its uniqueness, resilience, and fundamental \ngoodness.\n  The Israeli children are never subjected to lessons in the school \nthat say: ``Learn to kill your Arab neighbors,'' as contrasted to \ntextbook after textbook in surrounding countries that say: ``You must \nlearn to kill the Jews and kill the Israelis.''\n  As a matter of fact, this morning on television, what I saw was a \ngroup of very young Palestinian children being taught military methods \nso they can one day give their lives carrying a suicide bomb. It is \nincredible, when you think about it, that the Israelis should pay \nattention to the rights of the Palestinians, when you never hear in any \nof the Arab countries surrounding Israel that they ought to pay \nattention to the rights of the Israelis. It is very hard to even get a \ncondemnation from them when some mad suicide bomber comes in and takes \ninnocent Israeli lives without provocation.\n\n  Israel's vibrant, even if imperfect, democracy is precisely the \nreason why the U.N. bias against her is so unjust. Israel is a country \nin which huge crowds often gather in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square to demand \nthe Government quickly end its support of settlements, challenging the \nviews of lots of Israelis who want to use these settlements. But there \nis a fairness, an equity in the views of the Israelis that prevents \nthem from going ahead and supporting these activities.\n  Israel is a country in which domestic human rights groups, in an act \nof political protest, recently mounted a photo exhibit of Israeli \nsoldiers abusing Palestinian civilians--in the lobby of its Parliament, \nthe Knesset.\n  Could you ever imagine that taking place in Damascus? Or Iraq, as it \nwas? Or even a country as friendly as Egypt seems to be?\n  Israel is a country in which top reservists in the army and air force \nhave refused to serve in the West Bank because they do not support the \npolicies of the Sharon Government.\n  In an ideal world, Israel could prevent suicide bombers from \ninfiltrating its cafes and malls and buses. But the Israelis do not \nlive in an ideal world. The security fence is a measure of last resort. \nIsraelis felt compelled to build the security fence after Palestinian \nterrorists launched 50 successful suicide bombings in 2002.\n  The security fence, as Israel's Supreme Court rightly concluded, is a \ndefensive measure. And as a defensive measure, it has been very \neffective. There were 50 suicide bombings in 2002. In 2003, there were \n20. So far this year, there have been eight. That is a very positive \noutcome.\n  The most recent bombing attack in Israel occurred this past Sunday, \nJuly 11, on a Tel Aviv bus, killing one soldier and injuring a dozen \ncivilians. One of the injured was a 29-year-old named Sammi Masrawa, an \nIsraeli Arab who leads an Arab-Jewish friendship group in the Tel Aviv \narea. Mr. Masrawa told the press he had opposed the barrier. In fact, \nhe even took part in protests against it. But the bombing on Sunday \nchanged his mind. He said:\n\n       I will now be for [the fence] and form an organization in \n     favor of it.\n\n  I wonder: How might the 15 judges of the United Nations' highest \ncourt justify their ruling to Sammi Masrawa, who from his hospital bed \nnow pledges to lobby in support of the security fence.\n  His quest for peace underpinned by real security should be the call \nto which the United Nations and the international community respond. \nInstead, the ICJ has allowed an anti-Israel bias to cloud its vision \nand undermine its noble purpose.\n  We Americans need to wake up to the fact that the U.N. and its \nancillaries are fundamentally hostile to Israel. We need to wake up to \nthe fact that the U.N. and its ancillaries are unwilling to stanch the \nmurderous flow of worldwide anti-Semitism. Why is this important? \nBecause what affects Israel affects the United States as well.\n  Israeli nuclear physicist Haim Harari recently gave a speech in which \nhe grimly but accurately described the virulent new strain of \nterrorists who are not only threatening Jerusalem, they are threatening \nBali, Istanbul, Madrid, Riyadh, and New York. I urge my colleagues to \nread his message and reflect on what we must do to protect America and \nIsrael, fix the U.N., and promote freedom and democracy and human \nrights around the world.\n  I hope also to remind our Arab friends in the area--be that Egypt or \nKuwait or some of the other countries there--we care about these kinds \nof poisons that pervade the atmosphere, and we cannot tolerate that \nkind of an attitude, and won't, in our relationship with the U.N. or \nwithout or within these countries.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Harari's speech be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From On The Record, June 21, 2004]\n\n  One Small Step: Is the U.N. Finally Ready To Get Serious About Anti-\n                               Semitism?\n\n                           (By Anne Bayefsky)\n\n       (Editor's note: Ms. Bayefsky delivered this speech at the \n     U.N. at a conference on Confronting Anti-Semitism: Education \n     for Tolerance and Understanding, sponsored by the United \n     Nations Department of Information, this morning.)\n       I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you at this first \n     U.N. conference on anti-Semitism, which is being convened six \n     decades after the organization's creation. My thanks to the \n     U.N. organizers and in particular Shashi Tharoor [the \n     undersecretary-general for communications and public \n     information] for their initiative and to the secretary-\n     general for his willingness to engage.\n       This meeting occurs at a point when the relationship \n     between Jews and the United Nations is at an all-time low. \n     The U.N. took root in the ashes of the Jewish people, and \n     according to its charter was to flower on the strength of a \n     commitment to tolerance and equality for all men and women \n     and of nations large and small. Today, however, the U.N. \n     provides a platform for those who cast the victims of the \n     Nazis as the Nazi counterparts of the 21st century. The U.N. \n     has become the leading global purveyor of anti-Semitism--\n     intolerance and inequality against the Jewish people and its \n     state.\n       Not only have many of the U.N. members most responsible for \n     this state of affairs rendered their own countries Judenrein, \n     they have succeeded in almost entirely expunging concern \n     about Jew-hatred from the U.N. docket. From 1965, when anti-\n     Semitism was deliberately excluded from a treaty on racial \n     discrimination, to last fall, when a proposal for a General \n     Assembly resolution on anti-Semitism was withdrawn after \n     Ireland capitulated to Arab and Muslim opposition, mention of \n     anti-Semitism has continually ground the wheels of U.N.-led \n     multilateralism to a halt.\n       There has never been a U.N. resolution specifically on \n     anti-Semitism or a single report to a U.N. body dedicated to \n     discrimination against Jews, in contrast to annual \n     resolutions and reports focusing on the defamation of Islam \n     and discrimination against Muslims and Arabs. Instead there \n     was Durban--the 2001 U.N. World Conference ``Against \n     Racism,'' which was a breeding ground and global soapbox for \n     anti-Semites. When it was over U.N. officials and member \n     states turned the Durban Declaration into the centerpiece of \n     the U.N.'s antiracism agenda--allowing Durban follow-up \n     resolutions to become a continuing battlefield over U.N. \n     concern with anti-Semitism.\n       Not atypical is the public dialogue in the U.N.'s top human \n     rights body--the Commission on Human Rights--where this past \n     April the Pakistani ambassador, speaking on behalf of the 56 \n     members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, \n     unashamedly disputed that anti-Semitism was about Jews.\n       For Jews, however, ignorance is not an option. Anti-\n     Semitism is about intolerance and discrimination directed at \n     Jews--both individually and collectively. It concerns both \n     individual human rights and the group right to self-\n     determination--realized in the state of Israel.\n       What does discrimination against the Jewish state mean? It \n     means refusing to admit\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\n     only Israel to the vital negotiating sessions of regional \n     groups held daily, during U.N. Commission on Human Rights \n     meetings. It means devoting six of the 10 emergency sessions \n     ever held by the General Assembly to Israel. It means \n     transforming the 10th emergency session into a permanent \n     tribunal--which has now been reconvened 12 times since 1997. \n     By contrast, no emergency session was ever held on the \n     Rwandan genocide, estimated to have killed a million people, \n     or the ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands in the former \n     Yugoslavia, or the death of millions over the past two \n     decades of atrocities in Sudan. That's discrimination.\n       The record of the Secretariat is more of the same. In \n     November 2003, Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued a report \n     on Israel's security fence, detailing the purported harm to \n     Palestinians without describing one terrorist act against \n     Israelis which preceded the fence's construction. Recently, \n     the secretary-general strongly condemned Israel for \n     destroying homes in southern Gaza without mentioning the \n     arms-smuggling tunnels operating beneath them. When Israel \n     successfully targeted Hamas terrorist Abdel Aziz Rantissi \n     with no civilian casualties, the secretary-general \n     denounced Israel for an ``extrajudicial'' killing. But \n     when faced with the 2004 report of the U.N. special \n     rapporteur on extrajudicial executions detailing the \n     murder of more than 3,000 Brazilian civilians shot at \n     close range by police, Mr. Annan chose silence. That's \n     discrimination.\n       At the U.N., the language of human rights is hijacked not \n     only to discriminate but to demonize the Jewish target. More \n     than one quarter of the resolutions condemning a state's \n     human rights violations adopted by the commission over 40 \n     years have been directed at Israel. But there has never been \n     a single resolution about the decades-long repression of the \n     civil and political rights of 1.3 billion people in China, or \n     the million female migrant workers in Saudi Arabia kept as \n     virtual slaves, or the virulent racism which has brought \n     600,000 people to the brink of starvation in Zimbabwe. Every \n     year, U.N. bodies are required to produce at least 25 reports \n     on alleged human rights violations by Israel, but not one on \n     an Iranian criminal justice system which mandates punishments \n     such as crucifixion, stoning and cross-amputation of the \n     right hand and left foot. This is not a legitimate critique \n     of states with equal or worse human rights records. It is \n     demonization of the Jewish state.\n       As Israelis are demonized at the U.N., so Palestinians and \n     their cause are deified. Every year the U.N. marks Nov. 29 as \n     the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \n     People--the day the U.N. partitioned the British Palestine \n     mandate and which Arabs often style as the onset of al naba \n     or the ``catastrophe'' of the creation of the state of \n     Israel. In 2002, the anniversary of the vote that survivors \n     of the concentration camps celebrated, was described by \n     Secretary-General Annan as ``a day of mourning and a day of \n     grief.''\n       In 2003 the representatives of over 100 member states stood \n     along with the secretary-general, before a map predating the \n     state of Israel, for a moment of silence ``for all those who \n     had given their lives for the Palestinian people''--which \n     would include suicide bombers. Similarly, U.N. rapporteur \n     John Dugard has described Palestinian terrorists as ``tough'' \n     and their efforts as characterized by ``determination, \n     daring, and success.'' A commission resolution for the past \n     three years has legitimized the Palestinian use of ``all \n     available means including armed struggle''--an absolution for \n     terrorist methods which would never be applied to the self-\n     determination claims of Chechens or Basques.\n       Although Palestinian self-determination is equally \n     justified, the connection between demonizing Israelis and \n     sanctifying Palestinians makes it clear that the core issue \n     is not the stated cause of Palestinian suffering. For there \n     are no U.N. resolutions deploring the practice of encouraging \n     Palestinian children to glorify and emulate suicide bombers, \n     or the use of the Palestinian population as human shields, or \n     the refusal by the vast majority of Arab states to integrate \n     Palestinian refugees into their societies and to offer them \n     the benefits of citizenship. Palestinians are lionized at the \n     U.N. because they are the perceived antidote to what U.N. \n     envoy Lakhdar Brahimi called the great poison of the Middle \n     East--the existence and resilience of the Jewish state.\n       Of course, anti-Semitism takes other forms at the U.N. Over \n     the past decade at the commission, Syria announced that \n     yeshivas train rabbis to instill racist hatred in their \n     pupils. Palestinian representatives claimed that Israelis can \n     happily celebrate religious holidays like Yom Kippur only by \n     shedding Palestinian blood, and accused Israel of injecting \n     300 Palestinian children with HIV-positive blood.\n       U.N.-led anti-Semitism moves from the demonization of Jews \n     to the disqualification of Jewish victimhood: refusing to \n     recognize Jewish suffering by virtue of their ethnic and \n     national identity. In 2003, a General Assembly resolution \n     concerned with the welfare of Israeli children failed (though \n     one on Palestinian children passed handily) because it proved \n     impossible to gain enough support for the word Israeli \n     appearing before the word children. The mandate of the U.N. \n     special rapporteur on the ``Palestinian territories,'' set \n     over a decade ago, is to investigate only ``Israel's \n     violations of . . . international law'' and not to consider \n     human-rights violations by Palestinians in Israel.\n       It follows in U.N. logic that nonvictims aren't really \n     supposed to fight back. One after another concrete Israeli \n     response to terrorism is denounced by the secretary-general \n     and member states as illegal. But killing members of the \n     command-and-control structure of a terrorist organization, \n     when there is no disproportionate use of force, and arrest is \n     impossible, is not illegal. Homes used by terrorists in the \n     midst of combat are legitimate military targets. A \n     nonviolent, temporary separation of parties to a conflict on \n     disputed territory by a security fence, which is sensitive to \n     minimizing hardships, is a legitimate response to Israel's \n     international legal obligations to protect its citizens \n     from crimes against humanity. In effect, the U.N. moves to \n     pin the arms of Jewish targets behind their backs while \n     the terrorists take aim.\n       The U.N.'s preferred imagery for this phenomenon is of a \n     cycle of violence. It is claimed that the cycle must be \n     broken--every time Israelis raises a hand. But just as the \n     symbol of the cycle is chosen because it has no beginning, it \n     is devastating to the cause of peace because it denies the \n     possibility of an end. The Nuremberg Tribunal taught us that \n     crimes are not committed by abstract entities.\n       The perpetrators of anti-Semitism today are the preachers \n     in mosques who exhort their followers to blow up Jews. They \n     are the authors of Palestinian Authority textbooks that teach \n     a new generation to hate Jews and admire their killers. They \n     are the television producers and official benefactors in \n     authoritarian regimes like Syria or Egypt who manufacture and \n     distribute programming that depicts Jews as bloodthirsty \n     world conspirators.\n       Listen, however, to the words of the secretary-general in \n     response to two suicide bombings which took place in \n     Jerusalem this year, killing 19 and wounding 110: ``Once \n     again, violence and terror have claimed innocent lives in the \n     Middle East. Once again, I condemn those who resort to such \n     methods.'' ``The Secretary General condemns the suicide \n     bombing Sunday in Jerusalem. The deliberate targeting of \n     civilians is a heinous crime and cannot be justified by any \n     cause.'' Refusing to name the perpetrators, Mr. Secretary-\n     General, Teflon terrorism, is a green light to strike again.\n       Perhaps more than any other, the big lie that fuels anti-\n     Semitism today is the U.N.-promoted claim that the root cause \n     of the Arab-Israeli conflict is the occupation of Palestinian \n     land. According to U.N. revisionism, the occupation \n     materialized in a vacuum. In reality, Israel occupies land \n     taken in a war which was forced upon it by neighbors who \n     sought to destroy it. It is a state of occupation which \n     Israelis themselves have repeatedly sought to end through \n     negotiations over permanent borders. It is a state in which \n     any abuses are closely monitored by Israel's independent \n     judiciary. But ultimately, it is a situation which is the \n     responsibility of the rejectionists of Jewish self-\n     determination among Palestinians and their Arab and \n     Muslim brethren--who have rendered the Palestinian \n     civilian population hostage to their violent and anti-\n     Semitic ambitions.\n       There are those who would still deny the existence of anti-\n     Semitism at the U.N. by pointing to a range of motivations in \n     U.N. corridors including commercial interests, regional \n     politics, preventing scrutiny of human rights violations \n     closer to home, or enhancement of individual careers. U.N. \n     actors and supporters remain almost uniformly in denial of \n     the nature of the pathogen coursing through these halls. They \n     ignore the infection and applaud the host, forgetting that \n     the cancer which kills the organism will take with it both \n     the good and the bad.\n       The relative distribution of naivete, cowardice, \n     opportunism, and anti-Semitism, however, matters little to \n     Noam and Matan Ohayon, ages 4 and 5, shot to death through \n     their mother's body in their home in northern Israel while \n     she tried to shield them from a gunman of Yasser Arafat's al-\n     Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. The terrible consequences of these \n     combined motivations mobilized and empowered within U.N. \n     chambers are the same.\n       The inability of the U.N. to confront the corruption of its \n     agenda dooms this organization's success as an essential \n     agent of equality or dignity or democratization.\n       This conference may serve as a turning point. We will only \n     know if concrete changes occur hereafter: a General Assembly \n     resolution on anti-Semitism adopted, an annual report on \n     anti-Semitism forthcoming, a focal point on anti-Semitism \n     created, a rapporteur on anti-Semitism appointed.\n       But I challenge the secretary-general and his organization \n     to go further--if they are serious about eradicating anti-\n     Semitism:\n       a. Start putting a name to the terrorists that kill Jews \n     because they are Jews.\n       b. Start condemning human-rights violators wherever they \n     dwell--even if they live in Riyadh or Damascus.\n       c. Stop condemning the Jewish people for fighting back \n     against their killers.\n       d. And the next time someone asks you or your colleagues to \n     stand for a moment of silence to honor those who would \n     destroy the state of Israel, say no. Only then will the \n     message be heard from these chambers that the U.N. will not \n     tolerate anti-Semitism or its consequences against Jews and \n     the Jewish people, whether its victims live in Tehran, Paris \n     or Jerusalem.\n       Ms. Bayefsky is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and \n     an adjunct professor at Columbia University Law School.\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                               Exhibit 5\n\n                    A View From the Eye of the Storm\n\n   (Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International \n   Advisory Board of a large multi-national corporation, April, 2004)\n\n       As you know, I usually provide the scientific and \n     technological ``entertainment'' in our meetings, but, on this \n     occasion, our Chairman suggested that I present my own \n     personal view on events in the part of the world from which I \n     come. I have never been and I will never be a Government \n     official and I have no privileged information. My perspective \n     is entirely based on what I see, on what I read and on the \n     fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 \n     years. You may regard my views as those of the proverbial \n     taxi driver, which you are supposed to question, when you \n     visit a country.\n       I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and \n     some personal thoughts about the Israeli-Arab conflict. \n     However, I will touch upon it only in passing. I prefer to \n     devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the \n     region and its place in world events. I refer to the entire \n     area between Pakistan and Morocco, which is predominantly \n     Arab, predominantly Moslem, but includes many non-Arab and \n     also significant non-Moslem minorities.\n       Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate \n     neighborhood? Because Israel and any problems related to it, \n     in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media, \n     is not the central issue, and has never been the central \n     issue in the upheaval in the region. Yes, there is a 100-\n     year-old Israeli-Arab conflict, but it is not where the main \n     show is. The millions who died in the Iran-Iraq war had \n     nothing to do with Israel. The mass murder happening right \n     now in Sudan, where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its \n     black Christian citizens, has nothing to do with Israel. The \n     frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds \n     of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians \n     have nothing to do with Israel. Saddam Hussein did not invade \n     Kuwait, endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people \n     because of Israel. Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen \n     in the 60's because of Israel. Assad the Father did not kill \n     tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma \n     in Syria because of Israel. The Taliban control of \n     Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with \n     Israel. The Libyan blowing up of the Pan-Am flight had \n     nothing to do with Israel, and I could go on and on and on.\n       The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region \n     is totally dysfunctional, by any standard of the word, and \n     would have been so even if Israel would have joined the Arab \n     league and an independent Palestine would have existed for \n     100 years. The 22 member countries of the Arab league, \n     from Mauritania to the Gulf States, have a total \n     population of 300 millions, larger than the US and almost \n     as large as the EU before its expansion. They have a land \n     area larger than either the United States or all of \n     Europe. These 22 countries, with all their oil and natural \n     resources, have a combined GDP smaller than that of \n     Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of \n     California alone. Within this meager GDP, the gaps between \n     rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich \n     made their money not by succeeding in business, but by \n     being corrupt rulers. The social status of women is far \n     below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago. \n     Human rights are below any reasonable standard, in spite \n     of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the \n     U.N. Human Rights commission. According to a report \n     prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and \n     published under the auspices of the U.N., the number of \n     books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller \n     than what little Greece alone translates. The total number \n     of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less \n     than that of 6 million Israelis. Birth rates in the region \n     are very high, increasing the poverty, the social gaps and \n     the cultural decline. And all of this is happening in a \n     region, which only 30 years ago, was believed to be the \n     next wealthy part of the world, and in a Moslem area, \n     which developed, at some point in history, one of the most \n     advanced cultures in the world.\n       It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented \n     breeding ground for cruel dictators, terror networks, \n     fanaticism, incitement, suicide murders and general decline. \n     It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames \n     this situation on the United States, on Israel, on Western \n     Civilization, on Judaism and Christianity, on anyone and \n     anything, except themselves.\n       Do I say all of this with the satisfaction of someone \n     discussing the failings of his enemies? On the contrary, I \n     firmly believe that the world would have been a much better \n     place and my own neighborhood would have been much more \n     pleasant and peaceful, if things were different.\n       I should also say a word about the millions of decent, \n     honest, good people who are either devout Moslems or are not \n     very religious but grew up in Moslem families. They are \n     double victims of an outside world, which now develops \n     Islamophobia and of their own environment, which breaks their \n     heart by being totally dysfunctional. The problem is that the \n     vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the \n     terror and of the incitement but they also do not stand up \n     against it. They become accomplices, by omission, and this \n     applies to political leaders, intellectuals, business people \n     and many others. Many of them can certainly tell right from \n     wrong, but are afraid to express their views.\n       The events of the last few years have amplified four \n     issues, which have always existed, but have never been as \n     rampant as in the present upheaval in the region. These are \n     the four main pillars of the current World Conflict, or \n     perhaps we should already refer to it as ``the undeclared \n     World War III''. I have no better name for the present \n     situation. A few more years may pass before everybody \n     acknowledges that it is a World War, but we are already \n     well into it.\n       The first element is the suicide murder. Suicide murders \n     are not a new invention but they have been made popular, if I \n     may use this expression, only lately. Even after September \n     11, it seems that most of the Western World does not yet \n     understand this weapon. It is a very potent psychological \n     weapon. Its real direct impact is relatively minor. The total \n     number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within \n     Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due \n     to car accidents. September 11 was quantitatively much less \n     lethal than many earthquakes. More people die from AIDS in \n     one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands \n     of Chechnya-based Moslem suicide murderers since that \n     conflict started. Saddam killed every month more people than \n     all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition \n     occupation of Iraq.\n       So what is all the fuss about suicide killings? It creates \n     headlines. It is spectacular. It is frightening. It is a very \n     cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe \n     lifelong injuries to many of the wounded. It is always shown \n     on television in great detail. One such murder, with the help \n     of hysterical media coverage, can destroy the tourism \n     industry of a country for quite a while, as it did in Bali \n     and in Turkey.\n       But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no \n     defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a \n     determined suicide murderer. This has not yet penetrated the \n     thinking of the Western World. The U.S. and Europe are \n     constantly improving their defense against the last murder, \n     not the next one. We may arrange for the best airport \n     security in the world. But if you want to murder by suicide, \n     you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself \n     and kill many people. Who could stop a suicide murder in the \n     midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the \n     airport metal detector? How about the lines to the check-in \n     counters in a busy travel period? Put a metal detector in \n     front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will \n     get the buses. Protect the buses and they will explode in \n     movie theaters, concert halls, supermarkets, shopping malls, \n     schools and hospitals. Put guards in front of every concert \n     hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked \n     by the guards and this line will be the target, not to speak \n     of killing the guards themselves. You can somewhat reduce \n     your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and \n     by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely \n     not win the war in a defensive way. And it is a war!\n       What is behind the suicide murders? Money, power and cold-\n     blooded murderous incitement, nothing else. It has nothing to \n     do with true fanatic religious beliefs. No Moslem preacher \n     has ever blown himself up. No son of an Arab politician or \n     religious leader has ever blown himself. No relative of \n     anyone influential has done it. Wouldn't you expect some of \n     the religious leaders to do it themselves, or to talk their \n     sons into doing it, if this is truly a supreme act of \n     religious fervor? Aren't they interested in the benefits \n     of going to Heaven? Instead, they send outcast women, \n     naive children, retarded people and young incited \n     hotheads. They promise them the delights, mostly sexual, \n     of the next world, and pay their families handsomely after \n     the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people \n     are dead.\n       Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and \n     despair. The poorest region in the world, by far, is Africa. \n     It never happens there. There are numerous desperate people \n     in the world, in different cultures, countries and \n     continents. Desperation does not provide anyone with \n     explosives, reconnaissance and transportation. There was \n     certainly more despair in Saddam's Iraq then in Paul \n     Bremmer's Iraq, and no one exploded himself. A suicide murder \n     is simply a horrible, vicious weapon of cruel, inhuman, \n     cynical, well-funded terrorists, with no regard to human \n     life, including the fife of their fellow countrymen, but with \n     very high regard to their own affluent well-being and their \n     hunger for power.\n       The only way to fight this new ``popular'' weapon is \n     identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime \n     or pirates on the high seas: the offensive way. Like in the \n     case of organized crime, it is crucial that the forces on the \n     offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the \n     crime pyramid. You cannot eliminate organized crime by \n     arresting the little drug dealer in the street corner. You \n     must go after the head of the ``Family''.\n       If part of the public supports it, others tolerate it, many \n     are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty \n     or by a miserable childhood, organized crime will thrive and \n     so will terrorism. The United States understands this now, \n     after September 11. Russia is beginning to understand it. \n     Turkey understands it well. I am very much afraid that most \n     of Europe still does not understand it. Unfortunately, it \n     seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide \n     murders will arrive in Europe in a big way. In my humble\n\n[[Page S8101]]\n\n     opinion, this will definitely happen. The Spanish trains and \n     the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning. The unity of \n     the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely \n     indispensable. Until Europe wakes up, this unity will not be \n     achieved.\n       The second ingredient is words, more precisely lies. Words \n     can be lethal. They kill people. It is often said that \n     politicians, diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business \n     people must sometimes lie, as part of their professional \n     life. But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish, \n     in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute \n     deliberate fabrications, which have reached new heights in \n     the region we are talking about. An incredible number of \n     people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never \n     happened, or was an American provocation or, even better, a \n     Jewish plot.\n       You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information, Mr. \n     Mouhamad Said al-Sahaf and his press conferences when the US \n     forces were already inside Baghdad. Disinformation at time of \n     war is an accepted tactic. But to stand, day after day, \n     and to make such preposterous statements, known to \n     everybody to be lies, without even being ridiculed in your \n     own milieu, can only happen in this region. Mr. Sahaf \n     eventually became a popular icon as a court jester, but \n     this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers \n     from giving him equal time. It also does not prevent the \n     Western press from giving credence, every day, even now, \n     to similar liars. After all, if you want to be an anti-\n     Semite, there are subtle ways of doing it. You do not have \n     to claim that the holocaust never happened and that the \n     Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed. But millions of \n     Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case. \n     When these same leaders make other statements, the Western \n     media report them as if they could be true.\n       It is a daily occurrence that the same people, who finance, \n     arm and dispatch suicide murderers, condemn the act in \n     English in front of western TV cameras, talking to a world \n     audience, which even partly believes them. It is a daily \n     routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in \n     Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world. \n     Incitement by Arab TV, accompanied by horror pictures of \n     mutilated bodies, has become a powerful weapon of those who \n     lie, distort and want to destroy everything. Little children \n     are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so-called \n     martyrs, and the Western World does not notice it because its \n     own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows. I \n     recommend to you, even though most of you do not understand \n     Arabic, to watch Al Jazeera, from time to time. You will not \n     believe your own eyes.\n       But words also work in other ways, more subtle. A \n     demonstration in Berlin, carrying banners supporting Saddam's \n     regime and featuring three-year old babies dressed as suicide \n     murderers, is defined by the press and by political leaders \n     as a ``peace demonstration''. You may support or oppose the \n     Iraq war, but to refer to fans of Saddam, Arafat or Bin Laden \n     as peace activists is a bit too much. A woman walks into an \n     Israeli restaurant in mid-day, eats, observes families with \n     old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent \n     tables and pays the bill. She then blows herself up, killing \n     20 people, including many children, with heads and arms \n     rolling around in the restaurant. She is called ``martyr'' by \n     several Arab leaders and ``activist'' by the European press. \n     Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and \n     the money flows.\n       There is a new game in town: The actual murderer is called \n     ``the military wing'', the one who pays him, equips him and \n     sends him is now called ``the political wing'' and the head \n     of the operation is called the ``spiritual leader''. There \n     are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature, \n     used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western \n     media. These words are much more dangerous than many people \n     realize. They provide an emotional infrastructure for \n     atrocities. It was Joseph Goebels who said that if you repeat \n     a lie often enough, people will believe it. He is now being \n     outperformed by his successors.\n       The third aspect is money. Huge amounts of money, which \n     could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional \n     part of the world, are channeled into three concentric \n     spheres supporting death and murder. In the inner circle are \n     the terrorists themselves. The money funds their travel, \n     explosives, hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable \n     targets. They are surrounded by a second wider circle of \n     direct supporters, planners, commanders, preachers, all of \n     whom make a living, usually a very comfortable living, by \n     serving as terror infrastructure. Finally, we find the third \n     circle of so-called religious, educational and welfare \n     organizations, which actually do some good, feed the hungry \n     and provide some schooling, but brainwash a new generation \n     with hatred, lies and ignorance. This circle operates mostly \n     through mosques, madrasas and other religious establishments \n     but also through inciting electronic and printed media. It is \n     this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior, that \n     democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside \n     world is minimal. It is also that circle that leads the way \n     in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world, for the \n     miseries of the region.\n       Figuratively speaking, this outer circle is the guardian, \n     which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to \n     the inner circle of terror and incitement, rather than to the \n     world outside. Some parts of this same outer circle actually \n     operate as a result of fear from, or blackmail by, the inner \n     circles. The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate. \n     Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of \n     20, the most receptive age to incitement, guaranteeing two \n     more generations of blind hatred.\n       Of the three circles described above, the inner circles are \n     primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria, \n     until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by \n     some of the Communist regimes. These states, as well as the \n     Palestinian Authority, are the safe havens of the wholesale \n     murder vendors. The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi \n     Arabia, but also by donations from certain Moslem communities \n     in the United States and Europe and, to a smaller extent, by \n     donations of European Governments to various NGO's and by \n     certain United Nations organizations, whose goals may be \n     noble, but they are infested and exploited by agents of the \n     outer circle. The Saudi regime, of course, will be the next \n     victim of major terror, when the inner circle will explode \n     into the outer circle. The Saudis are beginning to understand \n     it, but they fight the inner circles, while still financing \n     the infrastructure at the outer circle.\n       Some of the leaders of these various circles live very \n     comfortably on their loot. You meet their children in the \n     best private schools in Europe, not in the training camps of \n     suicide murderers. The Jihad ``soldiers'' join packaged death \n     tours to Iraq and other hotspots, while some of their leaders \n     ski in Switzerland. Mrs. Arafat, who lives in Paris with her \n     daughter, receives tens of thousands dollars per month from \n     the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority while a typical \n     local ringleader of the Al-Aksa brigade, reporting to Arafat, \n     receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars, \n     for performing murders at the retail level.\n       The fourth element of the current world conflict is the \n     total breaking of all laws. The civilized world believes in \n     democracy, the rule of law, including international law, \n     human rights, free speech and free press, among other \n     liberties. There are naive old-fashioned habits such as \n     respecting religious sites and symbols, not using ambulances \n     and hospitals for acts of war, avoiding the mutilation of \n     dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human \n     bombs. Never in history, not even in the Nazi period, was \n     there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe \n     now. Every student of political science debates how you \n     prevent an anti-democratic force from winning a democratic \n     election and abolishing democracy. Other aspects of a \n     civilized society must also have limitations. Can a policeman \n     open fire on someone trying to kill him? Can a government \n     listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers? \n     Does free speech protects you when you shout ``fire'' in a \n     crowded theater? Should there be death penalty, for \n     deliberate multiple murders? These are the oldfashioned \n     dilemmas. But now we have an entire new set.\n       Do you raid a mosque, which serves as a terrorist \n     ammunition storage? Do you return fire, if you are attacked \n     from a hospital? Do you storm a church taken over by \n     terrorists who took the priests hostages? Do you search every \n     ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to \n     reach their targets? Do you strip every woman because one \n     pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her \n     belly? Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you, \n     standing deliberately behind a group of children? Do you raid \n     terrorist headquarters, hidden in a mental hospital? Do you \n     shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one \n     location to another, always surrounded by children? All of \n     these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas. What \n     do you do? Well, you do not want to face the dilemma. But it \n     cannot be avoided.\n       Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that someone would \n     openly stay in a wellknown address in Teheran, hosted by the \n     Iranian Government and financed by it, executing one atrocity \n     after another in Spain or in France, killing hundreds of \n     innocent people, accepting responsibility for the crimes, \n     promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same, \n     while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of \n     his acts but continues to host him, invite him to official \n     functions and treat him as a great dignitary. I leave it to \n     you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have \n     done, in such a situation.\n       The problem is that the civilized world is still having \n     illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless \n     environment. It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a \n     ballerina ice-skater into the rink or to knock out a \n     heavyweight boxer by a chess player. In the same way that no \n     country has a law against cannibals eating its prime \n     minister, because such an act is unthinkable, international \n     law does not address killers shooting from hospitals, mosques \n     and ambulances, while being protected by their Government or \n     society. International law does not know how to handle \n     someone who sends children to throw stones, stands behind \n     them and shoots with immunity and cannot be arrested because \n     he is sheltered by a Government. International law does \n     not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is \n     royally and comfortably hosted by a country, which \n     pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak \n     to arrest him. The amazing thing is that all of these \n     crooks demand protection under international law and \n     define all those who attack them as war criminals, with \n     some Western media repeating the allegations.\n\n[[Page S8102]]\n\n     The good news is that all of this is temporary, because \n     the evolution of international law has always adapted \n     itself to reality. The punishment for suicide murder \n     should be death or arrest before the murder, not during \n     and not after. After every world war, the rules of \n     international law have changed and the same will happen \n     after the present one. But during the twilight zone, a lot \n     of harm can be done.\n       The picture I described here is not pretty. What can we do \n     about it? In the short run, only fight and win. In the long \n     run--only educate the next generation and open it to the \n     world. The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force. \n     The outer circle cannot be eliminated by force. Here we need \n     financial starvation of the organizing elite, more power to \n     women, more education, counter propaganda, boycott whenever \n     feasible and access to Western media, internet and the \n     international scene. Above all, we need a total absolute \n     unity and determination of the civilized world against all \n     three circles of evil.\n       Allow me, for a moment, to depart from my alleged role as a \n     taxi driver and return to science. When you have a malignant \n     tumor, you may remove the tumor itself surgically. You may \n     also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from \n     other parts of the body, thereby preventing new ``supplies'' \n     from expanding the tumor. If you want to be sure, it is best \n     to do both.\n       But before you fight and win, by force or otherwise, you \n     have to realize that you are in a war, and this may take \n     Europe a few more years. In order to win, it is necessary to \n     first eliminate the terrorist regimes, so that no Government \n     in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people. I \n     do not want to comment here on whether the American-led \n     attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of \n     weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument, \n     but I can look at the post-war map of Western Asia. Now that \n     Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya are out, two and a half terrorist \n     states remain: Iran, Syria and Lebanon, the latter being a \n     Syrian colony. Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list. As \n     a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq, both Iran \n     and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories \n     unfriendly to them. Iran is encircled by Afghanistan, by the \n     Gulf States, Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former \n     Soviet Union. Syria is surrounded by Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and \n     Israel. This is a significant strategic change and it applies \n     strong pressure on the terrorist countries. It is not \n     surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a \n     Shiite uprising in Iraq. I do not know if the American plan \n     was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria, but that is the \n     resulting situation.\n       In my humble opinion, the number one danger to the world \n     today is Iran and its regime. It definitely has ambitions to \n     rule vast areas and to expand in all directions. It has an \n     ideology, which claims supremacy over Western culture. It is \n     ruthless. It has proven that it can execute elaborate \n     terrorist acts without leaving too many traces, using Iranian \n     Embassies. It is clearly trying to develop Nuclear Weapons. \n     Its so-called moderates and conservatives play their own \n     virtuoso version of the ``good-cop versus bad-cop'' game. \n     Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism, it is certainly behind much \n     of the action in Iraq, it is fully funding the Hizbulla and, \n     through it, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, it \n     performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South \n     America and probably also in Uzbekhistan and Saudi Arabia and \n     it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium, which \n     includes, as minor players, Syria, Lebanon and certain Shiite \n     elements in Iraq. Nevertheless, most European countries still \n     trade with Iran, try to appease it and refuse to read the \n     clear signals.\n       In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the \n     financial resources of the terror conglomerate. It is \n     pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between \n     the Sunni terror of Al Qaida and Hamas and the Shiite terror \n     of Hizbulla, Sadr and other Iranian inspired enterprises. \n     When it serves their business needs, all of them collaborate \n     beautifully.\n       It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of \n     the outer circle, which is the fertile breeding ground of \n     terror. It is important to monitor all donations from the \n     Western World to Islamic organizations, to monitor the \n     finances of international relief organizations and to react \n     with forceful economic measures to any small sign of \n     financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism. It is \n     also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies \n     and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who \n     collaborate with it out of naivety, financial interests or \n     ignorance.\n       Above all, never surrender to terror. No one will ever know \n     whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a \n     different result, if not for the train bombings a few days \n     earlier. But it really does not matter. What matters is that \n     the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that \n     they won by driving Spain out of Iraq. The Spanish story will \n     surely end up being extremely costly to other European \n     countries, including France, who is now expelling inciting \n     preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent \n     troops to Iraq. In the long run, Spain itself will pay even \n     more.\n       Is the solution a democratic Arab world? If by democracy we \n     mean free elections but also free press, free speech, a \n     functioning judicial system, civil liberties, equality to \n     women, free international travel, exposure to international \n     media and ideas, laws against racial incitement and against \n     defamation, and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding \n     hospitals, places of worship and children, then yes, \n     democracy is the solution. If democracy is just free \n     elections, it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be \n     elected, the one whose incitement and fabrications are the \n     most inflammatory. We have seen it already in Algeria and, to \n     a certain extent, in Turkey. It will happen again, if the \n     ground is not prepared very carefully. On the other hand, a \n     certain transition democracy, as in Jordan, may be a better \n     temporary solution, paving the way for the real thing, \n     perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy \n     did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China.\n       I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail. But \n     the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of \n     this war, the more costly and painful the victory will be. \n     Europe, more than any other region, is the key. Its \n     understandable recoil from wars, following the horrors of \n     World War II, may cost thousands of additional innocent \n     lives, before the tide will turn.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Message to the American People\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I, like millions of Americans, see \nwhat is happening on television, listen to what is happening on radio, \nand hear campaign commercials that are being submitted on a fairly \nregular basis. I listen to them and wonder, what is the message to our \ncountry? What is being said? What is the message we want to give to the \nAmerican people? What do we want to tell them about our concern for \ntheir needs? Do we want to talk about lower prices for prescription \ndrugs? Do we want to talk about educating our children? Do we want to \ntalk about health care generally? Do we want to talk about bringing the \ntroops home? Do we say enough is enough?\n  When we look at the record and see what is happening, the killing \ncontinues in Iraq. Since we have gone over to an Iraqi interim \ngovernment, the rate of death has not diminished from the time before \nwe turned this government over to the Iraqi interim government.\n  Today, we heard news of a terrible explosion that killed a bunch of \nIraqis and injured American soldiers. The toll continues to mount. I \nbelieve the American people are concerned about that. I hear it from \nparents who say: My son's term has been extended. He thought he would \nbe home by now. Now he has to serve 3 more months. Or, my daughter has \nto stay there far longer than she expected. Not only are they \nemotionally torn apart, not only are there family problems from the \nabsence of dad or the absence of mom from the household, but \nfinancially it is a disaster.\n  I have tried to get an amendment. I tried to put it on the Defense \nappropriations bill, but I couldn't get the amendment attached. They \nsaid no, we don't want to give $2,000 a month more for these people for \nthe 3 months more they have to serve; $6,000 total cost; maybe $150 \nmillion out of a budget of $400 billion, and we couldn't get an ear to \nlisten to it here. We couldn't get the majority to pay attention.\n  The job market is not robust. We are still at a loss for the number \nof jobs we have available since this administration took over. When do \nwe put these people to work? When do we stop shipping jobs abroad? When \ndo we deal with the problems that concern everyday citizens? When do we \ndeal with the cost of gasoline, which is up 50 percent almost in the \nlast year?\n  What we hear in response to those problems are campaign commercials--\n$8 million of them in recent weeks. We hear that John Kerry has missed \ntwo-thirds of the votes that have been taken here in the U.S. Senate. \nWe do not hear anybody saying John Kerry served bravely in Vietnam when \nhe disagreed with the policy of his country, but he felt loyal enough \nand obliged enough and went ahead and got wounded three times. He got \nthree Purple Hearts. I served in the Army 3 years. I didn't earn one, \nbut I know what a Purple Heart means in recognition of bravery; a \nSilver Star, very high-ranking\n\n[[Page S8103]]\n\nmedal; a Bronze Star, an important recognition of bravery on the \nbattlefield. And we want to hear talk about how he has missed these \nvotes.\n  Yes, I am a Member of the Senate and am proud of it. I am proud of my \nvoting record. But I am also proud of the contribution John Kerry is \ntrying to make to this country.\n  We ought to talk about comparing service to country, President Bush's \nservice and Senator John Kerry's service. Compare the two. Start with \nVietnam. See what happened there, when President Bush had an \nopportunity to avoid regular service by going to the Air Guard, which \nhe didn't really do anything with. But to criticize Senator John Kerry \nfor his contribution to our country by pointing out the fact that he \nhas missed a bunch of votes, that he found time to vote against the \nLaci Peterson amendment which was offered here, and that he missed \nother votes--talk about the platforms of these two, talk about what \nJohn Kerry is saying we have to do about jobs, about getting a \ncoalition to help us deal with Iraq to try to strengthen our resources \nthere.\n\n  President Bush's decision, along with his Cabinet, the Secretary of \nDefense, and the Vice President, was that General Shinseki was all \nwrong when he said we have to have 300,000 people in Iraq. They fired \nhim. They got rid of him. They don't want to hear dissent and \ndifference. They don't want to hear it. They don't want the public to \nhear what John Kerry has done for his country. No. They want to hear \nthat he missed votes. It is too bad that he missed votes, but he is on \na larger mission. He wants a change in the direction of this country. \nHe is not here at times when he is out there delivering messages to \nwhich people respond.\n  Just look at the gatherings. We see people for Senator Kerry and \nSenator Edwards. They are thirsty for information that affects their \neveryday lives. They do not sit around the dinner table talking about \nhow much time we are spending--not enough time, they might say--on gay \nmarriage and a constitutional amendment. I don't think Mr. and Mrs. \nWorking American are sitting around their table praying for the moment \nthat an amendment to the Constitution will be put in place where we can \nchallenge the rights of a particular group of people when we haven't \ngotten our appropriations bills in place; we haven't voted on moving \nhomeland security resources along not funding these things. No, but we \ncan spend days here.\n\n  By the way, we may have set a record for quorum calls. We have spent \na lot of time with two lights on. That should tell the American people \nthat there is nothing going on in here. We have had one vote this week, \nand the prospects for another vote are not very bright. What an \nexhausting schedule, two, three votes, possibly five votes in a week. \nCome on.\n  Please, Mr. President, clear your message, talk about the things the \nAmerican people are concerned about. Talk about how we get our kids \nhome from Iraq, talk about how we get our former allies into the mix so \nthey can help share the burden. That is what we want to hear.\n  We do not want to hear only critical comments about John Kerry \nbecause then you force us to compare the two records. If I were \nPresident Bush, I would hide from the record. If they want to compare \nPresident Bush's record to Senator John Kerry's record of service to \ncountry, we would have quite a revelation for the people in this \ncountry.\n  Spending millions on commercials to denigrate Senator John Kerry, a \nwar hero, a volunteer, who went to Vietnam--go there, do your duty, \npull a guy out of the water whose life may be hanging in the balance, \nunder gunfire. Pull this man out of the water.\n  I have campaigned with one of his former swift boat colleagues. If \nyou heard the praise that he gave to LTG John Kerry for his leadership. \nBut we do not want to talk about that. We want to try to subdue it with \nsneering commentaries about how he missed a vote and flip-flopped.\n  I wish President Bush would look at some of the decisions he made and \nflip them. One of them I tried to pass was to have flag-draped coffins, \nthe respect that they earn. People who gave their lives on behalf of \nthe country's mission, when they come back to Dover, DE, where the \ncoffins are deposited, and we say no, the media cannot show those \ncoffins because that would alert people to the penalties of war, to the \npunishment that families endure. We do not want that. Hide it from the \npublic. Don't let them understand what the cost of war is.\n  They criticize Senator John Kerry, loyal American, who served his \nduty, served it well, served it here. Look at his voting record before \nhe ran for President of the United States. Look at the President's \ntours for fundraising and political gatherings. He goes on Air Force \nOne and the only cost--and this 747 is a beautiful airplane; most of \nAmerica has seen it--all that has to be paid is the cost of the first-\nclass transportation on a commercial airliner. Take this huge airplane, \nlift it into the sky and say: Well, we will reimburse it because we \nused it for fundraising or for political campaigns.\n  Mr. President, change your tune. Let's hear your view on what America \nhas to have to satisfy the needs of our constituents. Please, you have \ngone too far with this character abuse, with this character \nassassination. You have gone too far.\n  Look at the American people. Look them in the eye and say, yes, I, \nPresident George Bush, approve of this message, and give a positive \nmessage about when drug prices are coming down, about how we will fund \nHead Start for 300,000 children who will now be dropped, or other \nprograms that are talked about but not funded. Please, Mr. President, \nspeak up on behalf of the people in America so we can build strength, \nso we can have some harmony and not the divisive attitude we find \nprevailing.\n\n  It is not fair to the American people. When we deny a hero's \nrecognition, we do something far worse. It was done in the State of \nGeorgia in a senatorial election recently. A fellow named Max Cleland, \nwith whom we served, and whom we all felt very close to, lost three \nlimbs in Vietnam. They managed to paint him in a somewhat cowardly \nfashion, that he was soft on defense. One arm missing, half of one arm \nmissing, two legs missing. It takes him 2 hours to get out of bed in \nthe morning, and they made him look like he was soft on defense. What a \ndisgrace. The American people have to look at that.\n  And now the game is to denigrate John Kerry's record to make him look \nas if he is just absent and not doing anything worthwhile. He and \nSenator Edwards are trying to put this country on the right path. The \nvoters will decide, by the way. But we ought to let the record be out \nthere so that everybody knows what each of the parties is doing.\n  Enough, Mr. President. Please change the tone of your commercials. It \nis not fair to have an airplane in the sky saying: Senator John Kerry, \nif he had his choice, would have voted against the interests of the \ntroops. It is a foul lie, that is what it is, not true at all. If a \nvote was made, it was made in the context of an entire amendment. It \nwas not made simply to take money away from our serving troops. \nPresident Bush knows that.\n  I wish he would change his tone. It does not ring properly for the \nPresident. It does not become the President of the United States to be \nlooking at Senator John Kerry's record and make jokes about his \nattendance, about his flip-flop. No, no, no, look at the things he has \ndone. We can all pick out the blemishes of the other, but that is no \nway to run a country. That is the way to run a schoolyard fight. It \ndoes not become the President of the United States.\n  I yield the floor, but I hope President Bush will change his tone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                   In Memory of Carey Lackman Slease\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to inform the \nSenate family of the passing of Carey Anne Lackman Slease, my chief of \nstaff, who passed this morning at 5:30 a.m.\n  During the course of the day, my office staff and I have been deluged \nwith expressions of sympathy showing the very high regard and high \nesteem that she was held in by our Senate family.\n  She was afflicted with the terrible problem of breast cancer. She had \na long, lingering illness. She received the very best of modern day \nmedicine with the assistance of the National Institutes of Health. My \ndeputy, Bettilou\n\n[[Page S8104]]\n\nTaylor, who handles the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services \nand Education, has had extensive contact with the National Institutes \nof Health. When I saw Carey last night, less than 24 hours ago, she had \nexpressed her gratitude for the kind of care which she had received.\n  She said, in her own words, she had a good run and she was \nunderstanding and at peace with herself as she knew her imminent fate.\n  She had left the hospital shortly after being married to her \nsweetheart, Clyde Slease, III, on Saturday. We have a beautiful set of \nwedding photographs, a clear remembrance of her from just a few days \nago. And she came home, setting up a hospice, in effect, in her home.\n\n  As I say, when I saw her yesterday, she was reconciled and at peace \nwith herself, and considering the circumstances, as composed and as \nbrave and as resolute as any human being could be. She said she was \nadvised that it was a matter of a few days or a week or two. She was \ntaken this morning, as I say, at 5:30.\n  Her life was really the U.S. Senate. She graduated from Radford \nUniversity. She was the oldest daughter of a retired colonel, William \nF. Lackman. She is survived by three sisters and three brothers--a \nlarge family of seven children--and her mother.\n  She came to the Senate family at the age of 24, and she spent most of \nthe remaining half of her life in the Senate, dying at the age of 48. \nShe was a legislative assistant to Senator John Heinz from 1979 to \n1985. She then founded her own firm in Los Angeles for a period of 6 \nyears. She then came back to work for me in the early 1990s. Except for \na very short stint, again, with her own firm in biotech in the public \nsector, she was on my staff, coming back to work for me some 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago in December 2001, when called to active duty.\n  She did an extraordinary job for me. She was beautiful in many ways: \na statuesque blonde, an amiable personality. She worked well with her \ncolleagues. She worked well with the young staff. She was a mentor. She \nwas very accomplished, brilliant, studious, analytical, and handled the \nsubstantive problems of the office with aplomb, dignity, and \nefficiency.\n  She was one of the first women to be chief of staff in the U.S. \nSenate. She was acclaimed by PoliticsPA as one of Pennsylvania's most \npolitically powerful women.\n  She had an extraordinary career, regrettably cut short by her \nuntimely passing at the age of 48.\n  Funeral services will be held in Middleburg, VA, on Friday at 10 \na.m., with a viewing tomorrow evening.\n  She has made quite an impact in many realms of her professional \npursuits, but really most of all in the U.S. Senate, where she had made \nso many friends and was held in such very high regard, really beloved \nby the Senate family.\n  So it is a sad occasion for the entire Senate family, but most of all \nfor her colleagues in my office and for me to note her passing at the \nvery tender age of 48.\n  Senator Santorum was in the chamber and wanted to speak but could not \nwait until the other speakers had concluded.\n  I thank the Chair and, in the absence of any Senator seeking \nrecognition, suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8104-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8104-S8105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 4520\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments I will be propounding a \nunanimous consent request that we can comment on afterwards. It \nreflects a number of negotiations and back and forth between both sides \nof the aisle that have gone on for several weeks, but aggressively and \nintensively over the last 8 to 9 hours.\n  I ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, July 15, immediately \nfollowing morning business, the pending motion to proceed be withdrawn \nand the majority leader or his designee be recognized in order to move \nto proceed to Calendar No. 591, H.R. 4520; provided further that the \nmotion be agreed to and that Chairman Grassley then be immediately \nrecognized in order to offer S. 1637, as passed by the Senate, as a \nsubstitute amendment; provided further that Senator DeWine be \nrecognized in order to offer a DeWine-Kennedy first-degree amendment \nrelating to the FDA and tobacco; further, that no other amendments be \nin order to the bill and that there be 3 hours for debate equally \ndivided in the usual form; I further ask consent that following the \ndebate, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the amendment at a \ntime determined by the majority leader after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader and that immediately following the disposition of \nthat amendment, the substitute be agreed to, the bill then be read a \nthird time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill \nwith no intervening action or debate; I further ask consent that the \nSenate then insist on its amendment, request a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair then be authorized to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate with a ratio of 12 to 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, what this means is we will be proceeding to \nconference on the FSC/ETI JOBS bill, a bill that overwhelmingly passed \nthe Senate and passed the House of Representatives and that prior to \nproceeding to conference, we will have a vote tomorrow on a combined \nbill that has to do with the FDA and a tobacco buyout. That vote will \nfollow up to 3 hours tomorrow. The vote will likely be tomorrow \nafternoon, although we will be debating the issue in the morning.\n  I am pleased. We all know that the FSC/ETI JOBS bill is a very \nimportant bill for the United States, for jobs and jobs creation. There \nis a certain time limit involved. In fact, every month that we wait, \nthe Euro tax goes up 1 percent every month; it is 9 percent now. It is \ntime to take this to conference and pass this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the majority \nleader in announcing this agreement tonight. This has not been easy for \nanybody involved in these discussions. We are now prepared to proceed \nwith, I think, a very good understanding about how we as Members of the \nSenate will present ourselves in the conference. I am very confident \nthat we can reach a successful conclusion.\n  Mr. FRIST. I want to discuss with the Democratic Leader an approach \nthat might enable us to move forward to conference on the JOBS bill, S. \n1637. The Senate JOBS bill reflects overwhelming bipartisan support, \npassing by a margin of 92-5. Much work remains to be done on this bill \nand it is important we start as soon as possible.\n  There are significant differences with the House bill, so this is \nlikely going to be a challenging process. I want to make sure that all \nSenators know that it is unrealistic to expect that the House will \nagree with all our provisions and that we will likely have to make \nchanges to S. 1637.\n  But as we make those changes, we should make them together. The JOBS \nbill we passed was a model of bipartisan cooperation that was marked by \ngood faith on both sides. And that is the essence of the agreement I am \nproposing--a commitment from both sides that they will work in good \nfaith in the conference to get the best possible result. I have spoken \nto Senator Grassley and he has agreed that he will not pursue a \nconclusion to the conference--nor sign any conference report--that \nwould alter the text of S. 1637 in a way that undermines the broad \nbipartisan consensus S. 1637 achieved on final passage.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Majority Leader for his leadership. I have \ndiscussed this with my colleagues and can commit wholeheartedly to the \ngood faith process you have proposed. Our side understands that changes \nwill have to be made to S. 1637; but, as they are made, these changes \nwill be the result of the mutual agreement of the lead Senate \nconferees, as well as the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader, \nacting in good faith.\n\n[[Page S8105]]\n\n  By moving S. 1637 through the Senate, Senators Grassley and Baucus \nhave already demonstrated that they can make that process work. If the \nprocess should break down due to disagreements over either corporate \ntax policy or extraneous provisions, then we understand that such a \nconference report will not be brought to the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct, so long as the Democratic conferees are \nacting in good faith. And I have every expectation they will. I agree \nthat it is our mutual goal to reach a conference agreement that \nreflects the balance and broad bipartisan consensus S. 1637 achieved. \nThat will be the test of good faith for both sides. I think we can do \nthat, and we will not bring a bill to the Senate floor if it does not \nreflect that commitment. I want to thank the Democratic Leader for his \nleadership and willingness to address this process.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's work \nin reaching the agreement and the good faith that I believe we need to \ndemonstrate on a bipartisan basis to move forward. This accommodates \nthe concerns on both sides. We have made some real progress. We have a \nlot of work to do. There are a lot of differences with the House. But I \nam confident that Democrats and Republicans are now in a position to \nwork very closely together to come up with the best result.\n  There are no predetermined conclusions as to what the result may be, \nbut we do this with a full appreciation of the need to work together to \naccomplish what is clearly a real opportunity to move forward on a jobs \nbill, on legislation that I believe is a must-pass piece of legislation \nprior to the time we adjourn for the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I congratulate the majority leader and \nthe Democratic leader for what I think is an excellent agreement made \nin good faith. It gives us a chance to pass one of the most important \npieces of legislation that Congress will consider in the second session \nof the 108th Congress.\n  It has not been easy getting to this point. I wanted to say, \nparticularly on behalf of those of us who represent States in which \ntobacco farmers are slowly having their assets stripped from them, that \nthis agreement gives the buyout a chance. It doesn't guarantee an \noutcome, but it certainly gives the buyout a chance to be considered in \nconference. Getting to conference on this bill is a significant move in \nthe right direction from the point of view of those of us who represent \ntobacco growers.\n  I thank the leaders for what I think is an excellent agreement to \nmove this into conference and have a chance to pass a very important \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8105-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

FRED CHOLICK\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, more than 7,000 students and thousands of \nSouth Dakota farm and ranch families have been impacted through the \nleadership of one man: Dr. Fred Cholick.\n  Dr. Cholick has served South Dakota's No. 1 industry of agriculture \nfor nearly a quarter of a century. He has been a teacher, a mentor and \nan advocate for expanded research. For the past 6 years, he has served \nas Dean of the College of Agriculture and Biological Sciences at South \nDakota State University, a land grant university and South Dakota's \nlargest educational institution.\n  He has earned a strong reputation nationally. Through his work, he \ncaught the attention of Kansas State University, where he will become \nDean of the College of Agriculture in Manhatten. It is a loss for my \nhome state of South Dakota, but an incredible professional opportunity \nfor Dr. Cholick.\n  When Dr. Cholick became Dean of the College of Agriculture and \nBiological Sciences in 1998, he instilled a motto for the college: \n``Making a Difference.'' It was a bold statement that faculty embraced \nand, to those students who arrived on campus, it signaled the high \nexpectations of the University and Dr. Cholick.\n  Dr. Cholick is an academic, but he has never been confined to a \nclassroom or laboratory. He has traveled extensively throughout our \nexpansive state, engaging in a constructive dialogue with farmers, \nranchers and agri-business men and women. He understands that adapting \nto the changes in agriculture--brought about by a global economy, \nbreakthroughs in technology and other factors--should be a \ncollaborative effort.\n  While Dr. Cholick is a forceful spokesperson for agriculture, he is \nan equally good listener, taking in people's ideas and insights in a \npatient, thoughtful manner.\n  As a young professor and researcher from Oregon State University and \nColorado State University, Dr. Cholick made a difference for South \nDakota's farmers with his work on spring wheat varieties that can \nwithstand the harsh weather of the Great Plains. He continued that \ncommitment when he headed up the Plant Science Department, continually \nworking to improve seed genetics to create more efficient and effective \ncorn and soybean varieties.\n  South Dakota State University has been enriched by Dr. Cholick's \nservice for 23 years. Beginning next month, he will continue his good \nwork at Kansas State University.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Dr. Cholick for his \ndistinguished career and commitment to our Nation's land grant \ninstitutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8105-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On September 30, 2003, in San Pablo, CA, Police Officers found a \ntransgender hair stylist named Sindy Cuarda wearing a blouse and pants, \nbleeding heavily from several gunshot wounds in the driveway of a \nbusiness in San Pablo. She was shot in the chest and genitals. Though \npolice have not commented on the case, witnesses have said that it was \nmotivated out of hate.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8105-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8105-S8107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ENSURING AMERICA'S COMPETITIVENESS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have come to this floor several times \nin the last few months to discuss our country's future competitiveness \nin the global marketplace, which I consider to be a very serious \nsubject. As a first step in tackling the challenges we are now facing, \nyesterday I introduced three bills that I feel will move us in the \nright direction. They will ensure a strong workforce that can handle \nthe ever-changing world around it, and create more high tech job \nopportunities for this workforce by encouraging the development of \nscience parks.\n  We have, as a nation, a significant negative trend to reverse. The \nUnited\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\nStates currently ranks fifteenth in the percentage of 18-to-24-year-\nolds who earn science and engineering degrees in their respective \ncountries. This places us behind Taiwan and South Korea, Ireland and \nItaly among others. Less than thirty years ago, in 1975, the United \nStates ranked third in the world in this respect. According to a new \nNational Science Foundation report entitled ``An Emerging and Critical \nProblem of the Science and Engineering Labor Force'', the average age \nof the science and engineering workforce is rising, and the children of \nthe baby boom generation are not choosing these careers in the same \nnumbers as their parents. The number of science and engineering \ndoctoral degrees awarded to U.S. citizens dropped by 7 percent from \n1998 to 2001, while the number of jobs requiring science and \nengineering skills in the U.S. labor force is growing almost 5 percent \nper year. In a recent survey, the National Association of Manufacturers \nfound that more than 80 percent of manufacturers report a shortage of \nqualified job candidates. Equally troubling, it is estimated that as \nmany as 3.3 million jobs may be sent overseas in the next 15 years, \ncausing American workers to lose $136 billion in wages.\n  A recent trip to Taiwan brought to my attention some of these \nemerging opportunities in other countries, and specifically the major \nbenefits of a science park. Initially developed by the Taiwanese \ngovernment in the early 1980s, the Hsinchu Science Park meets many of \nthe needs of growing high tech companies, which include access to a \ntrained work force, financing, secondary supply chain companies, and \nquality of life services such as schools, roads and parks. Two \ncompanies spun out from this park now control 40 percent of the world's \nmarket for chip fabrication. And China is now adopting a similar model.\n  What we need to take from countries like Taiwan is the role the \ngovernment has to foster continued growth in key industries by \nsupporting the necessary infrastructure, such as the science parks. It \nshould also be pointed out that that support is not forever. While \nTaiwan had a very active role in chip R in the 70's and 80's, that is \nnot true today. Industry, not the government, funds over 94 percent of \nchip R\n  In my own State of New Mexico, the 6-year-old Sandia Science and \nTechnology Park has already demonstrated some of the benefits of this \nunique model. The Sandia park now has 19 entities employing almost \n1,000 people. The average annual salary is $55,000--well above the \nAlbuquerque average. Since the Park's inception, more than $17 million \nin cooperative research and development agreements and licensing \nagreements have been made between Sandia National Laboratory and park \ntenants. In addition, Sandia has awarded more than $50 million in \nprocurement contracts to park tenants. Both Sandia National Laboratory \nand the companies in the park have benefited immensely from the \nadvantages of this business environment.\n  With the new challenges we are facing as a competitor in the \ninternational marketplace, here are four things we can do to improve \nour Nation's position.\n  First, we have to improve our high tech workforce. We need to \nincrease the numbers of workers educated for employment in high \ntechnology industries, align the technical and vocational programs of \neducational institutions with the workforce needs of high growth \nindustries, offer individuals expanded opportunities for rapid training \nand re-training needed to keep and change jobs in a volatile economy, \nand provide U.S. companies with adequate numbers of skilled technical \nworkers. This is why I am introducing the Workforce Investment in Next \nGeneration Technologies--WING--Act today.\n  Drawing from the already very successful Advanced Technology \nEducation Program at the National Science Foundation, the legislation \nwill establish a consultation partnership between the National Science \nFoundation, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Education \nthat creates flexible high-tech, high-wage career ladders. It would do \nthis by funding cooperative partnerships between one-stop centers, \nbusiness, community colleges, universities, and vocational programs at \nthe local and regional level. These would be directed toward creating \ntechnology-based certification programs that would solidify common \nskill standards for industry. Schools would create a curriculum based \non current industry needs, and individuals who leave the program would \nhave a skill-set recognized by industry. Significantly, they could be \nused anywhere across the country.\n  Over time, because individuals would be able to incrementally \nincrease their skill set through additional training, they would be \nable to pursue higher level degrees in science and technology and \nobtain progressively higher-wage employment. Furthermore, by linking \nthe public and private sector in a collaborative effort for high-\ntechnology workforce training, it will encourage the sharing of \ninformation and ideas, increase cooperation between entities frequently \nhaving a reputation for not working together, and enhance cluster-\ndriven economic growth across the country. In my state of New Mexico, \nfor example, you could easily envision a cluster being developed around \nkey critical technologies for the future such as high temperature \nsuperconductors or next-generation lighting.\n  Second, we need to ensure that individuals typically trapped in low-\nwage jobs have a tangible chance to step onto career ladders to \nsomething better. To this end I previously introduced the Limited \nEnglish Proficiency and Integrated Workforce Training Act, S. 1690. \nThis legislation establishes a program under the Workforce Investment \nAct administered jointly by Departments of Labor and Education focused \non preparing and placing individuals with limited English proficiency \nin growing industries with tangible high wage career paths. It is also \ndesigned to bypass lengthy prerequisites to entry into the workforce \nand allow individuals with limited proficiency to integrate \noccupational and English language training. Significantly, it \nrecognizes that immigrants constitute close to 50 percent of the growth \nin the civilian workforce in the last decade and that these individuals \ncan make a significant contribution to U.S. economic competitiveness.\n  In combination, these bills will bring together workforce training \nand economic development to enhance opportunities for growth in \ncommunities around the country. Similar language was already accepted \nin the Workforce Investment Act legislation that passed the Senate.\n  Focusing on high-school to postsecondary education, an important \nthird component to meeting the demands of a competitive, 21st century \nworkforce is the bill I am introducing today, the Preparing Students \nfor a High-Tech World Act.\n  Strong career and technical education programs are vital to \naddressing our shortage of highly-skilled workers and to preserving \nthese jobs for Americans. These programs offer effective and proven \nlinks to positive educational and employment outcomes for students, \nincluding increased school attendance, reduced high school dropout \nrates, higher grades, increased entry into postsecondary education, and \ngreater access to high-tech careers.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, we have benefited greatly from \nfederal support for career and technical education programs, which \ninvolve over 3,000 secondary and postsecondary teachers. These programs \nhave a distinguished record of preparing young people and adults for \nfurther education and careers. For instance, in Gadsden, we have an \ninnovative program in a rural border area that has been struggling to \nkeep its jobs and its industry alive. The Gadsden program has directly \nlinked the needs of area employers to the high school and postsecondary \ncurriculum. The employers get a customized workforce, and have more \nincentive to stay and grow their business in the region. The students \nget preferred hiring status, as well as opportunities to enhance their \nskills and obtain certificates as they work.\n  We also have an outstanding career and technical education program in \nRio Rancho that was established through a unique community-business \npartnership with Intel Corporation. Rio Rancho High School offers a \nrigorous, integrated career and technical education program that was \nfeatured in Time magazine as one of the 10 most innovative career and \ntechnical schools in the nation.\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\n  The Preparing Students for a High-Tech World Act will extend the \nopportunity to benefit from exemplary programs like Rio Rancho to our \nnation's students by increasing the academic rigor and integration of \ncareer and technical education programs; developing pathways to \npostsecondary education and high-skill, high-wage careers; forging \nalliances among secondary schools, postsecondary institutions, and \nbusiness and industry designed to address local and regional workforce \nneeds; ensuring that teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach \neffectively in career and technical education programs; and encouraging \nthe establishment of small, personalized, career-themed learning \ncommunities.\n  These three bills will ensure that we develop the skilled workforce \nthat is essential to building a strong and dynamic economy and to \nmaintaining our country's ability to compete in a global marketplace. \nThis legislation would have substantial spill-over benefits for the \ncommunities that adopted these strategies. It would improve science and \ntechnology education at the schools in the area. It would increase the \nemployment opportunities for the students that participated in these \nprograms. It would establish more cooperative linkages between the \nbusiness, schools, and the one-stop shops, and it would enhance \neconomic development in the region.\n  Along with developing a better trained workforce, we must also create \nthe jobs for them to fill. As I mentioned earlier, Taiwan and Sandia \nhave done an excellent job in demonstrating the competitive advantages \nof a science park. Given that they act as a critical element in \ndiffusing technology into our national industries, I think that a \nfourth element of our response to new S challenges would be for the \nFederal government to take a stronger and more coherent role in \nsupporting such parks. Some science parks are locally supported by \ntheir states, while others may apply for grants from the Economic \nDevelopment Administration within the Department of Commerce. These \nexisting sources of support are helpful but it appears to me that it \nwould make good sense to develop a more focused grant program to help \njump-start the development of science parks, which is why I have \nintroduced the Science Park Administration Act of 2004. If passed, the \nfederal funds in this bill would be cost matched by States. A loan \nprogram to assist in land acquisition and infrastructure development \nfor these parks would be established. And various tax incentives would \nbe provided, including credits for employees trained locally, and \nadjustment of depreciation schedules for high-end equipment to reflect \nactual product life-cycles.\n  I hope that I have provided some positive steps we can take to face \nthe increasingly competitive world we live in. Congress and the \nadministration need to find the will and the resolve to meet these \nchallenges head-on. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \ndoing so, and in helping to ensure the competitive strength of our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8107-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ESTIMATE FOR S. 894\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

The \n     legislation would specify a surcharge of $10 on the sale of \n     each coin and would designate the Marine Corps Heritage \n     Foundation, a nonprofit entity, as the recipient of the \n     income from the surcharge. CBO estimates that enacting S. 894 \n     would have no significant net impact on direct spending over \n     the 2004-2009 period.\n       Sales from the coins that would be authorized by S. 894 \n     could raise as much as $5 million in surcharges if the Mint \n     sells the maximum number of authorized coins. However, the \n     experience of recent commemorative coin sales suggests that \n     receipts would be about $3 million. Under current law, the \n     Mint must ensure that it does not lose money producing \n     commemorative coins before transferring any surcharges to a \n     recipient organization. CBO expects that those receipts from \n     such surcharges would be transferred to the heritage \n     foundation in fiscal year 2006.\n       S. 894 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and \n     would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       On March 22, 2004, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. \n     3277, the Marine Corps 230th Anniversary Commemorative Coin \n     Act, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Financial \n     Services on March 17, 2004.

The CBO staff contact is Matthew \n     Pickford.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Elizabeth Robinson,\n                              (For Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n     S. 976--Jamestown 400th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act of \n         2003\n       Summary: S. 976 would direct the U.S. Mint to produce a $5 \n     gold coin and a $1 silver coin in calendar year 2007 to \n     commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of \n     Jamestown, Virginia. The bill would specify a surcharge on \n     the sales price of $35 for the gold coin and $10 for the \n     silver coin and would designate the Jamestown-Yorktown \n     Foundation (an educational institution of the Commonwealth of \n     Virginia), the National Park Service, and the Association for \n     the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (a private nonprofit \n     association), as recipients of the income from those \n     surcharges.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 976 would have no \n     significant net impact on direct spending over the 2004-2009 \n     period. S. 976 contains no intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act (UMRA), and would benefit the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: S. 976 could \n     raise as much as $8.5 million in surcharges if the Mint sells \n     the maximum number of authorized coins. Recent commemorative \n     coin sales by the Mint suggest, however, that receipts would \n     be about $3 million. The legislation would require the Mint \n     to produce the $1 silver coin from silver available in the \n     National Defense Stockpile. Based on information provided by \n     the Defense Logistics Agency and the Mint, no silver is \n     available in the stockpile. Hence, CBO estimates that \n     receipts from only the $5 gold coin would be about $1.25 \n     million.\n       Under current law, only two commemorative coins may be \n     minted and issued in any calendar year and the Mint must \n     ensure that it will not lose money on a commemorative coin \n     program before transferring any surcharges to a designated \n     recipient organization. CBO expects that the Mint would \n     collect most of those surcharges in fiscal year 2007 and \n     would transfer collections to the designated recipients in \n     fiscal year 2008.\n       In addition, CBO expects that the Mint would use gold \n     obtained from the reserves held at the Treasury to produce \n     the gold coin. Because the budget treats the sale of gold as \n     a means of financing governmental operations--that is, the \n     Treasury's receipts from such sales do not affect the size of \n     the deficit--CBO has not included such receipts in this \n     estimate. CBO estimates that S. 976 would provide the federal \n     government with about $3.5 million in additional cash (in \n     exchange for gold) for financing the federal deficit in \n     fiscal year 2007.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 976 \n     contains no intergovernmental\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\n     or private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA, and would \n     benefit the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On March 22, 2004, CBO transmitted a \n     cost estimate for H.R. 1914, the Jamestown 400th Anniversary \n     Commemorative Coin Act of 2003, as ordered reported by the \n     House Committee on Financial Services on March 17, 2004. The \n     two pieces of legislation are similar and our cost estimates \n     are the same; however, H.R. 1914 would not require the Mint \n     to use silver from the National Defense Stockpile to produce \n     the $1 silver coin.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Matthew Pickford; \n     Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Sarah Puro; \n     and Impact on the Private Sector: Paige Piper/Bach.\n       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n        National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I supported passage of this year's \ndefense authorization bill because it contains many provisions that our \nbrave men and women in uniform need and deserve. But before I go into \nthe details of why I support this legislation, I must first thank the \nmembers of the United States Armed Forces for their service to our \ncountry. They are performing admirably under difficult circumstances \nall over the world. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines, along \nwith their families, are making great sacrifices in service to our \ncountry. I am voting for this legislation to support these people who \nare serving the country with such courage.\n  I strongly support the 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for \nmilitary personnel that this bill provides. We must make sure that our \nprofessional military is paid a fair wage. This bill also makes \npermanent the increase in family separation allowance and imminent \ndanger pay, another important policy for our men and women in uniform. \nOnce again, I was proud to support the expansion of full-time TRICARE \nhealth insurance for our National Guard and Reserve. The reserve \ncomponent is being used more than at any other time since World War II. \nForty percent of our troops in Iraq are reserve component troops. These \ncitizen soldiers face additional burdens when they transition in and \nout of their civilian life and providing them and their families with \nTRICARE is one way we can ease those burdens.\n  Another aspect of this bill that I strongly support is the increased \nfunding for force protection equipment. Last year, concerned \nWisconsinites contacted my office telling me that they or their \ndeployed loved ones were fighting for their country in Iraq without the \nequipment they needed. This situation is unconscionable. I have \nrepeatedly pressed the Pentagon to fix this situation and I and my \ncolleagues went a long way in addressing these shortages in the \nsupplemental spending bill for Iraq and Afghanistan. The $925 million \nfor additional up-armored HUMVEES and other ballistic protection as \nwell as the $600 million in force protection gear and combat clothing \nin this bill above what was in the President's proposed budget further \nensures that our troops have the equipment they need to perform their \nduties on the ground.\n  I am pleased that the Senate approved my amendment to ensure that the \nInspector General for the Coalition Provisional Authority will continue \nto oversee U.S. reconstruction efforts in Iraq after June 30 of this \nyear as the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. The \nAmerican taxpayers have been asked to shoulder a tremendous burden in \nIraq, and we must ensure that their dollars are spent wisely and \nefficiently. Today, the CPA is phasing out, but the reconstruction \neffort has only just begun. As of mid-May, only $4.2 billion of the \n$18.4 billion that Congress appropriated for reconstruction in November \nhad even been obligated. With multiple agencies involved and a budget \nthat exceeds the entire foreign operations appropriation for this \nfiscal year, U.S. taxpayer-funded reconstruction efforts should have a \nfocused oversight effort. My amendment will ensure that the Inspector \nGeneral's office can continue its important work even after June 30, \nrather than being compelled to start wrapping up and shutting down \nwhile so much remains to be done. This is good news for the \nreconstruction effort, and good news for American taxpayers.\n\n  I also want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee for working with me to accept the amendment that I \noffered with the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, which represents a \nfirst step toward enhancing and strengthening transition services that \nare provided to our military personnel. This amendment will require the \nGeneral Accounting Office, GAO, to undertake a comprehensive analysis \nof existing transition services for our military personnel that are \nadministered by the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Labor \nand to make recommendations to Congress on how these programs can be \nimproved. This study will focus on two issues: how to achieve the \nuniform provision of appropriate transition services to all military \npersonnel, and the role of post-deployment and pre-discharge health \nassessments as part of the larger transition program. I very much look \nforward to reviewing the results of this study.\n  The Senate version of the defense authorization bill also includes a \nprovision finally fulfilling a goal for which I have been fighting for \nyears--making sure that every state and territory has at least one \nWeapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team, WMD-CST. I was \ndelighted earlier this year when Wisconsin was chosen as one of 12 \nStates to receive a WMD-CST authorized and appropriated for in FY2004 \nbut I was also disappointed that the President's proposed budget for \nFY2005 included funding for only 4 of the 11 outstanding teams. I along \nwith 28 of my colleagues, wrote the Senate Armed Services Committee \nchairman and ranking member asking them to fully fund all 11 remaining \nteams. The chairman and ranking member have been very supportive of my \nefforts in this area over the years and I thank them again this year \nfor funding all 11 remaining WMD-CSTs.\n  This authorization bill addresses the grave threat our nation faces \nfrom unsecured nuclear materials. It includes $409 million for the \nCooperative Threat Reduction program and $1.3 billion for the \nDepartment of Energy nonproliferation programs. I was also proud to \ncosponsor the amendment offered by Senator Domenici and Senator \nFeinstein that authorizes the Department of Energy to secure the tons \nof fissile material scattered around the world. This bipartisan \ninitiative aims to dramatically accelerate current efforts to secure \nthis dangerous material so that it cannot fall into the hands of those \nwho aim to harm us. Time is of the essence and I was pleased to hear \nthat the administration is fully supportive of this effort through the \nGlobal Threat Reduction Initiative.\n\n  I also voted for an amendment offered by Senator Reed that boosts the \nArmy's end strength by 20,000. Mr. President I did so because it has \nbecome clear that the Army is currently overstretched, and I believe \nthat we need to ensure readiness to handle threats in the future. A \nrecent Brookings Institution report says that the military is being \nstretched so thin that if we don't expand its size, it could break the \nback of our all-volunteer Army. One does not have to support all of the \ndeployment decisions that brought us to this point today to see that we \nneed to have the capacity to handle multiple crises with sufficient \nmanpower and strength. I do not take lightly the decision to lock in a \nsignificant increase in spending. The need is great, however, and the \ndeliberative defense authorization process, not the emergency \nsupplemental process, is the place to do it.\n  I must note that, unfortunately, this bill has many of the same \nproblems that I've been fighting to fix for years. Once again, we are \nspending billions upon billions of dollars for weapons systems more \nsuited for the Cold War than the fight against terrorism. I was very \ndisappointed that the Senate did not agree to Senator Levin's amendment \nthat would have used a small percentage of the over $10 billion \nauthorized for missile defense for critical unfunded homeland defense \nneeds. This amendment, which I cosponsored, would have used $515.5 \nmillion now slated for additional untested interceptors and spent it \ninstead on the top unfunded Department of Defense homeland defense \npriorities, research and development programs, radiation detection \nequipment at seaports, and other important defenses against terrorism. \nBudgeting is about setting priorities and I am sad to say that when\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\nthe Senate failed to adopt Senator Levin's amendment, it missed a \ngolden opportunity to adjust its priorities in order to face our \ncountry's most pressing threat--the threat of terrorism.\n  I was disappointed that the Senate failed to reduce the retirement \nage for those in the National Guard and Reserve from 60 to 55. Our \ncountry has placed unprecedented demands upon the Guard and Reserve \nsince September 11, 2001, and will continue to do so for the \nforeseeable future. Considering the demands we are placing on them, it \nis time that we lower the Guard and Reserve's retirement age to the \nsame level as civilian federal employees.\n  Although my support for reducing the reserve component retirement age \nhas been unwavering, because of the significant budgetary impact of \nthis measure I had hoped that Congress would first receive reviews of \nreserve compensation providing all of the information that we need to \naddress this issue responsibly. I patiently waited for several studies \non the issue, including by the Defense Department, but when the studies \ncame out they called for further study. This matter cannot continue to \nlanguish unaddressed indefinitely. As retired U.S. Air Force Colonel \nSteve Strobridge, government relations director for the Military \nOfficers Association of America, MOAA, put it, ``It is time to fish or \ncut bait.'' I agree with MOAA's analysis that, ``Further delay on this \nimportant practical and emotional issue poses significant risks to \nlong-term (Guard and Reserve) retention'' and I was proud to vote for \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine.\n\n  I also believe that the Senate missed an opportunity to provide a \nsmall but needed measure of relief to military families when it failed \nto adopt my Military Family Leave Act amendment. This amendment would \nhave allowed a spouse, child, or parent who already qualifies for \nFamily and Medical Leave Act, FMLA, benefits--unpaid leave--to use \nthose existing benefits for issues directly arising from the deployment \nof a family member. The Senate adopted a similar amendment by unanimous \nconsent when I offered it to the Iraq supplemental spending bill. This \namendment has the support of the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United \nStates, the Reserve Officers Association, the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, the National Military Family \nAssociation, and the National Partnership for Women and Families.\n  I regret that a harmful second degree amendment was offered to my \namendment and that I was not given the opportunity to have a straight \nup or down vote. Rather than taking up the Senate's time in a \nprotracted debate about the second degree amendment, I withdrew my \namendment so that this important defense authorization bill could move \nforward. However, the need addressed by my amendment remains and I will \ncontinue to fight to bring some relief to military families that \nsacrifice so much for all of us.\n  I want to bring attention to another element of the Defense \nAuthorization bill that raises concerns for me. The Defense \nAuthorization bill includes language that raises troop caps in Colombia \nfrom 400 to 800 military personnel and from 400 civilian contractors to \n600. I am disappointed that Senator Byrd's amendment was not approved \nby the Senate, which would have limited the increases in these caps to \n500 military personnel and 500 civilian contractors. I have serious \nconcerns about the increase in these caps to the levels established by \nthe bill. Most importantly, I worry about placing more Americans in \nharm's way in Colombia. Further deployments bring greater risks to an \nalready overstretched military. We do not want to risk being drawn \nfurther into Colombia's civil war--certainly not without a thorough \ndebate that the American people can follow. In addition, many of my \nconstituents and I remain concerned that by raising these caps, the \nU.S. devotes greater resources to the military side of the equation in \nColombia without balancing our approach through greater support for \ndemocratic institutions, increasing economic development, and \nsupporting human rights.\n\n  There are other provisions in this bill with which I disagree and the \nSenate rejected a number of amendments that would have made this bill \nbetter. However, on balance this legislation contains many good \nprovisions for our men and women in uniform and their families and that \nis why I will vote for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8109-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  U.S.-AUSTRALIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an important \nfree trade agreement that was recently signed between the United States \nand Australia. Earlier today, I was pleased to join an overwhelming \nmajority of my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to report out \nthis agreement favorably, and I am hopeful that within the next day, \nthe full Senate will give its consent as well. This vote not only \nreaffirms our strong relationship with a close ally but marks an \nimportant step forward on our path toward economic recovery.\n  Since 1994, two-way trade between the United States and Australia has \nincreased 53 percent to nearly $29 billion. Australia purchases more \ngoods from the United States than any other country, giving the United \nStates a $9 billion bilateral goods and services trade surplus. Last \nyear alone, my homestate of Oregon exported more than $257 million in \nmerchandise to Australia. These exports accounted for 2.5 percent of \nthe State total in 2003.\n  The elimination of trade barriers between the two countries promises \nto increase these figures even more. Under the agreement, duties on \nalmost all manufactured goods will be eliminated. This will result in \nfirst-year tariff savings of about $300 million for U.S. manufactured \ngoods exporters. For Western Star--a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler--\nlocated in Portland, OR, this translates to savings of nearly $2 \nmillion a year in eliminated tariffs and duties that currently average \n$4,000 per truck exported to Australia. It is estimated that U.S.-\nAustralia Free Trade Agreement will result in approximately $2 billion \nof new U.S. exports.\n  This agreement will also open new doors for U.S. farmers. U.S. \nagricultural exports to Australia, totaling more than $700 million last \nyear, will receive immediate duty-free access. This means American \nfarmers will be better poised to compete in a market of over 19 million \npeople. Additionally, food inspection procedures that have posed \nbarriers in the past have been addressed, and substantial safeguards \nhave been written into the agreement to ensure a smoothe and stable \ntransition for our domestic meat and dairy industries.\n  As I come here today, I realize that there are those who still have \nreservations over the prospects of expanded trade. While the benefits \nof a more liberalized trade policy are vast, I know that they have not \nbeen spread evenly across all sectors. I am confident, however, that \nthe safeguards in this agreement will ensure a stable market for \ndomestic procedures while providing new market access and real consumer \nbenefits. I believe this agreement is good for the United States, and I \nurge its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8109-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8109-S8110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REVEREND DONALD J.

Mr. President, as founder of the Senate Wilderness \nCaucus, I introduced a Senate resolution to commemorate the 40th \nanniversary of the Wilderness Act of 1964, which was signed into law on \nSeptember 3, 1964, by President Lyndon B. Johnson. I thank the \nfollowing colleagues for their support as cosponsors: Senator Sununu, \nSenator Hagel, Senator Durbin, Senator Boxer, Senator McCain, Senator \nMurray, Senator Lugar, Senator Warner, Senator Chafee, Senator Snowe, \nand Senator Collins.\n  The Wilderness Act became law seven years after the first wilderness \nbill was introduced by Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota. The \nfinal bill, sponsored by Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico, passed \nthe Senate by a vote of 73-12 on April 9, 1963, and passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 373-1 on July 30, 1964. The Wilderness Act \nof 1964 established a National Wilderness Preservation System ``to \nsecure for the American people of present and future generations the \nbenefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.'' The law gives \nCongress the authority to designate wilderness areas, and directs the \nFederal land management agencies to review the lands under their \nresponsibility for their wilderness potential.\n  Under the Wilderness Act, wilderness is defined as ``an area of \nundeveloped federal land retaining its primeval character and influence \nwhich generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces \nof nature, with the imprint of man's work substantially unnoticeable.'' \nThe creation of a national wilderness system marked an innovation in \nthe American conservation movement--wilderness would be a place where \nour ``management strategy'' would be to leave lands essentially \nundeveloped.\n  The original Wilderness Act established 9.1 million acres of Forest \nService land in 54 wilderness areas. Now, after passage of 102 pieces \nof legislation, the wilderness system is comprised of over 104 million \nacres in 625 wilderness areas, across 44 States, and administered by \nfour Federal agencies: the Forest Service in the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, and the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife \nService, and the National Park Service in the Department of the \nInterior.\n  As we in this body know well, the passage and enactment of the \nWilderness Act was a remarkable accomplishment that required steady, \nbipartisan commitment, institutional support, and strong leadership. \nThe U.S. Senate was instrumental in shaping this very important law, \nand this anniversary gives us the opportunity to recognize this role.\n  As a Senator from Wisconsin, I feel a special bond with this issue. \nThe concept of wilderness is inextricably linked with Wisconsin. \nWisconsin has produced great wilderness thinkers and leaders in the \nwilderness movement such as Senator Gaylord Nelson and the writer and \nconservationist Aldo Leopold, whose A Sand County Almanac helped to \ngalvanize the environmental movement. Also notable is Sierra Club \nfounder John Muir, whose birthday is the day before Earth Day. \nWisconsin also produced Sigurd Olson, one of the founders of the \nWilderness Society.\n  I am privileged to hold the Senate seat held by Gaylord Nelson, a man \nfor whom I have the greatest admiration and respect. Though he is a \nwell-known and widely respected former Senator and former two-term \nGovernor of Wisconsin, and the founder of Earth Day, some may not be \naware that he is currently devoting his time to the protection of \nwilderness by serving as a counselor to the Wilderness Society--an \nactivity which is quite appropriate for someone who was also a co-\nsponsor, along with former Senator Proxmire, of the bill that became \nthe Wilderness Act.\n  The testimony at congressional hearings and the discussion of the \nbill in the press of the day reveals Wisconsin's crucial role in the \nlong and continuing American debate about our wild places, and in the \ndevelopment of the Wilderness Act. The names and ideas of John Muir, \nSigurd Olson, and, especially, Aldo Leopold, appear time and time again \nin the legislative history.\n  Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico, chairman of what was then \ncalled the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, stated his \nsupport of the wilderness system was the direct result of discussions \nhe had held almost 40 years before with Leopold, who was then in the \nSouthwest with the Forest Service. It was Leopold who, while with the \nForest Service, advocated the creation of a primitive area in the Gila \nNational Forest in New Mexico in 1923. The Gila Primitive Area formally \nbecame part of the wilderness system when the Wilderness Act became \nlaw.\n  In a statement in favor of the Wilderness Act in the New York Times, \nthen-Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall discussed ecology and what \nhe called ``a land ethic'' and referred to Leopold as the instigator of \nthe modern wilderness movement. At a Senate hearing in 1961, David \nBrower of the Sierra Club went so far as to claim that ``no man who \nreads Leopold with an open mind will ever again, with a clear \nconscience, be able to step up and testify against the wilderness \nbill.'' For others, the ideas of Olson and Muir--particularly the idea \nthat preserving wilderness is a way for us to better understand our \ncountry's history and the frontier experience--provided a justification \nfor the wilderness system.\n  In closing, I would like to remind colleagues of the words of Aldo \nLeopold in his 1949 book, A Sand County Almanac. He said, ``The \noutstanding scientific discovery of the twentieth century is not the \ntelevision, or radio, but rather the complexity of the land organism. \nOnly those who know the most about it can appreciate how little is \nknown about it.'' We still have much to learn, but this anniversary of \nthe Wilderness Act reminds us how far we have come and how the \ncommitment to public lands that the Senate and the Congress \ndemonstrated 40 years ago continues to benefit all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8110-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COSPONSORSHIP OF S. 2603\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that I have signed \non today as a cosponsor to S. 2603, the Junk Fax Prevention Act of \n2004. This legislation is vital in preserving a valuable small business \ntool and empowers consumers by requiring an opt-out option on faxes.\n  Consumers will benefit from this act because of the provision that \nrequires all unsolicited advertisers to provide an opt-out option on \nthe front page of all solicitations. This notice must be clear and \nconspicuous, and the mechanism for opting out must be at no cost to the \nconsumer.\n  The Junk Fax Prevention Act will also benefit small businesses \nbecause they will be able to continue corresponding with customers and \nbusiness partners who have an established business relationship. This \nis especially important for businesses, like real estate companies and \nrestaurants, which rely on faxes to do business. Faxes are beneficial \nbecause they are a low cost way to stay in touch with customers and \nclients. When an employee leaves a business, his or her email account \nis frequently shut down. Faxes allow the information to reach the new \nperson with the correct job.\n  Communication is the key to successful businesses. This bill strikes \nthe right balance between prohibiting unwanted faxes while allowing \nsmall businesses to easily stay in touch with customers.\n  I thank my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, for sponsoring this \nlegislation. I look forward to discussing the Junk Fax Prevention Act \nof 2004 in committee and urge my colleagues to adopt the necessary pro-\nsmall business and pro-consumer legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8110-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8110-S8113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST AIDS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on July 11, the 15th Annual International \nAIDS Conference began in Bangkok, Thailand. The theme of this year's \nconference is ``Access for All,'' meaning access to lifesaving \nmedications. As\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\nmany of my colleagues know, the current AIDS pandemic threatens \napproximately 38 million people worldwide. Last year, 5 million more \nbecame infected. Sixty percent of all cases are in sub-Saharan Africa, \nbut the virus is spreading almost unchecked in Asia and Eastern Europe. \nTwenty million people world-wide have died since the first case was \ndiagnosed in 1981.\n  Unfortunately, the theme of the Bangkok conference--``Access for \nAll''--is a hope and aspiration that bears little resemblance to the \nharsh reality we confront today. In reality, most newly infected people \nwill not receive anti-retroviral drugs in time to do any good.\n  There are many barriers to progress: developing countries lack the \ntrained physicians, nurses, or support staff to properly distribute \nanti-retroviral drugs and to monitor patients' progress. In addition, \ncontributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS are not sufficient. Some \ncountries are falling far short of what is needed.\n  And on July 1, the Wall Street Journal reported another big reason \nwhy drug distribution has been difficult. Simply put, the United States \ngovernment will not purchase effective generic drugs; it insists on \nbrand-name pharmaceuticals. Let me give you an example of why this \nmatters.\n  On April 6, The Washington Post reported on pricing agreements \nnegotiated by the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation with \npharmaceutical companies that produce generic drugs. These agreements, \nin cooperation with the Global Fund, the World Bank, and UNICEF, will \nprovide access to affordable AIDS drugs in 100 developing nations \naround the world. As a result, as many as 3 million additional people \nwill be tested and treated for AIDS than before.\n  Under negotiated pricing agreements with five generic-drug \ncompanies--four in India and one in South Africa--the Foundation will \nreduce the cost of fixed-dose generic AIDS drugs by as much as half. \nFixed-dosage drugs combine several drugs in one pill. This makes the \ntreatments simpler to take. Research tells us that simplified treatment \nprograms have more successful outcomes. The cost to test and treat a \npatient will drop from more than $500 per year down to $200 per year. \nThe drugs themselves will cost only $140 per person, per year.\n  These are significant savings. And the savings have positive results. \nMore people can be tested and treated than with existing programs. This \nis progress. These negotiated agreements will save lives.\n  In his 2003 State of the Union Address, President Bush announced a \n$15 billion plan to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide. Certainly, this was an \nadmirable initiative. Authorizing legislation passed overwhelmingly in \nthe House and Senate.\n  But, the administration has taken a different approach in \nimplementing this plan than the Clinton Foundation has with their \nnegotiated pricing agreements. I am concerned the $15 billion AIDS \npolicy the President is pursuing is not nearly as effective as these \nnegotiated agreements. Why? Because instead of negotiating for the most \neffective drugs for the lowest cost, the administration purchases \nbrand-name pharmaceuticals from western countries at twice the cost.\n  For example, at a hospital in Zimbabwe, the Centers for Disease \nControl will soon implement a program that calls for patients to take \nsix pills per day, from a variety of brand-name manufacturers, at a \ncost of $562 per patient, per year. Yet at the very same hospital, \nusing the very same procedures, Doctors Without Borders purchases \nfixed-dosage retroviral drugs --two pills per day--from an Indian \ngeneric manufacturer. The treatment program costs $244 per patient per \nyear--$318 less than the price the CDC pays. The programs have the same \ngoals, at the same hospital, but the program sponsored by the U.S. \nGovernment costs more than twice as much.\n  This is not the most effective use of taxpayer money. The \nadministration could use fixed-dosage, generic drugs, but won't. \nInstead it chooses to purchase multiple brand-name drugs, and implement \na more complicated treatment regimen at more than twice the price. If \nthe goal is to treat the AIDS epidemic, then why are we spending twice-\nas-much money on more complicated, less effective treatment? Where is \nthe outrage about waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government--\nnot to mention plain old-fashioned stupidity?\n  Unfortunately, the answer is all too familiar. The administration has \nchosen to side with the brand-name pharmaceutical industry-- despite \nthe cost, and despite the efficacy. We have seen this behavior before.\n  This brings us back to the Clinton Foundation's negotiated agreements \nwith generic firms. My colleagues will be interested to know the man in \ncharge of the Bush administration's AIDS initiative is Eli Lilly's \nformer Chief Executive Officer, Randall Tobias. Recently, Mr. Tobias \ntold Congress he had doubts about the quality of cheaper generic AIDS \ndrugs made in India--the same drugs which the Clinton Foundation \nnegotiated the pricing agreements. But, the World Health Organization \napproved the drugs and has an approval process similar to our own Food \nand Drug Administration. In fact, WHO's approval process was borrowed \nfrom the FDA. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on April 7, Dr. LuLu Oguda of Doctors Without Borders stated \nthat she was ``bewildered by the debate'' about the use of generic \nfixed-dosage drugs to combat AIDS in Africa. She noted that the \ngenerics used were not ``substandard'' as claimed by the Bush \nAdministration. Rather, they were made in some of the same facilities \nas generic drugs sold every day in the United States. As a volunteer in \nMalawi, a country where one fifth of the population lives with HIV, she \nknows the value of these quality generics.\n  I am left to conclude that the Bush administration has made a \nconscious choice. Cheaper, effective drugs are put aside in order to \npurchase more complex treatments from domestic pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers. Fewer HIV/AIDS patients are treated, and more \ninefficiently. This is no different than refusing to support \nnegotiation authority for Medicare beneficiaries. Fewer drugs can be \npurchased because prices remain high.\n  Beyond the burden to taxpayers, these policies have grave human \nconsequences. People's lives are at stake. Prescription drugs are not \nlike other consumer products. They are not optional or discretionary. \nFor people with HIV/AIDS, lack of access to drugs can mean debilitating \nillness and even death. It's not like buying a car--the customer can't \nwalk away from the deal with his or her health in tact. So the choices \nthat we make here in Washington, the choices that the pharmaceutical \nindustry makes, are fateful choices. And let's be clear, the pricing \npractices favored by the administration and the pharmaceutical industry \nwill cost countless lives in Africa and here at home.\n  I fully appreciate the need to preserve the pharmaceutical industry's \nability to perform research and development. The Federal Government \nalready supports this through rich tax incentives. Likewise, I \ncertainly do not dispute the industry's right to make a profit. But we \nare quickly coming to the point where the pursuit of reasonable profits \nturns into flat out profiteering. Diseases are viewed as marketing \nopportunities, not as scourges to be eliminated as rapidly and as cost-\neffectively as possible.\n  There is no question in my mind that we need to reopen the issue of \nhow we negotiate drug prices in the program to combat HIV/AIDS \nworldwide. If we take the Clinton Foundation's approach, we can reach \nroughly twice as many patients. It is also time for us to reopen the \nissue of negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in our own country. \nIt is time for our choices to put people ahead of profits.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from this morning's \nWashington Post and a transcript of a recent radio program on the \nInternational AIDS Conference in Bangkok be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 14, 2003]\n\n                   U.S. Rule on AIDS Drugs Criticized\n\n                  (By Ellen Nakashima and David Brown)\n\n       Bangkok, July 13.--The Bush administration's prohibition \n     against using money from its $15 billion global AIDS plan to \n     buy foreign-produced generic drugs is complicating\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\n     the delivery of medicine to some of the millions of poor \n     people who badly need it, according to AIDS experts at an \n     international conference here.\n       In an effort to sidestep the policy, some countries have \n     been using U.S. money to train AIDS clinicians and buy lab \n     equipment, while employing money from other sources to buy \n     the medicines.\n       U.S. officials at the conference said Tuesday that they \n     would go along with such an approach. They have also said a \n     fast-track plan announced in May would allow some of the \n     generics to receive rapid approval from the Food and Drug \n     Administration, which would make them eligible for U.S. \n     funding.\n       Specified in the giant President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \n     Relief, the restrictions against unapproved generics, which \n     for now include all foreign-made generics, have added to the \n     already long list of obstacles to bringing antiretroviral \n     (ARV) therapy to poor countries, experts attending the 15th \n     International AIDS Conference here say.\n       ``It was very confusing. You're trying to figure out who \n     can buy what with what money,'' said Joia Mukherjee, medical \n     director for Partners in Health, a Boston-based organization \n     that has run an AIDS treatment program in Haiti for seven \n     years and is developing others in Latin America.\n       The policy ``slows the coordination'' between the Bush plan \n     and the people running treatment programs in the countries, \n     Mukherjee said in an interview at the conference.\n       The U.S. Government Accountability Office reached similar \n     conclusions in a report issued this week.\n       The GAO interviewed 28 U.S. government employees involved \n     in the plan in the 15 countries where it is starting to \n     operate. ``Twenty-one respondents indicated that they had not \n     received adequate guidance on the procurement of ARV drugs, \n     which makes it difficult for the U.S. missions'' to support \n     country programs.\n       The State Department, which runs the plan, has not \n     specified which activities the program ``can fund and support \n     in national treatment programs that use ARV drugs not \n     approved for purchase by the office,'' the authors wrote.\n       Partners in Health is expecting to receive at least $1 \n     million in fiscal 2005 from the U.S. program. Mukherjee said \n     she first began about nine months ago to inquire about \n     whether it could be used to buy generic drugs. She--and \n     others--were told no several months ago. But last week, \n     she said, she was advised unofficially to use money from \n     another source to buy generics and use the U.S. money for \n     such things as salaries for health care workers, lab tests \n     and a van.\n       That was ``a compromise that wasn't acceptable before,'' \n     said a person affiliated with one of the organizations that \n     received a large Bush administration AIDS grant last winter. \n     ``We're still in the process of working out what drugs we \n     will buy . . . in the countries we're in,'' said the \n     official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n       Randall L. Tobias, the Bush administration's global AIDS \n     coordinator, officially ratified that view in a statement \n     Tuesday.\n       ``We respect local governments' decisions as to how best to \n     manage their HIV/AIDS programs,'' he said. ``We will, \n     however, not use U.S. tax dollars to purchase medications \n     that have not passed the same consumer protection standards \n     as those we use for our own patients in the United States.\n       ``In the event that a country elects to use non-U.S. \n     funding to purchase copy drugs that have not been approved \n     for quality and safety by the U.S., the president's emergency \n     plan will support non-pharmaceutical aspects of the country's \n     care, treatment and prevention programs, and will do whatever \n     is necessary to maintain integrated systems of care.''\n       AIDS treatment that uses generic pills containing three \n     antiretroviral drugs in one tablet--known as fixed-dose \n     combinations--can cost as little as $200 a year. That is less \n     than half the cut rates at which major pharmaceutical \n     companies are offering brand-name drugs in poor countries.\n       Most organizations that are providing money for AIDS drugs \n     in those countries--notably, the two-year old Global Fund to \n     Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria--require that generics \n     they purchase go through a process called pre-qualification \n     that is run by the World Health Organization and is similar \n     to FDA approval.\n       The U.S. program does not recognize pre-qualification and \n     instead has specified that all drugs it pays for must be \n     approved by the FDA. In May, the agency established a fast-\n     track system by which it will rule on applications from \n     generics makers in two to six weeks.\n       Anthony S. Fauci, the physician and AIDS researcher who \n     heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \n     Diseases, acknowledged the controversy over generics at a \n     news conference Tuesday.\n       ``I know there's been criticism about that, but I think we \n     should give a chance to the FDA to prove if they're able to \n     do it or not,'' he said. ``The only way to do that . . . is \n     to submit the application for the approval process.''\n       Progress in the effort to put 3 million poor AIDS patients \n     on treatment by the end of next year has been a major topic \n     of discussion at the conference, whose theme is ``Access for \n     All.''\n       In Haiti, where 280,000 people are living with HIV, the \n     virus that causes AIDS, Partners in Health had about 50 \n     patients on antiretroviral drugs in 2001. Today, largely with \n     Global Fund money, it is treating 1,500. The drugs are \n     administered free through a community health clinic.\n       Cissy Kityo of the Joint Clinical Research Center in Uganda \n     said that country's government cannot afford to pay for all \n     the drugs it is providing patients, even with a price of \n     about $300 per person per year for generics. Consequently, \n     about 90 percent of the 20,000 people on treatment are paying \n     for their drugs, she said.\n       Uganda's policy of making people pay for their drugs has \n     allowed it to spend funds instead to hire and train health \n     care workers, who are critical to prevention and treatment \n     efforts, Kityo said. ``We're just a small country trying to \n     do our best,'' she said.\n       Chief among nongovernmental organizations providing \n     antiretroviral drugs is Medecins Sans Frontieres, whose name \n     in English is Doctors Without Borders. Today it has 13,000 \n     patients in 56 projects in 25 countries in Africa, Asia, \n     Eastern Europe and Latin America. About half are on fixed-\n     dose combinations, which spokeswoman Rachel Cohen termed a \n     ``radically simplified'' treatment.\n       The organization is spending $200 per person per year. The \n     best available price worldwide for brand-name equivalents is \n     $562 per person per year. ``If you have the option of \n     spending $200 per person per year or $600 per person per \n     year, and you're electing to spend $600, that means you're \n     treating one person when you could be treating three,'' Cohen \n     said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From NPR News Morning Edition, July 13, 2004]\n\n Analysis: Small Indian Firm Cipla Manufactures Low-Cost Generic AIDS \n          Drugs, But Its Products Face Bans in Many Countries\n\n       Steve Inskeep (host). This is Morning Edition from NPR \n     News. I'm Steve Inskeep.\n       Renee Montagne (host). And I'm Renee Montagne.\n       At this year's International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, \n     most of the talk is about getting inexpensive, generic drugs \n     to tens of millions of people. Relatively small generic drug \n     manufacturers in four countries are at the center of the \n     debate. One of the more aggressive of these companies is the \n     Indian firm Cipla. In India, where five million people are \n     infected, Cipla had trouble persuading the previous \n     government to spend money on AIDS, even for generic drugs \n     that cost pennies a day. NPR's Brenda Wilson recently visited \n     Cipla.\n       Brenda Wilson (reporting). Once inside Cipla's corporate \n     headquarters in Mumbai, also known as Bombay, you're whisked \n     off to a large room. It is surrounded on three sides by a \n     glass wall of backlit shelves containing hundreds of samples \n     of the company's products. You're then shown a six-minute \n     promotional video that recounts Cipla's founding 70 years \n     ago.\n       Unidentified Woman No. 1. To heal and to hold, to wipe a \n     tear, bring back a smile, to give hope, to give life. That's \n     been Cipla's mission right from the time it started way back \n     in 1935.\n       Mr. Amar Lulla (managing co-director, Cipla). Welcome to \n     Cipla.\n       Wilson. Good meeting you, Mr. Lulla.\n       Mr. Lulla. Good to see you.\n       Wilson. That's Amar Lulla?\n       Mr. Lulla. That's me.\n       Wilson. OK, Amar.\n       Mr. Lulla. Yeah.\n       Wilson. So you are--what's your title exactly?\n       Mr. Lulla. I'm the joint managing director. I want you to \n     see the range of products that we do here. We have over 1,200 \n     products, exporting to 150 countries. We first start here. \n     This is the range of our anti-infectives, antibacterials, \n     quinolones, microlites . . .\n       Wilson. Some of them, products that have been approved by \n     the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are sold in the \n     U.S. Indian drugmakers, not just Cipla, have been something \n     of a thorn in the side of the big pharmaceutical companies, \n     who see generic versions of their brand-name products as \n     virtual rip-offs of intellectual property. They argue that \n     the companies that make generics have not put the billions of \n     dollars into research to develop drugs, just copied them. \n     They also say that the copies are not always safe and may not \n     have the same benefits.\n       Mr. Lulla. Here is the range of AIDS drugs. This is what \n     we're a little bit known for, if I may say so. And now we're \n     offering the triple-drug cocktail for less than 50 cents a \n     day now.\n       Wilson. And that's this drug right here.\n       Mr. Lulla. This drug.\n       Wilson. Triomune, yes.\n       Mr. Lulla. Triomune. That is a combination of lamivudine, \n     stavudine and nevirapine.\n       Wilson. All three in one pill, which means it's not only \n     cheaper but easier to take. It is this product more than any \n     other that holds up the hope of treating millions of people \n     in poor countries who have AIDS. The patents for the drugs \n     are held by three different manufacturers who, until \n     recently, could not agree to share and therefore combine the \n     compound in one pill.\n       Unidentified Woman No. 2. (Foreign language spoken.)\n       Wilson. The Y.R. Gaitonde Center, an AIDS clinic in the \n     southern city of Chennai, which treats more than 5,000 HIV \n     patients, is one of the few places where reduced-price drugs \n     are available in India. Oddly enough, Cipla sells most of its \n     AIDS drugs to other countries. Today patients have lined up \n     outside the pharmacy to purchase medications.\n\n[[Page S8113]]\n\n       A pharmacist gives a gaunt young man his change and \n     explains just when and how to take the medicine. Patients pay \n     what they can. They're required to pay something. It's a way \n     of making sure that the patient wants to be part of the \n     program and will follow treatment regimens carefully. The YRG \n     Center gets a special discount, and Cipla assists in other \n     ways. Lulla says it's been trying for years to sell more \n     generic AIDS drugs in India, but the government has not until \n     recently agreed to Cipla's terms. But Amar Lulla insists that \n     the company's motive isn't money and it isn't publicity.\n       Mr. Lulla. If you've seen the face of disease and if you've \n     seen the face of death and if you've seen people dying \n     because they can't access medicines, and if you save one \n     life, it is worth it. To some of us, it's very important, \n     you know. And then I can see a lot of cynicism in the \n     media and in the way people do ask us, what is behind all \n     this, you know? What is the motive? What is the motive? \n     But sometimes doing this is an immense joy and serves the \n     need that we all have within us as human beings, you know, \n     to help someone. That's it. There's nothing more to it.\n       Wilson. Still, nowhere near the two million people in India \n     that it is estimated now need treatment get it. Vivek Divan \n     with the Lawyers Collective AIDS Unit says it's a profound \n     paradox.\n       Mr. Vivek Divan (Lawyers Collective AIDS Unit). A lot of \n     our clients are dying. They just continue to die. It's a \n     ridiculous situation. It's absurd because, you know, Cipla \n     and Ranbaxy make this medication in this country, and it \n     wasn't available and still isn't more or less available. When \n     you think about it, it is such an absurd situation, it's so \n     starkly absurd that it shocks you sometimes. It makes you \n     laugh also, unfortunately.\n       Wilson. Late last year the Indian government finally struck \n     a deal with Cipla, and in April, just before the national \n     elections, the government began distributing free \n     antiretrovirals for people with AIDS.\n       Ms. Meenakshi Datta Ghosh (Director, National AIDS Control \n     Organization). We have treated more than 800 people so far, \n     and we do want to very rapidly accelerate the treatment.\n       Wilson. Meenakshi Datta Ghosh is the director of the \n     government's National AIDS Control Organization.\n       Ms. Datta Ghosh. We have trained teams in 25 medical \n     hospitals, and that's where we are now moving to expand. And \n     so we do believe the numbers getting treated will rapidly \n     pick up.\n       Wilson. `Cause 800, you know, for a population this size, \n     seems incredibly small.\n       Ms. Datta Ghosh. That's very unfair. We've only been in the \n     treatment less than four months. Since May 2003 onwards, we \n     have concentrated on expanding and widening the availability \n     of services for people living with HIV and for the general \n     population. Political commitment for HIV and AIDS has grown \n     by leaps and bounds. All of this put together has enabled us \n     to commence treatment earlier than perhaps was originally \n     scheduled. And therefore, I do not--it's not entirely correct \n     to say the government has not done anything.\n       Wilson. By the end of this year, she says, the government \n     aims to provide treatment for 100,000 AIDS patients. India is \n     not alone in the caution with which it has taken on \n     treatment, using the generic AIDS drugs. Scientists and \n     health officials question Cipla's capacity to supply generic \n     drugs to the millions in developing countries who need them \n     and maintain that supply for the rest of their lives. There \n     are also concerns that generics may contribute to the \n     development of a more resistant AIDS virus. Again, Cipla's \n     Amar Lulla.\n       Mr. Lulla. This is such a beautiful argument, such a \n     beautiful one when you don't want the drugs to reach the \n     dying patients. The big pharmacy will say this argument is \n     never advanced. Why? The same drugs, the same side effects, \n     the same risk of developing resistance. Why is it not talked \n     about? Why is it talked about only when you want to make them \n     available to the patients, and you talk all this junk, I \n     mean, such rubbish, it's not even pardonable. So don't give \n     to anybody, right? If you can't give to 40 million, don't \n     give to one million. Don't make these drug available to \n     anybody. Let everybody die. What kind of argument is this? \n     And this is such a con, such a lie, it's a crime on humanity, \n     and everybody repeats it, you know. That's a pity.\n       Wilson. Some of the suspicions about generics and the \n     quality of Cipla's three-in-one pill Triomune were answered \n     by a recent study that was published in the British journal \n     Lancet. As doctors had already noted, Tromune was just as \n     effective at suppressing the AIDS virus as brand-name \n     medications. Brenda Wilson, NPR News.\n       Montagne.

Mr. President, I rise to salute a true gentleman \nwho has just announced his retirement from the position of Chairman and \nCEO of the Bank of Granite based in Granite Falls, NC: Mr. John A. \nForlines Jr. John is a man of great integrity and ability.\n  John's bank has become legendary, as it is often called ``the best \nlittle bank in America.'' However, his achievements extend beyond his \nprofessional life, for he is also well known for an outstanding history \nof service to his community, state and his country.\n  I had the pleasure of serving with John as a trustee for Duke \nUniversity, and I was continually impressed with his intelligence, his \ndedication and his great enthusiasm for Duke University and higher \neducation. A native of Graham, NC and a graduate of Duke, John joined \nthe U.S. Army finance department in 1940, and eventually rose to the \nrank of Major.\n  John's extraordinary career with the Bank of Granite began in 1954, \nwhen he assumed the position of President. Soon after, he was named \nchairman of the North Carolina School of Banking at the University of \nNorth Carolina-Chapel Hill, and began his lifelong relationship with \nthe American Bankers Association. He was later named Chairman of the \nNorth Carolina Banking Association. John's work has resulted in the \ncontinued growth of stronger communities across North Carolina. Through \nhis work he has provided the capital for many businesses to be \nestablished and grow, creating good jobs. He work also financed \ncountless homes for families and individuals across the state.\n  In addition, John has furthered his commitment to the communities of \nNorth Carolina through his dedication to service in his personal life. \nHe serves on the Board of Elders of First Presbyterian Church in \nLenoir, NC. He also holds positions on the Board of Directors for the \nNorth Carolina Citizens for Business and Industry; Caldwell County \nHospice Inc.; Piedmont Venture Partners; and The Forest at Duke, a \nretirement community.\n  John's dedication to his profession and community has been recognized \nthrough the years with numerous honors and distinctions. These \naccolades include Financial World Magazine CEO of the Year for banks \n$300-$500 million in assets from 1992 to 1995. He received Duke \nUniversity's Distinguished Alumni Award in 1994; and was inducted into \nthe North Carolina Business Hall of Fame in 1999.\n  John Forlines epitomizes the American spirit through his \nentrepreneurial skills and his ever present commitment to family and \ncommunity.

ROBERT K. STUART\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate Dr. Robert K. Stuart for his accomplishments in the fight \nagainst cancer. He is a long-time leader in the medical cancer \ncommunity on a professional and personal level. For his devotion to \nmake a difference in the lives of others, Dr. Stuart deserves to be \nhonored. He has fought cancer on many levels and is a model of \ninspiration to his community.\n  I ask that a recent Post and Courier article be printed in the \nRecord, so that all my colleagues can see the extraordinary \naccomplishments of this man.\n  The material follows:\n\n               [From the Post and Courier, July 10, 2004]\n\n        Cancer Doctor, Survivor to Join Lance Armstrong on Tour\n\n                            (By David Quick)\n\n       Cancer survival and cycling were forever linked when Texan \n     Lance Armstrong survived testicular cancer and won not one, \n     but five consecutive--and perhaps six--Tour de France races.\n       But long before Armstrong would become a household name, \n     oncologist Dr. Robert K. Stuart was in the trenches fighting \n     the war on one of humankind's most deadly diseases and using \n     cycling as an escape and a way to stay strong physically and \n     emotionally.\n       This October, the worlds of Armstrong and Stuart will come \n     together for a week during the Bristol-Myers Squibb Tour of \n     Hope, a 3,200-plus-mile relay from Los Angeles to Washington, \n     DC. Stuart is one of 20 cyclists selected to participate in \n     the tour from among more than 1,000 applicants.\n       Besides riding four hours every day, Stuart and the other \n     cyclists, along with Armstrong, will be making stops along \n     the way, spreading the message of hope and encouraging cancer \n     patients to participate in new treatments, often referred to \n     as clinical trials.\n       Stuart certainly has earned the honor.\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\n       In addition to being an avid cyclist, cancer doctor and \n     researcher, he survived kidney cancer himself in 1991 and was \n     the primary caregiver to his wife, Charlene, who recovered \n     from leukemia after being diagnosed in 2000.\n       And he's been a leader in fighting cancer in South Carolina \n     for nearly two decades--starting the hematology/oncology \n     division at the Medical University of South Carolina in 1985, \n     leading a surgical team in performing the state's first bone-\n     marrow transplant in 1987, and being one of two who wrote the \n     proposal for federal funding of what later would be called \n     the Hollings Cancer Center.\n       ``He's just done so much for MUSC,'' says Dr. Rayna Kneuper \n     Hall, who heads the research hospital's breast cancer \n     program. ``I'd say he is a true pioneer in the fields of \n     hematology and oncology here. He had a vision of it (the \n     division) and was able to make it come true.''\n       Despite his monumental resume, Hall says Stuart is humble, \n     has deep compassion for his patients, and continues to be a \n     good teacher and mentor to medical school students. ``He has \n     an amazing memory. He can remember every patient he's ever \n     seen and is able to recall a specific case to demonstrate a \n     (cancer) situation. For students, it really helps to hear it \n     in the context of a patient.''\n       For Stuart, his proudest accomplishment is having a hand in \n     training 40 specialists in the fields of hematology and \n     oncology, as well as having helped his patients.\n       ``At this stage in my career, my legacy is more about \n     people than it is publication. I have more than a hundred \n     papers, but to me, the people are so much more important.''\n\n\n                            A LOUISIANA BOY\n\n       Stuart was born the second of five boys to Walter and Rita \n     Stuart in Grosse Tete, La., a small village across the \n     Mississippi River from Baton Rouge. One of his grandmothers \n     was Cajun and the other was Creole.\n       Walter Stuart worked for Kaiser Aluminum. Because both he \n     and his wife were worried about the limited opportunities for \n     their children in the village, they jumped at a job transfer \n     to Northern California, where Robert would start elementary \n     school.\n       However, when Kaiser planned to transfer Walter next to \n     either British Guyana in South America or Ghana in Africa, \n     the Stuarts decided to move to New Orleans, where Walter took \n     a job as a banker.\n       ``I consider New Orleans as home,'' says Stuart, ``because \n     between birth and high school graduation, it's where I spent \n     the most time.''\n       For the Stuarts, educating their children was paramount. \n     All five sons received advanced degrees. In addition to \n     Robert, another became a doctor, one a lawyer, one received a \n     master's of business administration and the other a master of \n     fine arts.\n       Robert attended Jesuit High School in New Orleans, whose \n     most famous alums include singer Harry Connick Jr. and \n     baseball player Rusty Staub, and got a traditional liberal \n     arts education. He took Latin, Greek, math and physics and \n     was urged to attend a Catholic university.\n       He picked Georgetown University.\n       Stuart says being in Washington, D.C., at the height of the \n     turbulent 1960s--1966 through 1970--was exciting. ``You just \n     had the feeling that you were living in the center of the \n     universe. I got at least as much education from reading The \n     Washington Post every day as I did going to school and it \n     (reading the Post) was a lot cheaper.''\n       He, of course, did the hippie thing. He grew his hair out \n     and had a mustache, which he's shaved only once since then, \n     and believed that the Vietnam War was wrong. Stuart recalls a \n     very moving protest he participated in that involved marching \n     past the White House, shouting the name of a dead soldier and \n     then putting the name of the soldier in a casket at the \n     Capitol.\n       ``It took hours and hours to finish naming all those \n     soldiers, and I think it served as a preview of the Vietnam \n     War Memorial,'' he says.\n       ``My father thinks it was unfortunate that I lived in \n     Washington at that time because now I question government. \n     I'm more prone to say, `Why should we do that?' than I am, \n     `My country, right or wrong.' But I am an American and think \n     I'm as patriotic as people who don't think about things.''\n\n\n                        CHOOSING A NEW FRONTIER\n\n       Stuart went from Georgetown straight into medical school at \n     Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n       When he was in his first year, he became acquainted with \n     the chief resident in urology. Stuart asked why he had chosen \n     urology, and the resident said it was because he was \n     influenced by a urology professor in school.\n       ``I can remember saying to myself: `That won't happen to \n     me.' I vowed to pick my specialty entirely on rational \n     grounds and, of course, the exact opposite happened.\n       ``I ran into some people in what was then a new field, \n     oncology. I thought these guys were like trying to climb \n     Mount Everest with no oxygen and no tools. To me, what they \n     were trying to do was monumental because back then cancer was \n     a death sentence. Everybody died from it. These guys were \n     determined that things were so bad that they had to get \n     better and that they were going to make it happen . . . I was \n     personally inspired.''\n       At the time--the mid-1970s--there was no standard therapy \n     for cancer, Stuart says.\n       Another inspiration came as a third-year med student. He \n     volunteered for a rotation on the oncology in-patient \n     service. His instructor assigned him only one patient because \n     she was so sick, suffering from acute myeloid leukemia, or \n     AML.\n       ``I couldn't do much as a student, but I basically stayed \n     up all night with her. She died the next afternoon and I was \n     shattered. . . . My instructor said to me that AML was the \n     worst leukemia of all and `don't take it personally.' But I \n     did take it personally.''\n       After doing his internal medicine residency at Johns \n     Hopkins, the school hired him as a faculty member in 1979. \n     Stuart focused on acute leukemia and bone-marrow \n     transplantation, which he admits remains ``the thing that \n     challenges me most today.''\n       About the same time, Stuart and another doctor began \n     studying and treating patients with aplastic anemia, a rare \n     disease where the bone marrow simply fails and stops \n     producing red blood cells. While not a cancer, its standard \n     therapy at the time was a bone-marrow transplant.\n       They also developed alternative therapies and worked on a \n     7-year-old, whose father later started a foundation focusing \n     on research that has made numerous advances in treating the \n     disease. ``One of the most satisfying things about having a \n     career in medicine is looking at the progress that's been \n     made,'' Stuart says of the improving rates of survival for \n     both AML and aplastic anemia.\n\n\n                         MAKING A MARK AT MUSC\n\n       In 1985, a friend and ``brilliant scientist,'' Dr. Makio \n     Ogawa at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Charleston, \n     asked Stuart to interview for MUSC's new hematology/oncology \n     division. Ogawa, a bone-marrow researcher, had met Stuart on \n     a few trips to Johns Hopkins.\n       ``At the time, I had no interest in leaving Johns Hopkins, \n     but there was something about Charleston and the people at \n     MUSC that made me change my mind,'' says Stuart. ``On July 1, \n     1985, the entire program consisted of me, a lab tech and a \n     secretary. I had to recruit physicians and create a training \n     program.''\n       It didn't take long to get the ball rolling.\n       Two years later, Stuart led a team in performing the first \n     bone-marrow transplant surgery in the state, and in another \n     two years, Stuart was among a group boarding a plane for \n     Washington, DC, to make a pitch for federal funding for a new \n     cancer center in Charleston.\n       U.S. Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., who did not attend those \n     first meetings, would embrace the effort and help usher \n     through a $16.8 million federal grant to pay for a building \n     to house what later would be called the Hollings Cancer \n     Center.\n       ``It got us in the ball game,'' Stuart says of the grant's \n     ability to kick-start the cancer program in Charleston, \n     leading to comprehensive cancer care and eventually the start \n     of clinical trials at the center. ``It was a very \n     sophisticated undertaking.''\n\n\n                           THE CANCER PATIENT\n\n       In 1991, the doctor became the patient when Stuart was \n     diagnosed in the early stages of kidney cancer.\n       Because of early detection and a rather fortunate location \n     at the tip of the kidney, Stuart was spared losing the organ. \n     He also didn't have to endure chemotherapy because the \n     treatment is not useful with kidney cancer.\n       Still, the experience made Stuart a better doctor.\n       ``It definitely changed me. I used to be distant from my \n     patients. I maintained what I thought was a professional \n     separation between doctor and patient,'' says Stuart. ``After \n     having cancer, I found myself thinking more about encouraging \n     people. Now, I consider what can I say to a patient that's \n     truthful and gives them hope.''\n       He also started hugging patients and calling them by their \n     first names, practices that never occurred before he was a \n     cancer patient.\n       During the same year, Stuart married Charlene McCants, who \n     had been the chief financial officer (later CEO) at MUSC and \n     with whom he initially had a rocky professional relationship. \n     At one point, Stuart would not return McCants' phone calls.\n       Yet it was she who was instrumental in having Medicaid and \n     Medicare recognize MUSC as a transplant facility. In doing \n     so, insurance providers would help pay for transplant \n     procedures.\n       Stuart and McCants both had been married once before and \n     had children from their first marriages.\n       Stuart's marriage to Gail Stuart, the current dean of the \n     MUSC nursing school, had lasted 18 years. They have two \n     children: Morgan, now 26 and a medical student at Georgetown; \n     and Elaine, 24, an editorial assistant at Child magazine in \n     New York. McCants had been married to Robert H. McCants for \n     22 years. Their son, R. Darren McCants, is business manager \n     for the physiology/neuroscience department at MUSC.\n       ``All three of our children turned out really well,'' says \n     Stuart.\n       Daughter Elaine recalls her father early in her childhood \n     as being ``cerebral and quiet'' and seemingly \n     ``impenetrable.'' She adds, ``Looking back now, I realize \n     that he may have been quiet because he lost a patient. You \n     never knew because he made a big effort not to let what was \n     going on at work affect us at home.''\n       Elaine Stuart, who attended the North Carolina School of \n     the Arts and was a ballerina with the Richmond Ballet, says \n     that while her father was deeply involved in\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\n     work, he made sure he was there for important events, such as \n     her dance recitals.\n       ``He wasn't all that liberal with praise, so when you \n     earned it, it really meant something. . . . Growing up, he \n     never pushed us that hard. In doing so, he instilled in us a \n     great sense of self-motivation. That was an effective way of \n     driving us, and I attribute a lot of what drives me today to \n     that.''\n\n\n                          CANCER STRIKES AGAIN\n\n       In 1997, the couple moved to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, when \n     Stuart received the opportunity to be oncology department \n     chairman at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research \n     Centre.\n       Three years later, though, cancer entered the personal \n     realm of the Stuarts' lives yet again. Charlene became \n     desperately sick and was diagnosed with the same leukemia, \n     AML, that had taken the life of the patient Stuart had \n     watched over as a med student 25 years before.\n       ``My first thought when I learned the diagnosis was that it \n     was cosmic irony--that this almost can't be happening,'' says \n     Stuart. ``In Saudi Arabia, one of my colleagues came up to \n     me, very stricken, and said, `I just heard your wife has \n     AML.' I remember thinking, `No, it's the other way around. \n     AML has my wife.' ''\n       AML, Stuart notes, is still nearly lethal--only one-third \n     who are diagnosed with it survive. The couple came back home \n     to Charleston for treatment and stayed.\n       ``The blackest time of my life was when she relapsed after \n     three treatments,'' he says.\n       The only recourse was to use marrow from her brother, \n     David. The transplant was successful and she is in remission.\n       His care for her is a testament of his love. Of the 81 \n     nights she was in the hospital, Stuart spent all but the \n     first night on a cot next to her in the hospital room. Then, \n     he took four months off from work, the longest stint of not \n     working as a doctor, to become his wife's primary caregiver.\n       ``It was the hardest thing I've ever done,'' he says now.\n\n\n                           CYCLING FOR SANITY\n\n       In the mornings of that uncertain time, Stuart took a break \n     by riding his bike. The exercise, he said, helped him ``keep \n     my head straight.''\n       But he first started cycling out of necessity. It was cheap \n     transportation in his Georgetown days. For two years, 1983-\n     1985, Stuart was a licensed bicycle racer, but ``wasn't \n     good'' due to his late start. He backed off cycling after \n     arriving in Charleston because of his career demands, but \n     started back in earnest after his cancer diagnosis in 1991 \n     and began participating in charity rides.\n       He continued cycling during the 1990s and even rode with a \n     group of doctors in the Saudi Arabian desert.\n       Perhaps his first true cycling feat came last year during \n     the first Tour of Hope. Stuart made the first cut of 50 for \n     the inaugural tour ride across the country, but wasn't chosen \n     for the final group. He, however, was invited to Washington, \n     DC, for the final day's ride and a chance to meet Lance \n     Armstrong.\n       Because he wasn't picked the first year and because he was \n     unsure the sponsors would take on tour expenses again, Stuart \n     didn't think the opportunity would come his way again. Even \n     when the sponsors announced the tour would happen again, he \n     applied thinking that his chances weren't good. The Stuarts \n     even booked a vacation in the south of France at the same \n     time as one of the tour's training camps, thinking that he \n     wouldn't be picked.\n       But he was picked. When he heard the news, his feelings \n     were mixed.\n       ``At first, I was really fired up. Then, I was really \n     scared. I'm not an elite cyclist, though I'm probably better \n     than your average Joe,'' says Stuart, noting that the five, \n     four-person relay teams have only a week to get from Los \n     Angeles to Washington.\n       He says the organizers also changed the route and made it \n     harder, specifically going over both the Sierras and the \n     Rockies in a route connecting Las Vegas, Denver, Omaha, \n     Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Baltimore to DC.\n       Stuart, however, is getting some expert training advice and \n     equipment, including a custom-fitted Trek road bike that \n     he'll get to keep after the tour. He's already flown to \n     Princeton, N.J., the home of Bristol-Myers Squibb, and \n     Colorado Springs, home of Carmi-chael Training Systems (Chris \n     Carmichael is Armstrong's coach), for training weekends. He's \n     to fly back early from his family vacation in France to go to \n     Madison, Wis., home of Trek, in August for a final meeting \n     before the fall ride.\n       Meanwhile, his current regimen consists of about 11 hours \n     of training a week, or about 200 miles. It will peak out at \n     about 16 hours a week. That's a lot of time on those small \n     bike seats.\n       Stuart is enjoying the experience. The group of riders--of \n     whom 13 are cancer survivors, five are physicians and two are \n     oncology nurses--already are feeling close to one another. \n     Stuart has been getting 10-15 group e-mails per day from \n     them.\n       Stuart is among the millions of Americans who are wishing \n     Armstrong wins his sixth Tour de France, in part because it \n     will make the Tour of Hope an even higher profile event.\n\n\n                          LIVING, LOVING LIFE\n\n       One of Stuart's closest cycling buddies, Clark Wyly, has \n     grown to know him well, as they regularly meet on Saturdays \n     and Sundays for rides ranging from 30 to 60 miles.\n       ``He is a very caring physician,'' says Wyly. ``He takes \n     each of his patients so seriously and so personally. When \n     they don't make it, it's really hard on him. . . . Rob is not \n     extroverted, but once you get to know him, he's very \n     personable and easygoing. I have never seen him lose his \n     temper and get out of control.''\n       Wyly adds that Robert and Charlene live each day fully.\n       For those who know them, the couple have a deep, loving \n     relationship. For a former CEO and the extrovert in the \n     couple, she admits to truly enjoying ``loving, supporting and \n     caring for him'' and describes herself as ``his professional \n     valet.''\n       ``I'm so devoted to him and I love taking care of him,'' \n     she says.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8115-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8115-S8116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              HONORING BEN MONDOR OF THE PAWTUCKET RED SOX\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues a story of a man who has dedicated more than 27 years of his \nlife to giving Rhode Island's baseball fans a team that they are proud \nto call their own.\n  If a poll were taken asking Americans to name the best that Rhode \nIsland has to offer, it is fair to say that most would think of the \nNewport mansions, or the beaches of South County, or perhaps the \nProvidence renaissance. While all of these sites are important \ncomponents of our tourism business, I would say that for native Rhode \nIslanders, there is an attraction in the working class community of \nPawtucket that has an even more prominent place in their shared \nexperience. Amid the tenement houses and old textile and wire mills of \nthe Blackstone Valley stands McCoy Stadium, home to the Pawtucket Red \nSox since 1973.\n  It is difficult for visitors to imagine now, but this minor league \nfranchise got off to a very shaky start. In the mid-I970s, the team was \nstruggling both on and off the field. Attendance was poor, the stadium \nwas in terrible disrepair, and bankruptcy was looming. Players who were \nassigned there saw it as a necessary penance before making it to the \nbig leagues and hoped to get out as soon as possible. It looked as if \nthe PawSox would not last too long in AAA ball.\n  At that time, Ben Mondor, a man who had quit working in his late 40s \nafter a successful career in business, was happy with retired life. \nOccasionally, he would catch a PawSox game, but as he has said, he \ndidn't know a thing about baseball. When encouraged by his friend and \nformer Boston pitcher, the late Chet Nichols, to rescue the PawSox, Ben \nrefused. ``Why would I want to buy a baseball team?'' he asked. But Ben \nhad plenty of experience stepping in to save struggling enterprises, \nand repeatedly had turned another person's failure into a successful \nventure. Finally, after much prompting from the brass of the parent \nclub, he took over the team in 1977.\n  And so Ben went to work. He sought to instill pride in the team, and \nbuild an organization that would command both local and national \nrespect. More than that, he wanted to give people of modest means a \nplace where they could take their families for a night out. It didn't \nhave to be fancy, but he would insist on a safe, family atmosphere, \nwhere young children could come and eat a hot dog or maybe a snow cone, \nshout ``we want a hit!'' when their favorite ballplayer came to bat, \nand learn to love the game of baseball.\n  Certainly, Ben faced an uphill climb, but he and his loyal staff \nembarked on a long campaign to renovate McCoy Stadium and reinvigorate \nthe franchise. As years passed, more and more of the creaky wooden \nseats were replaced, the field was improved, and the concession stands \nand restrooms were expanded. It took time, but the attendance steadily \nclimbed. Whole school buses filled with eager young fans poured in, not \njust from Rhode Island, but Cape Cod, and Connecticut, and greater \nBoston--even a few from New Hampshire. And Ben Mondor kept his word to \nthe working class family: amazingly, 20 years went by without an \nincrease in the price of a general admission ticket. Only in 1999, \nafter a $14 million renovation and expansion of McCoy Stadium did he \nfinally relent and agree to charge an extra dollar for tickets to a \ngame. Even today, a family of four can still take in a PawSox game for \njust $20.\n  Ben Mondor's team gives back to the community in many other ways. \nThere\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\nare the free youth clinics, in which Pawsox players and coaches offer \nchildren instructions and tips on the game. There is also a Candy Hunt \non Easter and roses for every mom on Mother's Day. The McCoy Stadium \nfireworks, which most recently lit up the sky for three nights on the \nFourth of July weekend, are legendary.\n  After 27 years, Ben Mondor's dream has come true. A team that \nstruggled to draw more than 1,000 fans to a game in the early days now \nfills a 10,000-seat park to nearly 90 percent of capacity, the best \nmark in the International League. One pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, \nrecently called up from Pawtucket, praised McCoy Stadium as ``the best \nminor league place that I've ever played.'' It has hosted high school \nbaseball championship games, the U.S. Olympic team and the National \nGovernors Association. Tomorrow night, McCoy Stadium will host the AAA \nAll-Star Game, the crowning achievement of Ben's long, successful \ncareer in baseball. And yet, my guess is that Ben takes the greatest \nsatisfaction from knowing that on any warm summer night, he can find \nthousands of blue collar workers and their young children enjoying a \ngame played by past and future big leaguers, cheering with each crack \nof the bat.\n  In the movie Field of Dreams, there is a scene in which James Earl \nJones's character, Terence Mann observes, ``The one constant through \nall the years has been baseball.'' In spite of all the challenges that \nhave come along over the course of three decades, the changes in the \npark, and the changes in our society, baseball has indeed been the one \nconstant at McCoy Stadium. And in large measure, we have Ben Mondor and \nhis love of the game and his love of people to thank for it.\n  Ben Mondor is a hero in Rhode Island, and when he steps down from \nrunning the PawSox this summer, he will leave behind a remarkable \nlegacy. I know my colleagues join me in saluting Ben on his well-\ndeserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8116-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IDAHO STATE VETERANS CEMETERY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge a very \nspecial event happening in Idaho on July 31. For my colleagues in the \nSenate who have never been to Boise, ID, I will describe a little of \nwhat that part of my State looks like.\n  On a clear day, miles stretch out before you bounded to the south by \nthe Snake River Valley and distant mountains, to the east and west by a \nvast expanse of open sky, and behind you to the north, by foothills \nrising to meet their less-weathered relatives.\n  The wind blows with reassuring regularity, and it seems that in this \nwestern meeting place of land and sky, at once comfortingly familiar \nand awe-inspiring, it is indeed an appropriate place to rest our fallen \nwarriors of freedom and pay our respects and tribute to their \nsacrifices.\n  The Idaho State Veteran's Cemetery represents the vision and hard \nwork of many dedicated Idahoans. These men and women have focused their \nenergy and donated their time and money to see this tremendous project \nto fruition. An idea that for many years was in the hearts of concerned \npatriots, the cemetery is the first of its kind to be built in Idaho, \nand its construction allows Idaho to finally join the rest in having a \nstate veterans' cemetery.\n  Gazing out at this vista of the junction of earth and sky, and the \nvisible freedom of wide open space causes us to reflect upon the \nfreedom that our country stands for; the freedom for which the men and \nwomen who will rest here committed their lives, some ending either much \ntoo young in combat or others after fulfilling and long lives. In this \ntime of sacrifice by yet another great generation of brave young men \nand women, this place gives comfort and exists as a testament to the \nage-old ritual of caring for those that have gone before us, in a \nproper and appropriate military manner that reflects their sacrifice, \nsense of duty and selfless devotion to the cause of liberty.\n  This place and the people for whom it is preserved remind us that \nfreedom is eternal, and their and our living and dying are not in \nvain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8116-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8116-S8117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF EDWARD F. MILES\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I memorialize the life of Edward \n``Ed'' Miles, a decorated Vietnam veteran who heroically turned his war \nexperience into a mission of compassion for victims of conflict around \nthe world. Ed Miles died on January 26, 2004.\n  I first met Ed through his advocacy on behalf of war survivors--work \nthat embodied the ideals of the Leahy War Victims Fund, which was \nestablished in 1989 to respond to the needs of innocent victims of \nconflict in developing countries. Despite painful injuries suffered \nduring the war in Vietnam that left him a bilateral amputee, and the \nchallenges of working in a country reeling from Pol Pot's genocidal \nKhmer Rouge regime, Ed persevered and set up a rehabilitation clinic \nfor landmine survivors and other war victims that was the first of its \nkind in Cambodia. Today it is recognized as Cambodia's national \nrehabilitation center and a model for others around the world.\n  Ed is perhaps best remembered for this work through his involvement \nwith Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, VVAF, and the \nInternational Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which received the Nobel \nPeace Prize in 1997 for its advocacy to eliminate the scourge of \nlandmines.\n  As an associate director of VVAF, Ed traveled throughout the world \nraising funds, generating medical research and support, and, finally, \nbuilding and staffing a prosthetics clinic for amputees at Kien \nKhleang, outside Phnom Penh, Cambodia in 1991. Since its inception, \nthis project has produced 15,000 prosthetics, orthotics and wheelchairs \nfor landmine survivors and other war victims. In addition, since Ed's \ninitial pioneering and humanitarian efforts in Cambodia, VVAF has \nopened rehabilitation clinics in Vietnam, Angola, Ethiopia, Kosovo and \nelsewhere in Central America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Thousands of \npeople with disabilities, many of whom had been treated as social \noutcasts, recovered their mobility and their dignity because of Ed \nMiles.\n  Ed's personal mission to help war survivors was undoubtedly the \nresult of his own war experience. In April 1969, as a Captain and \nMilitary Advisor, Special Forces, United States Army, Ed was wounded in \nan ambush outside Cu Chi near the Cambodian border. He stepped on a \nlandmine and lost both of his legs above the knee, suffered severe \nbone, nerve and muscle damage to his arm and later lost one of his eyes \nto infection.\n  As a result of his service in Vietnam, Ed received the United States \nArmy Silver Star for Bravery, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the \nVietnamese Cross of Gallantry, the Vietnamese Campaign Medal, the Air \nMedal, the Good Conduct and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.\n  After returning home, Ed became an active critic of the Vietnam War, \nco-founding Veterans Against the War. Yet despite the severity of his \ninjuries, years of hospital treatment and his enduring disabilities, he \nalso completed his education, receiving his Masters of Public \nAdministration from New York University. Ed worked as an Outreach \nCounselor for Vietnam veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In \n1989, he was one of the first Americans to return to Vietnam since the \nwar ended. In fact, he was featured on ``Nightline'' visiting the site \nwhere he was wounded.\n  Ed continued his quest for peace and reconciliation with America's \nformer enemy through VVAF, continuously lobbying the United States \nCongress and the White House to normalize diplomatic and trade \nrelations with Vietnam, which ultimately occurred in 1995. He was a \nfeatured speaker throughout the United States, and a visiting guest \nspeaker at local schools where he described his Vietnam experience and \nthe historical significance and lessons of the Vietnam War.\n  For the 35 years since being wounded and up until his life's end, Ed \nexhibited a selflessness, determination and compassion beyond compare. \nDespite the daily struggles and pain from his injuries, I never once \nheard Ed complain about his own misfortunes. He was soft spoken and \nunassuming to a degree rarely seen, but he also harbored a fiery \npassion for ridding the world of injustice and senseless conflict. Ed \nwas an inspiration to me in my efforts to ban landmines, and to \neveryone who knew him.\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\n  Family, friends and colleagues throughout the world responded with \nshock and deep sadness for the loss of this true humanitarian and hero. \nIn his gentle but powerful way, Ed touched the world one person at a \ntime, and I consider myself very fortunate to have been one of them.\n  Ed was born in Brooklyn, NY, and was buried there with his parents \nand Irish ancestors dating from 1860. He grew up in Manhasset, NY and \nthroughout his free-spirited life, had homes in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, \nAugsburg, Germany, Kinsale, Ireland, Greenwich Village, Sag Harbor, \nSouthhampton and Stamford, New York, Wyoming, Colorado, and Wilton, \nConnecticut. He is survived by sons Ed, of Boulder, Colorado, and \nDaniel of Southhampton, New York; a daughter, Sarah of New York City; \nsisters Mary Teresa Jackson of Raleigh, North Carolina, Michele Dunn of \nWilton, Connecticut, and Christine Kuhl of Southhampton, New York.\n  The world is a better place because of Ed Miles, and his generous \nheart and many contributions will always be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8117-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORIAM OF MARY MIYASHITA\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

She grew up in a traditional \nJapanese household until she was sent as a young woman to internment \ncamps in Santa Anita, CA and Gila, AZ during World War II. While in \ncamp, Mary met Eleanor Roosevelt and was introduced to the work of the \nQuaker organization: The American Friends Service Committee. This \norganization helped obtain early release of college-aged persons from \ncamp. These life-changing events later gave Mary the drive and \npersistence to become involved in social causes and politics.\n  Mary was an extraordinary woman, with great devotion to her family, \nher community and our Nation. Mary was a beloved wife and mother. She \nwas admired by many for her strength and conviction. Mary was dedicated \nto making a difference in the world, and she did. Mary had great \npassion and believed in basic kindness to all humans.\n  Mary's work in politics helped shape our Nation. Throughout the \nyears, she was involved in many important history changing causes, such \nas civil rights movements, peace demonstrations, education and literacy \ndrives. She was a founding member of the first Asian Pacific Caucus, \nand a founding member of the Women and Children's Crisis Shelter in \nWhittier. Mary was also a member of the executive boards of the League \nof Women Voters, Meals on Wheels, Women for Peace, Whittier Area Fair \nHousing Committee and the Whittier Area Education Study Council.\n  Mary Miyashita is survived by her husband, Kazuo and her three \nchildren, son, David Miyashita, and daughters, Jean and Carole \nMiyashita, and son-in-law, John Martinez. She was an exceptional \nindividual.\n  I am proud to recognize the legacy of Mary Miyashita. We can take \ncomfort in knowing that future generations will benefit from her \ncourage, her vision and her leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/14/senate-section/article/S8117-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:56 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4766.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ndeliver a meaningful benefit and lower prescription drug prices under \nthe medicare program; read the first time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, those who are following the business of \nthe Senate understand that just a few moments ago, we had a vote on the \nfloor of the Senate on the proposed constitutional amendment dealing \nwith same-sex marriage. The final vote, I think, was indicative of the \nfeeling of this body. There were 48 who supported going forward with \nthe debate on this amendment and 50 Senators who opposed it. Of course, \n48 Senators does not meet the threshold requirement for approving a \nconstitutional amendment, which is 67 Senators. So that gap of 19 \nSenators suggests this Senate does not believe it is appropriate for us \nto move forward on that type of constitutional amendment.\n  Many of the colleagues on both sides of the aisle spoke to this issue \nover the last several days and expressed their heartfelt feelings of \nthe underlying issue of same-sex marriage and about the question of \nwhether we should amend the Constitution. The vote today is, I think, a \ngood indication that this is an issue whose time has not come. There is \nno issue in controversy which requires us to amend the Constitution of \nthe United States of America.\n  One might ask, if this issue fell so far short, 19 votes short, of \nwhat it needed, why did we consider it? For obvious reasons. This \ndebate was not about changing the Constitution. This debate was about \nchanging the subject in the Presidential campaign.\n  It is understood that if you ask most American families what is \nimportant to them the politicians are worried about, they will talk \nabout the obvious things: My job, the fact that my paycheck does not \ncover the necessities of my family, the cost of health insurance, the \navailability of quality health care, whether my retirement savings are \ngoing to be protected; I am concerned as well about the situation in \nIraq; I would like to know when we will stop losing our soldiers, and \nwhat do we have ahead of us in terms of Iraq and the $1.5 billion which \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S8120]]\n\ntaxpayers spend each week in Iraq, how long will that go on? What could \nwe do with $1.5 billion every week in the United States of America for \nour schools, for providing health care for our children, immunizations.\n  These are the obvious questions with which most families identify. \nBut if the Presidential election campaign is waged on those issues, the \nWhite House and the Republican Party believe they are at a disadvantage \nbecause many people, in fact, an amazingly large percentage of \nAmericans, say when asked, they feel our country is going in the wrong \ndirection in terms of its economics to help working families, in terms \nof creating jobs, keeping good-paying jobs in America, dealing with the \nfact we still continue to be dependent on the Middle East and Saudi \nArabia for our oil which draws us into a terrible situation of \ndependency, a terrible situation which taxes our resources.\n  That is what most Americans will identify as the major issues, and \nthose are not issues on which this administration wants to campaign. So \nthey attempted today to change the subject. They wanted to change the \nsubject by changing the Constitution to deal with same-sex marriages, \nan issue which has not reached a level where it should even be \naddressed by our Constitution.\n  I will not go over that whole debate again, but the vote tells the \nstory. The Republican Party in the majority in the Senate was unable to \nget a majority of votes to support the President's constitutional \namendment. The rollcall tells the story. But there are other issues \nwhich, frankly, we should now move to, issues about which families \nacross America do care.\n\n  I know as I travel around my State of Illinois and talk with \nfamilies, businesses, labor union leaders, time and again the issue on \ntheir minds is the cost of health care in America.\n  I met 2 days ago in Chicago with a good friend of mine who heads up \none of the major labor unions. It is a labor union which represents \npeople who work at grocery stores, United Food and Commercial Workers. \nI talked with him about his problems.\n  He said: Senator, virtually every strike we have, virtually every \ncontract negotiation is over the cost of health insurance. We get our \nworkers 50 cents more an hour, and they don't see a penny of it. It all \ngoes into health insurance, and there is less coverage this year than \nlast year. They are upset with their labor leaders and upset with their \nemployers.\n  Then you talk with businesspeople, businesses small and large, and I \nhear the same story, businesses which say: We are mom and pop, and we \ncan no longer afford health insurance for the people who work for us; \nit is just too expensive.\n  There is another element in this whole equation which we cannot \noverlook, and that is the cost of prescription drugs. The cost of \nprescription drugs is not only driving the cost of health insurance to \nrecord levels, but it is also pushing a lot of people of limited family \nmeans into terrible choices: whether they can afford to buy the \nprescription drugs that will keep them healthy and, if they do, whether \nthey will have to sacrifice the necessities of life. That is a real \nissue. That is an issue this campaign ought to be about. Would it not \nbe refreshing if the debate of the week was not over same-sex marriage \nand its impact on families but the cost of health care and the cost of \nprescription drugs and their impact on families? I think that is what \nthe voters are waiting for.\n  If they have any frustration with those of us in public office, it is \nthe fact we talk past them, over them, and around them and never direct \nto the issues about which they care.\n  Today I am joining Senator Levin of Michigan and Senator Dayton of \nMinnesota in introducing S. 2652.\n  We are going to work to put this bill on the Senate calendar under \nrule XIV so that Senator Frist can call it up for debate. In other \nwords, what I am trying to do is to accelerate consideration of this \nbill to blow past all the political issues and the political rhetoric \nto get into this legislation. The Democratic leader in the other body \nis working to discharge a companion bill so they can consider it in an \nexpedited manner.\n  This bill is called the Medicare Prescription Drug Savings Act. We \nneed to expedite this bill. We need to put it on the calendar. We need \nto stop wasting time on issues going nowhere because seniors and low-\nincome individuals are facing escalating prescription drug prices that \nare really hurting them personally and diminishing their Medicare drug \nbenefits. Instead of considering bills that do not have the votes to \npass, like the one we just finished, we should consider something that \nis an urgent priority for Americans. Whether one lives in a blue State, \na red State, or a purple State, whether one is in a battleground State \nor it is a State that is decided, they are going to find seniors \nconcerned about the cost of prescription drugs. This is an issue that \nis bipartisan. It is an issue that affects virtually every family. Over \nthe past 5 years, prescription drug prices have risen between 14 and 19 \npercent every single year, 5 times the rate of inflation.\n  One particularly egregious example of drug price inflation in the \nUnited States is Novir, an essential ingredient in the HIV cocktail to \ndeal with the HIV/AIDS crisis. The price of an average dose of Novir \nwent up 400 percent this year from $1,600 a year to more than $7,800. \nThat is more than 10 times the cost of the same drug in Canada or in \nEurope. Americans are paying 10 times the cost of Novir for HIV \npatients in the United States as the price that is being paid in Canada \nand Europe.\n  Last month, the AARP released a study examining prescription drug \nprices for the 12-month period ending in March 2004. The study revealed \nthat the prices charged by pharmaceutical companies to wholesalers for \nthe top brand-name drugs used by seniors increased at a rate of 7.2 \npercent. That is faster than the 2 previous years, which is troubling \ngiven that inflation actually fell during that same period of time.\n  Drug discount cards have been suggested as the answer for this \nproblem, but they are not. A fact sheet sent out by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to 40 million Medicare beneficiaries said \nthat a discount card with Medicare's seal of approval can help save 10 \nto 25 percent on prescription drugs.\n  Now, this is the administration plan, a discount card under Medicare \nfor prescription drugs that could save 10 to 25 percent. Well, after \nthe same Department published the drug card prices in May, the Chicago \nTribune newspaper looked at what these cards would mean in a suburb of \nChicago, the city of Evanston. The Tribune compared the prices at \npharmacies in Evanston with what seniors will save with drug discount \ncards. Take a look at it.\n  In some cases, the people in Evanston, IL, will actually save less \nwithout the card. The drug Lipitor, with the discount card, is $67.07. \nThe lowest retail price, $68.99. Savings, $1.92, or 3-percent savings. \nCelebrex, 2 percent. Norvasc, in fact, costs more under the discounted \ncard. So this so-called discount card seems to be of little value with \ndrugs that are very popular and well used and prescribed to, such as \nLipitor, Celebrex, and Norvasc.\n\n  The lack of significant savings from the discount cards that are \nbeing touted by the administration is not unique to Illinois or the \ncity of Evanston. Since President Bush announced the idea of a drug \ndiscount card in July of 2001, top selling prescription drugs have \nexperienced double-digit increases, eroding any savings that might come \nfrom the card.\n  Remember when the Bush administration said their discount cards would \nsave seniors 10 to 25 percent? Well, price increases are eroding \nsavings. Take a look at what happened to these drugs: Celebrex for \narthritis pain went up 23 percent; Coumadin, a blood thinner, 22 \npercent; Lipitor, 19 percent; Zoloft, 19 percent; Zyprexa, 16 percent; \nPrevacid, 15 percent; and Zocor, 15 percent.\n  The prescription drug discount card is not even really keeping up \nwith the inflation built into prescription drug prices.\n  Some of my colleagues may say it is not important that the drug card \nis not producing much savings because the real benefit will start in \nJanuary of 2006. Unfortunately, rising drug prices will erode that \nbenefit, too.\n  I will tell my colleagues about one of my constituents. Alois Kessler \nof Skokie, IL, has $3,200 in drug costs, and his income, which is \nfixed, is $28,500. Assuming prescription drug prices continue to rise \nas we have seen them rise\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\nand Mr. Kessler stays with the same medication he is currently taking, \nhis drug costs will be approximately $4,800 by 2006, the first year of \nthe new Part D benefit. His income will rise about 3 percent a year. So \nhe will have drug prices at $4,800 and an income of $31,000 a year.\n  The new program reduces his cost by $1,080 in the first year, so he \nwill still have to pay out-of-pocket $2,120. By 2015, assuming he is \nstill taking the same medication, his drug costs will reach $17,000, \nand his income will only have risen to around $40,400. One just cannot \nkeep up with an inflation protection in their Medicare or retirement \nincome against drug price increases of this kind.\n  What can we do about it? What we can do about it is something this \nbill proposes, and it is something very basic. There is a lot of talk \nin Congress today about bringing drugs in from Canada and other places. \nI am open to that conversation, anything to provide relief to seniors \nand people on limited incomes trying to buy lifesaving drugs.\n  Look to the north. Canada selling American drugs made in America, \ninspected in America, approved in America, with research in America, \nfor sale in Canada turn out to be a fraction of the cost of what they \nare in the United States. With just 2 percent of the worldwide \npharmaceutical market, Canada cannot supply the United States no matter \nhow many busloads of seniors we send there.\n  The United States has 53 percent of the worldwide prescription drug \nmarket. Half of it is made up of Medicare beneficiaries. Think about \nthis for a moment. If Medicare, the program that covers seniors, were \nto sit down with major pharmaceutical companies and bargain for the \nprices of the drugs, think about their bargaining power. They have the \nability to bring prices down for Americans for drugs sold in America \nrather than reimported in the United States.\n  The prescription drug benefit bill we passed expressly prohibits \nMedicare from negotiating for lower prices. That is something the \npharmaceutical companies wanted, and they won. They won it at the \nexpense of American consumers.\n  Today, the Veterans' Administration and the Department of Defense \nnegotiate for VA drug prices and cut down the cost of drugs by almost \n50 percent. Take a look at some of these popular drugs and the \ndifference between what is paid in the drugstores of America and what \nthe Federal Government pays for the same drug: Xalatan eyedrops, $41 \nunder the negotiated price of the VA, and $101 is what is paid in the \ndrugstore; Celebrex, the drug we talked about earlier for arthritis, \n$108 on the Federal Supply Schedule and $173 at the drugstore; Lipitor \nfor cholesterol, $215 in the Federal system, $446 over the counter; \nPlavix, $257 negotiated, and over-the-counter, $593.\n  Once you put the bargaining power of the Federal Government behind \nprice negotiations, the prices come down. People can afford the drugs. \nFamilies can afford them. The cost of health insurance comes down, but \nthe profits for the drug companies come down, too. That is why this \nCongress, under the thrall of that special interest group, has refused \nto give Medicare the power to negotiate.\n  I will give one specific example we have lived through on Capitol \nHill. Many people rail about what happened with the anthrax scare a few \nyears ago. There was a suggestion that the drug Cipro would be used as \nan antidote to any ill-effects caused by anthrax. We found out Cipro \nwas an expensive drug, and Secretary Tommy Thompson said he would \nnegotiate with the Bayer Company, the company that makes Cipro, to \nlower prices.\n\n  Look what happened when Secretary Thompson tried to do that. He said:\n\n       Everyone said I wouldn't be able to reduce the price of \n     Cipro. I am a tough negotiator.\n\n  What was the market price when he went into it? It was $4.67 per pill \nfor Cipro. When it was all said and done, we were paying 75 cents. When \nsomeone sits down with the drug companies and says, You are \novercharging us, we won't pay it, look what happens. Yet when the \nseniors of America look for the same kind of hard-nosed negotiating to \nbring down costs for them, this Congress says no; we don't want to give \nMedicare the ability to negotiate to do the same thing Secretary \nThompson achieved when it came to these Cipro tablets. Through \nnegotiation, Secretary Thompson brought down the price of Cipro by 490 \npercent. Good news for the people who needed Cipro; bad news for the \npeople who need Medicare. But we can't even ask him to stand up for \nsenior citizens in America. Out of the question. Drug companies don't \nwant to lose their profitability.\n  Incidentally, they are very profitable. Let me show you some charts. \nThis indicates the profitability of Fortune 500 drug companies versus \nthe profits for all Fortune 500 companies in the year 2002. Look at \nwhat drug companies on the red bars have done on profitability: 17 \npercent as opposed to 3.1 percent; in this chart, 27.6 percent to 10.2 \npercent. They are making money hand over fist. They are charging \nseniors and families across America record high prices for drugs. They \nare increasing the cost of those drugs every single year and passing \nthem along directly, raising health insurance costs, making it more \ndifficult for seniors to keep up with the drugs they need to stay \nhealthy.\n  I think the bill I have introduced with Senators Levin and Dayton \nanswers the need. I believe the bill which we will attempt to put on \nthe Senate calendar today, so we can vote it before we leave for \nanybody's convention, is going to go a long way toward helping \nAmerica's seniors. The Medicare Prescription Drug Savings Act instructs \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to offer a nationwide \nMedicare-delivered prescription drug benefit in addition to the PDP and \nPPO plans available in the 10 regions. We keep in place what is in the \nMedicare bill passed last year, we just add a new player. The new \nplayer is Medicare providing prescription drugs with negotiated prices. \nWe set a uniform national premium of $35 for the first year for this \nprescription drug benefit, and we negotiate group purchasing agreements \non behalf of beneficiaries who choose to receive their drugs through \nthe Medicare-administered benefit. It is voluntary. Those who choose to \nreceive their drugs will have negotiated lower prices. Those who enroll \ncan stay enrolled as long as they want.\n  Not only will this bill provide seniors with lower cost drugs, it \nwill give them a choice to enroll in a Medicare-delivered plan, cutting \ndown on the confusion the privately delivered system has already \ncreated. Critics and the pharmaceutical industry would say my bill is \nabout price controls and big government. How do you explain the \nVeterans' Administration? Aren't we saying for our veterans we want to \nbring down the cost of pharmaceutical drugs? Have you spoken to a \nveteran lately who has gone to the VA hospital to sign up for the \nmonthly drug benefit because it is so attractive for him and his \nfamily? That tells me government can play an important role and have a \nvoice in buying in bulk and bringing down costs.\n\n  Who supports this bill we are trying to bring to the calendar? The \nAlliance for Retired Americans, AFL-CIO, American Nurses Association, \nCampaign for America's Future, USAction, Consumers Union, the Service \nEmployees International Union, AFSCME, the American Federation of \nTeachers, Families USA, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, and the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.\n  If you don't think this is a timely issue, pick up this morning's New \nYork Times and take a look at the front-page story. The bill we passed, \nsigned by President Bush, has America running in the wrong direction. \nFront-page headline:\n\n       Drug Law [signed by President Bush] Is Seen Leading To Cuts \n     in Retiree Plans.\n\n  Let me read one or two paragraphs:\n\n       New government estimates suggest that employers will reduce \n     or eliminate prescription drug benefits for 3.8 million \n     retirees when Medicare offers its coverage in 2006.\n\n  That is the plan we referred to earlier passed by Congress.\n\n       That represents one-third of all retirees with employer-\n     sponsored drug coverage, according to documents from the \n     Department of Health and Human Services.\n       No aspect of the new law causes more concern among retirees \n     than the possibility they might lose benefits they already \n     have.\n\n  That is what the administration offers us: discount cards which don't \noffer a real discount, the loss of prescription drug coverage already \navailable for 3.8 million retirees, and, finally, a plan that is \noffered to seniors\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\nthat is almost impossible to describe and follow because it is so \ncomplicated in its minutiae and detail, and it does not include a \nprovision that allows Medicare to bargain for the best prices, the same \nbargaining power which we use over and over again to help veterans and \nmany other Americans.\n  Before the end of the day, we are going to ask that this bill be \nbrought to the calendar. I don't know what else we will consider today, \nbut if my colleagues in the Senate will go home and ask a random sample \nof anybody on the street corner, or in the shopping center, about the \ncost of prescription drugs and what it means, they will understand that \nwhatever the next item of business might be in the Senate, it cannot \nreally match in importance what this issue means to families across the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Hollings, and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 2653. A bill to make it a criminal act to willfully use a weapon \nwith the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person \nwhile on board a passenger vessel, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Reducing \nCrime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act, along with Senators \nSpecter, Feinstein, Kyl, Hollings, and Allen. Today's bill is a revised \nversion of legislation Senator Specter and I introduced last year, S. \n1587. The bill benefits from the expertise of the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Senators Kyl and \nFeinstein. My colleagues have their own bill on this subject, S. 746, \nand I am grateful that they are original cosponsors of today's measure. \nThe Ranking Member of the Commerce Committee, my good friend Senator \nHollings, has also been a leader in this area and today's bill \nincorporates suggestions made by him and his able staff. Senator \nSpecter and I have worked long and hard on this issue, and it is my \nsincere hope and expectation that the bill we introduce today is a \nconsensus measure that will swiftly pass the Senate this year.\n  Today, almost three years after the devastating attacks of September \n11, our Nation's transportation infrastructure remains vulnerable to \nterrorist activity. American ports are critical to the nation's \ncommercial well-being, and we must do all that we can to ensure that \nour laws keep pace with the threats that they face.\n  Recently, Homeland Security Secretary Ridge traveled to the Port of \nLos Angeles/Long Beach to announce that the Untied States was in full \ncompliance with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, \nand that his department was working to meet the requirements of the \nMaritime Transportation Security Act. I welcome those announcements, \nbut there is more we should be doing to protect our ports and close \nexisting gaps in our criminal code. The bill Senator Specter and I \nintroduce today starts to close those gaps.\n  Our bill will double the maximum term of imprisonment for anyone who \nfraudulently gains access to a seaport or waterfront. The Interagency \nCommission on Crime and Security at U.S. Seaports concluded that \n``control of access to the seaport or sensitive areas within the \nseaports'' poses one of the greatest potential threats to port \nsecurity. Such unauthorized access continues and exposes the nation's \nseaports, and the communities that surround them, to acts of terrorism, \nsabotage or theft. Our bill will help deter those who seek unauthorized \naccess to our ports by imposing stiffer penalties.\n  Our bill would also increase penalties for noncompliance with certain \nmanifest reporting and record-keeping requirements, including \ninformation regarding the content of cargo containers and the country \nfrom which the shipments originated. An estimated 95 percent of the \ncargo shipped to the U.S. from foreign countries, other than Canada and \nMexico, arrives throughout seaports. Accordingly, the Interagency \nCommission found that this enormous flow of goods through U.S. ports \nprovides a tempting target for terrorists and others to smuggle illicit \ncargo into the country, while also making ``our ports potential targets \nfor terrorist attacks.'' In addition, the smuggling of non-dangerous, \nbut illicit, cargo may be used to finance terrorism. Despite the \ngravity of the threat, we continue to operate in an environment in \nwhich terrorists and criminals can evade detection by underreporting \nand misreporting the content of cargo. Increased penalties can help \nhere.\n\n  The legislation we introduce today would also make it a crime for a \nvessel operator to fail to slow or stop a ship once ordered to do so by \na federal law enforcement officer; for any person on board a vessel to \nimpede boarding or other law enforcement action authorized by federal \nlaw; or for any person on board a vessel to provide false information \nto a federal law enforcement officer. The Coast Guard is the main \nfederal agency responsible for law enforcement at sea. Yet, its ability \nto force a vessel to stop or be boarded is limited. While the Coast \nGuard has the authority to use whatever force is reasonably necessary, \na vessel operator's refusal to stop is not currently a crime. This bill \nwould create that offense.\n  In addition, the Coast Guard maintains over 50,000 navigational aids \non more than 25,000 miles of waterways. These aids, which are relied \nupon by all commercial, military and recreational mariners, are \ncritical for safe navigation by commercial and military vessels. They \ncould be inviting targets for terrorists. Our legislation would make it \na crime to endanger the safe navigation of a ship by damaging any \nmaritime navigational aid maintained by the Coast Guard; place in the \nwaters anything which is likely to damage a vessel or its cargo, \ninterfere with a vessel's safe navigation, or interfere with maritime \ncommerce; or dump a hazardous substance into U.S. waters, with the \nintent to endanger human life or welfare.\n  Each year, thousands of ships enter and leave the U.S. through \nseaports. Smugglers and terrorists exploit this massive flow of \nmaritime traffic to transport dangerous materials and dangerous people \ninto this country. This legislation would make it a crime to use a \nvessel to smuggle into the United States either a terrorist or any \nexplosive or other dangerous material for use in committing a terrorist \nact. The bill would also make it a crime to damage or destroy any part \nof a ship, a maritime facility, or anything used to load or unload \ncargo and passengers; commit a violent assault on anyone at a maritime \nfacility; or knowingly communicate a hoax in a way which endangers the \nsafety of a vessel. In addition, the Interagency Commission concluded \nthat existing laws are not stiff enough to stop certain crimes, \nincluding cargo theft, at seaports. Our legislation would increase the \nmaximum term of imprisonment for low-level thefts of interstate or \nforeign shipments from 1 year to 3 years and expand the statute to \noutlaw theft of goods from trailers, cargo containers, warehouses, and \nsimilar venues.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this measure, and I look \nforward to its prompt consideration by the full Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Bribery affecting port security.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nBiden, Specter, Kyl, Hollings and Allen, to introduce the Reducing \nCrime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act of 2004--legislation \ndesigned to deter, prevent and punish a terrorist attack at or through \none of our Nation's seaports.\n  I would like to thank Senator Kyl for joining me in sponsoring this \nbill, as well as Senators Biden, Specter, Hollings and Allen for their \nleadership and hard work on this critical matter.\n  Last year, Senator Kyl and I introduced the Anti-Terrorism and Port \nSecurity Act of 2003. That bill contained a set of comprehensive \nmeasures to enhance the security of our ports. At the same time, \nSenators Biden and Specter were working on legislation largely focused \non the criminal law aspect of Port Security.\n  Since that time we have joined together to craft the bill now before \nus. The legislation is narrow in focus, limited primarily to criminal \nlaw provisions. It is my hope that it will enjoy strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I also hope we can continue to work towards a more comprehensive \napproach to seaport security in the coming months.\n  Our nation's seaports represent the soft underbelly of our Nation's \nhomeland security. Our adversaries, including al-Qaida and other \nterrorist groups, have the plans and capabilities to launch a maritime \nattack. In fact, just last week six al-Qaida associates were charged \nwith planning the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole. in Yemen that left 19 \nAmerican sailors dead.\n  Millions of shipping containers pass through our ports each month. A \nsingle container has room for as much as 60,000 pounds of explosives--\n10 to 15 times the amount in the Ryder truck used to blow up the Murrah \nFederal Building in Oklahoma City. When you consider that a single ship \ncan carry as many as 8,000 containers at one time, the vulnerability of \nour seaports is alarming.\n  Worse, a suitcase-sized nuclear device or radiological ``dirty bomb'' \ncould also be placed in a container and shipped into the country. With \nthe current monitoring system, the odds are that the container would \nnever be inspected. And, even if the container was inspected, it would \nbe too late.\n  In addition to the danger such attacks present to human lives, an \nattack on or through a seaport could have devastating economic \nconsequences. Excluding trade with Mexico and Canada, America's ports \nhandle 95 percent of goods imported and exported from the U.S. That \nmeans 800 million tons of cargo valued at approximately $600 billion. A \nterrorist attack would bring our port operations\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\nto a complete standstill. To give you even a small glimpse of what such \na disruption could mean, last year's West Coast labor dispute cost the \nU.S. economy somewhere between $1 and $2 billion per day--a total of \n$10 to $20 billion.\n  In its December 2002 report, the Hart-Rudman Terrorism Task Force \ndescribed what a terrorist attack at or through one of our ports might \nmean in economic terms: ``If an explosive device were loaded in a \ncontainer and set off in a port, it would almost automatically raise \nconcern about the integrity of the 21,000 containers that arrive in \nU.S. ports each day and the many thousands more that arrive by truck \nand rail across U.S. land borders. A three-to-four-week closure of U.S. \nports would bring the global container industry to its knees. Megaports \nsuch as Rotterdam and Singapore would have to close their gates to \nprevent boxes from piling up on their limited pier space. Trucks, \ntrains, and barges would be stranded outside the terminals with no way \nto unload their boxes. Boxes bound for the United States would have to \nbe unloaded from their outbound ships. Service contracts would need to \nbe renegotiated. As the system became gridlocked, so would much of \nglobal commerce.''\n  This is a national issue, but one of particular concern to my home \nstate because more than half of all goods imported into the U.S. pass \nthrough my home State of California.\n  Last year, 6.5 million imported containers--52 percent of the \ncontainers entering the United States--traveled through California. Six \nmillion of these came through two ports alone: the Port of Los Angeles \nand the Port of Long Beach.\n  That means that, if terrorists succeeded in putting a weapon of mass \ndestruction into a container undetected, there is a one in two chance \nthat this weapon would arrive and/or be detonated in Southern \nCalifornia.\n  And the problem is not just with containers. Nearly one-quarter of \nCalifornia's imported crude oil is offloaded in one area. A suicide \nattack on a tanker at an offloading facility could leave Southern \nCalifornia without refined fuels within a few days.\n  Since September 11, we have made significant steps in enhancing port \nsecurity, but clearly, there is more to be done. This bill addresses \nsome of those needed enhancements, particularly in the area of criminal \nlaw.\n  The Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act of 2004 \ndoes the following: Clarifies existing law to make clear that those who \nwould try to access our ports under false pretenses are committing a \ncrime; makes it a crime to refuse to stop when the Coast Guard orders a \nship to standby for inspection; sets clear criminal penalties for the \nuse of a dangerous weapon or explosive on a passenger vessel such as a \ncruise ship; imposes criminal penalties for those who tamper with \nnavigational aids, such as buoys and transponders, intentionally place \ndestructive devices in navigable waters, or intentionally dump \nhazardous materials in waterways; establishes a specific crime for \nknowingly and willfully transporting aboard any vessel an explosive, \nbiological agent, chemical weapon, or radioactive or nuclear materials \nintended to be used to commit a terrorist act; the bill also makes it a \ncrime to knowingly and willfully transport a person aboard any vessel \nwho intends to commit, or has committed, a terrorist act; makes it a \ncrime to damage or destroy a vessel or a maritime facility, to commit \nan act of violence against any individual on a vessel or near a port \nfacility, or to knowingly communicate false information that endangers \nthe safety of a vessel; provides sanctions to deter criminal or civil \nviolations related to a range of offenses, including theft of \ninterstate or foreign shipments; amends existing law to increase \npenalties for noncompliance with certain reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements for incoming ships, including information regarding the \ncontent of cargo containers and the country from which the shipments \noriginated; and finally, the bill toughens anti-stowaway laws and laws \ngoverning bribery of port security officials.\n  Strengthening criminal penalties is one way we can make our Nation's \nports less vulnerable. The Coast Guard, the FBI, Customs and \nImmigration authorities--all need the appropriate crime-fighting tools \nto prevent a terrorist attack. Today, we are introducing legislation to \nprovide the crime-fighting tools that will do just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an analysis of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 2. ENTRY BY FALSE PRETENSES TO ANY PORT.\n\n       Section 2 would clarify that section 1036 of title 18 \n     (fraudulent access to transport facilities) includes seaports \n     and waterfronts within its scope, as well as increase the \n     maximum term of imprisonment for a violation from 5 years to \n     10 years. This provision was included in the originally \n     introduced Biden-Specter Bill, but not in the Feinstein-Kyl \n     Bill.\n\n     SEC. 3. CRIMINAL SANCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO ``HEAVE TO,'' \n                   OBSTRUCTION OF BOARDING, OR PROVIDING FALSE \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       Section 3 would amend the U.S. Code to make it a crime (1) \n     for a vessel operator knowingly to fail to slow or stop a \n     ship once ordered to do so by a federal law enforcement \n     officer; (2) for any person on board a vessel to impede \n     boarding or other law enforcement action authorized by \n     federal law; or (3) for any person on board a vessel to \n     provide false information to a federal law enforcement \n     officer (punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a \n     maximum term of 5 years). This provision was included in both \n     the Biden-Specter and Feinstein-Kyl Bills, but the Feinstein-\n     Kyl Bill included a lower penalty of 1-year maximum \n     imprisonment.\n\n     SEC. 4. USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON OR EXPLOSIVE ON A PASSENGER \n                   VESSEL.\n\n       Section 4 would amend section 1993 of title 18 (terrorist \n     attacks and other acts of violence against mass \n     transportation systems) to make it a crime to willfully use a \n     dangerous weapon (including chemical, biological, \n     radiological or nuclear materials) or explosive, with the \n     intent to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person \n     on board a passenger vessel (punishable by a fine and/or \n     imprisonment for a maximum term of 20 years; and, if death \n     results, for a term of imprisonment up to life). Both the \n     Biden-Specter and Feinstein-Kyl Bills, employing different \n     language, included a provision that would achieve this aim. \n     The substitute incorporates the Biden-Specter approach.\n\n     SEC. 5. CRIMINAL SANCTIONS FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST MARITIME \n                   NAVIGATION, PLACEMENT OF DESTRUCTIVE DEVICES, \n                   AND MALICIOUS DUMPING.\n\n       Section 5 would amend the criminal code to make it a crime \n     to intentionally damage or tamper with any maritime \n     navigational aid maintained by the Coast Guard or under its \n     authority, if such act endangers the safe navigation of a \n     ship; or knowingly place in waters any device or substance \n     which is likely to damage a vessel or its cargo, interfere \n     with a vessel's safe navigation, or interfere with maritime \n     commerce (punishable by a fine and/or a term of imprisonment \n     up to life; if death results, by a sentence of death). This \n     section would also make it a crime to willfully and \n     maliciously discharge a hazardous substance into U.S. waters, \n     with the intent to cause death, serious bodily harm, or \n     catastrophic economic injury (punishable by a fine and/or a \n     term of imprisonment up to life; and, where an individual \n     engages in the prohibited conduct with an intent to cause \n     harm to the marine environment, by a fine and/or imprisonment \n     for a maximum term of 30 years). Both the Biden-Specter and \n     Feinstein-Kyl Bills included this provision, but, unlike the \n     originally-introduced bills, the substitute measure excludes \n     the death penalty for violations of the malicious dumping \n     provision.\n\n     SEC. 6. TRANSPORTATION OF DANGEROUS MATERIALS AND TERRORISTS.\n\n       This section would make it a crime to knowingly and \n     willfully transport aboard any vessel an explosive, \n     biological agent, chemical weapon, or radioactive or nuclear \n     materials, knowing that the item is intended to be used to \n     commit a terrorist act (punishable by a fine and/or a term of \n     imprisonment up to life; and, if death results, by a sentence \n     of death). This section would also make it a crime to \n     knowingly and willfully transport aboard any vessel any \n     person who intends to commit, or is avoiding apprehension \n     after having committed, a terrorist act (punishable by a fine \n     and/or a term of imprisonment up to life). This provision was \n     included in the originally introduced Biden-Specter Bill, but \n     not in the Feinstein-Kyl Bill.\n\n     SEC. 7. DESTRUCTION OR INTERFERENCE WITH VESSELS OR MARITIME \n                   FACILITIES.\n\n       This section would make it a crime to (1) damage or destroy \n     a vessel or its parts, a maritime facility, or any apparatus \n     used to store, load or unload cargo and passengers; (2) \n     perform an act of violence against or incapacitate any \n     individual on a vessel or at or near a facility; or (3) \n     knowingly communicate false information that endangers the \n     safety of a vessel (punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment \n     for a maximum term of 20 years; if the act involves a vessel \n     carrying high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel, \n     by a fine and/or a term of imprisonment up to life; and, if \n     death results, by a sentence of death). This provision was \n     included in both the Biden-Specter and Feinstein-Kyl Bills. \n     The Biden-Specter Bill also included an exception\n\n[[Page S8127]]\n\n     for otherwise lawful activities (e.g., normal repair, salvage \n     activities, authorized transportation of hazardous materials) \n     and a bar to federal prosecution if the conduct is de minimus \n     (e.g., blown-out tire) or occurred during legitimate labor \n     activity. The substitute measure incorporates these elements \n     of the Biden-Specter Bill.\n\n     SEC. 8. THEFT OF INTERSTATE OR FOREIGN SHIPMENTS OR VESSELS.\n\n       Section 8 would expand the scope of section 659 of title 18 \n     (theft of interstate or foreign shipments) to include theft \n     of goods from additional transportation facilities or \n     instruments, including trailers, cargo containers, and \n     warehouses; and would increase the maximum term of \n     imprisonment for low-level thefts from 1 year to 3 years. \n     This provision was included in the originally introduced \n     Biden-Specter Bill, but not in the Feinstein-Kyl Bill.\n\n     SEC. 9. INCREASED PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH MANIFEST \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 509 would amend section 1436 of title 19 to \n     increase the penalties for noncompliance with certain \n     manifest reporting and record-keeping requirements, including \n     information regarding the content of cargo containers and the \n     country from which the shipments originated. This provision \n     was included in both the Biden-Specter and Feinstein-Kyl \n     Bills, but the Biden-Specter Bill included lesser penalties. \n     The substitute measure reflects the penalty structure set out \n     in the Biden-Specter Bill.\n\n     SEC. 10. STOWAWAYS ON VESSELS OR AIRCRAFT.\n\n       This section would increase the maximum penalty for a \n     violation of section 2199 (stowaways on vessels or aircraft) \n     of title 18 from 1 year to 5 years. If the act is committed \n     with the intent to commit serious bodily injury and serious \n     bodily injury does in fact occur, it would be punishable by a \n     fine and/or a term of imprisonment up to 20 years. If the act \n     is committed with the intent to cause death, it would be \n     punishable by a fine and/or a term of imprisonment up to \n     life. This provision was not included in either the Biden-\n     Specter or Feinstein-Kyl Bills, but is included in the \n     substitute measure on Senator Hatch's request.\n\n     SEC. 11. BRIBERY AFFECTING PORT SECURITY.\n\n       This section would make it a crime to knowingly bribe a \n     public official, with the intent to commit international or \n     domestic terrorism; or for anyone to receive a bribe in \n     return for being influenced in his or her public duties, \n     knowing that such influence will be used to commit, or plan \n     to commit, an act of terrorism (punishable by a term of \n     imprisonment up to 15 years). This provision was not included \n     in either the Biden-Specter or Feinstein-Kyl Bills, but is \n     included in the substitute measure on Senator Hatch's \n     request.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2654. A bill to provide for Kindergarten Plus programs; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy colleagues Senator Kennedy and Senator Bingaman to jump-start school \nsuccess for low-income children. Today we are introducing the Sandy \nFeldman Kindergarten Plus Act of 2004.\n  Sandy Feldman, the President of the American Federation of Teachers, \nstepped down today after decades of public service. If there is one \ngoal to which Sandy has dedicated herself over the years, it is the \neducation of our Nation's children.\n  Sandy is the product of New York City's public schools. She knows \nwhat great promise public education holds for our Nation. But, she also \nknows that all too often, we don't give our schools the resources they \nneed to be able to live up to that promise.\n  While I've worked with Sandy for many years, I've been particularly \nprivileged to work with her in the area of early childhood education. \nIt was Sandy who developed the concept for this Kindergarten Plus \nlegislation and Sandy who spent countless hours developing the details \nto ensure that the initiative would work in a diverse array of \ncommunities.\n  Although Sandy is leaving the AFT, I know she will continue fighting \nfor our Nation's children, and for mothers, fathers, and teachers \nacross this Nation. I look forward to her continued counsel and advice \non education issues and other issues of importance to families.\n  The Kindergarten Plus legislation we are introducing today will offer \ncompetitive grants to States to provide children below 185 percent of \nthe poverty line with a transitional kindergarten during the summer \nbefore kindergarten formally begins and a transitional first grade \nduring the summer between kindergarten and first grade.\n  Why an extra four months of kindergarten for these children? The \nanswer is simple. Because too many low income children today enter \nkindergarten unprepared for the year ahead, far behind their wealthier \npeers in both academic and social skills.\n  According to a recent survey, 46 percent of kindergarten teachers \nreport that at least half of their class or more has specific problems \nwith entry into kindergarten. Yet, kindergarten is critical in \npreparing children to succeed in elementary school, especially for \nchildren at-risk of academic failure.\n  There is no panacea, no magic wand to erase the deficiencies that too \nmany low income children have in entering kindergarten on par with \ntheir more economically well-off peers. It is simply not possible in a \ntwo month period before kindergarten begins or in a nine-month half day \npre-kindergarten program to wipe away the advantages that wealthier \nchildren have had in their first five years of life that result in the \nskill set with which they enter kindergarten.\n  We can, however, do a better job of preparing less fortunate children \nfor school. We can expose them to classroom practices and routines and \nthe expectations for kindergarten behavior and protocol. We can \nintroduce them to concepts and help them understand that classrooms \nhave rules. We can expose them to literature, story time or circle \ntime. We can help them understand that books are made up of printed \nwords and that words are made up of individual letters. We can ask them \nquestions to help develop their critical thinking skills, like what do \nyou think will happen next in the story? Why? We can offer them ``show \nand tell'' to develop their oral language skills and ability to speak \nout loud in sequential sentences.\n\n  Many children enter kindergarten with these skills. But, many do not. \nDuring the school year before a child is eligible to enter \nkindergarten, about 75 percent of children in families with more than \n$75,000 in income participate in some type of center-based program, \ncompared to 51 percent of children in families with incomes between \n$10,000 and $20,000.\n  The numbers are much more stark when looking at the children of \nmothers who dropped out of high school. Recent data shows that about 74 \npercent of 3, 4, and 5 year old children whose mothers graduated from \ncollege were enrolled in a center-based program compared to only 42 \npercent of 3, 4, and 5 year old children whose mothers did not complete \nhigh school.\n  How does this translate to children? Some children know how to follow \ndirections and some children do not. Some children transition well \nbetween activities as part of a daily routine, some children do not. \nAbout 85 percent of high income children, compared to 39 percent of low \nincome children, can recognize letters of the alphabet upon arrival in \nkindergarten. About half the children of college graduates can identify \nthe beginning sounds of words, but only 9 percent of the children whose \nparents didn't complete high school can recognize the beginning sounds \nof words.\n  Of equal concern, kindergarten teachers report that about 80 percent \nof children whose mothers graduated from college persist at a task and \nare eager to learn whereas only about 60 percent of the children whose \nmothers have not graduated from high school persist at a task and are \neager to learn.\n  What we know from the research is that children can enter \nkindergarten better prepared to learn. We may not be able to close the \ngap between low income children and their wealthier peers, but we can \ncertainly narrow it considerably.\n  Our bill would provide states with resources to offer a transitional \nkindergarten during the summer before kindergarten begins. This would \nenable local school districts to offer a jumpstart on kindergarten with \nsmaller class sizes during the summer. Before all kindergarten eligible \nchildren arrive, K+ children would have an introduction to \nkindergarten. The same opportunity would be part of the program for the \nsummer between kindergarten and first grade.\n  The introductory period would enable school districts to target low \nincome children who may never before have participated in a center-\nbased program such as Head Start or state pre-k, or nursery school. \nThey could target low income English language learners or low income \nchildren who participated in Head Start or state pre-k who could \ncontinue their progress during the summer.\n\n[[Page S8128]]\n\n  About 65 percent of mothers with children under age 6 are in the \nworkforce today. Every day, about 13 million preschoolers, including 6 \nmillion infants and toddlers, are in some type of child care \narrangement. What we are trying to do with this bill is to pull out low \nincome children who would be eligible to enter kindergarten in the fall \nand offer them a summer enrichment period as an introduction to \nkindergarten. It might be that a local Head Start or community-based \norganization's preschool would continue to operate their programs \nduring the summer. However, these are local decisions made by school \ndistricts that apply for and receive K+ funding.\n\n  It should be clear that the K+ program would operate as a supplement \nto existing programs, most of which follow the school calendar. In \nfact, children who participate in a high quality early learning program \nduring the summer before kindergarten are not eligible to participate \nin K+ to avoid duplication of efforts and scarce resources.\n  In the National Academy of Sciences report, ``From Neurons to \nNeighborhoods: the Science of Early Childhood Development'', numerous \nrecommendations are made to improve the foundation with which children \nenter school. The report points out that with so many parents working \ntoday, the burden of poor quality and limited choice in child care \nrests most heavily on low income working families whose financial \nresources are too high to qualify for subsidies or Head Start yet too \nlow to afford market prices for quality child care.\n  It is the children of the working poor who are very much at risk of \nbeginning kindergarten behind their wealthier and poorer peers. Yet, it \nis these children in addition to poor children who are most likely to \nenter kindergarten behind their wealthier peers, unprepared for the \nyear ahead.\n  Supporting the K+ program is the American Federation of Teachers, \nAFT, the Parent-Teacher Association, PTA, the Council of Great City \nSchools, the Society for Research in Child Development, SRCD, the \nChildren's Defense Fund, and Easter Seals.\n  We urge you to join us as cosponsors of this legislation and help \ngive low income children a jump-start on school success.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a brief summary of the \nbill and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2654\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kindergarten Plus Act of \n     2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Kindergarten has proven to be a beneficial experience \n     for children, putting children on a path that positively \n     influences their learning and development in later school \n     years.\n       (2) Kindergarten and the years leading up to kindergarten \n     are critical in preparing children to succeed in elementary \n     school, especially if the children are from low-income \n     families or have other risks of difficulty in school.\n       (3) Disadvantaged children, on average, lag behind other \n     children in literacy, numeracy, and social skills, even \n     before formal schooling begins.\n       (4) For many children entering kindergarten, the \n     achievement gap between children from low-income households \n     compared to children from high-income households is already \n     evident.\n       (5) 85 percent of beginning kindergartners in the highest \n     socioeconomic group, compared to 39 percent in the lowest \n     socioeconomic group, can recognize letters of the alphabet. \n     Similarly, 98 percent of beginning kindergartners in the \n     highest socioeconomic group, compared to 84 percent of their \n     peers in the lowest socioeconomic group, can recognize \n     numbers and shapes.\n       (6) Once disadvantaged children are in school, they learn \n     at the same rate as other children. Therefore, providing \n     disadvantaged children with additional time in kindergarten, \n     in the summer before such children ordinarily enter \n     kindergarten and in the summer before first grade, will help \n     schools close achievement gaps and accelerate the academic \n     progress of their disadvantaged students.\n       (7) High quality, extended-year kindergarten that provides \n     children with enriched learning experiences is an important \n     factor in helping to close achievement gaps, rather than \n     having the gaps continue to widen.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       For the purpose of carrying out this Act, there are \n     authorized to be appropriated $1,500,000,000 for fiscal year \n     2005 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal \n     years 2006 through 2010.\n\n    Summary of the Sandy Feldman Kindergarten Plus (K+) Act of 2004\n\n       Purpose: To provide disadvantaged children with additional \n     time in kindergarten during the summer before and summer \n     after the traditional kindergarten school year, and to help \n     ensure that more children enter school ready to succeed.\n       Background: Kindergarten is critical in preparing children \n     to succeed in elementary school. Many low-income children \n     begin kindergarten lagging behind other children in literacy, \n     math, and social skills, even before formal schooling begins.\n       85 percent of high-income children, compared to 39 percent \n     of low-income children, can recognize letters of the alphabet \n     upon arrival in kindergarten. Half the children of parents \n     who have graduated from college can identify the beginning \n     sounds of words, but only 9 percent of the children whose \n     parents have not completed high school recognize the \n     beginning sounds of words. Kindergarten teachers report that \n     about 80 percent of the children whose mothers graduated from \n     college persist at a task and are eager to learn whereas only \n     about 60 percent of the children whose mothers have not \n     graduated from high school persist at a task and are eager to \n     learn.\n       Brief Bill Summary: K+ creates a competitive grant program \n     for states to provide\n\n[[Page S8131]]\n\n     local education agencies (LEAs) with funds to provide \n     kindergarten to disadvantaged children the summer before and \n     the summer after the traditional kindergarten school year. In \n     awarding grants to LEAs, States shall give priority to \n     educational agencies serving the greatest number or \n     percentage of kindergarten-aged children who are from \n     families with incomes below 185 percent of the poverty line \n     and to LEAs that will significantly reduce kindergarten class \n     sizes for their summer programs.\n       To be eligible for a grant, States must have in place: \n     developmentally appropriate practices and curriculum; goals \n     and objectives for a high quality summer program; a \n     description of how the State will provide professional \n     development for K+ teachers and staff; a description of how \n     the State will assist K+ programs to reach out to, and work \n     with, parents; and, a means to collect evaluative data to \n     determine the effectiveness of K+ programs across their \n     state.\n       To be eligible for a subgrant, LEAs must have in place: \n     readiness standards and developmentally appropriate \n     curricula; a plan for using classroom practices and \n     strategies proven to be effective; a plan for notifying \n     parents and the community regarding the availability of K+; a \n     plan for parental involvement in any K+ program; and, a plan \n     to demonstrate how they will accommodate the needs of working \n     parents with ``before and after'' child care services.\n       Funds to LEAs may be used to: pay for operational and \n     programmatic costs, including personnel and transportation; \n     transition services to first grade; outreach and recruitment; \n     parental involvement programs; and child care services. Each \n     LEA shall ensure a highly qualified teacher and qualified \n     paraprofessional or for non-school based programs a teacher \n     that at a minimum has a Bachelor's degree in early childhood \n     education.\n       The bill authorizes $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2005, and \n     such sums as may be necessary for years 2006-2010; the \n     minimum State grant is $500,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH:\n  S. 2655. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit for the production of water and energy efficient appliances; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, water is a precious resource that we must \nbegin to manage as efficiently as possible. In several parts of the \ncountry, development is constrained by the lack of good quality water \nand water infrastructure. Having dealt with the water crisis in the \nKlamath Basin in 2001, when 1,200 farmers and ranchers had their \nirrigation water cut off, I can tell you firsthand that the conflicts \nbetween competing human and environmental needs are real and are \ngrowing.\n  Benjamin Franklin wrote in Poor Richard's Almanack in 1746, ``When \nthe well is dry, we know the worth of water.'' Well, in parts of the \nWest, the well is quickly running dry. As the Los Angeles Times \nreported on June 18, 2004, the Western United States may be facing the \nbiggest drought in 500 years. The current effects in the Colorado River \nBasin are considerably worse than those experienced during the Dust \nBowl years of the 1930s. The 10-year drought in the Colorado River \nBasin has produced the lowest flows on record, straining an important \nwater supply resource for millions of people.\n  One immediate way to stretch available water supplies, as well as \nenergy resources, is to provide incentives for water and energy \nefficient appliances. That is why I am introducing a bill to provide \ntax credits for the manufacture of highly efficient residential clothes \nwashers, dishwashers and refrigerators. The bill builds on the tax \ncredits for energy-efficient appliances pending before the Senate, \nwhich--if enacted--will expire in 2007. Under this bill, for the first \ntime, water efficiency is included in the eligibility criteria for the \ntax credits, and the energy efficiency criteria are higher. This bill \nprovides graduated credits to manufacturers. The more efficient the \ndishwasher, clothes washer or refrigerator, the higher the credit.\n  The daily per capita water use around the world varies significantly. \nThe U.N. Population Fund cites that in the United States, we use an \nestimated 152 gallons per day per person, while in the United Kingdom \nthey use 388 gallons. Africans use 12 gallons a day.\n  According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, 47 percent of all water \nsupplied to communities in the United States by public and private \nutilities is for residential water use. Of that, clothes washers \naccount for approximately 22 percent of residential use, while \ndishwashers account for about 3 percent.\n  I firmly believe that we can use technology to improve our \nenvironmental stewardship. Water efficiency can extend our finite water \nsupplies, and also reduce the amount of wastewater that communities \nmust treat.\n  High efficiency clothes washers use 20 to 30 gallons per load, \ncompared to the 40 to 45 gallons top-loading machines use. The average \nannual household water savings is estimated to be 3,500 to 6,000 \ngallons. Energy savings estimates range from 68 to 70 percent compared \nto older, standard clothes washers. High efficiency dishwashers use 39 \npercent less energy to heat the water and 39 percent less water than \nstandard models. Refrigerators must use at least 30 percent less energy \nthan comparably sized models to receive a credit under this bill.\n  While plumbing fixtures such as toilets, showerheads and faucets must \nmeet U.S. water efficiency standards, water-using appliances are not \ngoverned by any water-efficiency standards. We can, however, provide an \nincentive to lower the cost of these water and energy saving \nappliances, which are generally more costly to manufacture than \nstandard models.\n  Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring \nthis important bill to provide incentives for water and energy \nefficient residential appliances. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2655\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Water and Energy Efficient \n     Appliances Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CREDIT FOR WATER AND ENERGY EFFICIENT APPLIANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of \n     chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     business-related credits) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 45G.

A bill to establish a National Commission on the \nQuincentennial of the discovery of Florida by Ponce de Leon; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in 2013, our nation will celebrate the \n500th anniversary of Ponce de Leon's landing on the east coast of \nFlorida. I am pleased to introduce a bill today that establishes a \ncommission to determine how we can best commemorate his discovery of \nFlorida. For a country as young as ours, a Quincentennial is a rare \nmilestone worthy of tribute.\n  Juan Ponce de Leon landed on the coast of Florida, south of the \npresent-day St. Augustine, in April of 1513. During the Easter holiday, \nhe explored our coasts, visiting the Florida Keys and the west coast of \nFlorida. The first European explorer to step foot on North American \nsoil, Ponce de Leon opened Florida and the mainland of the Americas to \nthe rest of the world. Florida owes its heritage to Ponce de Leon. Even \nthe name Florida dates back to Ponce de Leon's discovery. When he saw \nthe lush terrain, Ponce de Leon named the area the ``land of flowers'' \nor ``Florida'' in Spanish.\n  While there is no doubt that Ponce de Leon is a key part of Florida's \nhistory, his landing in Florida is ingrained in our entire nation's \nearly history. Children read in their history books about the myths \nsurrounding Ponce de Leon's voyages. His quest for the fountain of \nyouth has become a myth symbolic of the age of exploration.\n  Other Europeans were encouraged to make the dangerous journey across \nthe Atlantic toward the Americas, persuaded by the stories of Ponce de \nLeon's explorations of the new lands of Florida. Ultimately, his \ndiscovery opened the path for exploration and colonization of the \nAmericas.\n  I have drafted this bill with the assistance of a notable scholar \naccomplished in the field of early Florida history--Dr. Samuel Proctor, \nDistinguished Service Professor Emeritus of History at the University \nof Florida. I would like to thank Dr. Proctor for all of his efforts in \ndrafting this bill.\n  Funding authorized by this legislation would support the activities \nof this commission and would allow for educational activities, \nceremonies, and celebrations. Fittingly, the principal office for this \noperation would be located in St. Augustine, FL.\n  With the establishment of this commission, my hope is to not only \ncommemorate Ponce de Leon's arrival in Florida but to enhance the \nAmerican public's knowledge about the impact of Florida's discovery on \nthe history of the United States. I hope that my colleagues will \nrecognize the importance of commemorating this historic event.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2656\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ponce de Leon Discovery of \n     Florida Quincentennial Commission Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Quincentennial of the founding of Florida by Ponce \n     de Leon occurs in 2013, 500 years after Ponce de Leon landed \n     on its shores and explored the Keys and the west coast of \n     Florida;\n       (2) evidence supports the theory that Ponce de Leon was the \n     first European to land on the shores of Florida;\n       (3) Florida means ``the land of flowers'' and the State \n     owes its name to Ponce de Leon;\n       (4) Ponce de Leon's quest for the ``fountain of youth'' has \n     become an established legend which has drawn fame and \n     recognition to Florida and the United States;\n       (5) the discovery of Florida by Ponce de Leon, the myth of \n     the ``fountain of youth'', and the subsequent colonization of \n     Florida encouraged other European countries to explore the \n     New World and to establish settlements in the territory that \n     is currently the United States;\n       (6) Florida was colonized under 5 flags; and\n       (7) commemoration of the arrival in Florida of Ponce de \n     Leon and the beginning of the colonization of the Americas \n     would--\n       (A) enhance public understanding of the impact of the \n     discovery of Florida on the history of the United States; and\n       (B) provide lessons about the importance of exploration and \n     discovery.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the National \n     Commission on the Quincentennial of the discovery of Florida \n     by Ponce de Leon established under section 4(a).\n       (2) Quincentennial.--The term ``Quincentennial'' means the \n     500th anniversary of the discovery of Florida by Ponce de \n     Leon.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend part III of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide for the establishment of programs under which supplemental \ndental and vision benefits are made available to Federal employees, \nretirees, and their dependents, to expand the contracting authority of \nthe Office of Personnel Management, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation with my friend and colleague, Senator Akaka, that would \ngive Federal employees, retirees, and their families greater access to \ncomprehensive dental and vision insurance coverage. The Federal \nEmployee Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004 would \nestablish a voluntary program under which Federal employees and \nannuitants may purchase dental and vision coverage. The legislation \ngrants the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) the authority to select \nthe appropriate combination of nationwide and regional companies and a \nvariety of benefit packages to meet the diverse needs of our Federal \nemployee and annuitant population.\n  The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research estimates \nthat for every dollar spent on dental disease prevention, $4 is saved \nin subsequent treatment costs. Improved access to dental and vision \ncare is an essential component of any comprehensive health care \nstrategy. Federal employees need and deserve increased access to dental \nand vision benefits.\n  Today, the Federal community has access to excellent medical coverage \nthrough the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB). \nUnfortunately, the program provides reimbursement for only a small \nfraction of dental care. Customer surveys indicate that FEHB enrollees \nwant more comprehensive dental and vision benefits than those that are \ncurrently being provided in the FEHB program. The increasing demand for \ndental and vision benefits has prompted Senator Akaka and me to pursue \nlegislation that would offer separate and improved coverage for Federal \nemployees, retirees, and their families.\n  The stand-alone model contained in my legislation preserves the \nintegrity of the FEHB while encouraging the purchase of additional \ndental and vision coverage. It is important to note that nothing in my \nlegislation prevents the existing medical carriers from continuing to \noffer dental and vision coverage under the FEHBP. Further, nothing in \nthe legislation precludes current FEHBP carriers from participating in \nthe competitive process to offer benefits under the new voluntary \ndental and vision programs. The legislation simply provides a mechanism \nfor dental and vision companies to participate in the Federal employee \nbenefits arena.\n  In recognition of the enormous fiscal pressures faced by the Federal \nGovernment, the legislation is designed to provide an employee-paid \ndental and vision benefit, patterned after the Federal Employees Long-\nTerm Care Insurance Program. By leveraging the purchasing power of the \nFederal Government, combined with market-driven competition, OPM would \nhave the ability to provide access to more comprehensive dental and \nvision coverage to employees and retirees at no cost to the Federal \nGovernment. Federal employees would have the confidence that OPM has \ngiven its seal of approval to the benefit packages provided under the \nvoluntary programs.\n\n  The legislation recognizes the geographic dispersion of the Federal \nworkforce and the need for greater access to care through local dental \nand eye health professionals by requiring companies to provide coverage \nin under-served areas. For example, companies selected to provide \ncoverage to a particular region would be required to develop and \nmaintain provider networks in all States, including States where access \nto care may be less available.\n  While the legislation lists general categories of benefits that may \nbe offered under the new programs, the statutory model is flexible to \nensure that the benefit packages can be modified over time to \nincorporate future advances in dental and vision products, therapies, \nand technologies.\n  Employees look to their employer to provide education about their \nbenefits. For this reason, the legislation requires OPM to make \navailable the educational tools necessary so that Federal employees \nhave a clear understanding of the choices available to them. Employees \nwill have access to information on how the voluntary plans can \nsupplement the existing, though limited, coverage offered by their \nmedical plan under the FEHBP, to meet their individual needs for care. \nOPM would also educate employees about the value of their existing \nFlexible Spending Accounts to help cover out-of-pocket dental and \nvision expenses. These options can help Federal employees and \nannuitants get the best value for their premium dollar.\n  Administration by OPM would ensure that each contract is awarded on \nthe basis of quality and price, and that the companies understand and \nadapt to the needs of Federal employees, retirees, and their families. \nAdditionally, OPM would provide participants access to a process to \nappeal adverse benefit determinations. Premiums can be made through \npayroll or annuity deductions, direct payments to the participating \ncompanies, or both. The plans would be open to all Federal civilian \nemployees and annuitants, regardless of whether they currently \nparticipate in the FEHBP.\n  As with the Long-Term Care Insurance Program, our measure for the \nsuccess of the dental and vision programs would be the extent to which \nFederal employees purchase these benefits.\n  My colleagues and I have recognized, through our support of \nlegislation to assist the Federal Government with its recruitment and \nretention efforts, that the Federal Government's most important asset \nis its human capital. Employees of 48 State governments offer or \nprovide access to dental benefit plans to employees. Surveys indicate \nthat 95 percent of employers with 500 or more employees provide dental \ninsurance. The opportunity to purchase enhanced dental and vision \ncoverage will help the government with its ongoing efforts to recruit \nand retain a highly qualified workforce.\n  The legislation is supported by the American Federation of Government \nEmployees, the National Treasury Employees Union, the National \nAssociation of Dental Plans, and the American Optometric Association. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in providing our\n\n[[Page S8135]]\n\nFederal employee community with greater access to dental and vision \ncoverage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Craig, Mr. \nBingaman, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2658. A bill to establish a Department of Energy National \nLaboratories water technology research and development program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. There is no more important or essential \nsubstance to us than water. It is the source from which life springs. \nIt also has the potential to be the source of incredible conflict \nranging from local to international levels. Fresh water supplies are \ncoming under pressure all over the globe. By mid-century, over half of \nthe world's population will face severe water shortages. These \nshortages go beyond drinking water; particularly important is the nexus \nof water and energy production--another flash point in global affairs. \nSeriously confronting this problem before it leads to tremendous \nburdens on this nation and the world is an endeavor as worthwhile as \nany I can contemplate.\n  Research and development in this area has long been without concerted \nnational attention. Water and water rights have traditionally been \nunder the purview of the States, and rightly so. But few States have \nthe capacity and funding to adequately address this problem. Users of \nwater resources are highly risk averse and can ill afford to take \nchances on unproven technology. At the Federal level, at least \nseventeen agencies do water research, however only three currently \nengage in water supply augmentation research--the Department of \nAgriculture, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Department of Energy. \nAccording to the National Research Council's June 17, 2004 report \nentitled ``Confronting the Nation's Water Problems: The Role of \nResearch,'' the total Federal investment in water resources research in \n2000 dollars has been level at $700m since 1967. The Federal investment \nin 2000 was 5 percent less than the investment in 1973 in indexed \ndollars. The total Federal water research investment of $700m \nrepresents about 0.5 percent of the Federal research budget--for the \nmost fundamental resource need. Investment in Water supply augmentation \nresearch funding has declined from $160m in 1970 to $14m in 2000.\n  These circumstances have led to neglect in long-term, cutting edge, \ncommercially viable research and development. This is ultimately \nuntenable. We know what is possible, we have acted successfully before. \nFederal investment in the 1960's and 1970's is the basis for existing \ndesalination technology that substantially expanded U.S. and world wide \nwater supplies. We know that a similar investment can again achieve \nsuch results. Thus, the lack of Federal investment is unacceptable \ngiven our prior experiences and our complete and utter dependence on \nthis resource.\n  Our nation's efforts to address these problems must be fought on \nmultiple fronts. We must provide for development and maintenance of \nwater infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. This is the \ninfrastructure that sustains our lives and livelihoods. We must make \nour management of this precious resource more rational. We must make a \nconcerted effort to more fully understand and extend the limits of our \nfresh and lower quality water. We must coordinate and enhance our \ntechnology to address both water quality and quantity. We cannot fight \nall these fronts with one effort, but we can begin to address aspects \nof the problem.\n\n  To that end, I introduce today the Department of Energy National \nLaboratories Water Research and Development Act of 2004. This \nadmittedly ambitious bill authorizes a substantial Federal investment \nof up to $200 million per year for basic and applied research and \ndevelopment in water supply technologies. The emphasis of this program \nis developing and deploying new and affordable technology to improve \nwater quantity and quality. Its primary goal is to facilitate and guide \nresearch, development, and deployment of affordable and cutting edge \ntechnology that increases the quantity and quality of water available \nfor multiple uses. This will be done across the Nation, in a wide range \nof hydrogeographies and water situations.\n  The effort combines the expertise and resources of our great National \nLaboratories and universities across the country. The Program builds on \nthe immense investment in new technology and basic science within the \nlabs and universities and directs it toward this critical human need. \nIt will also compliment and strengthen the many programs and efforts \nunderway at Federal agencies and non-governmental organizations.\n  The Act authorizes the Department of Energy, through the National \nLaboratories, to partner with universities in specified regions to work \non technology for particularized areas of research. Each region will be \ntasked with addressing a given range of issues. These include brine \nremoval and inland desalination to re-use and conservation technology. \nFurthermore, the water and energy nexus will be fully explored. \nPressures created by water needed to supply energy and energy necessary \nto produce usable water have not, to date, been sufficiently addressed.\n  A grant program will be created to augment existing efforts by non-\nprogram members. Many Federal agencies and non-governmental entities \nhave ongoing projects in this arena including the Bureau of Reclamation \n(``BOR''), the Department of Agriculture (``USDA''), the Department of \nDefense (``DOD'') (through the Office of Naval Research), the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (``EPA''), and NASA. Additionally, the \nProgram fully incorporates public-private partnerships such as those \nalready working with the American Water Resources Research Foundation, \nthe WateReuse Foundation and many others.\n  Finally, this bill creates a National Water Supply Law and Policy \nInstitute. The Policy Center's responsibilities include identifying \nintervention points where technological development may help alleviate \nreal and potential water supply problems. The Policy Institute will act \nas a clearinghouse for relevant information on regulations, laws and \ncodes--from municipal to national scales focused on helping to overcome \nobstacles of new technology that can expand water supplies.\n  The Program will be administered by a Program Coordinator appointed \nby the Secretary of Energy. The Coordinator will administer the program \nfrom facilities located at Sandia National Laboratory, our Nation's \nbest applied engineering lab. Acting as the coordinating institution, \nSandia is responsible for technology development road-mapping and \nassisting the Regional Centers in transferring their creations from \nbench-scale to commercialization. Sandia is also charged with guiding \nthe Policy Center.\n  The conditions are present to necessitate the Federal government \ntaking a lead role. We must act now. The costs of inaction will be \nborne by all of us. The market is skewed against development. It is a \nmatter of personal and national security. It is a matter of human \nnecessity. It is a matter of time.\n  The need is great. The goal is good. Let us begin.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2658\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It was \nGerald Ford's calm and steady leadership that began the process of \nhealing our Nation's wounds after one of the most serious domestic \ncrises in our history. President Clinton awarded him the Medal of \nFreedom, in 1999, in recognition of that leadership.\n  Gerald Ford served thirteen terms in the House of Representatives. \nFrom 1965 through 1973, he was the minority leader in that body. It is \nparticularly instructive in this time of partisan division in the \nCongress to reflect on his example as one who fought many battles on \nbehalf of his party, and his constituency, but who did so without \nacrimony or ill-will. He build life-long relationships and friendships \nacross the party aisle--even with his opposite numbers in the House \nDemocratic leadership. We would be well served at this time in this \nbody to remember his example.\n  I extend my congratulations and best wishes to Gerry Ford, his \nwonderful wife, Betty, and his family. I am certain that the people of \nMichigan, and our colleagues in the Senate join Senator Stabenow and me \nin paying tribute to President Ford on his 91st birthday.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the only \nperson from the State of Michigan to have served as President of the \nUnited States. On behalf of the people of the State of Michigan, I want \nto extend my best wishes to President Gerald R. Ford and his family on \nthe occasion of his 91st birthday.\n  President Ford took office during an extraordinarily trying time for \nAmerica. He was the first Vice President chosen under the terms of the \nTwenty-Fifth Amendment and, in the aftermath of Watergate, succeeded \nthe first American President ever to resign. In his inaugural address \non August 9, 1974, President Ford noted, ``This is an hour of history \nthat troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.'' Gerald Ford took on the \nchallenge of healing our national faith in the presidency with courage, \nwisdom and integrity.\n  Indeed, it was President Ford's reputation for openness and integrity \nthat propelled him into the White House. He was appointed Vice \nPresident after serving twelve terms in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, having secured each term with more than 60 percent of \nthe vote. The confidence of his colleagues fueled his ascent to Ranking \nMember on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and, eventually, to \nMinority Leader. It also won him an appointment to the Warren \nCommission investigating the assassination of President John F. \nKennedy.\n  As President, Gerald Ford led our Nation on the path toward healing a \nwounded faith in that office. He also labored to improve relationships \namong nations. In his own words ``a dyed-in-the-wool \ninternationalist,'' President Ford presided over the signing of the \nHelsinki Agreement, which ratified post-World War II European borders \nand codified international human rights standards. He also worked for \nimproved relations among the nations of the Middle East and, together \nwith Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, set new limitations on nuclear \nproliferation.\n  Since leaving the White House in 1977, President Ford has remained \nactively engaged in the political process and has continued to speak \nout on important issues. He has lectured at hundreds of colleges and \nuniversities, hosted numerous forums on public affairs, and served as \nan adjunct professor of Government at the University of Michigan. In \n1999, President Bill Clinton awarded Ford the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor.\n  Gerald Ford has also made an important mark in his home State of \nMichigan. In 1977, he announced the establishment of the Gerald R. Ford \nInstitute for Public Policy and Service at Albion College, which \nadministers an interdisciplinary program for undergraduate students \npreparing for careers in public service. In 1981, the Gerald R. Ford \nLibrary in Ann Arbor and the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids were \ndedicated. Through these institutions, the people of Michigan and many \nvisitors from around the country and the world continue to benefit from \nPresident Ford's legacy of internationalism, scholarship and humor.\n  President Ford, on the occasion of your 91st birthday, the American \npeople salute you, and express our profound gratitude for your \nleadership and service.\n  Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 405) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.
