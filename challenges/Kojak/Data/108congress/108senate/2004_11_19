Mr. President, this morning we will have 30 minutes of \ndebate prior to the cloture vote on the miscellaneous trade and \ntechnical corrections conference report. Therefore, I expect cloture to \noccur shortly after 10 a.m. I expect cloture to be invoked, and if it \nis invoked I hope we can complete the conference report in short order.\n  I will talk to the Democratic leadership after the vote to see what \ntime may be necessary during that postcloture period.\n  I also expect the appropriations conference report, the so-called \nomnibus package, will be filed today. If so, I hope we will be able to \nact on that measure at some point today or this evening. I am \noptimistic that we can, in fact, finish our work sometime today and \nadjourn this Congress.\n  While we are waiting for the omnibus conference reports, we will \ncontinue to try to process other cleared legislative items. The IDEA, \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act conference report, is \nexpected to arrive today from the House, and we will consider that \nlegislation before we adjourn this year.\n  Finally, we have a very large number of nominations that are \navailable on the Executive Calendar. It would be irresponsible to leave \nwithout acting on at least those nominations which we know are \nnoncontroversial. We must move toward resolution of these nominations \nover the course of the day. We need to continue to pursue a way of \nclearing that Executive Calendar.\n\n  I will close so we can move on for the vote, but I have to add that I \npersonally had a remarkable day yesterday. I had the opportunity to \nvisit the Clinton Library for what was an exceptional and remarkable \nday in terms of having our former Presidents together in a wonderful \nbipartisan spirit. It was a rainy day so we all sat in 2 or 3 hours of \nthe downpour. It really was an inspiration to see what has made and \ncontinues to make this country so great. It is a wonderful library. I \nhave three boys and look forward to going back and taking them through \na magnificent structure. It really does capture President Clinton's \nupbeat, optimistic enthusiasm, his whole view of life. A number of the \nSenators attended. I wanted to mention it because it was quite \nremarkable for me, personally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11516-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 1047, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report accompanying the bill (H.R. 1047) to \n     amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 30 minutes divided in the following form: Senator Grassley in \ncontrol of 10 minutes; the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, in control \nof 10 minutes; the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, for up to 8 \nminutes; and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, for up to 2 minutes.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't see Senator Grassley, the chairman \nof the committee, in the Chamber. I expect him momentarily. In the \nmeantime, I will say a few words with respect to the pending \nlegislation.\n  I am pleased, frankly, that in the final days of the 108th Congress, \nthe Senate is set to pass at long last the miscellaneous tariff bill. \nThis bill reduces or eliminates tariffs on literally hundreds of \nproducts that U.S. companies use to make products in America. It is a \ncollection of many bills too small to be considered independently, and, \ntraditionally, Congress collects these inexpensive and noncontroversial \nbills together into one big omnibus bill which the Senate then passes \nby unanimous consent. That is our tradition in the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, that did not happen with this bill this time. For the \nfirst time in the history of the process, the House insisted we go to \nconference on the bill. Frankly, that is unfortunate. In the aggregate, \nthe provisions of this bill represent a significant cost savings for \nU.S. manufacturers simply struggling to compete. We owe it to them to \nget the process back on track in the next Congress. I hope we can do \nthat, and I promise to work very hard toward that end.\n\n  I wish to highlight two provisions in this bill in particular that \nwill help my State of Montana remain competitive. One is a provision \nthat eliminates the tariff on specialized components used by a Bozeman-\nbased boot manufacturer called Schnee Shoes. This is a top-of-the-line \ncompany. They make the best boots for hunting. If a hunter goes out \npheasant hunting, duck hunting, you buy Schnee. They are terrific. They \nproduce first-class products. Eliminating the tariff will save them \ntens of thousands of dollars a year and allow them to keep good-paying \njobs in Bozeman, MT.\n  The other provision improves the competitiveness of U.S. wool. We \nproduce a lot of wool in Montana--$2 million a year. As other \ncommodities and textiles, wool has faced an increasingly difficult \nmarketplace over the past several years.\n  In response, U.S. wool growers adopted a positive approach to embrace \nworld markets; that is, setting up a wool trust fund. Through the wool \ntrust fund, first established in 2000, U.S. exports of wool have risen \nsixfold as a share of domestic production. This successful program of \nthe wool trust fund is, unfortunately, scheduled to expire next year. \nBut this bill renews the wool trust fund through the year 2007 and \nallows the United States and Montana wool growers to continue to \ncompete.\n  I also want to speak about one other provision of this bill, normal \ntrade relations with Laos, that I know has generated some controversy. \nI support granting normal trade relations to Laos. In the absence of \nnormal trade relations, Laos is subject to average tariffs of 45 \npercent, with peaks of 60 to 90 percent for important Laotian products \nsuch as T-shirts and bamboo chairs.\n  In contrast, most U.S. trading partners, including Laotian \ncompetitors Burma, China, Cambodia, and Vietnam, face average tariffs \nof only 2.4 percent compared, again, with Laos of 45 percent.\n  Now, I know some of my colleagues oppose granting normal trade \nrelations to Laos. They believe Laos must work harder on improving its \nhuman rights record before receiving normal trade relations. But normal \ntrade relations, I must emphasize, is not a special privilege the \nUnited States grants only to certain countries, and it does not signify \napproval of a country's policies. It is not a free trade agreement or a \npreference program. Rather, it is the baseline economic relationship \nthe United States has with virtually every other country in the world--\nthe baseline.\n  In fact, there are only three countries on Earth that do not have \nnormal trade relations: Cuba, North Korea, and Laos, and Laos is the \nonly one of the three that has full, normal diplomatic relations with \nthe United States.\n  Laos has worked with the United States closely in accounting for U.S. \nprisoners of war and missing in action in Laos during the Vietnam war, \nsupported U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Southeast Asia after 9/11, \nand has cooperated in a long-term bilateral counternarcotics program.\n  Granting normal trade relations to Laos could have a dramatic effect \non improving the dismal economic conditions in that country. Laos has \nthe\n\n[[Page S11517]]\n\nlowest life expectancy in Southeast Asia, and the highest fertility \nrate. It also has the highest adult illiteracy rate, particularly among \nwomen.\n\n  Cambodia, on the other hand, has created more than 200,000 jobs since \nthe United States granted that country normal trade relations in 1996. \nMy hope is that normal trade relations for Laos will have a similar \neffect. Granting normal trade relations to Laos will also create \nopportunities to open the society, improve human rights, improve \nreligious freedom, and improve the rule of law.\n  That is why my good friend, Senator Grassley, and I have worked hard \nto pass normal trade relations for Laos, and why it is right to include \nit in this bill. I think it is time for us to remove an awkward legacy \nof the Vietnam war and grant normal trade relations to Laos.\n  This bill includes a long list of provisions that will help American \ncompetitiveness. We should bring debate on this bill to a close and \npass this constructive measure. I urge my colleagues, therefore, to \nvote for cloture.\n  Mr. President, before I turn the floor over to my good friend, the \nchairman of our committee, I would like to thank several terrific staff \nmembers. I thank Everett Eissenstat and Zach Paulsen of the Republican \nstaff who worked very hard to get this miscellaneous tariffs bill \npassed. Also, from the majority leader's staff, I thank Rohit Kumar and \nAndy Olson, two extremely able and very helpful people, who helped get \nthese provisions into this bill. I also thank, on my staff, Sara \nAndrews, who really led the charge. She did a great job, assisted by \nJohn Gilliland, who is equally competent. That is an understatement. \nBoth of them are just aces, and I am very proud of them. I thank them \nfor their assistance.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference report to H.R. 1047, the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical \nCorrections Act of 2004, commonly called the miscellaneous tariff bill.\n  This legislation has traveled a long and difficult road to get to the \nfloor today. In fact, the journey began over 2\\1/2\\ years ago when \nSenator Baucus chaired the Finance Committee. The Senate historically \npasses a miscellaneous tariff bill at the end of every Congress. The \nbill under consideration today was supposed to pass at the end of the \n107th Congress. However, it was left as unfinished business for the \ncurrent Congress. Upon resuming the chairmanship of the Finance \nCommittee, my intention was to complete unfinished business from the \n107th Congress as quickly as possible. To that end, we passed the bill \nout of Committee by voice vote on February 27, 2003.\n  We hoped that early passage of this bill would pave the way for \nconsideration of another miscellaneous tariff bill in the 108th \nCongress. But that was not meant to be. Throughout the remainder of the \nCongress we faced significant delays and stall tactics. In March 2004, \nover a year after the bill was reported out of the Finance Committee, \nwe reached agreement and passed the bill by unanimous consent. But \nquick conference consideration was not meant to be. We were forced to \nwait another 6 months before we could go to conference with the House. \nThe conference committee quickly reached an agreement in October and \nthe House passed the conference report shortly thereafter. However, \nSenate action was further delayed until today. Happily, it looks like \nthe bill is finally near the end of its journey as we appear to be on \nthe verge of passing this bill as one of the last orders of business \nfor the 108th.\n  At this point, it might be interesting to reflect on what the Senate \nFinance Committee has been able to accomplish on trade during the time \nit took to pass this bill. During the first session of the 108th \nCongress, we were able to complete work on the Clean Diamond Trade Act, \nlegislation designed to help thwart trade in conflict diamonds. We also \nimplemented two free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore. In \naddition, we enacted the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, which put \nin place an import ban on products from Burma in an effort to help stop \nhuman rights abuses and the repression of democracy in that country.\n  During the second session of the 108th Congress, we enacted the \nAfrica Growth and Opportunity Acceleration Act, which continues trade \npreferences for some of the poorest nations in sub-Saharan Africa. We \nalso implemented two trade agreements with Australia and Morocco and \nbrought the United States into compliance with an adverse WTO ruling in \nthe FSC/ETI case through passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of \n2004. There is no doubt that Senate passage of the conference report on \nthe MTB will be a nice capstone to what has already been a highly \nsuccessful Congress on trade.\n  This package contains many trade provisions, primarily duty \nsuspensions, reductions and extensions, for products that are not \nproduced domestically. This bill supports American factories and \nworkers by allowing manufacturers to save money when they import these \nproducts.\n  Each of these provisions went through an extensive vetting process \nincluding a public notice and comment period to ensure that they did \nnot compete with domestic manufacturers. The bill also contains a \nnumber of liquidations or reliquidations for certain entries.\n  The general rule for inclusion here is that the product entered the \ncountry under an incorrect duty rate due to Customs or other \nadministrative error. These provisions allow those entries to enter the \ncountry at the correct duty rate.\n  There are several some other very important provisions in this bill. \nThe bill grants the President the authority to provide permanent normal \ntrade relations, PNTR, for Armenia. Armenia recently joined the World \nTrade Organization. But, in order to reap the benefits of their \naccession, the United States needs to extend PNTR to Armenia. This \nlegislation provides the President with the authority to grant that \nextension. I also hope we will be able to consider similar treatment \nfor Azerbaijan in the very near future.\n  The bill also extends normal trade relations to Laos. Last year the \nBush administration signed a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement \nwith Laos, an agreement that was negotiated during the Clinton years. \nThe agreement will promote U.S. interests by protecting U.S. \nintellectual property rights and opening the Laotian market to U.S. \ngoods and services. It is a good agreement. But to enable the United \nStates to benefit from it, we must extend normal trade relations to \nLaos. Doing so will also benefit the Laotian people. Laos is one of the \npoorest nations in Asia. Yet exports from Laos are subject to some of \nthe highest tariffs when they enter the United States. This agreement \nwill help alleviate poverty, help bring Laos out of the Vietnam War \nera, and further integrate Laos into the global marketplace.\n  We also included in this bill a provision that extends preferences \nunder the Generalized System of Preferences, GSP, to allow duty-free \ntreatment for hand-knotted and hand-woven carpets. This provision is \ndesigned primarily to help the citizens of Afghanistan and Pakistan. I \nbelieve that allowing these products to be considered as eligible \narticles under GSP will help beneficiary countries that have joined the \nUnited States in the fight against global terrorism.\n  Further, H.R. 1047 corrects a mistake in the Trade Act of 2002 that \ninadvertently and temporarily raised duties on Andean originating \nhandbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves and leather wearing apparel \nunder the Andean Trade and Preferences and Drug Eradication Act, \nATPDEA. This provision retroactively reinstates the reduced duty \ntreatment for eligible products that entered the U.S. from August 6, \n2002, the date ATPDEA was signed, and the time in which these products \nmet the import sensitivity test, several months later. It provides for \ncontinued duty-free treatment for these eligible products, which was \nthe intent of the trade act.\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes the Emergency Protection for \nIraqi Cultural Antiquities Act. I introduced the EPIC Antiquities Act \nto authorize the President to continue emergency import restrictions on \nthe archaeological and ethnological materials of Iraq. The purpose of \nthis bill is simple--to close a legal loophole which could allow looted \nIraqi antiquities to be brought into the United States.\n\n[[Page S11518]]\n\n  If Congress does not act to ensure the continuing means for banning \ntrade in antiquities that may have been stolen, the door could be \nopened to imports of looted Iraqi antiquities into the United States. \nAlready the press has reported allegations that European auction houses \nhave traded in looted Iraqi antiquities. The last thing that we in \nCongress want to do is to fail to act to prevent trade in looted Iraqi \nartifacts here in the United States.\n  Other important provisions in the bill include modifications to the \ncellar treatment of natural wine and repeal of the 1916 act. Repeal of \nthe 1916 act will bring the United States into compliance with its WTO \nobligations. We have also improved and extended the wool trust fund and \nadded a provision that simplifies some processing U.S. Customs \nprocessing procedures, thereby resulting in increased efficiency and \nproductivity for both the government and the trade community.\n  I also want to point out that the provisions I have covered are not \nthe only important provisions contained in this bill. This bill makes a \nnumber of other technical yet meaningful changes to our trade laws.\n  I am very pleased that we are going to be able to pass this bill \ntoday. We would not be here today if not for the bipartisan efforts of \na number of the Finance Committee staff, some of whom have long left \nthe Senate. First, I want to thank Andy Harig who shepherded this bill \nthrough its first stages of development under Chairman Baucus' \nleadership during the 107th Congress. I also want to recognize Carrie \nClark Phillips, for immersing herself in the tremendous complexities of \nthis bill and her dedication to seeing the task done upon my resumption \nas chairman of the committee. Zach Paulsen and Sara Andrews also \ndeserve recognition for their ability to pick up where Carrie and Andy \nleft off and their hard work in bringing this bill to a successful \nconclusion. I also appreciate the hard work of Rohit Kumar, who was \ninstrumental in helping us move this bill forward. Finally, Liese \nWright, with the Washington International Business Council, has done an \noutstanding job bringing together, and holding intact, the Ad Hoc \nCoalition on Tariffs. In good times and bad, Liese remained ever \nhopeful and committed to getting this bill done. Her hard work and \noptimism is appreciated.\n  Let me also thank the rest of the Finance Committee international \ntrade staff for their work not just on this bill, but for all we have \nbeen able to accomplish this Congress. On Senator Baucus's staff I \nwould like to recognize Russ Sullivan and Bill Dauster, who provided \nthe guidance necessary to help the Committee accomplish its goals, and \nTim Punke, Brian Pomper, John Gilliland and Shara Aranoff for their \ntechnical expertise and policy advice which was so crucial to our \nsuccess. On my staff, I would like to thank Kolan Davis, Everett \nEissenstat, Stephen Schaefer, David Johanson, Tiffany Atwell McCullen, \nand detailees Nova Daly and Dan Shepherdson. Their knowledge, hard \nwork, and ability to pull together as a team, enabled me to accomplish \na number of important trade priorities in this Congress. And for that, \nI am grateful.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to efforts to push through a provision in this bill \nnormalizing trade relations with Laos.\n  Let me first say I thoroughly enjoy my work with both managers of the \nbill. Senator Baucus and I agree on so many issues. We have had our \ndisagreements on trade issues, but I do respect his views and \narguments. Of course, I very much respect the Senator from Iowa. I have \nthe pleasure of serving with him on a number of committees. I \nrespectfully disagree with him on this particular aspect of the bill \nhaving to do with Laos.\n  I am deeply disappointed that a decision was made to insert this \nprovision into the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of \n2004 conference report. The Senator from Montana suggested that those \nof us who are opposed to this provision simply believe that Laos could \ndo better. I am afraid it is a lot more serious than Laos needing to do \na little bit better on human rights.\n  First, let there be no misunderstanding that this bill would sail \nthrough the Senate if this provision on Laos was not included. However, \nI cannot support upgrading Laos's trading status as long as the human \nrights situation in that country remains so disturbing. I am not \nprepared to simply let this bill pass without at least some debate on \nthis important matter.\n  This is the wrong time to reward the Government of Laos with normal \ntrade relations. Reports emerging from Laos continue to demonstrate \nthat human right conditions in Laos remain appalling. It is not a \nquestion of simply doing a little better, it is appalling. Despite the \nLao Government's denials, human rights organizations, the U.S. \nGovernment, and my constituents and various news agencies have all \ndocumented the Lao Government's blatant disregard for human rights.\n\n  I have tried to closely monitor the human rights situation in Laos as \na member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on \nEast Asia and Pacific Affairs, and also as a Senator representing over \n35,000 Hmong people in Wisconsin. Many of these people fled Laos \nfollowing the end of the Vietnam war. Quite a number of the Hmong \nprovided courageous assistance to the CIA during the Vietnam war, at \ngreat risk to themselves and their families. They helped rescue \nAmerican pilots and hold off North Vietnamese troops.\n  Especially at a time like this, I think we can all agree that we owe \nthem a debt of gratitude, and we owe them better than simply rewarding \nnormal trade relations to a government that has badly mistreated them.\n  The Senator from Montana indicated this provision was an indication \nthat it is time to put the legacy of the Vietnam war behind us. When it \ncomes to the situation on the ground in Laos, the tragic legacy of the \nVietnam war is very much alive for families of people who helped us \nduring that very difficult conflict. So the legacy of Vietnam is not \nover when it comes to the treatment of the Lao Hmong people in Laos.\n  I am regularly contacted by constituents concerned about their \nfriends and families in Laos. Again and again, my office encounters \nreports of atrocities committed against the Hmong in Laos and other \ndeplorable practices by the Lao Government. These reports, combined \nwith the Lao Government's absolute refusal to investigate allegations \nor to permit independent monitoring, lead me to believe it is not in \nour country's national interest to adopt normal trade relations with \nthe Lao Government.\n  The United States has an obligation to the Hmong people, and I \nstrongly believe that we have a moral interest in reducing human \nsuffering and protecting human rights abroad. We cannot ignore these \nallegations of atrocities in Laos. Granting NTR is not appropriate at \nthis time. In fact, I do recognize, as the Senator from Montana pointed \nout, that there are only a few countries that do not have NTR status. \nBut that does not mean Laos deserves it any more than North Korea or \nperhaps Cuba. In fact, I have not supported the granting of NTR to some \ncountries that have it now, such as China. In fact, I think the normal \ntrade agreement with China is the biggest reason the State of Wisconsin \nhas lost up to 80,000 manufacturing jobs since the middle of the year \n2000.\n  You can call NTR normal, but, in fact, that was a semantic change \nfrom MFN, most-favored-nation treatment. It was a semantic change to \ntry to make it easier to get these deals through. The fact is, normal \ntrade relations with another country is not always right. Sometimes it \nis in our own interest in terms of protecting our jobs, and sometimes \nbecause of the outrageous human rights records that some countries \nhave, and Laos, in my view, is certainly one of those countries.\n  I know many of my colleagues have provisions in this bill they want \npassed, and I want the body to know, Mr. President, that I have \nrepeatedly asked that we simply strip out this one contentious \nprovision and pass the rest of the bill, and I am prepared to do that \nagain. I heard the resuscitation of some of the other meritorious \naspects of this bill, and I respect that. I am not sure I agree with \nevery piece of the bill, but I do recognize much of it is good. My goal \nhere is not to kill the\n\n[[Page S11519]]\n\nwhole bill. I simply want this item removed.\n\n  At some point, this body has to come to grips with the fact that we \ntend to shove major policy decisions into larger bills without any real \ndebate and discussion and without the American people having access to \nwhat their representatives are doing, thinking, or saying about some of \nthese items. Somehow this has to change.\n  I also realize the 108th Congress is drawing to a close, and many of \nus are already looking to head home to our families and constituents. \nBut I cannot, in good conscience, stand by and say nothing against a \nprovision that conflicts so fundamentally with our country's dedication \nto human rights, to democracy, and to fundamental decency.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing cloture. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am deeply troubled by the series of events \nwhich have brought us here today. The miscellaneous tariff bill, a \nrelatively noncontroversial bill that has been making its way through \nthe Congress for more than a year now, which is full of worthy \nnoncontroversial provisions, has become the vehicle to pass a bill that \nis controversial, to say the least.\n  At the eleventh hour, behind closed doors, the conferees on this bill \ndecided to tack on a bill to grant normal trade relations status to the \nCommunist Laos People's Democratic Republic, one of the few remaining \nCommunist states on the Earth.\n  For many years, I have worked to shed light on the serious \nallegations of human rights violations in Laos, many involving the \nstatus of the Hmong ethnic minority. By attaching Laos NTR to this bill \nwithout any opportunity to debate it and to consider it on its merits, \nwe are missing an important opportunity to hold the Lao Government \naccountable. We are also missing an important opportunity to press the \nLao Government to allow credible international observers into Laos and \ninto the remote jungles where the Hmong ethnic minority live.\n  We should not be proceeding to this bill in its current form. The \nFinance Committee could have easily stripped the Laos NTR provisions \nfrom the conference report and passed a clean version of the \nmiscellaneous tariff bill. Then we could have had a real debate on Laos \nNTR at a more appropriate time.\n  I will have more to say on this matter after the cloture vote. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against cloture so that Laos NTR can be \nconsidered on its merits and not part of an omnibus trade package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, every year U.S. businesses lose several \nbillion dollars in revenues due to international theft of their \nproducts. Every time a book is photocopied without permission, a \nbootleg movie DVD is sold, or a piece of music is downloaded from the \nInternet, engineers, authors, musicians, actors, technicians, camera \ncrews, lighting crews, building owners, investors--indeed, everyone \ninvolved in the process--lose money. The United States has long been \nthe world leader in the creation of products protected by intellectual \nproperty. Almost every growing industry in the United States uses \nintellectual property laws as the single most important tool they have \nto ensure their companies will be viable and competitive in the world \nmarketplace. Millions of employees throughout the United States can \ndirectly or indirectly tie their jobs to companies who use intellectual \nproperty protections for their products.\n  Because intellectual property is so important to the U.S. economy, \nour Government has a long tradition of working hard with the \ninternational community to enforce the basic and fair rights \nestablished by intellectual property law. Enforcement of these rights \nin foreign countries is extremely important to the U.S. economy and so \nthe Congress has long provided Government officials with the direction \nand tools they need to pursue fair treatment of intellectual property \non an international basis.\n  Be it through the Trade Act of 1974 or through the WTO establishment \nof the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \nRights, TRIPS Agreement, the U.S. Government has been very active in \npursuing the protection of intellectual property that brings me to the \nbill at hand.\n  As passed by the Senate on March 4, 2004, H.R. 1047 contained five \nimportant measures that would have given the U.S. Government more tools \nin our effort to protect intellectual property around the world. \nSpecifically, the five intellectual property sections of H.R. 1047 \nwould provide the U.S. Trade Representative additional time to \nnegotiate and consult with countries prior to bringing a World Trade \nOrganization intellectual property dispute; it would have given \ncompanies and innovators the ability to request the U.S. Government \nsuspend certain trade benefits to Caribbean and Central American \ncountries who are not meeting their intellectual property commitments; \nand it would have standardized the criteria for adequate and effective \nprotection of intellectual property under several U.S. trade programs, \nthereby giving U.S. companies greater ability to protect their IP in \nseveral countries around the world.\n  Unfortunately, during the conference with the House, H.R. 1047 was \nstripped of four of the five IP protections I just outlined. This is of \ngreat concern to me. I fear the House conferees who were opposed to \nthese important IP measures are selling our economy short and \njeopardizing thousands of U.S. jobs. Failure to pass these important \nprotections diminishes the U.S. Government's ability to encourage \nforeign governments to crack down on intellectual property violations. \nIt is difficult to motivate foreign governments to seek out and \nprosecute those who steal the property of U.S. companies and sell it to \nconsumers at reduced prices. However, this language would have provided \nan extra incentive for foreign governments to prosecute intellectual \nproperty theft and, hopefully, would have led to billions of dollars of \nadditional U.S. exports across several industries.\n  Few U.S. industries enjoy a positive trade balance in the world \nmarketplace; however, those few U.S. industries which do enjoy large \npositive trade balances with other countries depend on strong, \ninternationally enforced intellectual property protections. It is \nbeyond me why anyone would want to make it more difficult for these \nindustries to enforce their property rights internationally. It is \nbeyond me why anyone would want to stand idly by and watch American \nemployees get ripped off by foreign companies.\n  Although this legislation was stripped of most of the intellectual \nproperty protections I worked so hard to include, I am supporting its \npassage because it provides tariff relief to many industries throughout \nthe country. Many of our Nation's largest manufacturers and employers \nin industries such as agriculture, textiles, chemicals, \npharmaceuticals, electronics, heavy equipment, and food and beverages \nall benefit greatly from the reduced tariffs provided by this \nlegislation.\n  In fact, several large employers in my home State of Utah will \nbenefit directly from this legislation. The reduced tariffs contained \nin this bill will provide these companies with the ability to compete \nfor effectively in the global marketplace, to sell more products and \nservices throughout the world, and create jobs in Utah. For these \nimportant reasons, I will support this legislation.\n  Although the Senate has not been able to take advantage of this \nopportunity to pass four very important intellectual property \nprovisions on the Miscellaneous Tariffs Bill, I am hopeful that we can \ncome together at the start of the 109th Congress and take up and pass \nthese important protections. Those industries which depend on IP \nprotections agree that we need them; the U.S. Trade Representative's \nOffice agrees that we need them; and I call on my Senate colleagues to \nwork with me next Congress to pass these important tools to help us \ncombat international IP theft.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11519-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11519-S11520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DUTY SUSPENSIONS FOR IMPORTED PRODUCTS\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleague about \nthe conference report to accompany H.R. 1047, the Miscellaneous Trade \nand\n\n[[Page S11520]]\n\nTechnical Corrections Act of 2004, which passed the Senate floor by \nunanimous consent earlier today. This legislation contains a number of \nduty suspensions for imported products. The duty suspensions help make \nAmerican industry competitive by allowing companies to reduce costs on \nneeded inputs. An important criterion for duty suspension is that the \nimported product cannot compete with a domestic product.\n  I am concerned that duty suspensions were included in the bill for \neight pigments that may compete directly with pigments produced in my \nState. If so, it could directly affect hundreds of workers in my State. \nThe provisions at issue are: Sections 1439, 1440, 1441, 1452, 1453, \n1454, 1455, and 1456.\n  I understand that the Department of Commerce has been contacted about \nthese provisions and is willing to review them to determine whether \nthey are appropriate for inclusion in this bill. Will the Senator work \nwith me to ensure that the Department of Commerce completes its \nanalysis?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate the Senator raising this issue with me. I \nam happy to work with the Senator from Kentucky and the Commerce \nDepartment to ensure that an appropriate and timely analysis is \ncompleted. I recognize that the duty suspensions in question take \neffect on January 1, 2005. If the results of this analysis demonstrate \nthat the inclusion of these provisions in H.R. 1047 was inappropriate, \nI will gladly work with him to try and rectify the situation at the \nearliest possible date.\n  Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Louisiana for \nher leadership on this issue and on the introduction of this resolution \nto recognize what we believe to be a very important month and a very \nimportant day for America, for America's children, and especially for \nthe foster care children of America.\n\n[[Page S11521]]\n\n  Tomorrow, November 20, is National Adoption Day. This month is \nNational Adoption Month. Over the years, as we have worked to bring \nthis to the attention of the American people and to people who would \nlike to form families through adoption, we find this tremendously \nimportant. More than 3,100 adoptions of children from foster care will \nbe finalized as a result of National Adoption Day. Of those who are in \nfoster care, some 129,000 children wait for adoption. Senator Landrieu \nand I, over the last good number of years, have worked almost nonstop \non this issue, not just for the foster care children of our country but \nfor all children of our country who are seeking a permanent, loving, \nsafe environment.\n  As a result of that effort, she and I and others on the House side \ntook the old congressional coalition on adoption and created the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption Institute. That institute is now \none of the sponsors of National Adoption Month and National Adoption \nDay.\n  These efforts on the part of all of us, we hope, continue to build \nthe kind of understanding and knowledge that is growing across \nAmerica--that you can form a family through adoption. Adoption is a \nphenomenally viable option for couples who may not be able to have \nchildren naturally or who wish to expand their families, simply because \nthey care so much about the future of children and who know that \nchildren who grow up in a safe, loving environment are going to be \nyoung people who become productive in our society instead of frustrated \nand oftentimes misguided in their adult efforts.\n  What I would like to do now is read the resolution and the \nPresident's Proclamation on National Adoption Month, because I think it \nspeaks to the kind of cooperative effort that the Congress, that Mary \nand I and a good many others in this Senate and the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption Institute have, with a lot of other alliances but \nvery importantly with the President and the executive branch of \nGovernment.\n  This is the 2004 Presidential Proclamation on National Adoption \nMonth, by the President of the United States:\n\n       By deciding to share their hearts and home with a child, \n     adoptive parents demonstrate great compassion and receive \n     many blessings in return. During National Adoption Month, we \n     recognize the generosity of adoptive and foster families who \n     are providing hope and love, and we encourage the adoption of \n     children of all ages.\n       In 2002, I signed the Promoting Safe and Stable Families \n     legislation that supports families and promotes adoption, and \n     last December I signed the Adoption Promotion Act of 2003 to \n     increase incentives to adopt older children. We have raised \n     the adoption tax credit to $10,000 per child and created the \n     AdoptUSKids website that has joined thousands of children \n     with adoptive parents. We are working hard to place more \n     children from foster care to permanent homes. This year, on \n     November 20, communities from all 50 States and the District \n     of Columbia will celebrate National Adoption Day by \n     finalizing the adoption of thousands of children by loving \n     families. And each one of those families will be enriched by \n     the addition of new members. By bringing care and hope into \n     other lives, individuals can fill their own lives with \n     greater purpose.\n       Now, therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United \n     States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by \n     the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby \n     proclaim November 2004 as National Adoption Month. I call on \n     all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs \n     and activities to honor adoptive families and to participate \n     in efforts to find permanent homes for waiting children.\n       In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth \n     day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, \n     and of the Independence of the United States of America the \n     two hundred and twenty-ninth.\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  That is what our President has said. He and this administration, as \nhave others, have worked very cooperatively with Senator Landrieu and \nme. Much of what we talk about and much of what the President talked \nabout were activities and efforts initiated right in the Senate--the \nchild tax credit and other efforts to facilitate and make easier for \nAmericans the ability to adopt children and bring them into their homes \nto create that loving environment that we talk about, that we know is \nso critically necessary in the lives of young people as they grow up.\n  So I am tremendously proud to join with my colleague, Mary Landrieu \nof Louisiana, as we work cooperatively together in the passage of this \nresolution and as we continue to work to foster the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption Institute, to grow it.\n  Let me close by asking all Senators to become an active member with \nus in the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, to participate \nin its activities and its purpose as we work to facilitate adoptions \nboth here in this country and around the world.\n  I thank my colleague from Louisiana, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to join my \ncolleague from Idaho. I have the opportunity this morning before this \nbody to thank him for his extraordinary leadership on this issue and \nhis tireless efforts. Despite all of the responsibilities he has as a \nleader of the majority party and all of the other issues that he leads, \nhe always finds time for this issue. It is not an issue that has a lot \nof paid lobbyists associated with it because this is a coalition that \nis actually advocating on behalf of orphans. His leadership is \nparticularly noted, and we are grateful for all the work that our \nSenators do for children, not only in our country but around the world.\n  While we do celebrate this month and recognize this month of November \nand mark this time noting our great progress and success, let me begin \nby saying, unfortunately, the number of orphans in the world is on the \nrise. Some experts predict an unprecedented number of orphans in the \nworld--really in numbers not ever known by the world before. We have \nhad world wars in the past that have caused the number of orphans to \nexpand greatly, but in the midst of this century and this time not only \ndo we have war and famine, but we have something the world has never \nseen before, and that is the epidemic of AIDS that is an orphan factory \nin Africa and India.\n  We come to the floor today to celebrate what successes we have \nachieved in the United States, and we will talk about those successes \nin a moment. The challenge is great. I look forward to working with \nSenator Craig and all Members of the Senate as we try to form a \nleadership team for the world to address this unprecedented number of \norphans.\n  If I could just say one more word about AIDS, sometimes children are \norphaned because a parent dies of heart disease or cancer, but those \ndiseases usually just affect one parent, not two. Because of the \nnature of AIDS and the way this disease is transmitted, it actually \nworks at killing parents in usually a quick amount of time, leaving \nchildren in the international community not single orphans but double \norphans. So that is quite a challenge to the world.\n\n  Let me switch to a happy note. In America last year 120,000 children \nfound loving and permanent homes, and approximately 12,000 of those \nchildren came from other countries to the United States to loving homes \nin all parts of our country; small towns in Idaho, very small towns in \nLouisiana, as well as to our larger metropolitan areas. And they were \nwelcomed, of course, with happiness and celebration and have become \nparts of families. I am proud to say that over 100,000 children were \nadopted, children from the United States to American families right \nhere at home out of foster care and, of course, infant adoptions as \nwell. That was terrific.\n  Two million children live in adoptive homes today in our country. \nMore extraordinary and more jolting and impressive is the fact that 6 \nout of every 10 Americans have been personally touched by adoption; \neither they themselves were adopted or they have adopted into their \nfamily or grandparents have received from their biological family \nadoptive grandchildren. The stories are endless and wonderful. We need \nto make sure this Government of ours is doing everything it can to \nconnect children who need families because governments do a great job \nat many things, but raising children is not one of them. Children need \nto be raised by parents, preferably two parents, but at least one \nloving adult that can raise that child to be a contributing member of \nour society.\n  Our future truly depends on it. We can have all the great tax \npolicies in the world, great health policies, great education policies, \nbut it is parent to child, that carries future values from\n\n[[Page S11522]]\n\none generation to the next. So making these connections is not only a \nfeel-good thing to do, it is a necessary thing to do for the \ncontinuation of our great Nation and the world community and family.\n  Let me share briefly about some of the children waiting in my State. \nThere are 500,000 children in foster care in the United States today. \nThat is tragic. It is tragic and good and I will explain. It is tragic \nbecause children have been separated from their parents. Sometimes we \ncould have done a better job of preventing that had we given more drug \ncounseling on substance abuse or stronger educational benefits or job \nopportunities to those parents. On the positive side, sometimes \nchildren have to be separated from their families because, if not, they \nmay literally die at the hands of parents who are not in their right \nmind and spirit. These children can sometimes be in danger.\n  While we try to protect, promote and develop a better system, the \nfact is, 500,000 children are in foster care, anywhere from the age of \n1 month up to 21 years old.\n  These are pictures of some of the children in my State. There are \nmany more. Some are young teens, children who are perfectly healthy, \nsibling groups. Cynthia is a beautiful child. She was born with \ncerebral palsy and needs special care and attention. This is a story of \none child who gives everyone great inspiration. Children like this with \nthe right love and attention can grow up to be Presidents, mayors of \ngreat cities, professors at our great universities. They just need \nlove, attention, and care. That is what National Adoption Month is all \nabout.\n  Let me in my brief time share a story about an extraordinary young \nwoman who came out of an orphanage. I will tell the story and then show \nthe picture because you will not believe it when I show the picture. I \nwant to tell a story that Senator Craig and I know about that has \ntouched our hearts that we want to share with you today.\n  A young girl, about 9 years ago, was left in an orphanage in Russia. \nWe do not know too much about the circumstances, but what we know is \nshe was severely disabled when she was born. She had spina bifida. She \nhad a hole in her spine. In some places in the world, children born \nwith disabilities are basically just left to die--even with \ndisabilities that we have come to know in America can be fixed and \ncorrected with good health care. But there are truly dying rooms around \nthe world where infants and young children are born and left to die. \nThey are not fed, they are not taken care of because there is no \nmedicine, no doctors, and nobody can do anything, so they make a tough \njudgment: to feed the healthy children and leave the sick children to \ndie.\n  This little girl was left in a dying room. But she would not die, \nbasically. After 6 years of living, with very little support, a woman \nwe know well showed up in one of our adoption agencies and was trying \nto find children in this orphanage to be adopted. She came across this \nchild who was on the floor because she could not walk. She had no \nwheelchair but she crawled up and touched her jacket. She looked down \nat this child's eyes and saw something that obviously no one else had \nseen and decided to adopt this child. The orphanage kept saying: We \ndon't want you to have this child; we want you to have a ``good'' \nchild.\n  She kept saying: This is the child I want. I want this child with a \nhole in her back, the strong and beautiful little girl.\n  The long and short of the story is, this woman scoops this child up, \nbrings the child to America, adopts this child as her daughter, and her \nname is Tatiana McFadden.\n  I want to show a picture of Tatiana, but no one is going to believe \nthe end of this story. Tatiana represented the United States of America \nin the Para-Olympics in Greece this year and won the silver medal for \nour country, for America.\n  This is a picture of Tatiana, who is now 16 or 17 years old, one of \nthe strongest, most courageous, bravest human beings I have ever met. \nShe proudly carried the American flag over that finish line and won the \nsilver medal in the Para-Olympics.\n  Senator Craig, my good friend from Idaho, and I hoped she would be \nour special guest at Angels in Adoption, but she was actually winning \nthe medal as our event was taking place.\n  In honor of Tatiana McFadden, I wanted to speak for her and for the \nchildren she represents in America and around the world. This is \nTatiana, receiving on our behalf, for the United States of America, the \nsilver medal. She represents everything that Senator Craig and I want \nto share today about National Adoption Month.\n  There are many orphans waiting. They are not damaged goods. These are \nchildren who, through no fault of their own, have been separated from \ntheir parents for a variety of different reasons. They need and want \nfamilies. They have a lot to offer not only to themselves but to their \ncountries and their families.\n  We hope in November, as we gather around our Thanksgiving table, and \nas our Nation gathers and spends time on its knees thanking God for our \nmany blessings which we have, remembering our blessings from the early \nfounding of this country. As we gather around our tables and hold the \nhands of our children, let's think about the children who do not have \nparents and what we can do.\n  Every Senator can most certainly do something. Many Senators and \nHouse Members are doing a great deal.\n  My colleagues have been very gracious with this time, but I close by \nsaying that tomorrow, on Saturday, many of our colleagues, House and \nSenate Members, will be participating at their courthouses all over \nAmerica. We are happy to say that we will have 4,000 children adopted \ntomorrow, on National Adoption Day, an effort started by one judge, \nJudge Nash in Los Angeles, CA, who started this to call attention to \nchildren like Tatiana. All they need is someone to pick them up, hold \nthem, love them. Basically the spirit that God has put in them will do \nthe rest. That is what this month is about.\n  I thank my colleague for offering this resolution. I thank the \nSenators in the midst of their busy work schedule for pushing this \nresolution through. I thank the President for his great support and \nacknowledge President Clinton and First Lady Clinton's effort, now \nSenator Clinton, and President Bush and Mrs. Bush, for their good \nleadership on this issue--not just in America, as my colleague knows, \nbut as President Bush advocates these policies around the world.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider by laid upon \nthe table, and any statements related thereto be printed in the Record \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 474) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 474\n\n       Whereas there are approximately 532,000 children in the \n     foster care system in the United States, approximately \n     129,000 of whom are waiting to be adopted;\n       Whereas the average length of time a child in foster care \n     remains in foster care is almost 3 years;\n       Whereas for many foster children, the wait for a loving \n     family in which they are nurtured, comforted, and protected \n     is endless;\n       Whereas every year 25,000 children ``age out'' of foster \n     care by reaching adulthood without being placed in a \n     permanent home;\n       Whereas, since 1987, the number of annual adoptions has \n     ranged from 118,000 to 127,000;\n       Whereas approximately 2,100,000 children in the United \n     States live with adoptive parents;\n       Whereas approximately 6 of every 10 Americans have been \n     touched personally by adoption in that they, a family member, \n     or a close friend was adopted, has adopted a child, or has \n     placed a child for adoption;\n       Whereas every day loving and nurturing families are formed \n     when committed and dedicated individuals make an important \n     difference in the life of a child through adoption;\n       Whereas, on November 20, 2004, communities from all 50 \n     States and the District of Columbia will celebrate National \n     Adoption Day by finalizing the adoption of thousands of \n     children by loving families; and\n       Whereas on November 4, 2004, the President proclaimed \n     November 2004 as National Adoption Month: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes November 2004 as \n     National Adoption Month.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S11523]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the President.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I will \nnot object to these remarks, but subsequent to that we will begin the \npostcloture discussion of the issue before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I commend my colleagues from Louisiana and \nIdaho. It was a very touching story of the Senator from Louisiana which \nhighlights the importance of adoption month. This is a wonderful effort \nthat my two colleagues have launched. We are pleased to support them \nand the President's efforts and all those wonderful people who take \nadopted children into their home.\n\n       (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of \n     S. 3009 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \n     Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11523-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11523-S11533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MISCELLANEOUS TRADE AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I want to speak on the miscellaneous \ntariffs bill.\n  Last spring, Senator Feingold and I sent a letter to the minority \nleader making it clear we would object to taking up S. 2200, a bill \ngranting NTR status to Laos because of the human rights situation \nthere. At the time we said:\n\n       Reports emerging from Laos remain disturbing. Journalists, \n     human rights groups, and many of our constituents inform us \n     that the Laos government continues to be responsible for \n     serious human rights violations, and that conditions are \n     particularly difficult for the Hmong ethnic group.\n\n  The situation in Laos has not changed, and, in fact, over the last \nseveral months more disturbing evidence has emerged that now is not the \ntime for us to appear to be rewarding one of the most closed and \nrepressive regimes. For the first time, we have independent \ncorroboration of the types of charges which have been made by many \nHmong residents of my State for years and by others who have fled Laos \nmore recently.\n  On September 13, 2004, Amnesty International issued a report entitled \n``Military Atrocities Against Hmong Children Are War Crimes.'' The \nreport, which I will read from momentarily, details horrific crimes \ncommitted in May of this year reportedly by Laos soldiers. These crimes \nwere captured on a graphic videotape smuggled out this summer and which \nI understand the State Department has taken very seriously, and they \nwere also described by witness testimony.\n  The attack took place against a group of children, five of whom were \nkilled, in a remote area of the country, and was described by Amnesty \nInternational as follows:\n\n       The 5 children, between 13 and 16 years old and part of an \n     ethnic Hmong rebel group, were brutally mutilated--the girls \n     apparently raped before being killed--by a group of \n     approximately 30-40 soldiers. The victims--four girls, Mao \n     Lee, 14; her sister Chao Lee, 16; Chi Her, 14; Pang Lor, 14; \n     and Tou Lor, Pang Lor's 15 year old brother--were killed \n     whilst foraging for food close to their camp. They were \n     unarmed.\n       A witness, who has subsequently fled the country and been \n     recognized as a refugee by the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees, reported hearing one of the \n     soldiers saying: ``Hmong. Your mouth allows you to speak. \n     Your vagina allows you to breed''.\n       He then heard moans and a gunshot.\n       A 14-year-old girl was shot in each breast and the other \n     bodies were mutilated by what appears to be high-powered \n     rifle shots fired at close range. One of the girls was \n     disemboweled.\n       Several other members of the group were seriously injured \n     with gun shot wounds but managed to return to their \n     encampment. The rebels have little if any medicine and rely \n     on traditional treatments using plants found in the forest.\n\n  It is my understanding that in the last several weeks, our State \nDepartment has delivered a demarche to the Lao Government, calling for \nthorough investigation of these atrocities which happened in May--an \ninvestigation that is credible and that would withstand scrutiny by the \ninternational community. To date, there has been no such investigation \nand the soldiers involved with these war crimes have not been held \naccountable.\n  Also this year, came startling and deeply upsetting reports. Hundreds \nof former Hmong-Lao insurgents--many of whom courageously helped our \nmilitary during the Vietnam War--and their families emerged from the \njungles in Laos only to be captured by the Lao military and mistreated, \nand as some allege, killed.\n  The emerging Hmong-Lao were under the impression that there was an \namnesty program organized by the Laotian government, but there was much \nconfusion about this program. The Lao government has officially denied \nthere was such a program, they have refused to provide our Government \nwith any details of this mass surrender of ethnic Hmong and their \nfamilies, and they would not accept humanitarian assistance for the \nsudden influx of people seeking assistance.\n  In response to these reports, Senator Feingold and I, along with \nothers, sent a letter to Ambassador Negroponte asking for his \nassistance in urging the United Nations to send a high level UN \nrepresentative or fact finding mission to Laos to monitor the treatment \nof the Hmong. I also raised the issue with Secretary Powell when he \ncame to testify before the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations \nSubcommittee. Secretary Powell expressed concerns about the reports \ncoming out of Laos. He agreed that there is a need for greater access \nand that more needs to be done to secure the safety of the Hmong. And, \nwhile Laos hasn't exactly been on the front burner, this spring the \nSecretary raised the issue of the Hmong in Laos with UN Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan, and he wrote to the Lao Foreign Minister to express \nconcerns about the reports related to the supposed amnesty.\n  It is my understanding that there has been no reply to Secretary \nPowell's letter.\n  So, here we are today offering a carrot to a government that has \nessentially stonewalled our Secretary of State and has restricted \naccess to independent international monitors, leaving us with no way to \ninvestigate the many reports coming from Laos.\n  I am aware that there are supporters of Laos who have raised \nquestions about the veracity of reports of human rights violations \nagainst the Hmong. Because of restrictions put in place by the Lao \ngovernment that deny policymakers, journalists, and humanitarian groups \naccess to the situation on the ground, it is very difficult to confirm \nthese reports one way or the other. More significantly, it is virtually \nimpossible to ensure that these individuals are being treated fairly \nand humanely. That is why it is essential for us to keep the pressure \non the Lao government to push for international access. Such access \nwould be crucial in determining the facts surrounding the treatment of \nthe Hmong and would allow us to ensure that they are not being \nmistreated.\n  The sad fate of the Hmong in Laos has been exacerbated by their role \nin helping the United States during the Vietnam war. By 1963, as many \nas 20,000 Hmong fighters were trained and armed by the Central \nIntelligence Agency to fight against the North Vietnamese Army and \nPathet Lao forces as part of the so-called ``secret war in Laos.'' Some \nreports put the number of fighters as high as 40,000 in 1969. The Hmong \nsustained heavy casualties during those years, working in coordination \nwith the CIA. The impact on the Hmong community extended beyond the \nactual fighters: Family members lived under terrible conditions, \nthroughout this period, unable to farm because they were constantly \nmoving to keep one step ahead of the Communists. Since they were never \nin one place long enough to harvest, they had to eat leaves, wild \nfruit, tree bark, and whatever else they could find in the jungle. The \nUnited States is indebted to these former Hmong insurgents who rescued \ndowned American pilots and disrupted North Vietnamese supply lines--\nunder the most difficult circumstances. We cannot forget these \ncourageous individuals and their families.\n  In the years since the end of the Vietnam war, thousands of Hmong\n\n[[Page S11524]]\n\nhave fled to Thailand, living a life of separation from their homeland \nand ongoing transition. Hmong have come to the United States, \nresettling in California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and \nRhode Island. My State of Wisconsin is the home to 33,000 former Hmong \nrefugees, many of whom are concerned about the status of their family \nand friends in Laos. And, last December, the U.S. Government decided to \nadmit 15,000 Hmong-Lao refugees who were living in Thailand. These \nrefugees began to arrive in June and they will continue to arrive \nthrough the end of the year.\n  Estimates are that there are as many as 17,000 Hmong still live in \nthe jungles of Laos. According to the Associated Press, about 20 Hmong \ncommunities are currently involved in low level combat against the Lao \ncommunist government, which came to power in 1975 at the end of the \nVietnam War. Most recently, there are reports that as many as two \nthousand Hmong have been under attack in remote regions of Laos by Lao \nforces using grenades, machine guns, and mortars. The scattered reports \nwe receive are from those who manage to escape the area, those who call \nout on satellite phones, and the few reporters who venture onto the \ndangerous terrain.\n  In October 2003, Amnesty International issued a report which stated \nthat the Lao government is using starvation as a ``weapon of war \nagainst civilians''--a clear violation of the Geneva Conventions, which \nLaos has ratified. The report indicated that the Lao military had \nsurrounded several rebel groups and their families, including \ncivilians, and was preventing them from foraging for food they need to \nsurvive. At that time, Amnesty stated that it was greatly concerned \n``by the sharply deteriorating situation of thousands of family members \nof ethnic minority groups, predominantly Hmong, involved in an armed \nconflict with the Lao military in jungle areas of the country.'' \nArticles in Time Asia in spring 2003 underscored these charges, stating \nthat the Lao government had hunted down and surrounded ``this dwindling \ngroup of outcasts.'' The pictures accompanying this and other pieces in \nTime have shown the Hmong in the jungle living in deplorable \nconditions.\n  Beyond its treatment of the Hmong, the Lao government also has a \nhistory of particularly severe violations of religious freedom which \nhave been documented by the U.S. Commission on International Religious \nFreedom in a report submitted to Congress last March. The Commission \nhas designated Laos as a ``country of particular concern'' and has said \nthat ``U.S attention to Laos at this time may advance protections for \nreligious freedom and promote U.S. interests.''\n  I am sure that granting NTR was not the kind of attention the \nCommission had in mind.\n  To quote from their report:\n\n       . . . there has been extensive government interference with \n     and restrictions on all religious communities. In more recent \n     years, the government has focused its repression on religions \n     that are relatively new to Laos, including Protestant \n     Christianity . . . [Violations] include the arrest, prolonged \n     detention, and imprisonment of members of religious \n     minorities on account of their religious activities. . . . \n     Lao officials have forced Christians to renounce their faith \n     . . . dozens of churches have been closed.\n\n  This persecution of religious minorities has extended to U.S. \ncitizens as well. In June of this year, the Laotian Government \narrested, imprisoned, tried, convicted, and sentenced to 15 years in \nprison a Lutheran minister, a U.S. citizen, from St. Paul, MN. While in \ncaptivity, he was denied consular access for over a week and was \nsubjected to a so-called trial before the Laotian judiciary system. \nAlthough he was released after a month, Laotian Christians have not \nbeen so lucky. Some Christian pastors say leaders have remained \nimprisoned for years. As long as there is no pressure on the Lao \nGovernment, we can expect the status quo to continue.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues on the Finance Committee, I \nhave to say they have been surprisingly eager to grant NTR status to \nLaos. They have been so focused on taking this step in the context of \ncleaning up our trade laws and eliminating the distinction between \nthose nations which have NTR status and those that do not have NTR \nstatus that they have forgotten that this is not happening in a vacuum. \nWhether we intend to or not, we are sending a strong signal to the Lao \nGovernment, and that signal is that they can act with impunity.\n  I recognize there is strong support for the miscellaneous tariff bill \nthat has nothing to do with Laos NTR, and that many of my colleagues \nare not casting this vote with Laos in mind. For many years, I have \nworked with others, including my colleague, Senator Feingold, to shed \nmore light on the condition of the Hmong in Laos and to assure their \nsafety, and I did guarantee I will continue to do so.\n  Madam President, I commend to my colleagues a report on the CIA Web \nsite entitled ``Supporting the `Secret War': CIA Air Operations in \nLaos, 1955 to 1974.'' The report is by a historian at the University of \nGeorgia.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a report from \nTime magazine of May 5, 2003, entitled ``Welcome to the Jungle,'' which \ndetails the deplorable conditions of the Hmong in the jungle in Laos. \nAs one of the Hmong said, ``We shed blood with the U.S . . . they \nshould remember us.'' Also, a report dated September 13, 2004, from \nAmnesty International entitled ``Laos: Military Atrocities Against \nHmong Children Are War Crimes.'' Then a letter from the United States \nCommission on International Religious Freedom.\n  And a letter dated March 15, 2004, to the U.S. Ambassador to the \nU.N., John Negroponte, signed by members of the Wisconsin, California, \nand Minnesota delegations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Time Magazine, May, 2003]\n\n                         Welcome To The Jungle\n\n                           (By Andrew Perrin)\n\n       There were hundreds of them, perhaps a thousand. They wept \n     and knelt before me on the ground, crying, ``Please help us, \n     the communists are coming.'' I had hiked four days to reach \n     this forsaken place deep in the jungles of Xaysomboune, \n     northern Laos. The Hmong rebels prostrate before me were \n     convinced they would all soon die. They knew they were a \n     forgotten tribe, crushed by a military campaign that is \n     denied by the communist leaders of their small, sheltered \n     nation.\n       In all my years as a journalist I had never seen anything \n     like this: a ragtag army with wailing families in tow, \n     beseeching me to take news of their plight to the outside \n     world. I walked among starving children, their tiny frames \n     scarred by mortar shrapnel. Young men, toting rifles and with \n     dull-eyed infants strapped to their backs, ripped open their \n     shirts to show me their wounds. An old man grabbed my hand \n     and guided it over the contours of shrapnel buried in his \n     gut. A teenage girl, no more than 15, whimpered at my feet, \n     pawed at my legs and cried, ``They've killed my husband. \n     They've killed my mother, my father, my brother . . .'' But \n     before she could finish, others were pushing her aside to sob \n     out their own litanies of loss. In this heart of darkness, \n     nobody has a monopoly on grief.\n       Now, for the first time in nearly three decades, this \n     dwindling group of outcasts are completely surrounded by the \n     Lao government troops that hunt them. They are trapped in a \n     narrow swath of jungle, with all avenues of escape blocked by \n     either soldiers or antipersonnel mines. ``This time,'' says \n     Moua Toua Ther, 46, the one-armed leader of the camp and \n     commander of its pitifully equipped fighting force, ``we will \n     not be able to run or hide. When the helicopters come we will \n     be butchered like wild animals.''\n       What is the crime this ragged bunch has committed? It is \n     simply that they are Hmong, mostly the children, \n     grandchildren or even great-grandchildren of fighters who in \n     the 1960s sided with the U.S. to fight communism in Laos \n     during the Vietnam War. Fabled for their resourcefulness and \n     valor, many Hmong became members of a secret CIA-backed \n     militia that helped rescue downed U.S. pilots and disrupted \n     North Vietnamese supplies and troop movements along the Ho \n     Chi Minh Trail through central Laos. The communist Pathet Lao \n     movement--and its patrons in Hanoi--has never forgotten the \n     Hmong's complicity with the Americans. Shortly after the \n     Pathet Lao took power in 1975--two years after the U.S. had \n     fled the country and left the Hmong soldiers to their fate--a \n     communist newspaper declared the Party would hunt down the \n     ``American collaborators'' and their families ``to the last \n     root.'' But until Time recently reached one of the last Hmong \n     outposts, no one truly believed that, after 28 years, the Lao \n     government still meant it. This, then, is the final act of a \n     war that, according to history books, ended in 1973.\n       The Hmong, who migrated to Laos from southwestern China in \n     the 19th century, have always been a proud, warlike people. \n     In the 1920s a Hmong rebellion against their French rulers \n     erupted in much of Laos and northern Vietnam, ultimately \n     failing but leaving thousands dead. When the French left Laos\n\n[[Page S11525]]\n\n     in 1953, the Hmong found themselves fighting again--this \n     time against the threat of communism. Among the resisters \n     was a young Hmong general named Vang Pao, who in 1961 was \n     commissioned by the CIA to set up a secret army to fight \n     the advancing communists. Over the next decade nearly half \n     of the 40,000 Hmong fighters in Vang Pao's army are \n     thought to have perished during the fighting. The reward \n     for their sacrifice? The Paris cease-fire agreement of \n     1973, which signaled an end of U.S. aid. Vang fought on \n     for two more years, but when it became clear that the \n     Pathet Lao would win he fled to Thailand and then to the \n     U.S. Today, some 200,000 other Hmong live in exile \n     communities in the U.S. But not all Hmong made it to \n     America: 15,000 of Vang's brethren were cut off from \n     escape and were forced to melt away into the mountainous \n     jungles of Laos.\n       Even from California, where he leads the United Lao \n     Liberation Front (ULLF), Vang, 74, casts a long shadow over \n     his people. Moua says he reports directly to Vang--a claim \n     the Californian denies, though he does admit to providing \n     occasional help. From his suburban American home, the exiled \n     general demands democracy and a reinstatement of the monarchy \n     in Laos. Moua and his militia are among the remnants of Hmong \n     rebel groups fighting for that disappearing dream.\n       Moua joined Vang's secret army at age 15. His left arm ends \n     in a stump-his hand was removed in a 1974 jungle amputation. \n     One of only four people in the village with some writing \n     skills, he is a meticulous keeper of village statistics--\n     there are 56 orphaned children, 40 widows and 11 widowers. By \n     Moua's count, 30% of the villagers have shrapnel wounds. In \n     1975, when Vang fled Laos, Moua recorded his group at 7,000 \n     people. Today there are only about 800 left.\n       Although the Hmong have been on the run for nearly three \n     decades, Moua and others in his village regard the past year \n     as the worst. In October, they say, some 500 ground troops \n     attacked them from four directions in Xaysomboune while a \n     gunship strafed them from above. In all, 216 Hmong were \n     killed. Such assaults can come at any time. Last August, a \n     mortar round landed less than a meter from nine-year-old Yeng \n     Houa's family dinner table, killing both his parents. Yeng \n     survived; but I count 18 shrapnel scars on his legs, his jaw \n     is broken and there is an infected sore on his inner thigh. \n     Since the attack, he has not spoken.\n       The Hmong say they are too ill-equipped to strike back. \n     Most of their fighters are armed with ancient M-16s and AK-\n     47s, and the heaviest weapons at their disposal are two \n     geriatric M-79 grenade launchers. Ammunition is mostly dug up \n     from former U.S. air bases. According to Moua, only a third \n     of the rounds are actually live, negating Hmong chances of \n     launching a viable offensive. As for the Lao government, \n     which declined to talk to Time, it denies allegations that it \n     is decimating Hmong rebels and blames them for much of the \n     unrest in the country. It insists that Hmong are doubling as \n     bandits. In February an ambush on a bus traveling the busy \n     Highway 13 in the north left 12 people dead, including two \n     Swiss cyclists. A calling card pinned to one of the corpses \n     indicated the deaths were the work of Hmong rebels. And on \n     April 20, gunmen opened fire on a passenger bus, killing at \n     least 13 people. Eyewitnesses to this massacre say the gunmen \n     spoke to one another in the Hmong language. Vang Pao angrily \n     denies claims that his men are responsible for attacks on \n     civilians. ``In the past there have been several events like \n     this that have taken place and been blamed on the ULLF,'' he \n     says. ``But it was not us. We believe it was organized by the \n     government using Hmong people who serve in the Lao army.'' \n     For his part, Moua portrays the Hmong as helpless innocents. \n     ``We only defend and run,'' he says. ``If the Lao troops \n     launch an assault, our ammo won't even last an hour.''\n       Back in the mountains of Xaysomboune, Moua and his comrades \n     sleep uneasily on beds of leaves inside banana-leaf huts. \n     Most cannot recall how many times they've relocated, but they \n     remember the people they've lost Bhun Si, 42, says his wife \n     and two sons were taken from him last October. His friend \n     Soum Sai saw everything: the government troops came in, he \n     says, and shot women and children from a distance of just \n     five meters. Today, Bhun looks barely alive himself. Only two \n     fingers remain on his left hand--he lost the others in a B-41 \n     rocket attack that killed six of his fellow Hmong. His leg \n     still bleeds from a suppurating shrapnel wound he received 13 \n     years ago. One side of his face is a mask of melted flesh, \n     with black sockets where an ear and an eye should be. \n     ``Everybody is dead,'' he says. ``Sixteen people in my family \n     are dead, all killed by the communists.'' In a heartbreaking \n     refrain I heard repeatedly during my stay in the camp, he \n     adds, ``America must save us.''\n       Commander Moua, too, wonders where his erstwhile American \n     allies have gone. ``We shed blood with the U.S.,'' he says. \n     ``They should remember this. They should find us a land where \n     we're safe and have food to eat.'' But as the world has \n     watched in awe of the might of the U.S. war machine in Iraq, \n     the final scenes of a 30-year-old war in Indochina that \n     America would rather forget are destined to play out \n     unnoticed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From Amnesty International, Sept. 13, 2004]\n\n    Laos: Military Atrocities Against Hmong Children Are War Crimes\n\n       Amnesty International is horrified by recent reports, \n     including video evidence and witness testimony, of an attack \n     by Lao soldiers against a group of five children, four of \n     them girls, in the Xaisomboune military zone on 19 May 2004.\n       The children, aged between 13 and 16 years old and part of \n     an ethnic Hmong rebel group, were brutally mutilated--the \n     girls apparently raped before being killed--by a group of \n     approximately 30-40 soldiers. The victims--four girls, Mao \n     Lee, 14; her sister Chao Lee, 16; Chi Her, 14; Pang Lor, 14; \n     and Tou Lor, Pang Lor's 15 year old brother--were killed \n     whilst foraging for food close to their camp. They were \n     unarmed.\n       The attacks violate the most fundamental principles of \n     international human rights and humanitarian law. These rapes \n     and killings constitute war crimes. The Lao authorities must \n     bring to justice those responsible for this atrocity and \n     cease attacks on unarmed civilians.\n       A witness, who has subsequently fled the country and been \n     recognized as a refugee by the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees, reported hearing one of the \n     soldiers saying: ``Meo (Hmong). Your kael ni (mouth) allows \n     you to speak. Your hin (vagina) allows you to breed''.\n       He then heard moans and a gunshot.\n       Mao Lee was shot in each breast and the other bodies were \n     mutilated by what appears to be high-powered rifle shots \n     fired at close range. One of the girls was disembowelled.\n       Several other members of the group were seriously injured \n     with gun shot wounds but managed to return to their \n     encampment.\n       The rebels have little if any medicine and rely on \n     traditional treatments using plants found in the forest.\n       The Lao authorities must, as a matter of utmost urgency, \n     permit UN agencies and independent monitors unfettered access \n     to those rebels who are recently reported to have \n     `surrendered'. They must also permit humanitarian agencies to \n     provide medical and food assistance to those injured as a \n     result of this and other military actions against the rebels.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       The Hmong ethnic minority group in Laos was allied to the \n     US during the Viet Nam war and its spill-over fighting in \n     both Laos and Cambodia. The Hmong people have a long history \n     of resistance and aspirations of independence from Lao \n     government control. Following the creation of the Lao \n     People's Democratic Republic in 1975 and the fall of the \n     former regime, as many as a third of the Hmong ethnic \n     minority are believed to have fled the country. Most of these \n     refugees resettled in the USA, but a large number spent many \n     years in refugee camps in Thailand.\n       Sporadic military resistance to the government has \n     continued among some ethnic groups, predominantly Hmong. \n     There are also continuing allegations of serious human rights \n     abuses against those Hmong perceived as still being opposed \n     to the Lao government.\n       There have been increasing concerns over the last two years \n     at an apparent increase in Lao government military activity \n     against rebel groups, who along with armed adult men also \n     comprise a large number of women, children, elderly and sick. \n     The upsurge in military activity followed increasing \n     international concern at the situation, which was triggered \n     by a number of journalists visiting rebel groups and \n     reporting their plight.\n       Credible sources have reported the deaths of scores of \n     civilians, mainly children, from starvation and injuries \n     sustained during the conflict. It is known that several of \n     approximately 20 rebel groups with their families are \n     surrounded by Lao military and prevented from foraging for \n     food that they traditionally rely on to survive. Amnesty \n     International has protested to the Lao authorities at what it \n     believes is the use of starvation as a weapon of war against \n     civilians.\n       Several hundred ethnic Hmong rebels are reported to have \n     `surrendered' to the Lao authorities in recent months. UN \n     agencies, diplomats and journalists have not been given \n     access to these people and Amnesty International has received \n     conflicting reports as to their reception and treatment by \n     the authorities.\n       Amnesty International has also repeatedly condemned \n     indiscriminate attacks by armed opposition groups that have \n     reportedly killed and injured civilians in Laos. Amnesty \n     International unequivocally condemns these acts and has and \n     will continue to call upon the perpetrators to cease all \n     activities that are in violation of human rights and \n     international humanitarian law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       United States Commission on\n\n\n                              International Religious Freedom,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2003.\n     Senator Herb Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: On behalf of the U.S. Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom, I am pleased to enclose the \n     Commission's 2003 report and policy recommendations on Laos. \n     The Commission is charged with reviewing the facts and \n     circumstances of violations of international religious \n     freedom. By law, a key function of the Commission is to \n     submit to the President, Secretary of State, and Congress its \n     findings and recommendations for U.S. policies with respect \n     to foreign governments engaging in or tolerating violations \n     of religious freedom.\n       In its most recent report, the U.S. Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom determines that the \n     government of Laos has been engaged in particularly severe \n     violations of religious freedom, as defined in the\n\n[[Page S11526]]\n\n     International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (IRFA). These \n     violations include the arrest, prolonged detention, and \n     imprisonment of members of religious minorities on account of \n     their religious activities.\n       The Commission draws attention to abuses including arrests, \n     prolonged detention and imprisonment of members of minority \n     religions, forced renunciations of faith of Christians, and \n     extensive governmental interference with and restrictions on \n     all religious communities, including Evangelical Christians, \n     Roman Catholics, Baha'is and Buddhists. In July 2002, the Lao \n     government promulgated a new decree on religious affairs that \n     provides a legal basis for control of and interference with \n     religious activities by government officials.\n       Lao officials perceive the United States to be influential \n     in the provision of international aid for Laos' development \n     and some have thus demonstrated a willingness to address U.S. \n     concerns, including human rights concerns raised by the \n     Commission, the State Department, and non-governmental \n     organizations. The United States has a unique opportunity to \n     engage the government and people of Laos in a process of \n     reform that would end the suppression of religious freedom \n     and other related human rights, and relatively small measures \n     of attention and assistance could accomplish a great deal.\n       Therefore, the Commission makes the following \n     recommendations to the President, Secretary of State, and \n     Congress:\n       1. President Bush should designate Laos as a ``country of \n     particular concern'' to make clear U.S. concerns over \n     particularly severe violations of religious freedom in Laos, \n     thus engaging the U.S. government in a process to promote \n     changes that would advance legal as well as practical \n     protections of freedom of religion and related human rights \n     in that country.\n       2. The U.S. government should urge the government of Laos \n     to take specific steps to improve respect for religious \n     freedom, including the possible establishment of a bilateral \n     human rights dialogue that would also address the broader \n     range of human rights concerns such as torture and other \n     forms of ill-treatment.\n       3. The U.S. government should provide assistance to Laos to \n     take genuine steps to reform its practices, policies, laws, \n     and regulations that contribute to religious freedom \n     violations.\n       The report, as well as information about the Commission, \n     can be found on our Web site at www.useirf.gov. For further \n     information, please contact the Commission at (202) 523-3240.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Felice D. Gaer,\n      Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2004.\n     Ambassador John D. Negroponte,\n     U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, United States Mission \n         to the United Nations, New York, NY.\n       Dear Ambassador Negroponte: We are writing to ask for your \n     assistance in urging the United Nations to send a UN \n     representative or fact-finding mission to Laos to monitor the \n     treatment of hundreds of Hmong-Lao, many of whom are former \n     insurgents and their families, who have recently emerged from \n     the jungles of Laos. A high-level UN presence is essential in \n     securing the safety of these individuals, as well as in \n     providing greater transparency regarding Lao governmental \n     actions to the international community.\n       Over the past several weeks, hundreds of Hmong-Lao and \n     their families have left the jungles of Laos. Many of these \n     former insurgents fought with the Central Intelligence Agency \n     during the Vietnam War to rescue downed American pilots, to \n     thwart supply lines along the Ho Chi Minh trail and to hold \n     off North Vietnamese troops. When the Vietnam War ended and \n     the communist Pathet Lao took over the government, thousands \n     of Hmong were killed and sent to reeducation camps. Most \n     Hmong fled Laos or hid in the jungles of Laos, fearing far \n     their lives. Some estimate that as many as 17,000 Hmong have \n     been living in the jungles since 1975. The United States \n     remains indebted to these courageous individuals and their \n     families.\n       The U.S. government claims that these individuals have \n     surrendered to the Lao government and are participating in an \n     unofficial and ``unstated'' amnesty program organized by the \n     government of Laos. Yet, our offices have heard contradictory \n     information. Reports indicate that the Laotian government \n     denies the existence of any amnesty program for these \n     individuals. In addition, many of our constituents claim that \n     these former insurgents have been captured by the Lao \n     military and did not surrender. Our constituents fear that \n     these people are in serious danger and allege that many have \n     already been killed, including women and children. Amnesty \n     International in a report on March 4, 2004 states, ``Amnesty \n     International has received conflicting reports as to their \n     [the Hmong's] reception and treatment by Lao authorities.''\n       The restrictions imposed by the Lao government on \n     international access have prevented policymakers, journalists \n     and humanitarian groups from knowing the reality on the \n     ground and understanding the needs. The United Nations can \n     play a crucial role in shedding light on the situation. We \n     ask you, therefore, to urge the United Nations to send a UN \n     representative or fact-finding mission to ensure that these \n     former insurgents are treated humanely and that the Lao \n     government respects its obligations under international law.\n       We thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Russ Feingold, U.S. Senator; Herb Kohl, U.S. Senator; \n           Barbara Boxer, U.S. Senator; Mark Dayton, U.S. Senator; \n           Dianne Feinstein, U.S. Senator; Ron Kind, U.S. \n           Representative; Mark Green, U.S. Representative; Devin \n           Nunes, U.S. Representative; George Radanovich, U.S. \n           Representative; Dana Rohrabacher, U.S. Representative.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to efforts to push through a provision normalizing trade \nrelations with Laos.\n  First, let me thank my senior colleague, Senator Kohl. I enjoy \nworking with him on so many issues, from our dairy industry in \nWisconsin, to our excellent National Guard. But I am particularly proud \nhe and I have been able to cooperate and work so hard with regard to \nthe Hmong people living in Wisconsin and the concerns they have \nregarding issues not only concerning their own lives in Wisconsin but \nalso the issues involving their families and their relatives in places \nsuch as Laos. I thank the Senator for all the work we have done \ntogether on this issue, and we will continue this battle to make sure \nthere is accountability with regard to the human rights record of the \nGovernment of Laos, which is not a good record.\n  It is for this reason I am deeply disappointed the decision was made \nto insert this provision in the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical \nCorrections Act of 2004 conference report. Let's again remember--and \nSenator Kohl pointed this out--so there is no misunderstanding, this \nbill would sail through the Senate if this provision on Laos was not \nincluded. Senator Kohl and I are not trying to block the larger \nlegislation. However, I cannot support upgrading Laos's trading status \nas long as the human rights situation in that country remains so \ndisturbing, and I am not prepared to let this bill pass without at \nleast some further debate on this important matter.\n  As Senator Kohl just said, this is the wrong time to reward the \nGovernment of Laos with normal trade relations. Reports emerging from \nLaos continue to demonstrate that human rights conditions in Laos \nremain appalling. Despite the Lao Government's denials, human rights \norganizations, the U.S. Government, my constituents, and various news \nagencies have all documented the Lao Government's blatant disregard for \nhuman rights.\n  I have tried to carefully and closely monitor the human rights \nsituation in Laos as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee's Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and as a \nrepresentative of over 35,000 Hmong in Wisconsin, many of whom fled \nLaos following the end of the Vietnam war.\n  Just like Senator Kohl, I am regularly contacted by constituents \nconcerned about their friends and family in Laos. Again and again, my \noffice encounters reports of atrocities committed against the Hmong in \nLaos and other deplorable practices by the Lao Government. These \nreports, combined with the Lao Government's absolute refusal to \ninvestigate allegations or to permit independent monitoring, lead me to \nbelieve it is not in our country's national interest to adopt normal \ntrade relations with the Lao Government at this time.\n  The State Department has documented these abuses through a series of \nreports, including their Human Rights Report, Trafficking in Persons \nReport, and Religious Freedom Report. In their Country Report for Human \nRights Practices for 2003, the State Department reported the Lao \nGovernment's ``human rights record remained poor, and it continued to \ncommit serious abuses.'' As described by the report, the abuse of \ndetainees and prisoners, inhumane prison conditions, arbitrary arrests, \ndetention and surveillance by police, a corrupt judiciary, and \nrestrictions on freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and association \nare just some of the conditions that Laotians face.\n\n  Trafficking in women and children for prostitution and forced labor \nin\n\n[[Page S11527]]\n\nLaos is also a serious problem. The State Department's 2004 Trafficking \nin Persons Report placed Laos in their tier 2 watchlist which they said \nreflected the ``lack of evidence of increasing Lao Government efforts \nto prosecute traffickers and to provide adequate protection for \nvictims.'' It also stated that some local government officials ``likely \nprofit from trafficking.''\n  The State Department's International Religious Freedom Report for \n2004 describes restrictions on freedom of religion, stating that while \nthe country's constitution allows for freedom of religion, the Lao \nGovernment actually ``restricts this right in practice.'' The report \nstates that local officials were reported to pressure Christians to \n``renounce their faith on threat of arrest or forceful eviction from \ntheir villages. There were also several instances of persons detained \nor arrested for their religious faith.''\n  The report goes on:\n\n       The absence of rule of law has created an atmosphere in \n     which authorities may act with impunity against persons \n     regarded as threats to social order. Persons arrested for \n     their religious activities have been charged with exaggerated \n     security or other criminal offenses. Persons detained may be \n     held for lengthy periods without trial. Court judges, not \n     juries, decide guilt or innocence in court cases, and an \n     accused person's defense rights are limited. A person \n     arrested or convicted for religious offenses has little \n     protection under the law. All religious groups, including \n     Buddhists, practice their faith in an atmosphere in which \n     application of the law is arbitrary. Certain actions \n     interpreted by officials as threatening may bring harsh \n     punishment. Religious practice is ``free only if \n     practitioners stay within tacitly understood guidelines of \n     what is acceptable to the government and the LPRP . . .''\n\n--The Lao Republic Revolutionary Party, the country's ruling party.\n  A particular concern to my constituents and to me is the steady flow \nof reports of atrocities committed against the Hmong in Laos. My office \nis regularly bombarded with reports of murders, rape, and starvation of \nthe Hmong in Laos. We cannot verify each of these claims, but the \nstream of videos, photographs, eyewitness reports, and articles is \ndeeply disturbing. These allegations cannot be dismissed outright, as \nthe Lao Government simply does again and again, denying the Hmong's \nvery existence in the jungles of Laos. My constituents and the \nconstituents of many Members of Congress care deeply about the well-\nbeing of their friends and families.\n  It is not just our constituents and Members of Congress who are \nconcerned. Patricia Haslach, our U.S. Ambassador to Laos, stated in her \nnomination hearing on April 22, 2004, that her first priority was to \npress the Lao Government to respect the rights of ethnic groups, \nespecially the Hmong population. The former Ambassador to Laos, \nAmbassador Douglas Hartwick, also made this a priority in his dealings \nwith the Government of Laos and recognized the need for greater \ntransparency and reform.\n\n  As Senator Kohl pointed out, and as I reiterate, let us not forget \nthe obligation the United States has to the Hmong. During the Vietnam \nWar, the Central Intelligence Agency recruited, trained and armed \napproximately 60,000 Hmong to fight the Vietcong in a secret war. They \nfought with the CIA to rescue downed American pilots, to thwart supply \nlines along the Ho Chi Minh trail and to hold off North Vietnamese \ntroops. Following the ascendancy of the communist Pathet Laos regime in \n1975 in Laos, the Lao government cracked down on its perceived \npolitical opponents, including the U.S.-trained Hmong guerilla \nfighters. Lao and Vietnamese troops crushed nearly all remnants of the \nHmong army. Tens of thousands of Laotians, including the Hmong, died \nwhile attempting to flee the Lao communist regime, and many others \nperished in reeducation and labor camps. Hundreds of thousands of \npeople fled to Thailand, and between 1975 and 1998, nearly 130,000 \nHmong refugees were admitted to the United States.\n  The Hmong's relationship with the CIA was not acknowledged by the \nU.S. until 1994 when the former CIA Director William Colby told \nCongress of the Hmong's cooperation with the CIA. At that hearing, he \nstated that the Hmong contribution was ``substantial and at great \nsacrifice.'' He further stated:\n\n       Many of the Hmong who bore the burden of that effort did so \n     in hopes of a better life for their families and children, \n     only to see them flee their homes in fear of their enemies to \n     become dependent refugees in foreign lands . . .\n\n  The largest Hmong communities are now in Wisconsin, Minnesota, \nCalifornia and the State of the Presiding officer, North Carolina. \nThere are approximately 280,000 Hmong nationwide. My State of Wisconsin \nis home to the third largest Hmong community in the United States, most \nof whom came to this country from Laos as refugees after the Vietnam \nWar. I am proud of the Hmong veterans and their families who sacrificed \nso much during the Vietnam War.\n  The Hmong people have made important contributions to Wisconsin and \nthis Nation. They have brought new traditions and new perspectives, \nwhich have enriched the cultural life of my State and many others. I \nhave consistently admired their passion and commitment to tackling a \nhost of difficult issues confronting their community in the United \nStates, Laos and in Thailand. They have endured tremendous hardship, \neven in the United States, as they have adjusted to an entirely new way \nof life here. I admire their strength and perseverance. In December \n2003, the United States Government announced the creation of a new \nresettlement program of approximately 15,000 Hmong-Lao, who were living \nat a temple named Wat Tham Krabok in Thailand. They have already begun \nto resettle in the United States, and some have come to Wisconsin, \nwhich has a proud tradition of welcoming refugee populations.\n  However, while most fled Laos, it appears that remnants of former \nHmong insurgent groups and their families, who once fought with the CIA \nand the Royal Lao government, remain in remote areas of Laos. The Lao \nleadership refuses to acknowledge that these groups exist. In a speech \non January 27, 2004, then-U.S. Ambassador to Laos Hartwick stated \nthat Laos needs to make progress in human rights and should find a \nhumanitarian solution to the people still hiding in Laos' jungles. He \nactually stated:\n\n       Remnants of former Hmong insurgent groups who once fought \n     on the side of the Royal Lao Government some 27 years ago, \n     still hide deep in the Lao forest, afraid or unwilling to \n     come out. The Lao leadership is unwilling to acknowledge \n     publicly that these groups exist, nor to explain in detail to \n     the international community the amnesty policy Laos has had \n     in place for years to encourage peaceful resettlement. Much \n     more needs to be done. Only improved cooperation and dialogue \n     among the Lao authorities, the forest people leaders, and \n     those outside of Lao borders who encourage this standoff can \n     resolve this tragic situation that continues to claim \n     innocent lives and fuel bilateral tensions . . . My \n     government and the international community stand ready to \n     assist in resolving this complicated issue if requested by \n     the concerned parties.\n\n  An article in Time Asia from September 20, 2004 reiterated that \nthousands of Hmong ``remain trapped deep inside the mountains, playing \na deadly game of cat and mouse with the government.\n  Recently, my constituents have informed me that attacks have only \nescalated against the Hmong in the jungles by Laotian military forces. \nI want to highlight some of the examples of these disturbing reports.\n  Amnesty International in October 2003 reported that the Lao \nGovernment was using ``starvation as a weapon of war.'' They reported \nthat the Lao military had surrounded several rebel groups and their \nfamilies and was preventing them from foraging for food they need to \nsurvive. Amnesty International stated that they were gravely concerned \nby the ``sharply deteriorating situation of thousands of family members \nof ethnic minority groups, predominantly Hmong, involved in an armed \nconflict with the Lao military in jungle areas of the country.''\n  Following this report, I wrote a letter with other Senators to the \nAmbassador of Laos, bringing his attention to the Amnesty International \nreport and asking the government to investigate the treatment of Hmong \nin the jungles of Laos, and to permit international monitors and \nhumanitarian relief agencies to provide food and medical supplies. The \nLao Ambassador dismissed the Amnesty report outright, and the Lao \nGovernment refused to investigate the claims.\n  In a Time Asia article from May 5, 2003, journalist Andrew Perrin \nwrote of his journey to visit a group of Hmong deep within the jungles \nin northern\n\n[[Page S11528]]\n\nLaos and spoke of the Hmong being hunted down and trapped by Lao \nmilitary forces. He wrote this ``ragtag army with wailing families in \ntow'' was ``completely surrounded by the Lao government troops that \nhunt them.'' He goes on, ``What is the crime this ragged bunch has \ncommitted? It is simply that they are Hmong, mostly the children, \ngrandchildren or even great-grandchildren of fighters who in the 1960s \nsided with the U.S. to fight communism in Laos during the Vietnam War . \n. . The communist Pathet Lao movement . . . has never forgotten the \nHmong's complicity with the Americans.''\n\n  In another article from Time Asia on June 30, 2003, Andrew Perrin \nagain highlighted the plight of the Hmong, stating, ``In Laos, no \npolitical dissent has been allowed in 28 years, nor any right of \nassembly. Scores of political prisoners and youth have been detained \nfor years in dark cells without trial; many have been tortured. \nChristians are persecuted, told to denounce their faith under threat of \nimprisonment'' and Hmong women and children are ``trapped in the \nmountains, starving, shot at and dying in droves.'' He continued, \n``Most of this brutality passes unnoticed or uncommented upon by \nWestern governments, because Laos does not register on their radar.''\n  Well, it registers on my radar and the radar of my constituents. \nHowever, it appears that this brutality has gone unnoticed by some \nmembers of Congress who wish to move forward on normal trade relations \nwith Laos. Do these reports not give some of my colleagues any \nhesitation about granting normal trade relations to Laos at this time?\n  Also in June 2003, in a highly publicized case, the Lao government \narrested a Hmong-American and two European journalists for visiting \nHmong in restricted areas of Laos. According to reports, they received \na 15-year prison sentence following a two hour trial, demonstrating the \nflawed judicial process in Laos. After intense diplomatic pressure, \nthey were released. According to an AFP report, one of the journalists \nstated, ``Everything was decided in advance. It was a total mockery of \njustice, a parody . . . At one point we had black hoods on our heads \nand were handcuffed . . . They said we were carrying drugs and weapons, \nthey were all lies.'' However, the Lao citizens apprehended with the \nthree foreigners were not so lucky. They remain in jail, having been \nsentenced to between 12 and 20 years. News reports indicated that they \nwere tortured while in detention.\n  Even the United Nations has been unsuccessful in getting answers from \nthe Lao Government regarding human rights violations in Laos.\n  In August 2003, the United Nations Committee to Eliminate Racial \nDiscrimination strongly criticized the Lao People's Democratic Republic \nand expressed its grave concerns regarding reports of human rights \nviolations, including brutalities inflicted on the Hmong. The committee \n``expressed its grave concern at the information it had received of \nserious and repeated human rights violations in that country; was \nextremely disturbed to learn that some members of the Hmong minority \nhad been subjected to severe brutalities; deplored the measures taken \nby the Lao authorities to prevent the reporting of any information \nconcerning the situation of the Hmong people . . .'' The committee \n``urged the state party to halt immediately acts of violence against \nthe Hmong population.''\n\n  In March 2004, an Amnesty International reported that large numbers \nof ethnic Hmong rebels and their families had emerged from jungles of \nLaos and surrendered to authorities in at least two areas of the \ncountry. The U.S. State Department confirmed these reports, believing \nthat anywhere from 350 to 700 Hmong surrendered to Lao authorities and \nwere participating in a Lao amnesty program. However, the Lao \ngovernment has denied the existence of an amnesty program. Furthermore, \nsome of my 26 constituents have raised fears that these Hmong did not \nactually surrender, but were captured and in some cases summarily \nexecuted. Several colleagues and I urged the administration to pursue \nincreased international access to monitor this issue under United \nNations auspices. In addition, we urged the State Department to \ninvestigate the allegations and gain access to the Hmong emerging from \nthe jungles.\n  Following these reports, in March 2004, I contacted the U.S. \nAmbassador to the UN with other members of Congress, asking for his \nassistance in urging the United Nations to send a representative or \nfact-finding 27 mission to Laos to monitor the treatment of the Hmong. \nIn addition, I also wrote Secretary Powell with other members of \nCongress to investigate reports of atrocities and to take further \naction to protect the Hmong.\n  In a letter of response, Ambassador Negroponte informed my office \nthat both the Embassy and the United Nations Development Programme--\nUNDP--continue to urge the Government of Laos to address this \nhumanitarian issue in a peaceful and transparent manner, and have asked \nthe Lao government to provide access to the areas where these people \nare seeking assistance.\n  It seems that no access was granted. In addition, in my response to \nSecretary Powell's letter, the U.S. State Department informed me that \nthey too shared our concern about the treatment of Hmong living in \nremote areas and that they were seeking access to these people in order \nto learn about their status firsthand. Furthermore, the State \nDepartment informed us that Secretary Powell wrote to Lao Foreign \nMinister Somsavat, requesting that the Lao government allow the U.S. \nembassy and UN or other international organization 29 personnel access \nto these groups. The Foreign Minister never wrote Powell back. The \nForeign Minister never even responded to our Secretary of State at all. \nNow Congress wants to grant normal trade relations to Laos? Why would \nwe reward the misbehavior and human rights abuses of this regime?\n  Most recently, in September 2004, Amnesty International, CNN and \nother news sources reported on a recently released video, which \ndocumented the murder of five Hmong teenagers in Laos, allegedly by Lao \nmilitary forces. Amnesty called these attacks war crimes. The children \naged between 13 and 16, were murdered while foraging for food near \ntheir camp in Laos in May 2004. According to the reports, the 4 girls \nwere raped prior to being killed. Not surprisingly, the Lao government \ninitially dismissed the allegations, calling the tape a fabrication. \nAfter intense pressure by the United States State Department to launch \nan investigation, the Lao government stated that they undertook an \ninvestigation and were not able to find any evidence of a confrontation \nbetween the Lao military and these Hmong teenagers. But they have \nrefused to make their report on the incident public.\n\n  Mr. President, Michael Vang of California and Houa Ly of Wisconsin, \ntwo United States citizens, were last seen near the border between Laos \nand Thailand in April 1999. We do not know what fate they met in Laos. \nJoint U.S.-Lao investigations were unable to find them. The Lao \ngovernment needs to make greater efforts at finding these two men.\n  While we in Congress cannot verify every allegation, the information \nwe receive from journalists, human rights organizations and our \nconstituents is incredibly disturbing and cannot be disregarded. We \njust do not have enough information. But, the Lao government does not \nhelp us find the truth by restricting the international community from \ngetting any more information.\n  Despite all of the Lao government's stonewalling of our inquiries and \nthe flood of reports of human rights violations by the Lao government, \nthis Congress is now about to grant normal trade relations to Laos. Why \nnow? Why do we choose to reward this oppressive and brutal government \nwhen they have not adequately responded to our concerns? When the \nForeign Minister of Laos has not even responded to Secretary Powell's \nletter to his government, requesting more information? If these \nallegations are untrue, as they claim, then why does the Lao government \nnot allow international monitors into the areas where the Hmong are \nliving?\n  But our concerns go unheeded, and we continue to be confronted with \nthe most horrific accusations about conditions in Laos with no way to \nrespond. We should not be giving Laos NTR, when they refuse to open to \nus in meaningful ways.\n  The Lao government must assure the international community that they \nare\n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\nattempting to address the problem of these men and women and children \nin the jungles of Laos through a humanitarian solution. The Lao \ngovernment must allow international humanitarian organizations to have \naccess to areas in which Hmong and other ethnic minorities have \nresettled, to allow independent monitoring of prison conditions, and to \nrelease prisoners who have been arbitrarily arrested because of their \npolitical or religious beliefs.\n  The U.S. has an obligation to the Hmong people, and I strongly \nbelieve that we have a moral interest in reducing human suffering and \nprotecting human rights abroad. We cannot ignore these allegations of \natrocities in Laos. Granting NTR is not appropriate at this time. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in insisting that the conference report \nbefore us not be used as a Trojan horse to sneak through a provision \nthat conflicts so fundamentally with our country's dedication to human \nrights, to democracy, and to fundamental decency.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nproceed as in morning business for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, I certainly will not \nobject, and I look forward to hearing the remarks of my colleague, the \nSenator from Oklahoma, whom I have enjoyed serving with very much, \nespecially on the Budget Committee, and simply indicate to the Senate \nthat I intend after this to get back to the business of debating the \npending issue. But with that, I do not object.\n  Again, I commend the Senator on his wonderful service to this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Farewell\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague for his \nconsideration.\n  My wife and I, our families, were taking our Christmas photo a few \ndays ago and I was surprised to realize that our two oldest children \nwere actually older than we were when we came to the Senate. They are \nin their thirties and I think I was 32 when I was sworn in, just turned \n32, and now we have a couple of children who are that age or more. It \ntells me we have been here a little while. I am actually very surprised \nthat I am concluding 24 years in the Senate.\n  I have absolutely loved working in the Senate. The Senate is a great \ninstitution. It is one of the true pillars of democracy in the world, \none which people look to with great respect and admiration. I have \nalways been proud to be called a Senator and I have always been proud \nto represent my State and my country. To me, it represents a shining \ncity on a hill, and a true beacon of democracy for the free world which \nhas stood for more than two hundred years.\n  My first time to visit the Senate and sit in the gallery was in 1974 \nand I was coming to Congress as a businessman to give my impressions on \na bill that was pending before Congress. The bill was called ERISA, \nEmployment Retirement Income Security Act. I ran a small business in \nPonca City, OK, and I thought the better title for the bill was ``Every \nRidiculous Idea Since Adam.''\n  But that was in 1974. I happened to be here, it was a coincidence at \nthe time, and Senator McConnell will appreciate this, being a political \nhistorian, it was a time when an election was contested and it happened \nto be the Senate election of Oklahoma. Henry Bellman, was reelected by \na very close margin over Congressman Edmondson. As all of our \ncolleagues know, the Senate is the final arbiter in contested elections \nand it was being contested on the floor of the Senate the time I was \nhere.\n  Senator Domenici remembers that. It was a very contested, spirited \ndebate.\n  I was quite taken by the debate. I sat in the gallery for hours. I \nremember Senator Allen, a Democrat. The Democrats controlled the Senate \nat that time. Henry Bellman was a Republican. He won by a very narrow \nmargin--I can't remember what it was, a couple thousand votes. There \nwere disputes on election-counting machines. That sounds kind of \nfamiliar. It was a great debate. I remember Senator Allen spoke on \nSenator Bellman's behalf, and then they had the rollcall vote and \nenough Democrats voted with Senator Bellman, and that was the end of \nit.\n  I happened to ride back on the plane that day, and guess what. I was \nriding with Senator Bellman and Congressman Edmondson. They were \nfriends and they were shaking hands. I was impressed. And I was \nimpressed with this body. I was impressed with the Senate. I was \nimpressed with the Senators. I was impressed with the conduct of the \ndebate. I was impressed with the fact that almost all Senators were \nhere during the debate.\n  It was such a special occasion. I was so pleased because Henry \nBellman was reelected and affirmed by the Senate because I also \nconsidered him a mentor and a leader in Oklahoma. He was the first \nRepublican Senator elected in our State in a long time and now he was \nreelected. Senator Domenici served with him on the Budget Committee. He \nwas the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, on the formation of \nthe Budget Committee in 1974. I served with Ed Muskie and he did a \nwonderful job in that capacity.\n  That was my first, personal impression of the Senate. My impression \nof the Senate was very good then and it has been very good ever since. \nI have absolutely had the greatest respect for this institution and for \nthis body. This body is composed of great Members.\n  I remember the time coming into the Senate when I was elected. It was \n1980. That was a big election year. We have had a few big election \nyears in my time, but I'm not sure we have ever had one quite as big, \nas dramatic a change as we did in 1980. There were 18 new Senators \nelected in 1980, and 16 of the 18 were Republicans. The majority leader \nbecame Howard Baker from Tennessee. He was nice enough to be my mentor, \nand I thought the world of him then as I still do today. He is a \nwonderful Ambassador to Japan, and he and Nancy Kassenbaum were \nwonderful Senators. It was a great time to serve in the Senate.\n  I remember the highlight of my Senate career was on Ronald Reagan's \ninaugural day on January 20, 1981. It was a beautiful day, and I \nremember the hostages in Iran were released that very day. They were \nheld hostage for 444 days. They were liberated on that inaugural day. I \nwill never forget what a euphoric feeling it was for not just those of \nus who were elected to the Senate and taking control--the Republicans \nwere taking control of the Senate for the first time in decades. I \nthink none of those Republicans had ever been in the majority, and I \ndon't believe any of those Democrats had ever been in the minority.\n  That was a big change. It was kind of a fun change from my vantage \npoint. There was so many new people. I was one of 18 new Senators, and \nit was a great time. That was a big turnover any time in this \ninstitution. To think that the hostages were released and Ronald Reagan \nwas elected--it was a big exciting time, and a lot was accomplished.\n  I was coming to Congress as a businessman from Ponca City, OK, with \nan agenda. Part of the agenda was not to be here forever. Frankly, I \ntold people I was running because I thought our country had declined \nfar too much militarily, economically, and morally, and I wanted to do \nsomething about it.\n  I came here to cut taxes and to cut regulations, particularly in the \nenergy industry, and to see if we couldn't make positive changes for \nthe country. Economic issues aside, I wanted to defeat the Communists. \nThis was of particular concern to me, as I thought our country had \ndeclined way too much militarily.\n  We did a lot of those things. We accomplished a lot in the 1980s \nunder Ronald Reagan's leadership. I am absolutely amazed when I look \nback at when Ronald Reagan was elected, and when I was elected. The \nmaximum tax rate was 70 percent, and 8 years later it was 28 percent. I \nam still amazed at that. What an unbelievable accomplishment. I \nremember how it was accomplished. It took a lot of strong\n\n[[Page S11530]]\n\nleadership and work by Howard Baker and Bob Dole. It took working with \nother people. I remember Bill Bradley working on some of these tax \nbills. That was a big change.\n  I came from a business background and, oh, yes, if you made some \nmoney, you can be taxed all the way to 70 percent on the individual \nside, and 80 percent on the corporate side. You were working more for \nthe Government than you were yourself. To me, that represented a real \nloss of personal and economic freedom. I wanted to restore economic \nfreedom for all Americans and be part of that change.\n  My father, unfortunately, died in 1961. We had a small family-held \nbusiness. The Government contested, basically, my mother and our family \nfor 7 years over the value of Nickles Machine Corporation. They wanted \na big chunk of that business. I always resented that. I thought \nGovernment was supposed to protect private property; not confiscate it.\n  On the 1981 tax bill, I remember talking to Secretary Don Regan when \nI said: We really should eliminate the estate tax on surviving \nspouses--and we made sure that was included in the 1981 tax bill. I am \nprobably as proud of that as any other thing. I had a little something \nto do with a very profamily, very probusiness, very progrowth-oriented \nbill becoming law. That success told me that we could accomplish great \nthings here.\n  Of the 18 Senators who were elected with me in 1980, there are only 3 \nleft. Chris Dodd is still here, Chuck Grassley is now chairman of the \nFinance Committee, and Arlen Specter will be chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Only 3 of the 18 are left.\n  I respect them greatly, and I compliment them for their many years of \nservice.\n  Over the years, I've had many great mentors. I mentioned Bob Dole and \nHoward Baker. I'll mention one other one with fond affection. That \nwould be Senator Jesse Helms. I remember one time when we were engaged \nin a filibuster, and I encouraged the Senate not to have many \nfilibusters, but that is the first one I can remember. I believe it was \n1982 or 1983. This was a little filibuster on the Nickles gasoline tax. \nSome of us believed that the States should do it rather than the \nFederal Government. Three of us were opposed to that: Senator Helms, \nSenator East, and myself. That was when the filibuster was a real \nfilibuster. We spent the night on cots outside the Senate Chamber.\n  I remember laying awake at night somewhat nervous. The heart was \nstill beating, and I remember some grumbling amongst some of our \ncolleagues who weren't very happy about the fact that we were here in \nlate December arguing over a Nickles gasoline tax. I remember that this \nwasn't quite worth falling on the sword over.\n  I communicated that to my friends and colleagues, Senator Helms and \nSenator East. I eventually convinced Senator Helms, and it took a \nlittle longer to convince Senator East, and we dropped the filibuster.\n  What I wanted to say about Senator Helms is I remember that we had a \nlot of discussions during these times. We were actually in session two \nor three nights around the clock. He told me something I will never \nforget, which I will pass along to our colleagues.\n  He said: Don, when I am flying over North Carolina and I look around \nand see all those lights, I am amazed at how many people live in that \nState and how many people there are, particularly in rural areas. And I \nwonder if those people think they have anybody in DC who really cares \nabout them, and probably most of them don't think anybody cares about \nthem. He was just as genuine as he could possibly be.\n  When I am on a plane at night looking out at the lights and see how \nbig our cities, towns, and rural areas are, I think about that. Do the \npeople in those areas really think somebody is fighting for them, \nworking for them? Jesse Helms is one of those individuals. He is very \nspecial. He had a reputation of being kind of tough and mean, but \npersonally he is probably one of the nicest Senators with whom I have \nhad the pleasure of working. He knew everybody who worked the \nelevators. He was nice to the staff. He was a gentleman's gentleman. I \nunderstand his health is not real good right now, so my thoughts are \nwith him, and I wish him all the best at this time. He was a great \nSenator. He knew the rules of the Senate, and he would fight for what \nhe believed in, and he would fight with tenacity. He also was a \nSenator's Senator, and I'm am fortunate to say I have had the pleasure \nof serving with many colleagues who fall into that category.\n  I came here with a real interest in trying to change things in the \nenergy field. I served on the Energy Committee, but I wanted to make \nsome changes. I ran and maybe was elected in large part because of some \nof the things that Congress was passing in 1978 and 1979 and 1980 with \nwhich I just totally disagreed. One of those was the windfall profits \ntax. I campaigned vigorously against it. I wanted to repeal it. I was \ndisappointed that I couldn't get it repealed in 1981, or in 1982. I \nintroduced legislation every single year. We finally got it repealed in \n1986.\n  As I told somebody last night, it was $77 billion too late. But \neventually it was repealed.\n  We did some other things that I think were very positive--undoing \nsome of the things that were passed in the last couple of years of the \nCarter administration.\n  We deregulated natural gas. I did that working with Wendell Ford and \nBennett Johnston on the Energy bill. That was very positive, \nsignificant legislation that one of my predecessors, Bob Kerr, had \nworked on 20 years before. We got that done.\n  We repealed the fuel use tax. We eliminated the Synfuels Corporation. \nThe Synfuels Corporation was run by an Oklahoman who ran against me, Ed \nNobel. He ran against me in 1980. Ronald Reagan appointed him chairman \nof the Synfuels Corporation. I campaigned to eliminate it, which we \neventually did.\n  I have had a lot of fun in this capacity. In the mid-1980s, I was \nappointed to the Appropriations Committee. I have great, fond memories \nof that. The Democrat leader, Harry Reid, was my colleague on two or \nthree committees. I think we both were either chairman or ranking, and \nwe switched back and forth a couple of times on the District of \nColumbia Appropriations Committee, our penance, and the Interior \nsubcommittee, which either Senator Reid or Senator Byrd was chairman \nand/or ranking members. We worked together on those committees for \nyears.\n  We did a lot of good things together, such as reforming the frank so \nyou couldn't mail out thousands and thousands of pieces of mail, \nparticularly prior to election time.\n  Harry Reid is my friend and his word is as good as gold. He will be a \ngood leader for the Democrats, and he will be a good Senator for \nSenator Frist and Senator McConnell to work with to get things \naccomplished. So I am excited about his elevation.\n  I was selected by our colleagues to be campaign chairman back in 1989 \nand 1990, one of the tougher jobs. I compliment George Allen for the \nfine job he did this year. I compliment Bill Frist for the fine job he \ndid in that position, and Mitch McConnell when he had that position. It \nis probably one of the toughest elected positions we have in \nleadership, but one which I thoroughly enjoyed. The reason I enjoyed it \nis you work hard, and you get to know your colleagues. We get so busy \naround this place we often don't get to know our colleagues. If you are \ncampaigning with somebody, if you are spending the night, as I did at \nGordon Smith's home in Oregon, or campaigning in Maine with Senator \nSnowe or Senator Collins, or if you are campaigning in Minnesota, or \nwhen you campaign with people and you are traveling with them for a day \nor two, or in Montana on a bus tour with Conrad Burns and his wife \nPhyllis, you get to know them.\n  I have gotten to know our colleagues well. I think I have been in \nalmost everybody's State, at least on our side of the aisle, \ncampaigning. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know my colleagues. The \nSenate is composed of a great group of individuals, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and we need to get to know each other better. I think if \nwe get to know each other better, our body works better and we will do \nbetter.\n  After that, I was fortunate enough to be elected policy chairman. I \nhad that position for 6 years, and it was another job I absolutely \nloved. I succeeded Bill\n\n[[Page S11531]]\n\nArmstrong, and I was fortunate to keep some of his staff, some of the \nbest staff on the Hill, I might add. They stayed with me, and I \nappreciate that. Eric Ueland and Doug Badger would fit in that \ncategory, and they were outstanding.\n  Bill Armstrong is another one of my mentors. I met with Bill \nArmstrong and a couple of other Senators in a prayer group once a week \nfor 12 years. He is probably the most articulate Senator I have had the \npleasure of serving with, an outstanding leader. I wish he would have \ncontinued his service. He decided to return to the private sector, and \nsince I am doing that, I respect that greatly. But I have always looked \nup to him because he was a man of conviction, and he got things done.\n  Let me add, Jon Kyl who is now the policy chairman, and there could \nnot be a better policy chairman, is doing a fantastic job, a very \nimportant job. I compliment him for his leadership.\n  After that position--and I thank my colleagues for giving me that \nresponsibility--I served 6 years as assistant majority leader, and I \nguess at some point maybe assistant minority leader. It was a great \nhonor and a pleasure to work with Trent Lott, which I enjoyed greatly. \nTrent did a fantastic job as our Republican leader, and I'd like to \ntake this opportunity to commend him on his outstanding service. Mitch \nMcConnell has my old post now, and he is doing a super job. Again, it \nis a position where you get to know your colleagues really well. You \nnot only learn how to count votes, but you find out what makes people \ntick and where they are coming from, what they are trying to \naccomplish, and what they are trying to do. And Mitch McConnell is \ndoing a fantastic job in that capacity.\n  During my tenure in the Senate, we have had the pleasure of passing a \nlot of legislation. I am fortunate to have so many colleagues who have \nhelped me do some things that I think have become good laws.\n  The Republicans took control of the Senate in the 1994 elections, and \nin 1995 I think the first bill we passed was the Congressional \nAccountability Act that Senator Grassley and a lot of Democrats \nand Republicans passed. We worked hard on that. I am glad to see that \nhappened.\n\n  We passed the Congressional Review Act that Senator Reid was my \nprincipal Democrat sponsor on, where we could review expensive and \nexpansive Federal regulations. We actually used that to repeal the \nergonomics rule which the Clinton administration tried to pass in the \nlast couple of days of their term. Although he supported the \nregulation, Senator Reid, to his credit, defended the Congressional \nReview Act which is still the law of the land. We used that to repeal \nwhat I felt was a very intrusive, expensive, and unwarranted \nregulation. Again, that is another case where Senator Reid stated--he \ndid not agree with repealing the regulation, but he defended the law we \nrepealed it with, and some people were trying to undermine that.\n  Senator Lieberman and I passed the Defense of Marriage Act, an act \nthat became a little more noteworthy in the last year or two. I thank \nSenator Lieberman for his help and leadership on that issue. Bill \nClinton signed that bill. I am not sure he wanted to, but he did sign \nit in the wee hours of 1996. That act is still the law of the land. It \nbasically says States do not have to recognize other States' \nlegalization of same sex marriage. Some States have legalized gay \nmarriage, which is their prerogative, but due to our bill other States \ndo not have to recognize that. Some people presume that it will be \ndeclared unconstitutional. I hope it is not. I would be disappointed if \nthe Supreme Court did overrule that. That bill passed with 80-some-odd \nvotes in the Senate and still is the law of the land.\n  We passed the International Religious Freedom Act. Again, I say \n``we.'' Senator Lieberman joined me in passing that bill. We passed \nthat in 1998, and it is now the law of the land. It is very important \nthat we note countries that are very repressive and oppressive in \nstifling religious freedom. Unfortunately, we have seen such oppression \nin many countries around the world. That kind of bigotry is the genesis \nof a lot of the hatred and violence and the wars we are fighting today.\n  We have ensured, with the passage of this act, that the State \nDepartment will be much more proactive in not only identifying cases of \nreligious intolerance and persecution, but will take proactive steps to \nchange such behavior as a matter of U.S. policy.\n  Senator Landrieu and I passed, in 2000, the Child Citizenship Act, \nwhich basically grants citizenship to foreign born children who are \nadopted. I think 150,000 children became citizens in one day as a \nresult of that act, and I am greatly pleased to have been a part of \nthat success.\n  I have had the pleasure for the last couple of years of being \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I look back at some of our \naccomplishments, and I have to think maybe those were some of the best \nin my career as a Senator.\n  The budget we passed in 2003 was a real challenge. We probably spent \nmore days, more hours, and had more votes on the 2003 Budget Act than \nany other Budget Act in history. I think we had 80-some-odd votes. It \ntook more than a week. It took about a week and a half, almost 2 weeks, \non the floor.\n  I compliment Senator Zell Miller for his assistance in that. We \npassed that budget with the Vice President breaking the tie. That was \nnot easily done. We defeated numerous amendments, and were successful \nin passing a budget that allowed us to have the opportunity to have an \neconomic growth package. President Bush was nice enough to ask me to \nintroduce the package and to try to carry it, and we did. Again, Zell \nMiller was the principal cosponsor with me of the bill, the growth \npackage. We introduced that package in January of 2003. We passed it in \nJune of 2003.\n  When we first took up that legislation, the Dow Jones was at about \n7,700. Today, the Dow Jones is over 10,500. We wanted to pass that \npackage so we could stimulate the economy because it was, at that time, \npretty anemic. Government receipts were still down. We wanted to get \nsomething to grow the economy. We passed that package, and not only did \nthe stock market go up, receipts are up, and we have created a couple \nmillion jobs since then.\n\n  We accelerated the tax cuts that were slowly being phased in from the \n2001 tax bill. So now we have a maximum rate of 35 percent. Although \nsome people say that is too much of a giveaway, it is the same rate the \ncorporations pay, and I do not think individuals or self-employed \npeople should pay a higher rate than Exxon or General Motors. So we \npassed that.\n  We also passed a 15-percent tax on capital gains and a 15-percent tax \non corporate distributions, dividends, which I firmly believe has \ngreatly helped not just the market but the economy. So I am proud of \nthat.\n  I am proud of Zell Miller because he had the courage to be a \ncosponsor, to stand up and fight for those things and make them become \nlaw. It also made a $1,000 tax credit per child become law. It also \neliminated or greatly reduced the marriage penalty on married couples. \nIf they have taxable income of $58,000, that is $900 of tax relief. \nThose are positive things. It would not have happened without Zell \nMiller.\n  Zell Miller only served 4 years in the Senate. He replaced a very \ndear friend of all of ours, Paul Coverdell. I mourned Paul Coverdell's \nloss, and I stated at the time he cannot be replaced; and he certainly \ncannot be replaced. But Zell Miller has been one outstanding addition \nto this body. He is a great patriot, not a great Democrat or a great \nRepublican, he is a great patriot, and he stands for what he believes \nin, and he helped us enact these measures which are vitally important.\n  I also read in the Washington Post today that somebody said, well, \nthe Budget Act is not working, and so on, and there is no discipline in \nCongress. Frankly, they don't know what they are talking about. I hate \nto tell them that.\n  They also said we did not pass a budget this year. Well, they don't \nquite know what they are talking about there either. In the last 2 \nyears, thanks to the collective will of this body, we have made 82 \nbudget points of order--in the last 2 years--78 of which were \nsustained. I voted to waive a couple of them. We defeated $1.7 trillion \nof additional spending over a 10-year period on those 78 budget points \nof order.\n  The Budget Act did work. We passed a budget through the Senate \nearlier\n\n[[Page S11532]]\n\nthis year that had domestic discretionary spending at $821.9 billion.\n  I am confident that when the leader brings up an Omnibus bill this \nyear, it is going to meet that goal of $821.9 billion. That is several \nbillion dollars less than a lot of people wanted.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Stevens. I have wrestled with him every \nday on appropriations bills. But Senator Stevens helped us pass the \n821.9 cap on the DOD Appropriations bill. I could not get the budget \nresolution to pass. We passed it through the Senate and through the \nHouse. I could not get the conference report adopted. That was one of \nmy disappointments.\n  One of our accomplishments, as most people didn't know, was we did \nput in the spending cap on the DOD Appropriations bill and we are \nenforcing that cap and we are abiding by that cap today. So I wanted \npeople to know that. I also thank people such as Thad Cochran and \nSenator Specter, because they enforced the cap as chairmen of their \nrespective Appropriations subcommittees, probably more than anyone. I \ndidn't have to make the points of order; they did it. It worked. We \nhave nondiscretionary and nonhomeland security growing at less than 1 \npercent this year, compared to a 14-percent growth a few years ago in \nPresident Clinton's last years. Yes, we are spending a lot of money in \ndefense and homeland security, no doubt about it.\n  Are the deficits too high? You bet. Are they coming down? You bet. \nThe deficit this year was finalized at 400-something, over $100 billion \nless than the administration projected 9 months ago; and that is \nbecause revenues are up and the economy is growing. The changes we \npassed in 2001 are working significantly.\n  I project, and CBO projects, they will continue to climb by another \n$100 billion in the next year or so. Is the war expensive? Yes. Is it \nworth it? You bet. Is the war on terrorism worth it? Yes.\n  Earlier this year--I would say this was a real highlight--I went to \nIraq and Afghanistan with Senators Sessions and Lieberman. I have done \na lot of things, and I have been to a lot of places around the world, \nbut I cannot tell you how proud I was to be in Iraq, basically when \nthere was a transition of power, when Mr. Allawi assumed control of \nIraq.\n  We met with the Defense Minister and he said: Yes, we want to protect \nour country. When we met with our military leadership and theirs, we \nwere in the process of training 210,000 Iraqis, and we had a chance to \nmeet with Iraqis there that are hungry for freedom and thankful for our \nsupport and eager to assume and take control.\n  They are talking about elections in January, and I am hopeful and \nprayerful that those will be successful. I believe they will be. \nSenator Sessions and I also went to Afghanistan and met with now-\nPresident Karzai. It was around July 4. They were scheduled to have \nelections in October. They did that and he was elected overwhelmingly.\n  The success we have had in Afghanistan has been absolutely \nphenomenal. I remember well the debates here, with many people saying: \nYou are going to be involved in a quagmire; you will never be able to \nhave democracy. You cannot get in there. The Soviets were there 10 \nyears and lost tens of thousands of troops. You are going to do the \nsame thing.\n  Frankly, our military was successful, working with the Afghan \nnorthern alliance and other Afghan people who wanted freedom in \nAfghanistan. We basically helped them take control of that country with \na few hundred troops on the ground and our Air Force. We have liberated \nAfghanistan. They have had elections and they have proved they can have \na democracy. They will have parliamentary elections early next year.\n  So the success we have had and have seen in Afghanistan is restoring \nfreedom to millions of people there. I believe we are in the process of \nrestoring freedom and liberating the Iraqi people for the long run so \nthe Iraqis can control their own destiny. If you look at those things, \nwe have had an outburst, an outgrowth of freedom.\n\n  Abraham Lincoln said in the Gettysburg Address:\n\n       This Nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom.\n\n  This country is largely responsible for not only this country having \na new birth of freedom, but frankly countries throughout the world, in \nour own hemisphere and in the former Soviet bloc, and now even in \nplaces as remote as Afghanistan and Iraq. To have been able to play a \nsmall part in that over these last 24 years has been a real pleasure.\n  I thank my constituents, the people of Oklahoma, for giving me the \nopportunity and the privilege to serve them for the last 24 years. I \nthank my family, and especially my wife for her tolerance in allowing \nme to do this for the last 24 years. I thank my colleagues who I have \nhad the pleasure of serving with and working with and the pleasure of \nknowing. Frankly, my best friends are my colleagues. I have spent a \nlong time here and I have absolutely loved this work. I love the \nSenate.\n  I think the Senate is in very good hands. My replacement is Dr. Tom \nCoburn. I am honored that an active physician would leave his career \nand serve in the Senate. We have not seen it often. We saw it with Dr. \nBill Frist, and I am so grateful that he set aside his career as a \ntalented physician to serve in the Senate. I am delighted he is the \nmajority leader. He has done a fantastic job. I am delighted Dr. Coburn \nhas left his profession to serve in the Senate. What a great addition \nto the Senate. I have had the pleasure of working with Jim Inhofe, and \nI see Jim and Tom Coburn doing an outstanding job in representing our \nState.\n  I look at the leadership in the Senate today with Bill Frist, Mitch \nMcConnell, John Kyl, and the rest of the team on this side, and with \nHarry Reid and others on the Democrat side, and I see good things ahead \nfor the Senate, positive things.\n  I have been so fortunate also to have what I have often said are the \nbest staff on the Hill. I have truly been blessed. I have many staff \nmembers who have been with me for a long time.\n  Looking to my left is Bret Bernhardt, my chief of staff, who has \nworked with me for over 20 years. Hazen Marshall came in as an intern \nmany, many years ago, and he is now chief of staff on the Budget \nCommittee. Nobody knows the budget or taxes any better than Hazen \nMarshall. Both of these men are true professionals.\n  I have so many people to thank. I cannot go down the whole list. I \nwill recognize some who have been with me for over 20 years. In my \nOklahoma City office, there is Joey Bradford, who worked for me going \nback to Nickles Machine Corporation in 1978 to 1979. She is still with \nme. She will be the last person to turn out the lights. She is a \nwonderful person. Jo Stansberry goes way back. She was my secretary \nwhen I was a State senator in 1978, bless her heart. She is the \nsweetest person you will ever know. She is still with me today. Also, \nin my Oklahoma City office, Judy Albro and Maurie Cole have been with \nme almost the entire time. Sharon Keasler has been running my Tulsa \noffice for over 20 years.\n  In my DC office, Zev Teichman and Cynthia Singleton have been with me \nthe entire time.\n  They are wonderful people and true public servants, all of whom could \nhave done much better financially on the private side, but they have \nstayed with us on the public side, as well as many others.\n  I look at our staff and we still have most of the staff still with \nus. I am grateful for that. They are all anxious about new careers, and \nthey have been generous with their time and very loyal in their \nsupport, not just to me but to the people of Oklahoma and to this \ninstitution called the Senate. The Senate is a very special place.\n  I also would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge two or three other \npeople who have had a profound and positive impact on my life. One is \nDoug Coe. Some of our colleagues know him very well. Doug Coe was a \nfriend, brother, and mentor whom I respect and love greatly. He is also \na golfer, and that is my favorite vice, I guess. Most golfers play for \na little money. Doug would say, ``I will play you for a Bible verse.'' \nWe would do it and, of course, I would lose--predestined from on high. \nI will never forget when Doug said here is a verse for you to memorize. \nIt was, I think, John 13:34: ``A new commandment I give to you, that \nyou love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one \nanother.'' He made me learn that. I learned it in, I think, about 1981 \nor something. He has been a very positive guiding light. I have tried\n\n[[Page S11533]]\n\nto keep that commandment in my heart when I am on this floor and \nconducting my business, and it is good advice. I wanted to thank him.\n\n  Also, I will mention a couple other people. One is Dick Halverson, \nthe first Senate Chaplain with whom I had the pleasure working. He was \nmaybe one of the most Christlike persons I have ever known. Lloyd \nOgilvie, who succeeded him, was a great mentor. He led many of us in \nour Bible studies for years. He is a wonderful, wonderful brother and \nfriend. And now Barry Black. Barry Black, when he was giving the prayer \ntoday, said we may seek to accomplish causes beyond our lifetime. And \nhe is so right. That is what the Senate is about. It is about causes. \nIt is about things that can have consequences, that can have real \nmeaning beyond our lifetime eternally.\n  So I thank God for the opportunity and the privilege and the pleasure \nto serve in this great body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11533-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11533-S11542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on leader time, I want to make a few \ncomments in tribute, not in response, to the great man we just heard on \nthe floor of this institution. Over the last several days, all of us \nhave taken that opportunity for three of our colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle and others on the other side of the aisle, to reflect on the \npast and how people have affected us directly.\n  All of us have prepared remarks, and we have taken the opportunity to \nread them into the Record or enter them into the Record. What we just \nheard does reflect in many ways why so many of us have such strong \nfeelings about Don Nickles and his family--Linda and their children.\n  For me, it boils down to two general areas. One is the tremendous \nrespect he has and continues to have and will always have for this \ninstitution. He literally reveres this institution. We heard it in his \nwords today, the way he closed referring back to Chaplain Barry Black's \nopening this morning where causes beyond our lifetime is the essence of \nthis institution, and he has captured that in his 24 years in the \nSenate--respect for the institution, for its traditions, for its \nvalues, for its rules, for its precedents, all of which he has \nmanifested.\n  The second general area when I think of Don is his wise counseling \nthat he has been able to reflect in different ways to each and every \none of us. For me, it is the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \nWhen I was first thinking about running, I went directly to Don Nickles \nbecause in the early 1990s he developed a model which was revolutionary \nat that time which really did go to what happens at the grassroots, and \nit applied both in terms of politics and fundraising. That model is one \nthat has come full cycle.\n\n  One thing he did not mention directly but touched me in a very \nspecial way is what he did 2 weeks ago, and that is run, whether it is \nmarathons or short races or out for a daily jog--I call it a jog; he \nactually runs. But for about a year, at least once a week, sometimes \nseveral times a week, we ran together with a few Senators--I think \nthere were more than two--a few Senators, but more than that, about 8, \n9, 10, it got up to about 14 other people who every morning at 6 \no'clock would take off and go initially for 30 minutes, an hour, an \nhour and a half, 2 hours, 3 hours, and Don kept going. But those are my \nmemories.\n  What is interesting is that of the people running with us, there were \nsome new people, but then there were also people who had done this for \nyears and years, and those rich relationships were played out on the \nfloor of the Senate or with his golf, which everybody knows about, or \nthe running, which is touching me.\n  A few weeks ago, he ran in the New York City marathon. He ran it by \nhimself. He probably ran it in 3 hours. I would go much longer than \nthat. I was back here, but I was really with him, thinking of him when \nhe was going to be taking off and at each of those miles, as you run \nthrough those boroughs. I was really with him because it brought back \nmemories of us spending time together.\n  That was for, again, a cause that goes beyond our lifetime because \nour running and the group that he put together was for an effort that \nLinda, his wife, I think introduced him to, the Lombardi Cancer Center. \nAgain, it shows how everything comes together, in ways beyond going out \nto have a good run and working for this greater cause.\n  He mentioned getting to know each other. In terms of counseling to \nme, directly or indirectly, you cannot go anywhere in this town without \nDon Nickles being recognized, without him having touched or having a \nrelationship in some special way over the last 24 years, and counseling \nin terms of the prayer breakfast. Don Nickles was there every single \nweek, and the Bible studies again touch me directly in that those few \nmoments every week we have the opportunity to come together and share.\n  He mentioned the positive and guiding light of Doug Coe in the same \nway he has touched us in those prayer breakfast meetings.\n  He mentioned the budget, again the wise counsel that he set in place \nthat we will be using over the next several years as we look at tax \nrelief, but also the impact it has had on the jobs and growth in this \ncountry.\n  I have to mention his overall optimism because there is nobody more \noptimistic in the Senate, even in very tough times, trying times. There \nwere times dealing with the budget over the last 4 years that were \ntough, difficult, hard, challenging, especially in 2003. Even through \nall that, he was optimistic, upbeat, reaching out. He always knew there \nwas some way to get the best out of people working together.\n  I will close by mentioning--and we had this conversation two nights \nago--his overall commitment to family. Everything comes back to Linda \nand their four children--Don Nickles, Jr., Jenny Rossiter, Kim \nNickles, and Robyn Nickles. Everything he does comes back through that \nunit, to Linda who has--he used the word ``tolerance,'' and it does \ntake a lot of tolerance to put up with Don Nickles, I am sure. Linda \nwas there, I should also add, with support through every one of his \nendeavors.\n\n  It has been a real privilege for Karyn and me to get to know them and \ntheir entire family.\n  He used a Bible verse, his favorite Bible chapter, Galatians 5. The \nApostle Paul lists a godly man's attributes. A godly man works hard, \nsays Paul, lives a life of--the words that are key--love, joy, peace, \nkindness, goodness, and faithfulness. As we look at that string of \nwords, those nouns, I cannot think of a better description of Don \nNickles.\n  So, Don, we will miss you. I say that recognizing all our \nrelationships will continue to grow. We will clearly miss you on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, most Americans probably do not know the \nSenate is a continuous body. From the day the Founding Fathers \nestablished this marvelous institution up until today, it has never had \na termination point. It goes on and on. Senator Byrd can tell us \nexactly how many Members of the Senate there have been. The last figure \nI heard was something over 1,500.\n  Candidly, a significant number of those probably did not make much \ndifference. They filled the seats. They made sure the continuous body \ncontinued. But very few left any footprints on the sands of time. We \nhave honored a handful out here off the Senate floor, people such as \nHenry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, and just a couple of \nothers.\n  I have been here now a couple of decades, a little bit less than my \nfriend from Oklahoma. I can say without fear of contradiction, from the \nmoment I got here until today, the Senator from Oklahoma has been a \nleader in this body. He has been involved in virtually every issue of \nconsequence in the 20 years I have been here in some kind of leadership \ncapacity or providing his inspiration or, as the majority leader \nindicated, his enthusiasm for getting a solution to the problems \nconfronting America at that particular moment.\n  So I say to my friend from Oklahoma, he has left footprints in this \nbody.\n  He is one of the great Senators in the history of our country. We \nwill always\n\n[[Page S11534]]\n\nremember his service, and we wish him Godspeed in the coming years and \nlook forward to seeing him again in his new capacity whatever it may \nbe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have not been coming to the floor for \na lot of speeches about our fellow Senators, nor have I given very many \nas they are departing. I do intend to do that in the next few months \nfor all of them, but I would not dare let this record go today without \nmy having an opportunity to share some remarks with the Senate about \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  There is nobody here that has served on as many committees together \nas Senator Nickles and Senator Domenici. We have been thrilled to work \non the Energy Committee. He has told us the facts about energy. He has \ntold us the impact that was made by that committee, and nobody can \ndoubt that to have the Senator from Oklahoma come to that committee, \nhaving lived with the ridiculousness of the rules on natural gas, \nhaving him there was a great stimulus to change, once and for all--we \ndid a little bit and we opened the floodgates--to give the country a \ngreat supply of energy called natural gas.\n  More important than that, he is one who takes an opportunity to come \nforth with an idea, with a cause, and set it forth when people do not \neven think it has a chance. All of a sudden it gathers some more \nmomentum, and then it is a big issue, and nobody believes it but pretty \nsoon it passes and becomes law. There are so many that we cannot talk \nabout them. The Senator has talked about some of them.\n  When you came here, your senior Senator was kind of the opposite of \nyou. He was a great hulk of a man. He was older than you by far. If he \never bragged, it was about being a Marine lieutenant tank commander. He \nused to look at me and tell me: Well, I do not know. This Nickles is \njust too young. I am not sure he can do this job.\n\n  Well, I am sure he told you some of those things when you were \nrunning or preparing to run, but your youth had nothing to do with your \nsuccess. You were going to get it done because you have a great \ncapacity to lead and to work with people. It has been my privilege to \nhave you as my teammate.\n  There is one thing for sure, this place does not succeed without \npeople who have talent. We can all look that over and say it is not so, \nbut it is so. You are a very talented man, but talent is not enough. \nYou have to be loyal.\n  Senator Nickles is the second most senior serving Senator on the \nBudget Committee, 20 years. I am the one who was goofy enough to serve \nmore, but he was there during most of my time. Many times, Senator Don \nNickles did not get exactly what he wanted, but when it came to the \ntime of getting something for this Senate that would permit us to \nfollow that Budget Act, you never worried about Don Nickles. He may \nhave pushed and shoved and maybe held out to the end, but when the time \ncame that you said, We have to do this, Don, he understood. That is \nbecause of what he just said here today. He really loves this place. He \nlearned how to love it. He did not love it when he came here. He might \nhave told his colleagues that he started liking it, but he did not love \nit the first few years like he does now.\n  I had the privilege once of nominating him for a leadership job. He \nwill not ever forget that introduction because he was thinking I was \nnot going to be speaking in behalf of him, but I surely was. I said \nsomething like, Don Nickles came here and he was just too young. Then I \nproceeded to say, however, I have never seen a Senator mature as much \nand as fast as he has in terms of acquiring the skills and the capacity \nand understanding to be a Senator, after which time I suggested that he \nshould win that particular job he was seeking. He did, obviously. I did \nnot have anything to do with it, but nonetheless that is sort of the \nway I saw him for the first 8, 10, or 12 years.\n  Senator, you never stopped. You never stopped growing, and I think to \ngrow in this place, besides the qualities I have just described, you \nhave to end up understanding what the Senate is.\n  I have heard you many times in the last part of your career talk \nabout what a great place this is, and I really believe you understand \nit. I think you understand that it is not just some legislative body. \nYou have many times cast your vote, done your work, chastised and \nbegged, cajoled people to do things because you would tell them \nsometimes when it was urgent that this is the Senate and we cannot be \nall on our own. We have to be a part of this place, and sometimes you \nhave to do things to make it work.\n  I commend you for all of that and the policies and philosophies that \nyou brought here. We did not agree on some of them. We have not agreed \non everything, but I say the Senate was better off for every single day \nthat you were here, and it will not be quite as good until somebody \ncomes along and fills your seat. As our distinguished whip said, it is \na continuing place, and we will go on. But I honestly think there will \nbe sort of a place here for you, and we will remember how you used to \ndo things, and, yes, Senator, you will know how you grew in terms of \nworking with the other side. I mean, all of a sudden you would have \nsomething and we would wonder what is going on, and you would announce \nyour cosponsor and we would say, well, he started with something that \nwas not going to work, but he has been working at it and it is going to \nwork. I commend you for that. That is the end product of real growth \nand a real ability to get done what you thought was good.\n\n  So I will miss you and your wonderful family and your wife. You have \nbeen through some tough problems with the family just like many of us. \nYou have come through it strong and robust, and your children are \nbeautiful and successful.\n  As far as the prayer breakfast is concerned, you have stated this \nmorning in beautiful terms, just as a matter of fact, with Doug Coe and \nother names, but I can remember talking to you many times about that, \nhow it made you mature also in terms of your faith, in terms of how we \nprayed and how we did other things. For that relationship, I thank you. \nIt has little to do with the Senate, but if it were not for the Senate, \nwe would not have had that experience together.\n  So this is a good day because we get to say something about a great \nSenator, but on the other hand not so good a day because we say \ngoodbye. He is young enough to honestly spend another 24 years here. I \nam 72 and I have been here 33 years, so I clearly could have left a \nwhile ago. Then I would be out there doing whatever you are going to be \ndoing; I am sure you will have a lot more leisure time. You can hit the \nball. Me, maybe I could play with my 11 grandchildren now, and growing.\n  Thank you, Don. It has been great to be your friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise after listening to the words of \nour distinguished whip, who has been here more than a couple of \ndecades, and the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, who has been \nhere more than three decades. I have only been in the Senate a couple \nof years, but I do want to let the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma \nknow and say very publicly what an impact he has had on me and what \ndeep respect I have for him.\n  When he came here, he talked about having respect for the Senate, and \nI certainly understand that. It is somewhat overwhelming to me. As he \nkind of recapped the 24 years, talking about the love that he has for \nthis institution, I want to let him know what that means to somebody \nlike me who comes here certainly with that respect--that love is \nsomething that grows. Love is something that is in the heart.\n\n  As I reflect upon a colleague who has been here, who has had some \ntough things he has had to do, I say to my friend--truly my friend from \nOklahoma, the chairman of the Budget Committee--he is in an \ninstitution, surrounded by folks who like to say yes, who like to spend \nmoney. We like to take care of those around us who have needs. That is \na good thing. But we also have to have a fundamental understanding. As \nin any family, you have to know what you earn and you have to know what \nyou can spend. You have to have some discipline and you have to have \nsome values and you have to do the right thing. It is hard, because \nnaturally we want to say yes to those who come and say, We need help.\n  Because of the integrity of the Senator from Oklahoma, because of the \ndeep respect his colleagues have for\n\n[[Page S11535]]\n\nhim, he was able to guide us and help us understand what it meant to \nhold the line, to do the right thing, in the end, to build a stronger \nAmerica.\n  His philosophical foundation, framework, ``restoring economic freedom \nfor America,'' is something he said he started thinking about early, \nand that he always believed in it when he got here. Certainly in each \nand every thing I have seen him do here, it has been part of his core \nvalue, restoring economic freedom for America, so in fact we produce \nhope and opportunity and greater times for moms and dads. He has done \nit.\n  I cannot say I always thought it was the right thing to do. I can't \nsay that every time we voted the same way. But I do want to let the \nSenator from Oklahoma know how important his words and his values and \nhis integrity were, what they meant to me.\n  I have been going to the prayer breakfasts since I came to the \nSenate. I have listened to some of his helpful suggestions for \nstrengthening faith. They have made a difference. They have made an \nimpact.\n  You are going to be gone, physically gone, and the Senate will be \ndifferent. But I have no doubt, and I feel part of that, that your \nfaith and your love and your strength and what you have been about has \nhad a profound impact on so many of us here. It has had a profound \nimpact on me. Although you will not be here, know that as I go about \nmaking the decisions I make, I have no doubt I will reflect upon your \nwords, reflect upon what you might think is the right thing to do, and \nthen make the decisions I have to make.\n  You may be gone. You may move from this body. You are still a \nrelatively young man with a great family, a magnificent wife. You are a \nperson who can look back on all you have accomplished and still have \nthe opportunity to accomplish so much more. But I do want to thank the \nSenator from Oklahoma for his service. I thank him for the opportunity \nhe has given me to serve with him. I thank him for the impact he has \nhad on my life, hopefully making me a better Senator, a better humble \nservant, a person better able to contribute with a deeper appreciation \nof how important faith is to the service we give. I want him to know \nwhat he is about certainly will live with me in the time I have to \nstay. I simply want to say for all of that: Thank you and God bless \nyou.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, Don Nickles has been truly one of our \ngreat Senators for almost a quarter of a century. I join with the \nremarks of others who came before me, and particularly Mitch \nMcConnell's belief that Don Nickles is one of the best of all times in \nthis body.\n  He rode into Washington at the age of 30, determined to fight for a \nheartland vision of America with all his strength and energy. As he \nleaves here, still a young man, limping a little bit from that New York \nmarathon he just ran a few days ago, every one of us can say he was \ntrue to those ideals and extraordinarily effective in advocating them. \nThis Senate and this Nation is losing a tremendous champion. We are \nlosing one of our most valuable Members.\n  Don was a small businessman who had seen personally the oppression of \nmindless regulation and taxes and rules that make creating a business \nand creating jobs difficult and frustrating. He knows taxes stifle \ngrowth and human creativity and taxes mean a transfer of power and \nwealth from the people who have earned it by the fruit of their labor, \nsending it to Washington for governmental politicians to dispense.\n  He knows government spends too much and too wastefully. And he knows \nas a true man of faith that ultimately it is the families, the hearts, \nand the faith of America in which our strength resides.\n  Those values he holds and he holds them very strongly. For those \nvalues he has worked ably and courageously to his last day in the \nSenate. As his service here comes to an end, he can know that in each \nof these areas where he has committed himself, to a remarkable degree \nour country has made real progress. We have. He can and should take \ngreat pride in knowing he was a key player in effecting the historic \ntransformation of this country from an era of big government to an era \nin which even President Clinton would say: Big government is over.\n  The battle hasn't totally ended. The roaches will come back. No doubt \nwe will have to continue to spray. But tremendous progress has been \nmade. Don's critical role in this historic reversal of the liberal big \ngovernment vision as the answer to all our problems can be seen, in \npart, by examining the key positions he has held. He chaired the Budget \nCommittee, the Republican Policy Committee, the National Republican \nSenatorial Committee, the Republican Platform Committee for the \nRepublican National Convention, and he held a critical position of \nassistant Republican leader, the second person in charge here in the \nSenate.\n  During his career he has been involved in many key battles. One of \nthe most crucial was the lead he took in opposing the Clinton \nadministration one-size-fits-all health care plan in 1993. He offered a \ncountervision of consumer choice and for Americans he won that battle \nby blocking what I think to be ill-advised legislation. I know he took \ngreat pride when Congress passed the Medicare prescription drug bill \nlast year that included his vision for medical savings accounts and for \nmore competition in the health care industry. I didn't agree with \neverything in that bill, but the good parts he and I battled for are \ngoing to be important for years to come in health care in America.\n  Two years later, in 1995, he secured passage of the Congressional \nAccountability Act, which made Congress abide by the same health and \nsafety standards that employers around America did. That was an \nimportant psychological victory for those who suffered under Government \nregulation, that those of us who write the regulations have to abide by \nthem, too. In 1995 he authored the bill for families to receive $500 \nper child tax credit. Now it is $1,000 per child tax credit. When I \ncampaigned in 1996, it was one of the primary emphases of my campaign. \nI strongly believed, and believe to this day, that nothing has been \ndone to strengthen families more than allowing the working families \ntrying to raise children today to have an extra $1,000 in their pockets \nto take care of their children and their families. Don Nickles was the \none who drove that home.\n  In 1998, the International Religious Freedom Act that he referred to \nin his remarks became law. He has been a champion of religious freedom \nand rights. He worked to establish this commission to develop \nappropriate responses to violations of religious liberty worldwide. \nSince the bill's passage, the commission has issued four annual reports \non religious freedom and persecution around the world. This act will \nbecome more and more important as the years go by, as we are now seeing \na rise in religious intolerance and persecution around the world. Now \nwe have an authoritative source so the world can know how serious this \nproblem is, and that knowledge can help us lead to positive change.\n  The next year, the Senate passed the Patients' Bill of Rights \nlegislation.\n  Throughout 1998, Senator Nickles chaired a task force of Republican \nSenators, on which I served, working to better understand and respond \nto the concerns about managed health plans. His group wrote and \nintroduced the Patients' Bill of Rights-Plus, a responsible alternative \nto the plan that would have dramatically increased health care costs. \nIt was a terrific battle. Don called us together daily to prepare on \nhow to carry out the debate. The opposition said a massive intervention \ninto the American private insurance market by the Federal Government \nwas necessary, and anybody who dared oppose this huge Federal mandate \nwould just be run over by them. But Don proposed legislation that \ntargeted the real abuses, with minimum cost increases and limited \nFederal regulation.\n  His bill would have, in fact, impacted the cost of premiums only a \nfraction of what was proposed by the opposition.\n  It may now seem a small matter. At the time of that debate it was a \ncentral issue before the Congress for months, and pressure from the \nliberal news media to pass an expansive bill was great. There could be \nno doubt that his personal leadership on behalf of individual citizens \nand small businesses was a key factor in the successful effort to avoid \na fundamental takeover of private insurance in America.\n\n[[Page S11536]]\n\n  In 2003, he became chairman of the Budget Committee, and I had the \nhonor of serving as a member. During his chairmanship he made great \nstrides to protect the fiscal sanity of our country. He led the Budget \nCommittee during the time of war when our homeland was attacked and \nwhen we had a serious economic slowdown. He faced a surging national \ndebt, and it was a time of heated partisanship in an evenly divided \nSenate. I was doubtful that anything could be accomplished because of \nthe partisan atmosphere, and I told Don of my doubts.\n  I said: I am not sure we can produce a budget. He understood the \ndifficulty he was facing but was convinced that a responsible budget \nwas essential for America. He set to work with his usual skill and \ndetermination and commitment to principle and courtesy. He knew his \nbudget depended on many. There was, indeed, much political posturing on \nall sides as all maneuvered to promote their interests. But Don never \nwavered. He was confident, funny, gracious, and determined.\n  The result was a very responsible 2004 budget with good spending \nlimitations and caps. Wisely, he managed to make sure there would be a \ncap for fiscal year 2005, which we are in now, in case the budget would \nhave failed this year. Without doubt, this was a good plan. It was \ncritical that the Senate at that time pass a budget in a time of \nnational insecurity and great deficits. It impacted positively, I \nbelieve, the economic situation of our country.\n  We didn't produce a fiscal year 2005 budget, although Don gave it his \nall. I have never seen him work so hard. He tried everything that could \nbe done to achieve a budget for this year. That effort failed, but his \nfiscal year 2004 cap still made sure that we could maintain spending \ncontrol.\n  I could say more, but I will just close with the remarks that were \nshared by Phil Gramm as I talked about Don one time. I said something \ngood about him. And Phil Gramm, an astute observer and great Senator, \nshook his head and said: I am always amazed that this machine shop \noperator from Oklahoma is so consistently right on every issue that \ncomes up.\n  I agree. He has been consistently right for every year he has been \nhere. He has been the leader in the values that the American people \nshare. He has played a critical role in the development of a new vision \nfor government in America. He has produced regulations; he reduced \ntaxes; he has empowered people around the globe. It has been an honor \nand a pleasure for me to call him a friend and serve with him. I admire \nhim greatly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I came here primarily to listen this \nafternoon and show my respect for the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  My remarks will be very brief.\n  I want to begin with a story that I told the Senator from Oklahoma \nbefore. My mentor in politics is former majority leader of this body, \nHoward Baker. I got involved in politics because of him in the 1960s, \nwhen we were building a two-party system in Tennessee. I remember the \ncampaign of 1980. Senator Baker was the Republican leader. He changed \nthe name on the door from ``Minority Leader'' to ``Republican Leader'' \nbecause he didn't want the Republican Party thinking of itself as a \npermanent minority. Many people thought he was just whistling, \n``Dixie,'' so to speak.\n  At that time, there were 37, 38, or 39 Republican Members, and no one \nsaw much prospect of getting much further ahead of that.\n  Then came a tidal wave in 1980 with the election of President Reagan \nand 13 or 14 new Republican Senators. It went from fewer than 40 to \nmore than 50. Senator Baker had predicted that. I had learned to pay \nattention to him.\n  I saw him after the election. I said: Well, you were right about \nthat. You were about the only person who was. He said: I will tell you \none thing.\n  I said: What is that?\n  He said: Pay attention to Nickles.\n  I said: Who is Nickles?\n  He said: He is this young, 32- or 33-year-old new Senator from \nOklahoma, and he is going to be a real force to deal with.\n  I have paid attention to Senator Nickles ever since then. I have \nserved in the Senate with the Senator from Oklahoma, and during that \ntime I have seen him a lot. We have known each other. I think Senator \nBaker was correct. A lot of people have paid attention to Don Nickles \never since 1980. I am delighted to have had the privilege of serving 2 \nyears with him in the Senate.\n  In my experience, I have found him highly intelligent. He has been a \nbig help with the complex issues that we have here. He is principled. \nThat is important. And he has been easy to work with from the point of \nview of a colleague.\n  I heard his remarks to the new Senators that he was meeting with; he \nand the Senator from Louisiana spoke to them as they were stepping \ndown. He was suggesting that even though he is known as a principled, \neffective, and conservative Senator, he reminded them that in order to \nget things done in the Senate there has to be a consensus. And that \nusually means finding ways of dealing across the aisle with colleagues \nwe respect.\n  I am simply here today to show respect, not to make a speech.\n  I am glad to have that opportunity and finally to say something that \nmay be a little different from what some of your other colleagues have \nsaid.\n  I admire your decision, and from my perspective I think it is the \nright one. Life is big. It is more than politics. It is more than \ngovernment.\n  This is a big wonderful world in which we live. We live in a \nmagnificent country. There is a lot to savor.\n  For example, when I have been in and out of public life at different \ntimes and leaving the Governorship, going into the private sector was \nliberating. I found that my focus had been narrow and that there were a \ngreat many things about my personal life, about my family's life, about \nmy country's life, and about the private sector that I could get \ninvolved in and found very interesting. Over time I found I could come \nback to the public sector with a new energy, a broader experience and a \ndifferent perspective.\n  I don't know what the future may hold for you.\n  I think it is wise to make such an enormous contribution here, and at \nthe peak of that, to step out and take that to other places. For one, I \nhope the future will include, in some way, a contribution in the public \narena. But you certainly deserve a chance to explore the private arena.\n  It has been my privilege to know you and to serve with you, and to \nknow, once again, that Howard Baker was right in 1981 when he said, \n``Pay attention to Nickles.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nInvestigation Into Air Force Leasing of Boeing Aerial Refueling Tankers\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I intend to address the Senate for a \nperiod of time today. I believe I have as much as an hour under \npostcloture debate, but I will be discussing an issue I have been \ninvolved in for some 3 years now and have not reached a conclusion, \nalthough certainly enormous progress has been made in trying to address \nthis issue.\n  But during these 3 years since the appropriators slipped a $30 \nbillion rider in the fiscal year 2002 Defense appropriations bill, a \nlot of strange and unusual things have happened, I am sad to say, that \nare a very damming commentary about the way the Pentagon in general and \nthe Air Force in particular conducts its business.\n  I am going to tell a story that has not, as I said, reached its end. \nBut it has uncovered the very strong likelihood, because of the \nconfession by Ms. Druyun in Federal court when she pled guilty, that \nthere could be many billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money that \nwere wasted, criminally treated, and misused because of the decisions \nmade by Ms. Druyun. The question is, How could Ms. Druyun have done all \nthis by herself? Did she have accomplices or was the system in the \nPentagon so broken that one individual\n\n[[Page S11537]]\n\ncould make contracting decisions which entailed tens of billions of \ndollars, and in this case may have cost the taxpayers of America \nmillions and even billions of dollars as well?\n  Nearly 3 years ago, behind closed doors, the Appropriations Committee \nslipped a $30 billion rider in the fiscal year 2002 Defense \nappropriations bill. This rider authorized the Air Force to lease from \nBoeing up to 100 767s for use as aerial refueling tankers. Before the \nrider appeared in the bill, Air Force leadership never came to the \nauthorizing committees about this issue. In fact, tankers have never \ncome up in either the President's budget or the Defense Department's \nunfunded priority list. The Air Force's tanker lease program was born \nof a virgin birth.\n  The rider was, in fact, the result of an aggressive behind-the-scenes \neffort by the Boeing Corporation with considerable assistance from \nsenior Air Force procurement official Darleen Druyun and others. After \nthe President signed the bill into law, the Air Force embarked on \nnegotiating with Boeing a lease that would have cost the taxpayers \naround $6 billion more than an outright purchase of these aircraft \nwould have.\n  Soon after Air Force Secretary Jim Roche submitted to the four \nDefense committees a report on plans to lease these tankers from \nBoeing, three out of the four authorizing committees summarily approved \nthe lease without even looking at the contract. Two did so without even \nholding a single hearing.\n  Much to his credit, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John \nWarner held the line and refused to authorize the proposal, as did the \nranking member, Senator Carl Levin. Through the hearings and \ninvestigations that followed, we unearthed a crushing body of evidence \non how much a folly the proposal actually was.\n\n  Throughout 2002 and in the beginning of 2003, even agencies within \nthe Defense Department and the Air Force, including Program, Analysis \nand Evaluation, the Office of Management and Budget, and even the Air \nForce's own General Counsel's Office raised salient concerns about \naspects of the proposal. These concerns, however, would not get in the \nway of Air Force leadership.\n  Rather than resolve these concerns, Air Force proponents continued to \naggressively push the deal in the press. A Wall Street Journal \neditorial entitled ``John McCain's Flying Circus,'' published on the \nvery same day as the tanker hearing we had in the Commerce Committee, \nis particularly notable. It was obviously drafted with considerable \nhelp from the Office of the Air Force Secretary. In it, tanker \nproponents accused me of ``trying to prevent approval by running up my \nown Jolly Roger'' and brazenly exaggerated the Air Force's need for \ntankers by describing how, during Secretary Roche's visit to Tinker Air \nForce Base, he ``peeled back the skin of a tanker being refurbished and \nfound the metal underneath disintegrating before his very eyes.''\n  By this time, Air Force leadership's aggressive press campaign was \nwell underway. On April 25, 2002, Secretary Roche's special assistant, \nWilliam Bodie, told Secretary Roche that he:\n\n     saw Rudy deLeon [who heads Boeing's Washington office]--\n\n  And, by the way, he has rotated back and forth between the Congress \nand defense corporations and the Defense Department--he:\n\n     saw Rudy deLeon at the Kennedy Center and politely asked the \n     Great White Arab Tribe of the North [which is what these \n     folks called Boeing] to unleash their falcons on our behalf \n     for once. I talked to [defense analyst] Loren [Thompson], who \n     is standing by to comment to this reporter about the national \n     security imperatives of tanker modernization. [Editor of \n     Defense News and Air Force Times] Vago [Murandian] is also \n     standing by. I will get with [Assistant Air Force Secretary \n     for Acquisitions Marvin] Sambur first thing to rehearse \n     talking points.\n\n  Get that, ``to rehearse talking points'' with the editor of Defense \nNews and Air Force Times and defense analyst Loren Thompson: We will \nget with you before we talk to the reporter.\n  Among the falcons that Boeing ``unleashed'' was an op-ed that \nsubsequently appeared in Vago Muradian's Defense News. This piece, \nwhich strongly endorsed Boeing's tanker lease, was supposedly written \nby former Commander-in-Chief for U.S. Pacific Fleet Admiral Archie \nClemins. However, Admiral Clemins has admitted, and Boeing's e-mails \nreflect, that it was in fact ghost-written and placed by Boeing.\n  As this indicates, rather than address salient concerns regarding the \ntanker deal raised by their own staff, Air Force leadership focused on \nusing the press, which Mr. Bodie described as ``3rd Party support at \nits best'' to perpetuate the fiction that ``the lease was the exact \nopposite of a Boeing `bailout.' '' Among the spin that lease advocates \nfed the press, were statements like, ``[I] will not succeed in blocking \na 767 lease because tanker replacement is critical and [I] have offered \nno alternatives to leasing.''\n  While Air Force leadership was focused on pushing the deal in the \npress, analyses from several independent bodies, including the Defense \nDepartment's Office of the Inspector General, the Government \nAccountability Office, the Congressional Budget Office, the \nCongressional Research Service, the National Defense University, the \nCenter for Naval Analysis, the Institute for Defense Analyses, and \nothers criticized almost every aspect of the program. Perhaps most \nnotably, a Defense Science Board Task Force, vetted for conflicts with \nindustry only after my insistence, concluded that the need to replace \nthe current tanker fleet was not urgent. The Task Force's finding \ndebunked the numerous representations Air Force leadership made to the \ncontrary. Indeed, the Defense Science Board suggested that the Air \nForce's case on corrosion was virtually cut from whole cloth. Air Force \nleadership repeatedly cited this case as the biggest reason for having \ntaxpayers pay Boeing billions more than necessary.\n  About 2 months ago, Ms. Druyun was sentenced to 9 months in prison on \npublic corruption charges. Her crime: negotiating the $30 billion deal \nwith Boeing while negotiating with Boeing for a job. Ms. Druyun's \nsentencing occurred months after Boeing's board of directors fired her \nand former Chief Financial Officer Michael Sears for misconduct arising \nfrom the tanker negotiations. Boeing's Chief Executive Officer Phil \nCondit soon left the company under a cloud of suspicion.\n  In court papers accompanying her sentencing, Ms. Druyun admitted to \noverpricing Boeing's 767s as a ``parting gift'' to Boeing. She admitted \nthat she did this to ``ingratiate herself'' with her future employer \nand help secure employment for her daughter and future son-in-law at \nthe company. Astonishingly, Ms. Druyun also admitted that she similarly \nharmed the United States on behalf of Boeing on several other major \ndefense programs, including the NATO AWACS, C-130 AMP, and the C-17 \nprograms. How much taxpayers were fleeced remains unclear. These \ncontracts were in the billions. But this matter remains under \ninvestigation by the Justice Department and other authorities. The \nscope of these investigations seems to widen almost weekly. Ultimately, \nit is likely that Ms. Druyun's misconduct cost taxpayers an \nastronomical sum.\n  In yesterday's paper, Lockheed is bringing suit against Boeing for \nallegedly having involvement with bid rigging on other contracts as \nwell.\n  Over the past few weeks, Air Force leadership has tried to delude the \nAmerican people into believing that all of this happened because of one \nperson, and that because no one else has been hired for her position, \nthe problem has been solved. I don't buy it. I simply cannot believe \nthat one person, acting alone, can rip off taxpayers out of possibly \nbillions of dollars. This appears to be a case of either a systemic \nfailure in procurement oversight, willful blindness, or rank \ncorruption. Either way, full accountability among Air Force leadership \nis in order.\n  Just this week, Secretary Roche and Ms. Druyun's old boss, Assistant \nSecretary of the Air Force for Acquisitions Marvin Sambur, announced \ntheir resignations. But, among Air Force leadership, nor one has \nassumed responsibility for this debacle. Ms. Druyun is, perhaps \ngrudgingly, accepting responsibility for her role. To some extent, \nBoeing has accepted responsibility for its. The Justice Department and \nothers are continuing to ferret out others who may be responsible. \nHowever, accountability among Air Force leadership has been almost \nnonexistent. It seems that it is business as usual. Air Force \nleadership remains content laying all the\n\n[[Page S11538]]\n\nblame at the feet of a single individual, Darleen Druyun. I'm not \nbuying it.\n  Just on the Tanker Lease Proposal, the conduct of Air Force \nleadership has been unacceptable. First, Air Force leadership was never \ninterested in doing a formal ``analysis of alternatives'' for the \nmultibillion dollar tanker program. Such AOAs are typically always done \nfor major defense programs.\n  Second, Air Force leadership misrepresented to Congress how bad \ncorrosion afflicted the current tanker fleet. They did this to devise a \nreason why taxpayers needed to lease new tankers from Boeing, rather \nthan simply buy them at a much lower cost.\n  Third, according to independent analyses, Air Force leadership \noverstated ``operation and supply'' cost-growth estimates for the \ncurrent tanker fleet. This too was done to artificially bolster the \ncase that the current fleet needed to be replaced immediately, at a \ndramatically higher cost.\n  Fourth, Air Force leadership repeatedly misrepresented that its \nproposal was merely an ``operating lease.'' Their plan was to slip the \nprogram in the budget at a relatively modest initial cost, only to have \nactual costs balloon in the intervening years. We now know that this \nwas done to conceal the Tanker Lease Proposal's real budgetary impact.\n  By the way, they also had plans that the money to fund in the later \nyears, known as outyears in Pentagonese, that would be taken from the \nother services' budget.\n  Fifth, according to the Defense Department's Inspector General, the \ncommercial procurement strategy that Air Force leadership used in the \ntanker proposal (and, incidentally, the C-130J program) placed the \nDepartment at ``high risk for paying excessive prices,'' and precluded \n``good fiduciary responsibility for DoD funds.''\n  Sixth, the Inspector General found that, when the specifications for \nthe tanker were being developed, Air Force leadership let Boeing tailor \nthose specifications to Boeing's proposed tanker. They were not \ntailored to the operational requirements of the warfighter. They should \nhave been. Yet, Air Force leadership allowed an Air Force briefer to \ntell the Joint Staff that the tanker ``operational requirements \ndocument'' was not tailored to Boeing's aircraft. The Defense \nDepartment Inspector General, however, found that it was.\n  I could go on, but I'll stop here for now. As I've gone into many of \nthese points in excruciating detail in my letter to Secretary Rumsfeld \non July 28, 2004, I'll simply ask for unanimous consent to have my \nletter printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 28, 2004.\n     Hon. Donald H. Rumsfeld,\n     Secretary, Department of Defense\n     The Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am concerned about how the Analysis \n     of Alternatives (AoA) for the Tanker Lease Proposal will be \n     conducted. In particular, I am concerned about the \n     participation of Air Force leadership in the AoA, and the \n     involvement of the Air Force's federally funded research and \n     development center (FFRDC)--RAND, which I understand is \n     spearheading this effort.\n       The conduct of Air Force leadership regarding the Tanker \n     Lease Proposal has been unacceptable. Frankly, its \n     credibility on the recapitalization of the tanker fleet has \n     been fundamentally called into question. Notably, many of the \n     problems that the Department of Defense Office of the \n     Inspector General (DoD-OIG) found in the Tanker Lease \n     Proposal are similar to those it recently found in the \n     multibillion dollar C-130J procurement program. Bases for my \n     concern about the participation of Air Force leadership in \n     the AoA include, but are not limited to, the following.\n       First, the Air Force has provided Congress inaccurate \n     information in an attempt to justify its original proposal to \n     lease 100 Boeing KC-767As. For example, Air Force Secretary \n     Jim Roche has repeatedly advised Congress that, in the \n     existing KC-135 fleet, ``corrosion is significant, pervasive, \n     and represents an unacceptable risk.'' Secretary Roche has \n     also emphasized to Congress increased operating costs in the \n     current fleet as a basis for entering into the tanker lease. \n     Air Force leadership has indicated that these elements create \n     an ``urgent'' need to recapitalize the fleet. However, as you \n     of course know, the DSB task force concluded that the Air \n     Force's claims of unmanageable corrosion problems and cost \n     growth were overstated. As such, the task force also \n     concluded that ``[t]here is no compelling material or \n     financial reason to initiate a replacement program prior to \n     the completion of the AoA and the MCS.'' Thus, the task force \n     jettisoned the ``dominant reason'' Secretary Roche first \n     cited in his July 10, 2003, report to Congress as the basis \n     for having taxpayers pay billions of dollars more for leasing \n     tankers than they would for buying them. The Air Force's \n     representations on this issue remains a matter of continuing \n     investigative concern.\n       In another example, to comply with the original authorizing \n     statute, the Air Force misrepresented to Congress that its \n     proposal to lease 100 Boeing KC-767 tankers was merely an \n     operating lease. This would have obviated the requirement \n     that the White House obtain advance budget authority for the \n     whole lease proposal. But, the DoD-OIG and Program Analysis \n     and Evaluation (PA), as well as the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) and the General Accounting Office (GAO) found \n     that the procurement of these tankers is, in fact, a lease \n     purchase. In addition, facts surrounding the original lease \n     proposal made it clear that the transaction was a lease-\n     purchase: under the original proposal, the Air Force conceded \n     that the DoD is ``committed to earmark[ing] an additional $2B \n     in FY08 and FY09 for the purchase of aircraft covered by the \n     multi-year program under the terms of the proposed contract'' \n     to head off a funding spike over the Future-Years Defense \n     Program.\n       Second, the DoD-OIG and the NDU concluded that the Air \n     Force's commercial item procurement strategy ``prevented any \n     visibility into Boeing's costs and required the Air Force to \n     use a fixed-price type contract . . . The strategy also \n     exempted [Boeing] from the requirement to submit cost or \n     pricing data. The strategy places the Department at high risk \n     for paying excessive prices and precludes good fiduciary \n     responsibility for DoD funds.'' The NDU similarly concluded \n     that ``[i]n a sole source, monopoly commercial environment, \n     the government is not served well with limited price data'' \n     and suggested that the Air Force neglected its fiduciary/\n     stewardship responsibilities.\n       Notably, the DoD-OIG arrived at similar conclusions \n     regarding the Air Force's mismanagement of the C-130J \n     procurement program. In particular, the DoD-OIG found that, \n     because the C-130J was improperly acquired as a commercial \n     item, the Air Force did not have contractor-certified \n     information on contract prices, costs, or profits, and \n     therefore was ``limited'' in its ability to protect the \n     Government against possible overpricing.\n       Third, the DoD-OIG and the NDU also concluded that the \n     operational requirements document (ORD) for tankers was not \n     tailored, as it should have been, to the requirements of the \n     warfighter, but rather to closely correlate to the Boeing KC-\n     767A. The DoD-OIG found that senior Air Force staff directed \n     that the ORD closely correlate to the Boeing KC-767A that was \n     being developed for a foreign government, in anticipation of \n     the authorizing legislation. This is particularly troubling \n     where, according to an internal Boeing document regarding the \n     ORD, Boeing planned to ``establish clearly defined \n     requirements in ORD for the USAF Tanker configuration that \n     results in an affordable solution that meets the USAF mission \n     needs and will prevent an AOA from being conducted.'' Under \n     the current proposal, the first 100 tankers produced will not \n     be capable of, among other things, interoperability with \n     Navy, Marine, or coalition assets, or simultaneously \n     refueling more than one receiver aircraft. Rear Adm. Mark P. \n     Fitzgerald, USN, recently suggested that in theater, such a \n     limitation restricts the Navy's long range striking \n     capability and fosters a needlessly risky aerial refueling \n     environment.\n       Notably, with respect to the C-130J procurement program, \n     the DoD-OIG similarly found that, while the Air Force \n     conditionally paid Lockheed Martin about $2.6 billion, the C-\n     130J is not operationally suitable or effective and cannot \n     perform its intended mission. Furthermore, to date, 36 \n     deficiency reports that ``could cause death, severe injury or \n     illness, major loss of equipment or systems, or that could \n     directly restrict combat or operational readiness'' have been \n     received.\n       Finally, Boeing documents suggest that the Air Force \n     allowed Boeing to modify the requirements in the ORD while it \n     was being developed. These documents also reflect that the \n     Air Force induced the Joint Requirements Oversight Council \n     (JROC) into approving and validating the corrupted ORD by \n     falsely representing that it was not tailored to a specific \n     aircraft. This is of continuing investigative interest to the \n     Committee.\n       Interestingly, as a result of the commercial specifications \n     of the C-130J not meeting user needs, the Air Force (and \n     Marine Corp) decided to ``revise its requirements document'' \n     to reduce the initial capabilities required and to satisfy \n     operational requirement deficiencies through block upgrade \n     programs at the Government expense. I am very concerned about \n     this.\n       I understand that RAND (the Air Force's FFRDC), and Project \n     Air Force in particular, is spearheading the AoA. Generally, \n     the Air Force, specifically Dr. Sambur, is ``the overall \n     sponsor'' for Project Air Force activities. However, having \n     argued against the need for an AoA as early as November 2002, \n     according to a recently produced internal DoD e-mail, Dr. \n     Sambur has apparently prejudged its outcome:\n       ``A formal AoA will cost money, delay the program two \n     years, and still come up with the same answer we have today. \n     There are only a few aircraft that can serve as tankers, they \n     are already in production, and so analyzing their respective \n     capabilities and costs won't take long--in fact, it's already \n     been done and the results passed to OSD. What's left to \n     study?''\n\n[[Page S11539]]\n\n       As I originally indicated in my letter of March 12, 2004, \n     Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General T. Michael Moseley \n     similarly touted the Air Force's proposal to lease and buy \n     Boeing 767s during recent budget hearings. In particular, \n     General Moseley provided ``opinion'' testimony suggesting \n     that the KC-767 tanker is the Air Force's only viable option. \n     For example, in testimony before the Projection Force \n     Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, General \n     Moseley specifically rejected re-engining remaining KC-135Es \n     (as the DSB task force recommended); modifying used aircraft \n     (for example, DC-10s, also as the DSB task force suggested); \n     using contractor support services (as the GAO recently \n     opined), and other options that your office's AoA guidance \n     specifically required the Air Force to examine. While General \n     Moseley attempted to explain away his testimony as ``personal \n     opinion,'' at no time was he asked to provide his personal \n     opinion and at no time during his testimony did General \n     Moseley indicate that he was conveying a personal opinion. \n     Considering General Moseley's role as the chairman of the Air \n     Force Steering Group for Project Air Force and, respectfully, \n     despite your assurances in your March 17, 2004, letter, I \n     remain concerned that the Air Force and RAND have effectively \n     prejudged the outcome of the AoA regarding the Tanker Lease \n     Proposal.\n       Several recently produced internal DoD e-mails call into \n     question whether the ongoing AoA will be conducted \n     objectively. For example, in an e-mail, dated August 15, \n     2003, from Secretary Roche to Dr. Sambur and Acting \n     Undersecretary Wynne, Secretary Roche dissuaded the OSD and \n     Air Force staff from initiating an AoA. In this e-mail, \n     Secretary Roche said the following:\n       ``Agggggg, stop the nonsense! Don't even begin to start an \n     unnecessary AoA at this point. All this would do is give the \n     enemies of the lease an excuse from DoD to delay the 'lease, \n     and really honk off the Appropriators. Let's see what comes \n     out of conference, damn it! If the lease is approved then we \n     can talk about how to decide on the recapitalization of the \n     other 400 airplanes, but there is no rush here.''\n       Soon thereafter, Acting Secretary Wynne responded, ``I \n     agree with Jim, [sic] What started this flurry of activity? \n     I'd hate for our story to change.'' The foregoing does not \n     inspire confidence that the current AoA will be conducted \n     properly.\n       My concern that RAND, in particular, may have prejudged the \n     outcome of the AoA is underscored by its conclusion regarding \n     tanker recapitalization in a recent report. In a December \n     2003 report entitled ``Investigating Optimal Replacement of \n     Aging Air Force Systems,'' RAND, in particular Project Air \n     Force, found--without the benefit of an AoA--that ``it \n     appears to be optimal to replace the KC-135 by the end of the \n     decade.'' Apparently relying on Air Force data and analysis \n     that was ultimately rejected by the DSB task force, this \n     conclusion comes unacceptably close to prejudging the outcome \n     of the AoA and is inconsistent with the conclusions of the \n     Air Force's own Economic Service Life Study; the GAO; and, \n     most recently, the DSB task force, all of which found that \n     the current fleet is viable through 2040. In light of the \n     relationship between the RAND and the Air Force, as described \n     above, there can be no assurance that RAND will conduct the \n     AoA here with the desired independence.\n       My concerns appear to be reflected in a recently released \n     internal DoD e-mail from Eric Coulter, Deputy Director for \n     Theater Assessments and Planning at Program, Analysis and \n     Evaluation (PA) to Nancy Spruill, co-chairperson of the \n     Leasing Review Panel Working Group, dated August 7, 2003:\n       ``I do not support RAND as the sole source or lead to \n     conduct the Congressionally-directed independent tanker AoA. \n     First, its [sic] sad that it takes Congress to direct the \n     Department to do something it should do on its own. We've \n     been Wingto get the AF to conduct an AoA for several years, \n     but could never get AT's support to direct one. The AF \n     clearly wanted to postpone it for as long as possible to \n     delay the issue of recapitalizing the fleet. Now the \n     Department is playing catch up. That said, [the Institute for \n     Defense Analyses (IDA)] has more experience to conduct this \n     type of effort. In fact, [Air Mobility Command] relies on IDA \n     to do a lot of its mobility analyses both for airlift and \n     tankers. I believe the Department will get a better, more \n     objective product than we would from RAND. I hope we're not \n     letting IDA's cost review of the tanker lease color our \n     opinion. Please convince me otherwise.''\n       I am also concerned about the fact that Project Air Force \n     may have received as much as $50 million for FY03 and FY04 \n     and is expected to get at least another $25 million for FY05. \n     This financial relationship between the Air Force and RAND \n     renders RAND unsuitable for conducting the AoA on this \n     multibillion dollar procurement proposal.\n       Given the foregoing, I respectfully suggest that the Air \n     Force not enter into an agreement to procure aerial refueling \n     aircraft until an entity independent of the Air Force--on the \n     basis of a study not funded directly or indirectly by the Air \n     Force--completes the AoA.\n       As always, I appreciate your consideration.\n           Sincerely;\n                                                      John McCain,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. What I would like to do now is discuss documents, \nbelatedly produced by the Defense Department, that underscore the need \nfor accountability among Air Force leadership regarding the tanker \nlease proposal. While the total number of documents that the Defense \nDepartment has produced remains unsatisfactory, the few that have been \nproduced are compelling.\n  On February 5, 2002, Air Force Secretary Roche personally assured me, \nin testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the tanker \nprogram, that he ``believed in competition,'' and ``would come back to \nCongress'' if another competitive proposal was particularly good.\n  Secretary Roche's e-mails, however, suggests that he is indeed a man \nwho allows his personal animus to stifle competition. For example, on \nSeptember 5, 2002, Darleen Druyun wrote to Secretary Roche, ``I read \nwith disgust the article on Airbus tankers from the new EADS CEO of \nNorth America. What BS . . . should not have been surprised at the \nslime . . . his day of reckoning will come hopefully.''\n  Secretary Roche answered, ``Oy. I agree. I had hoped you would have \nstayed and tortured him slowly over the next few years until EADS got \nrid of him!''\n  This is from the guy who says he believes in competition. His \npersonal contempt for one defense contractor, and particularly its CEO, \nis clearly reflected in his other e-mails.\n  For example, on August 7, 2002, when Secretary Roche learned that \nRalph Crosby, with whom Secretary Roche once worked at Northrop \nGrumman, was appointed to the head EADS' North American operations, \nSecretary Roche wrote to his special assistant, William Bodie:\n\n       Well, well, we'll have fun with Airbus.\n\n  The day after, William Swanson at Raytheon asked Secretary Roche:\n\n       Did you see the notice on Ralph in EADS?\n\n  Secretary Roche responded:\n\n       Right. Privately between us: Go Boeing! The fools in Paris \n     and Berlin never did their homework. And, Ralphie is the CEO \n     and chairman of a marketing firm, for that's all there is to \n     EADS, North America. The [Air Force] has problems with EADS \n     on a number of levels. The widespread feelings about Crosby \n     and the Air Staff, Jumper especially, will only make their \n     life more difficult. Smiles.\n\n  On September 4, 2002, Mr. Bodie wrote Secretary Roche complaining \nabout statements EADS issued about its tanker proposal:\n\n       We don't have to turn the other cheek, you know. I'm ready \n     to tell the truth about Airbus' boom, footprint, and \n     financial shortcomings. But maybe we should sleep on it.\n\n  In response, Secretary Roche wrote:\n\n       No, sir, save it and blow him away. He admits they were not \n     technically qualified! And, we keep their record of bribes as \n     our trump card!\n\n  This is the Secretary of the Air Force communicating with an \nassistant of his saying ``we keep their record of bribes as our trump \ncard.'' Remarkable.\n  Taken together, these documents inject serious doubt into Secretary \nRoche's commitment to competition in contracting, about which he \nassured me in congressional testimony.\n  During hearings on the controversy in the Senate Commerce Committee \nand the Senate Armed Services Committee, I expressed concern about \nSecretary Roche asking Boeing to pressure dissenting elements within \nthe Office of the Secretary of Defense into playing ball on tankers.\n  However, in congressional testimony, Secretary Roche categorically \ndenied this. For example, at a September 3, 2003, Commerce Committee \nhearing, I asked Secretary Roche about a Boeing e-mail dated 23 June \n2003, ``Subject: Roche Meeting 23 June 2003.'' In particular, I asked \nSecretary Roche:\n\n       Do you have any recollection whatsoever of telling . . . \n     anyone . . . from Boeing to put pressure on [Acting Assistant \n     Secretary for Acquisitions] Mike Wynne to convince [Program \n     Analysis, and Evaluation] to write a new letter essentially \n     undoing the first letter [which criticized the proposal]?\n\n  After significant waffling, Secretary Roche responded:\n\n       No, sir. I talked to [PA Director] Ken Krieg, and in \n     fact, I told him, ``Don't bother writing another letter.'' We \n     understood these were his arguments.\n\n  Again, on September 4, 2003, at a hearing before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I asked the same question to Secretary Roche:\n\n\n[[Page S11540]]\n\n\n       Do you have any recollection whatsoever of telling . . . \n     anyone . . . from Boeing to put pressure on Mike Wynne to \n     convince PA to write a new letter essentially undoing \n     the first letter?\n\n  I might say that the first letter from this part of the Pentagon was \nvery critical of the tanker lease deal. This time Secretary Roche \ntestified:\n\n       I did not ask them to put pressure [on Wynne].\n\n  Finally, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nMarch 2, 2004, Secretary Roche adamantly denied asking the Boeing \ncompany to put pressure on Mike Wynne. Secretary Roche said:\n\n       I've told you there was no pressure. . . .[I] certainly did \n     not tell them to pressure anybody.\n\n  Secretary Roche's e-mails, however, paint a very different picture.\n  From Boeing's e-mails, here is what we know. In a June 23, 2003, e-\nmail to Jim Albaugh, who is head of Boeing's defense subsidiary, Boeing \nexecutive Thomas Owens described a meeting during which Secretary Roche \nexpressed serious concerns about this letter from Mr. Ken Krieg. Mr. \nKrieg is the Director of Program Analysis, and Evaluation at the Office \nof the Secretary of Defense. His letter was key. In that letter, \nDirector Krieg concluded that the original Boeing proposal failed two \nkey Government accounting rules and, therefore, violated the \nauthorizing legislation.\n  According to Mr. Owens's e-mail, Secretary Roche ``ask[ed] [Boeing] \nto put pressure on [Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisitions] Mike Wynne to convince PA to write a new letter \nessentially undoing the first letter.''\n  Soon after, Dr. Sambur wrote Secretary Roche regarding the PA \nletter saying:\n\n       Boss, this is getting ridiculous.\n\n  Secretary Roche wrote to Acting Assistant Secretary Wynne as follows:\n\n       Ever since Pete--\n\n  They are talking about former Assistant Secretary Aldridge--\n\n     left, the bureaucrats who opposed the 767 lease have come out \n     of the woodwork to try to kill it--yet, once again, Mike, I \n     won't sign a letter that makes the case that we shouldn't \n     lease the planes. Ken Krieg's memo attached is a cheap shot, \n     and I'm sure has already been delivered to the enemies of the \n     lease on the Hill. It is a process foul. And Ken needs to be \n     made aware of that by you! I can't control the corporate \n     staff on acquisition issues. Mike, this is their way of \n     asserting dominance over you. I know this sounds wild, but \n     animals are animals. Pete had beaten them down. Now, they're \n     taking you on. I'm sorry. Expecting professional behavior \n     from them is something I gave up on a while back. Among other \n     things, they are about to embarrass SecDef--\n\n  That is Secretary of Defense--\n\n     who having approved the lease, will now have to explain why \n     his staff is destroying the case for it. I'll do whatever I \n     can to help you, Mike, but [it's] your job to get the \n     corporate staff under control. If not now, then they will \n     overrun you whenever you ``don't behave'' according to their \n     desires. This is a game they played for years. [They] and OMB \n     are trying to set the Air Force up to be destroyed by Sen \n     McCain with OSD--\n\n  Office of Secretary of Defense--\n\n     and OMB--\n\n  Office of Management and Budget--\n\n   arguments. As you might imagine, I won't give them the chance, but I \n     will make it clear who is responsible to Don [Rumsfeld]. I \n     refuse to wear my flack jacket backwards!\n\n  This is after testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nthat Secretary Roche never put any pressure on anybody. This is \nremarkable.\n  Subsequently, Assistant Secretary Wynne reprimanded Director Krieg. \nIn response to an e-mail from Director Krieg that attempted to clear \nthe air, Secretary Roche rather disingenuously answered:\n\n       Kenny, I love you, and you know that. I think you have been \n     had by some members of the famous PA staff. You never \n     should have put what you put in writing. It will now be used \n     against me and Don Rumsfeld.\n\n  Other e-mails corroborate that Secretary Roche suggested to Boeing \nthat it lobby the Office of the Secretary of Defense to undercut \nProgram Analysis and Evaluation. For example, a December 17, 2002, e-\nmail from Boeing's top lobbyist Andy Ellis to Rudy deLeon, who heads \nBoeing's Washington office and served as a Deputy Defense Secretary in \n2000 and 2001 described ``some quick notes from Jim [Albaugh]'s meeting \ntoday. It instructed, ``Please do not re-distribute this e-mail.'' The \ne-mail memorialized what was said during ``[a] meeting with Sec. \nRoche'' as follows:\n\n       PA now a problem on tankers--arguments include price, 767 \n     footprint and prospects for ``used 767s.'' Boeing needs to do \n     more on behalf of tankers in the Office of Secretary of \n     Defense. PA working to convince Aldridge to delay--reengine \n     while doing an analysis of alternatives. We should vector \n     hill support for tankers at Aldridge. . . . said he is very \n     comfortable with the price air force has on tanker, and very \n     comfortable with overall deal. It is the right time to do \n     this deal. He is waiting until early January to push on the \n     Office of Management and Budget--wants to deal with the next \n     congress, not the current. . . . Boeing needed to work White \n     House and especially Office of Secretary of Defense.\n\n  That is from the Secretary of the Air Force.\n  Other e-mails recently produced by the Department of Defense \ncorroborate the shocking dynamic whereby Secretary Roche apparently \norchestrated efforts against tanker lease critics within the Office of \nthe Secretary of Defense. For example, in a May 7, 2003, e-mail, Paul \nWeaver, a Boeing lobbyist and former Director of the Air National \nGuard, wrote Secretary Roche as follows:\n\n       Rudy [DeLeon] called me and said that Marv Sambur was \n     getting beat up by Mike Wynne again concerning the $125 \n     million number per aircraft. Rudy would like to know if he \n     needs to do anything like calling in the big guns to help \n     out. I told him I would query you to get your advice.\n\n  In response, Secretary Roche wrote:\n\n       It's time for the big guns to quash Wynne! Boeing won't \n     accept such a dumb contract form and price, and Wynne needs \n     to ``pay'' the appropriate price!\n\n  Now, that is the Secretary of the Air Force talking about another \nmember of the Pentagon in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, \nProgram Analysis and Evaluation:\n\n       Wynne needs to ``pay'' the appropriate price.\n\n  I wonder what he was talking about.\n  These e-mails call into serious question whether Secretary Roche was \ntruthful in testifying that he had not directed Boeing to pressure \ntanker lease critics within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to \nplay ball.\n  During last year's hearings, we released e-mails indicating that \nSecretary Rumsfeld's policy analysts may have been improperly lobbying \nthe Office of the Secretary of Defense in support of the tanker lease \nproposal. Another set of e-mails, only recently produced, give a fuller \npicture of this issue. For example, in an October 9, 2002, e-mail, \nDarleen Druyun wrote Secretary Roche and Dr. Sambur saying:\n\n       I would like to informally brief [Defense Science Board \n     Chairman] Bill Schneider on tanker leasing when he gets back \n     from Germany. I had briefed him during the transition about \n     the idea of leasing as a viable acquisition alternative. He \n     has apparently had a positive conversation with Wolfowitz on \n     leasing and is interested in quietly helping us.\n\n  This is the head of the Defense Science Board, who is supposed to be \nmaking decisions about weapons systems and other acquisitions, and he \nis ``interested in quietly helping us.''\n\n       If you give the nod we will use the same charts we used to \n     brief Gingrich which was very positively received by him.\n\n  Secretary Roche responded:\n\n       Please do. Thanks much.\n\n  This e-mail, and others I have released, raise serious questions \nabout the undue influence that industry exerts on procurement decisions \nin the Pentagon. What is striking here is that in this case, Air Force \nleadership seems to have been deep in the middle of it.\n  To what I have described already, add the doctoring of documents \nproduced to Congress. After SASC, Senate Armed Services Committee, \nstaff returned from their visit from Tinker Air Force Base in October \n2003, they asked for some placards that reflected unusually low failure \nrates associated with component parts of the KC-135s maintained there. \nThat is the present Air Force fleet of tankers. Shockingly, what the \nSenate Armed Services Committee staff received were altered versions of \nwhat they asked for. I conveyed my concerns about these doctored \ndocuments directly to Secretary Roche. In Secretary Roche's February \n27, 2004, response to me, he conceded that the information that the \nSenate Armed Services Committee requested was intentionally deleted. In \nparticular, he explained:\n\n\n[[Page S11541]]\n\n\n\n       As those placards featured ``Tinker-only'' information, and \n     because our installations and logistics professionals strive \n     to present a complete and timely picture of our fleet, they \n     amended the placard file by omitting the ``Tinker-only'' \n     occurrence factors.\n\n  To add insult to injury, the explanation that the Air Force \nleadership provided to the press about what happened was different \nentirely. Furthermore, we have yet to learn who in Secretary Roche's \noffice directed that the information that Congress asked for be \ndoctored before it was delivered.\n  It seems that whatever documents Air Force leadership did not doctor, \nthey improperly withheld.\n  For example, on Friday, September 10, 2004, the White House Counsel's \nOffice and the Office of Management and Budget brought to my staff's \nattention a very troubling e-mail stream between Secretary Roche and \nsenior OMB official, Robin Cleveland. After Darleen Druyun went to work \nfor Boeing, Ms. Cleveland, the Associate Director for National Security \nPrograms, represented the Government in negotiating with Boeing on the \ntanker lease proposal.\n  In this e-mail stream beginning on May 9, 2003, Ms. Cleveland asked \nSecretary Roche to help her brother get a job at Northrop Grumman. The \ne-mail said:\n\n       Jim, this is my brother's [Peter Cleveland's] stuff. I \n     would appreciate anything you can do to help with NG--\n\n  that means Northrop Grumman--\n\n       He is an incredibly hard working, disciplined guy--worked \n     full-time, with two little kids, putting himself through law \n     school at night. I would be grateful. Thanks very much. Robin\n\n  About half an hour later, Secretary Roche gave Mr. Cleveland's resume \nand cover letter, and, under color of his office and title, vouched for \nhim to Steve Dyslas, a Northrop Grumman executive:\n\n       I know this guy. He is good. His sister (Robin) is in \n     charge of defense and intel at OMB. We used to work together \n     in senior staff. If Peter Cleveland looks good to you, pls \n     [sic] add my endorsement.\n\n  A few minutes later, Secretary Roche wrote Ms. Cleveland in an e-\nmail:\n\n       Be well. Smile. Give me tankers now. (Oops. Did I say that? \n     My new deal is terrific.)\n\n  Now, the person who is responsible for overseeing the national \nsecurity programs at the Office of Management and Budget, the watchdog \nof all the budgetary issues in America, that one specifically charged \nwith overseeing tankers, asked the Secretary of the Air Force to get \nher brother a job. He, under his title and name, contacts the defense \ncorporation that does business with the U.S. Air Force and asks them to \ngive Ms. Cleveland's brother a job, and then after sending it, sends an \ne-mail back to Ms. Cleveland:\n\n       Be well. Smile. Give me tankers now. (Oops. Did I say that? \n     My new deal is terrific.)\n\n  On May 15, 2003, Ms. Cleveland responded to her brother in an e-mail \nentitled: ``Interview at NG,'' saying, ``Great. Hope it works before \nthe tanker leasing issue gets fouled up.''\n  Until these e-mails were brought to our attention by the White House, \nwe never even knew about them. In a meeting with me on September 13, \n2004, White House Counsel Judge Alberto Gonzales told me that someone \nin Secretary Roche's office concluded that these e-mails were a joke \nand therefore they did not need to be produced.\n  That has to be taken in the context that they told me that they would \ngive me these e-mails as part of our oversight responsibility. The \nSecretary of the Air Force decided the e-mails that I just cited were \nnot relevant to the tanker deal. So if there is some level of mistrust \nthat exists between me and my office and the Secretary, maybe that \nclears up that degree of mistrust a little bit.\n  Given all the scandal and controversy surrounding the tanker lease \nproposal, and especially given the keen interest that Chairman Warner \nand I have expressed regarding potential Air Force misconduct, the \nunilateral decision made by Air Force leadership to withhold this \ndocument is profoundly disturbing.\n  Keeping a defense contractor's ``record of bribes'' as a ``trump \ncard''; ``torturing'' a defense contractor ``slowly''; pressuring \ndissenting elements within the Office of the Secretary of Defense whose \njob it was, particularly in the absence of a Defense Acquisition \nBoard--in other words a formal analysis--to vet this procurement \nprogram; signing off on a plan to get the chairman of the Defense \nScience Board to ``quietly help'' on the tanker lease inside the OSD; \ndoctoring and improperly withholding documents requested by Congress: \nthis is the picture that we are getting on what happened with the \ntanker proposal, and we have received only a few documents from 6 out \nof 30 people we have asked for. This is the picture we are getting, but \nno one among Air Force leadership stands up to assume responsibility. \nInstead, what we get from Air Force leadership is deeply troubling \nstatements in the press about how rosy things are. For example, in a \nrecent op-ed appearing in Defense News, Dr. Sambur describes the \ncurrent acquisition process as ``healthy'' and ``on track.''\n  Hoping that Air Force leadership will ``get it'' now may perhaps be \ntoo much, when they didn't ``get it'' then. In that context, I find \nparticularly troubling an e-mail from Air Force Under Secretary Teets \nto Secretary Roche sent just 3 days after Boeing announced the firing \nof CFO Michael Sears and Vice President Darlene Druyun. In it, Under \nSecretary Teets writes:\n\n       Jim, I think it is important for you to know all I know \n     about the situation surrounding the tankers . . . Late \n     Tuesday afternoon I talked to Marv Sambur and got his \n     assurance that a thorough review of the Darlene situation had \n     been completed and there was no way Darlene had any influence \n     on our plan for tankers. Furthermore, Marv said that a letter \n     had been prepared for the DepSecDef to send over to the SASC \n     indicating same, and notifying them of our intent to proceed.\n\n  So two people are fired by Boeing because of information that has \ncome to light about improper behavior and later the individual pleads \nguilty in court--in fact, both of them have now pled guilty in court. \nMs. Druyun has confessed that she rigged the contracts as a ``parting \ngift to Boeing'' in behalf of her daughter and son-in-law's employment.\n  Meanwhile, the Under Secretary of the Air Force writes to the \nSecretary of the Air Force that he talked to Marv Sambur, the Assistant \nSecretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, and got his assurance that \n``a thorough review of the Darlene situation had been completed and \nthere was no way Darlene had any influence on our plan for the \ntankers.''\n  I am amazed. I am amazed.\n  One thing is for sure: the final chapter on the tanker lease proposal \ncannot be closed until all the stewards of taxpayers funds who \ncommitted wrongdoing, are held accountable. In order to get a full \naccounting of what happened on the tanker lease proposal, I will \ncontinue to insist that all the documents that the Senate Armed \nServices Committee has asked for, be produced--no matter how long it \ntakes\n  In closing, Air Force Doctrine Document 1-1 on Leadership and Force \nDevelopment contains a section setting forth the Air Force's core \nvalues. There are three: integrity, service before self, and excellence \nin all they do. The first, integrity, includes the indispensable \ncharacteristics of accountability, responsibility, honesty, and honor. \nWhen it comes to Air Force leadership's conduct regarding the tanker \nlease proposal and related congressional probes, I must however ask: \nwhere is the accountability and the responsibility; where is the \nhonesty and the honor; where have these core values been over the past \n3 years, and where are they now? To eschew accountability here is to do \na profound disservice to the good men and women who wear the uniform of \nthe United States Air Force honorably, capably, and proudly.\n  For those in the public interested in what I have discussed today, I \nwill be posting all of these documents on my website, \nwww.mccain.senate.gov.\n  In closing, the scandal continues to widen. Yesterday one of the \ncompetitors of Boeing alleged that information was leaked by Ms. \nDruyun, and the CEO of Boeing. I don't know if it is true. I doubt if \nit is true. I have no way of knowing. But the scandal continues to \nunfold. As I said, we have only received a small percentage of the \ndocuments and e-mails that we have asked for.\n  This is a very sad chapter. I was asked last week by a reporter for \nthe Air Force Times if this was personal with me, this issue I have \ndiscussed on the Senate floor for the past half hour or so.\n\n[[Page S11542]]\n\n  It is personal in this respect. It is personal that I had the \nprivilege of serving in the U.S. military and wearing the uniform. I \nbelieve we always expect not only the same standard but a higher \nstandard of conduct of the men and women who wear the uniform, and the \nvast majority, 99 and 44/100 percent of the men and women who wear the \nuniform conduct themselves with the highest degree of honor, courage, \nand integrity. But here we have individuals who have, obviously, \nbehaved in a less than honorable fashion. That is why it is necessary \nwe get to the bottom of this.\n  Next year, beginning January, we are going to have to look at the \nwhole procurement process as it works today in the Department of \nDefense, because we have just found out that Ms. Druyun, in her guilty \nplea, said she was involved in rewarding Boeing on several other \ncontracts, not just the Boeing tanker lease. We have no idea how much \nmoney that is. But it brings a profound question here: How could one \nperson do this? How could one person alone in the whole Pentagon--I \nhave forgotten how many thousands of people work there--have done this \nand they not know about it? If they didn't know about it, what kind of \na system is it that allows such a thing to take place, over a period of \nyears?\n  I deeply regret having been involved in this. But I also remind my \ncolleagues that the way this thing started was the insertion in an \nappropriations bill that was one line that no member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee had any knowledge of nor did the Senate Armed \nServices Committee have a single hearing on before this appeared as a \nline item in an appropriations bill. That is not the way to do \nbusiness.\n  I would allege to you right now, if it had gone through the normal \nauthorization process perhaps this whole scandal wouldn't have unfolded \nthe way it did because we would have had a hearing. We would have \nscrutinized the proposal. We would have gone through the normal \nprocess. Instead, we spent 3 years fighting a rearguard action and \nthrough the sheerest kind of luck, in many respects, we are able to \nidentify this wrongdoing.\n  I hope we can get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible and \nfind lessons learned, find out how much money we can reclaim, if \nnecessary, on behalf of the taxpayers, so that if, indeed, Ms. Druyun's \nstatement is true--and I have no reason not to believe what she \nconfessed to, that she issued a number of contracts that were \ndetrimental to the cause of the American taxpayer--we can reform the \nsystem so this kind of thing can never happen again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, obviously, in the brief time here I am not \ngoing to be able to say everything that comes to mind about the \nSenators who are retiring but to summarize a little bit of the \ninformation for the benefit of those who might be watching.\n  When you have long, distinguished careers of Senators and they decide \nnot to run for reelection but leave the body, there is a lot that comes \nto mind about their service. I think it is good to remind ourselves of \njust a few of these things because of the service they have provided, \nboth to the people of their own States and to the United States.\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  Starting, for example, with our colleague from Oklahoma, Don Nickles, \nhe served both in the leadership of the Senate Republican Conference as \nwell as chairman of the Budget Committee. The last 2 years of his time, \nduring his chairmanship of that committee, he was deeply involved on \nbehalf of taxpayers in saving literally hundreds of billions of dollars \nin taxpayer money that might otherwise have been spent but for his hard \nwork in ensuring that we had the procedural mechanisms in place to \nobject to excess spending.\n  Second, ensuring that taxpayers could keep more of their money. \nHelping to get passed significant tax reform, especially during the \nfirst term of President Bush, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts in particular, \ncoupled with the tax cuts of this past year, has meant substantial \nsavings for all American taxpayers.\n  The marginal rate reductions accelerated in 2003, and the reduction \nin capital gains and dividend tax rates, have been a substantial reason \nthat the economy has moved forward as quickly as it has.\n  Senator Don Nickles was significantly involved in every one of those, \nand his leadership in tax policy is going to be sorely missed when he \nleaves the Senate.\n  He got his start in Nickles Machinery back in Ponca City, OK, and he \nunderstood early on the lessons of how Government involvement in \nbusiness could make it much more difficult to not only grow a business \nbut to employ people and to contribute to the economy. It is one of the \nreasons, when his father passed away, that he began to understand how \nthe estate tax can act in a pernicious way on American families when \nhis business had to actually sell off part of its equity in order to \npay the estate tax, to make it more difficult for them to stay in \nbusiness, to employ the people they did, and do the work they did. He \nunderstood, therefore, from practical experience why we needed to \nreform the Tax Code, and he was instrumental in the reformation of the \nestate tax as well with the spouses' deduction, which was largely his \nwork.\n  There is so much more one could say about the efforts of Senator Don \nNickles. He is a great friend of all of us. In addition to being very \nfocused on getting the work done, he always managed to do so with a \nsmile on his face and a slap on the back in a way that made it hard for \npeople to disagree with him even when they didn't particularly follow \nhis legislative agenda.\n  Don Nickles will be very much missed in the Senate. He leaves, even \nafter 24 years, at such a young age that he will be in Washington and \naround this country in a way to continue to have interaction with us. \nWe all cherish that because of our friendship with Don Nickles.\n  It is bittersweet that Don will be leaving the Senate, but we know \nafter his significant contributions to this country he certainly \ndeserves an opportunity to move on.\n\n\n                    Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to say a word about another of our \ncolleagues, Ben Nighthorse Campbell. Senator Campbell and I served \ntogether in the House of Representatives. He is unique in the history \nof the Senate. He is a Native American who came first to the House and \nthen to the Senate. He represents the people of the State of Colorado, \nas does the Presiding Officer, with distinction. He is a real man of \nthe people. He is a jeweler, a motorcycle enthusiast, a real athlete--\nan Olympian, as a matter of fact, in judo. He is a man whose interests \nare extensive beyond the kind of humdrum interests sometimes we in the \nSenate focus on. He brought a lot of spirit and a lot of light to this \nbody. I know Ben will be missed by every one of us as well.\n\n\n                        Senator Peter Fitzgerald\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my colleague Peter Fitzgerald from Illinois \nis an extraordinarily smart and focused individual who came to the \nSenate to represent his State of Illinois and did so with great \npassion, enthusiasm, and courage, in some cases, when he had to stand \nagainst a lot of other Members who were attempting to act in ways he \nfelt were inimical to the interests of his State.\n  Peter Fitzgerald, though here only one term, I think will be \nremembered as a great Senator from the State of Illinois and certainly \na colleague I will miss personally.\n\n\n                          Senator Zell Miller\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me mention our colleague Zell Miller. \nZell\n\n[[Page S11543]]\n\nMiller is another person who will be in the history books of this body \nbecause of his passion and because of his unique character as well. He \nis probably best exemplified by one of the books he has written called \n``Corps Values,'' obviously a reference to the U.S. Marine Corps, in \nwhich he describes how a lot of the values that have animated the \ncourse of his career and the values he has held dear throughout the \nrest of his life came from his training as a marine and from his drill \nsergeant whom he describes so vividly in the book as having almost \nliterally pounded some very important lessons of life into Zell's head \nat a very young age--lessons that he took away to apply throughout the \nrest of his life and which have stood him in very good stead throughout \nhis career.\n  He has represented the people of his State of Georgia with passion \nand with great capability, not only as Governor but then to come to the \nSenate. He has certainly been a friend of people on both sides of the \naisle. He is a Democrat, but he still, of course, has many friends here \non the Republican side of the aisle.\n  I can't think of Zell without thinking of some of the more humorous \nthings he has done as well because despite his passion and enthusiasm, \nhe also has a very good sense of humor. I remember one case in \nparticular when he and Phil Gramm from Texas, who has left the Senate, \nteamed up to offer an amendment which had no chance of passing. There \nwas no real rationale for it. It was an amendment to exempt pickup \ntrucks from the mileage standards we were going to apply to all other \nvehicles in the Energy bill, but they thought there was something kind \nof un-American about having these standards applied to pickup trunks. \nThe two of them offered the amendment.\n  During the course of the debate, more and more people came over here \nto listen to them. Their case made such great sense that one by one the \nSenators began to think maybe this is an amendment that ought to pass. \nAt the end of the day, when they pointed out that, after all, there was \nno other place to haul your coon dogs when you are going to hunt, or \nhave the rack for your gun, and all of the other things they pointed \nout what a pickup is for, and no other vehicle could do that job, the \nSenate finally, I think on a voice vote, acquiesced in their amendment. \nBecause, after all, it made sense when Zell Miller and Phil Gramm \nargued that pickup trucks should be exempted from that standard, we \nexempted pickup trucks from that standard.\n  In other words, they knew how to have fun with the seriousness of \nthis body to point out some of the commonsense things most Americans \nbelieve and we sometimes forget here in this body.\n  He is a man of great common sense, a man of the people who loves \nAmerica greatly, and who certainly inspired me, Senator Zell Miller \nfrom Georgia.\n  These are only four of the colleagues who are going to be leaving us \nat the end of this session. These are Senators whom I became \nparticularly close to. I wanted to say a word about each one of them, \nto wish them all the very best, bid them farewell, also to know they \nhave too many friends around here to ignore. And we are going to be \nstaying in touch with every one of them.\n  We thank them for their service to the people of their States, to the \nSenate, and to the people of the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11543-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11543-S11553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IDEA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a little later today, the House and the \nSenate, Republicans and Democrats, will come together for a monumental \nachievement to strengthen special education for millions of children \nwith disabilities.\n  The agreement we have reached demonstrates what Americans have to \ncome to realize--that students with disabilities are a far too \nimportant priority to be used as a political tool or cast aside because \nof an election schedule. Their education is not a partisan issue. It is \nan issue that touches families in every State and in every community.\n  This has been a long and arduous march for our country as we fought \nto recognize the civil rights of children with disabilities. When \nCongress first passed IDEA, disabled children were shuttered away. They \nhad no place in our society. We have all heard the horror stories. \nThere is no need to revisit those dark days, but we should never, ever \nforget from where we have come.\n\n  Then they were sent to separate schools. We know from another battle \nfor integration that separate and equal are not synonymous. All of our \nchildren must be educated under the same schoolhouse roof.\n  Gradually, they were allowed to attend regular public schools, but \nhad to remain in separate wings in those schools. Still, separate and \nunequal.\n  At long last, America is coming to know what parents of disabled \nchildren have known all along--that their children have hopes and \ndreams, just like every other child--that they have parents who love \nthem and want the best for their children, just like any other parent.\n  America is coming to learn that children with disabilities want to be \nasked what every other child is asked: ``What do you want to be when \nyou grow up?''\n  America is coming to understand that disabled does not mean unable--\nthat we shortchange our communities when we deny them the gifts and \ncontributions of those with disabilities.\n  So today, all children in America--including those with disabilities \nhave--the right to a free and appropriate education. No one can take \nthat away. And now, 6.5 million children with disabilities attend \npublic schools, and two-thirds of them spend most of the day in a \nregular education classroom.\n  The IDEA is about making a better life for children like Zachary \nMorris of Newton, MA, who has Down's syndrome. Zachary enjoys reading, \nand loves to play the characters in Dr. Seuss books in class.\n  It is about Valerie Sims of Attleboro, MA. When her mother Katie \nnoticed her daughter was having difficulty reading at home, she asked \nher school for an evaluation. The school discovered that Valeria has a \nlearning disability. She spends a couple hours a day in a special \nclassroom and now is able to read at grade level.\n  The bill before the Senate is a milestone. With this legislation, the \ndebate is no longer whether children with disabilities should learn \nalongside all other children, but how best to do it. That is why this \nbill strengthens services to disabled children, works with their \nparents, improves teaching, and provides practical help to their \nschools.\n  This bill also involves changes in the IDEA law, changes which I know \ncause uncertainty and anxiety for many parents here today, especially \nwhen it comes to the proposed new discipline procedures. With the help \nof Senator Sessions, I believe we have reached a workable compromise. \nIt makes sure no child is ever punished for behavior that is caused by \ntheir disability or has to go without the educational services they \nneed to meet their goals. And for students whose behavior is caused by \ntheir disability, they will get new help under this compromise.\n  I know that around other issues related to discipline, many parents \nare worried that the changes in this bill will take away their rights \nto fight for their child. I want to address several of these issues to \nclarify what the intent of the conference committee was in making these \nchanges and to reassure parents that we are not, in any way, taking \naway their rights.\n  Parents must be trained to be knowledgeable about the changes that \nwere made in this bill and to be skilled advocates for their children. \nWe must assure that misinformation is corrected so that parents do not \nbelieve that this bill stripped them of rights to advocate for their \nchildren and if necessary have representation by lawyers.\n  For example, this bill incorporate for the first time, well \nestablished civil rights guidelines setting forth the rare \ncircumstances when school districts can recover fees from parents or \ntheir attorney's. These standards were developed in Christiansburg \nGarmet Co., v EEOC, 1978. Defendants can only get fees against a \nparent's attorney if the case is wholly without legal merit and against \nparents only in the most egregious case where the parent acts in bad \nfaith, knowingly filing a complaint for the sole purpose of \nembarrassing or harassing the school district. Since we know that \nparents of children with disabilities are far too busy to file \ncomplaints on these grounds, we do not expect this provision to be used \nby Local Educational Agencies and State Educational Agencies. No parent \nshould be\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\nin any way deterred from filing their legitimate complaint on behalf of \ntheir child.\n  Another example is that this bill for the first time provides a \ntimeline for when a parent must file a due process complaint. Although \nthe complaint must be filed within 2 years of the alleged violation, \nthe remedy for lost services is not limited to 2 years. For example, a \nparent might first realize that their child may have a learning \ndisability in sixth grade. If the school should have assessed the child \nin first grade and provided services, compensatory education would need \nto cover the entire period. The child with a disability should never be \ndeprived educational opportunity because the schools are not holding up \ntheir end of the bargain.\n  This is also true for disciplinary matters. If the school has not \ndeveloped an appropriate IEP or has failed to implement the IEP, the \nchild should not be disciplined for conduct arising from the school's \nfailure. It goes without saying that a child should never be punished \nfor conduct that arises from the disability itself. Since the \n``manifestation determination'' is so critical, it is imperative that \nparents be trained how to be skillful advocates in the manifestation \ndetermination process. A child with a disability may engage in the same \nconduct as a child without a disability, but not have the same ability \nto understand or control the conduct. In these situations it is \ninequitable to treat the children the same for disciplinary purposes.\n  This bill aims at remediation, not punishment. By adding strong \nrequirements for functional behavioral assessments and positive and \nskillful behavioral interventions, we hope to address the conduct \nbefore it becomes misconduct. Suspensions and expulsions are the easy \nway out and I encourage school districts across the country to \ninstitute positive behavioral supports for all children. For the \nschools that have, the results have been remarkable. I strongly urge \nschool districts to apply educational approaches and to use \ndisciplinary approaches as a last resort.\n  Regarding the important issue of attorney's fees a sentence in the \nStatement of Managers' language of the conference report that provided \nthe explanation for the attorney's fees language was inadvertently left \nout. By adding at Note 231 sections detailing the limited circumstances \nin which Local Educational Agencies and State Educational Agencies can \nrecover attorney's fees, specifically Sections 615(i)(3)(B)(i)(II) and \n(III), the conferees intend to codify the standards set forth in \nChristiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978).\n  According to Christiansburg, attorney's fees may only be awarded to \ndefendants in civil rights cases where the plaintiff's claims are \nfrivolous, without foundation or brought in bad faith.\n  The primary contribution of this legislation is that it strengthens \nthe broader community of those involved in the education of our \nchildren, and gives them a greater stake in the success of our \nchildren.\n  For our children, this bill provides at least 30,000 additional fully \ncertified special education teachers in our schools. It will expand \naccess to technologies that will help disabled children learn and \nbecome independent.\n  And for the first time, we will ensure that students with \ndisabilities are provided with job training and other services that \nenable them to support themselves after they graduate. Five years after \nthey complete their special education programs, more than half of those \nwith disabilities still are not working or are not involved in \ncontinuing education. We spend more than $12 billion for their \neducation, only to abandon them once they finish school. Surely, we owe \nit to them, to their parents, and to our communities to provide the \ntraining and support they need to lead independent lives.\n  Our agreement will simplify the rules for services that help disabled \nstudents make the transition from the classroom to the rest of their \nlives. It requires early planning, and that transition services begin \nat age 16. It requires the evaluation of all students with disabilities \nto assist them in meeting post-secondary goals, and to help them apply \nfor jobs, after graduation.\n  While the major transition provisions included in the Senate bill are \nnot in this bill, Chairman Boehner assures me that they will be \nincluded in job training legislation next year.\n  Students with disabilities, more so than their peers, need an \neducation plan that takes into account their academic needs, but also \ntheir life goals. Because for children with disabilities, success means \nmore than learning the three R's, it means being able to live \nindependently after they leave school and to contribute and be a part \nof their community. For this reason, this bill makes sure that a \nchild's education plan lays out a clear roadmap to success in school \nand in life.\n  Related services, such as speech and language therapy, physical and \noccupational therapy, and psychological services are of extraordinary \nimportance for disabled students and the IDEA law has always included \nthem. This bill adds new services, such as interpreters and school \nnurses.\n  For parents, this bill assures that they have a strong voice in their \nchildren's education. It makes sure that students are evaluated quickly \nfor IDEA services when a parent calls for them, and it works with \nparents to improve the coordination of educational services for \nstudents who change schools during a school year. Parents need to be \nkept informed of their children's progress. It requires all schools to \ngive parents quarterly reports about their child's progress.\n  It provides new resources to parent training centers to help resolve \ndisputes between parents and schools, and it gives parents more \nflexible options to participate in their child's education. And above \nall, it holds schools accountable for results, and imposes sanctions on \nStates that ignore the law, so that parents don't always have to fight \nfailing schools alone.\n  For too long, the Department of Education has been a toothless tiger, \nwith little interest in monitoring State compliance with the law and \nwith too few tools to take action where there's need for improvement. \nWe know that as a result, States are woefully out of compliance with \nthe law. Every reliable source shows it, and it's the children who pay \nthe price of this negligence.\n  According to the National Council on Disability, every State in the \ncountry is out of compliance with this law in some way.\n  A recent General Accounting Office report identified compliance \nfailures in 30 of the 31 States visited. Over half of the failures were \ndirectly related to providing student services, the lifeblood of the \nIDEA, services such as counseling, speech therapy and assistive \ntechnology, which make the impossible possible.\n  The monitoring and enforcement provisions in this bill will hold the \nDepartment of Education to a higher standard. And it will improve their \ncapacity to hold States accountable for fixing problems.\n  For teachers, the bill provides new training opportunities. And it \nrecognizes that special education teachers face 2\\1/2\\ times the \npaperwork burden as other teachers by allowing 15 States to test new \nways of giving teachers more time with students and less with needless \npaperwork.\n  It streamlines State and local requirements to ensure that paperwork \nfocuses only on improving educational results for children with \ndisabilities and it requires the Secretary of Education to develop \nsimple model forms for individual education plans and other key \nrequirements.\n  Teachers, principals and other school personnel are also given \nimproved training options and special grants dedicated for this \npurpose. And a new grant program is created to help institutes of \nhigher education to train our teachers.\n  States and local schools are allowed to use funds to provide \nprofessional development for teachers.\n  The new law also expands training options for general education \nteachers, principals and other administrators in how to make the IDEA \nwork for their whole school community.\n  Most importantly, the bill sets a high standard of competency for \nspecial education teachers to meet so disabled students get the best \neducation possible from the best trained professionals.\n  Special education teachers are modern-day heroes. They are teachers \nbecause they care and they do a remarkable job. But we are facing a \nshortage\n\n[[Page S11545]]\n\ncrisis now, and in the coming years. One of the reasons so many \nteachers leave special education is they are not adequately prepared \nfor the job. Better trained teachers remain in the field for longer and \nimprove the results for students.\n\n  In No Child Left Behind we made a commitment to have a highly \nqualified teacher in every regular education classroom, and with this \nbill we do the same thing with students with disabilities. The new law \nrequires that all special education teachers obtain a bachelor's \ndegree, hold a license in their State to teach special education, and \ndemonstrate subject knowledge. It is the right thing to do for students \nand it will help schools meet the goals under No Child Left Behind. \nThese teachers need our support, and they will receive it as they work \nto meet these new, high standards.\n  For communities--for students and parents and teachers and schools--\nthis bill encourages everyone to work together to solve problems and \nmeet challenges. It says that if children must be removed from school \nfor disciplinary reasons, the community must continue to see to the \neducational and other needs of those children. Far too often, issues \nbetween parents and schools quickly wind up in court. This bill tries \nto resolve them first through a complaint process before resorting to \nlitigation. But it also preserves parents' rights when they do go to a \nformal due process hearing. It encourages parents and schools to share \ninformation to facilitate early and more effective resolution of \ndisputes.\n  The law will require all schools to measure the academic performance \nof students with disabilities on all State and district-wide \nassessments, including alternate assessments aligned to a State's \nacademic content standards or extended standards. It requires all \nStates to include students with disabilities who take alternate \nassessments in their No Child Left Behind accountability systems.\n  Communities win with this bill when it comes to financing the \neducation of disabled children, too. They contribute the majority of \nfunds to educate disabled students, and we recognize that by giving \nthem a greater say over how they spend Federal funds.\n  I deeply regret this bill does not require the Federal Government to \nmeet its full funding commitment to local schools to help them cover \nthe costs of special education. The bill at least sets specific funding \ntargets, and we will continue to fight next to see that Congress and \nthe administration meet them.\n  Meeting local needs also includes continuing support for early \nintervention programs. We know early intervention for our youngest \nchildren ages zero to 3 can make an enormous difference in their \ndevelopment, and that dollar for dollar these resources are one of the \nmost effective investments we can make.\n  This law also gives States the incentives and the authority to create \na seamless system of early intervention from birth through kindergarten \nso our youngest children get the best care possible and enter \nkindergarten ready to learn.\n  As a society, we are judged by how we treat our children, and we are \nmeasured especially by how we treat those children with special needs. \nThat is why I believe so strongly in the right of every child to a free \nand appropriate education, and I believe this bill advances that cause.\n\n  I thank the many people who brought us successfully to this day. \nFirst and foremost, I commend the thousands of parents who made their \nviews known in shaping this legislation. They have been citizen leaders \nat their very best. Chairman Boehner, Senator Gregg, the chairman of \nour committee, and Congressman Miller deserve special thanks for their \nleadership in producing an agreement with such strong and overwhelming \nsupport.\n  I might mention, Mr. President, the vote in the House of \nRepresentatives was 397 to 3 on this legislation. The House voted \nearlier today. It reflects the best judgment of Republicans and \nDemocrats in both bodies on an issue of such fundamental, basic \nimportance to families who have the special-needs children but to all \nAmericans who care about the quality of our society and the value this \nNation places in terms of understanding the special gifts special-needs \nchildren provide for their families and for communities and for our \ncountry.\n  I also commend Senator Sessions for his bipartisan work in dealing \nwith the discipline issue, which has needlessly plagued the debate on \nIDEA for so long.\n  Senator Harkin is always at the forefront of the movement for equal \nrights for all persons with disabilities, including children. He has \nled the effort for positive support for all students with disabilities, \nand his best ideas are in this bill.\n  Senator Dodd and Senator Jeffords worked effectively on this \nlegislation to improve early childhood programs. They have been two \npioneers in the development of the legislation since the very \nbeginning, and they have been absolutely tireless in pursuing positive, \nconstructive, responsive changes in these programs. They are both \nleaders on children's programs in the Senate.\n  Senator Bingaman fought for strong enforcement of civil rights \nprotections for every disabled student. Senator Mikulski strengthened \nsupport for students making the transition from schools to careers. \nSenator Reed improved the training and recruitment of special education \nteachers. Senator Murray improved the provisions on enforcement and the \nmonitoring of the law and for caring for homeless and foster care \nchildren so they do not fall through the cracks. Senator Clinton \ndeserves credit for her work to ensure that new funds are provided to \nimprove the quality of alternative student placements, to provide more \neffective behavioral support for students, and to see that all schools \nare safe schools.\n  Thanks especially to the staff, who worked endless hours over the \npast few weeks to produce this bill.\n  All of us are grateful to Denzel McGuire, Annie White, Bill Lucia and \nCourtney Brown on Senator Gregg's staff for their dedication to making \nthis bipartisan process work, and to Michael Yudin with Senator \nBingaman for his expert counsel.\n  Also to Sally Lovejoy, David Cleary, Melanie Looney, Krisann Pearce \nand Brad Thomas with Congressman Boehner; Alex Nock, Alice Cain and \nRuth Freidman with Congressman Miller; John Little with Senator \nSessions; Mary Giliberti and Eric Fatemi with Senator Harkin; Elyse \nWasch and Seth Gerson with Senator Reed; Maryellen McGuire and Jim \nFenton with Senator Dodd; Bethany Little, formerly with Senator \nMurray's staff; Jamie Fasteau with Senator Murray; Justin King and Jean \nCook with Senator Jeffords; Catherine Brown, Susie Saavedra and Maryana \nZubok with Senator Clinton; Carmel Martin, formerly with Senator \nBingaman's staff; Sara Vecchiotti with Senator Bingaman; Rebecca Litt \nwith Senator Mikulski; Erica Buehrens with Senator Edwards; Joan Huffer \nwith Senator Daschle; Bethany Dickerson with the Democratic Policy \nCommittee; and Kristen Bannerman with Senator Alexander.\n  I especially thank Jeremy Buzzell, Michael Dannenberg, Charlotte \nBurrows, Jim Manley, Jane Oates, Roberto Rodriguez, Kent Mitchell, Cody \nKeenan, Danica Petroshius and Michael Myers on my staff for their \nskillful work and dedication, and above all Connie Garner for all she \nhas done for children with disabilities and their families and for \nnever letting us forget what this law is really about.\n  Our thanks also go out to the hundreds of disability and education \nadvocates across the country who worked so hard on this legislation.\n  This bill represents our best bipartisan effort, and I look forward \nto its immediate and imminent passage and strong support from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, before concluding--and I am going to include an \nappropriate number of these letters in the Record--we asked, just \nseveral weeks ago, some of those children whose lives will be impacted \nby this legislation a question. We sent them this question:\n\n       Take a few minutes to think about being an adult. What will \n     your life look like? How do you think that school can help \n     prepare you to be the best that you can be and make some of \n     your own dreams for your future come true?\n\n  This is the answer from an eighth grader:\n\n       I want to be a doctor. I know that if I try hard to read \n     well, I can learn better and then\n\n[[Page S11546]]\n\n     I have a chance to be a doctor. Teachers like Mr. McKenzie \n     and Ms. Ann help me to learn and make me feel good.\n\n  The question was:\n\n       Take a few minutes to think about being an adult. What will \n     your life look like? How do you think school can help prepare \n     you to be the best that you can be and make some of your own \n     dreams for your future come true?\n\n  Again, this was a sixth grader:\n\n       I want to be an art teacher when I grow up. I want to learn \n     all about and to be able to work with clay, paints, pencils \n     and everything. I want to teach kids like me.\n\n  Mr. President, we have a book that I will not, obviously, put in the \nRecord, but we have a number of letters like that. The hopes and dreams \nof these children are the hopes and dreams of children all across the \ncountry. This bill will help those hopes and dreams be achieved.\n  I see my chairman on the floor at this time. Again, I thank Senator \nGregg for his work.\n  We have worked very closely on this legislation and other \nlegislation, No Child Left Behind. He was tireless in terms of trying \nto increase funding for the IDEA. We had differences. Some of us felt \nwe ought to move in a more rapid way, but he has certainly been strong \nand committed to the goals of this legislation over a long period of \ntime. He is giving up the chairmanship of this committee to go on to \nother service in the Senate. I think all of us who have been a part of \nthis pathway on IDEA are particularly in his debt for his leadership \nand the work he has done on this very important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues, Chairman \nGregg and Senator Kennedy, as well as Chairman Boehner and \nRepresentative Miller, for conducting a truly bipartisan conference. \nWhen the legislative process is working properly, we have a fair \nnegotiation--and more often than not, that produces a better bill. Not \na bill that gives each of us everything we wanted, but a fair result \ngiven the two bills that we are charged with reconciling. And that is \nwhat we have here.\n  Last week, Washington Post's internet site ran a cartoon by Ted Rall \nthat was one of the most egregious things I have ever seen. I don't \nknow if many of you saw it, but it showed a student in a wheelchair \nwith crossed eyes and drool coming from his mouth. He had joined a \nclass of students without disabilities and here is what one of the \npanels of the cartoon read, ``The special needs kids make people \nuncomfortable and slow the pace of learning.'' The cartoon showed the \nclass changing from higher level math to simple addition because of the \nspecial education student.\n  The cartoon was supposed to be some kind of analogy to the United \nStates, but it was very hard to understand the point. What was crystal \nclear, however, was the author's bigotry and stereotyping of children \nwith disabilities. I understand that the Post will no longer run \ncartoons by Mr. Rall because cartoons like this are not funny. They are \nhurtful and serve as a stark reminder of why we are here and why IDEA \nis such important civil rights legislation.\n  I was here in Congress in 1975, as were some of my Senate colleagues, \nwhen IDEA was enacted. And it is important to remember why we passed \nthis legislation in the first place. We passed it because bigotry and \ndiscrimination were keeping a million children with disabilities \ncompletely out of school. Those children were locked out of an \neducation and denied the bright future that comes with an education. \nIDEA opened the doors of opportunity for those children.\n  I have participated in many subsequent revisions to the law over the \npast 29 years. And I am supporting this reauthorization because we \ncontinue our proud tradition of ensuring that children with \ndisabilities have the right to a free, appropriate public education, \nFAPE. In addition, we improve the enforcement of that right.\n  Over the years, I have been involved in the debate about disciplining \nstudents with disabilities--and this was a major issue for the \nconferees. I know that parents were very concerned about changes to \nthis section of the law. I appreciate and understand those concerns \nbecause I have shared them.\n  While this reauthorization streamlines the discipline provisions, it \ncontinues several key principles. We will continue to consider the \nimpact of the disability on what the child is doing and we will not \npunish children for behavior that is related to their disability. It is \nalso important that we continue to require that children receive \neducational services when they are being disciplined so they do not \nfall further behind. We also continue to emphasize that an assessment \nand services must be provided to children who have more serious \nbehaviors so we can prevent future discipline problems.\n  I believe that discipline will become less and less of an issue over \ntime as schools implement positive behavior supports more widely. \nSection 614(d)(3)(B), entitled consideration of special factors, was \nadded in 1997 to provide special emphasis on certain related services, \nmodifications and auxiliary aides which were not being considered by \nIEP teams and therefore not provided. The Senate bill modified \nsubsection 614(d)(3)(B)(i) to state that behavioral supports must be \nprovided when the child's behavior impeded his/her education or that of \nothers. In conference, current law was re-instated in order to make the \nsubsection consistent with the other special consideration subsections.\n  By instructing the IEP team to consider the specified services, it \ngoes without saying that the services must be provided if the IEP team \nfinds that the services will assist the child in benefiting from his/\nher educational program. In the case of behavioral interventions, the \nsection sets forth the circumstances when the services would be \nrequired.\n  The regulations to IDEA specify that ``if, in considering the special \nfactors ... the IEP team determines that a child needs a particular \ndevice or service (including an intervention, accommodation, or other \nprogram modification) in order for the child to receive FAPE, the IEP \nteam must include a statement to that effect in the child's IEP.'' 34 \nC.F.R. Sec. 346(c). And IEP services must be provided to the student. \nSee Office of Special Education Programs Letter to Osterhout, 35 IDELR \n9 (2000).\n  There has been widespread noncompliance with this requirement. \nHowever, with reauthorization's increased emphasis on monitoring and \nenforcement, we expect that this implementation will improve. Children \nwhose behavior is impeding them or others from learning should get the \npositive behavioral supports they need when the IEP team considers this \nissue and finds that the services are part of FAPE for that child.\n  In addition, we allow schools to use up to 15 percent of their funds \nto address behavior issues for children who have not been identified as \nspecial education students. Also, Senator Clinton has worked to include \nauthorization for a program that would provide funding for systemic \npositive behavioral supports in schools.\n  Research by Dr. George Sugai and others indicates that the \nimplementation of positive behavioral supports can have a dramatic \nimpact on disciplinary problems. Dr. Sugai testified in 2002 before the \nHealth, Education and Labor Committee that by shifting to schoolwide \npositive behavioral supports, an urban elementary school decreased its \noffice referrals from 600 to 100. It also decreased in 1 year its days \nof suspension from 80 to 35. Schools can save administrators' time and \nresources and cut down on discipline problems by implementing these \nprograms.\n  Another area that generated discussion in this reauthorization is \nlitigation and attorneys fees. However, the facts show that there is \nvery little litigation under IDEA. GAO examined the data and concluded \nthat the use of ``formal dispute resolution mechanisms has been \ngenerally low relative to the number of children with disabilities,'' \naccording to a 2003 report titled, Special Education: Numbers of Formal \nDisputes Are Low and States Are Using Mediation and Other Strategies To \nResolve Conflicts.\n  My own State of Iowa follows the general trend of very low \nhearings and court cases. A graduate student in Iowa did a thorough \nanalysis of due process hearings in Iowa from 1989-2001. Since the \namendments in 1997, there were three hearings in 1998; three also in \n1999 and four hearings in 2000. The Department of Education informs me \nthat this trend continues, with only\n\n[[Page S11547]]\n\nthree hearings in each of the past 2 years. And there are thousands of \nchildren in special education in the State of Iowa.\n\n  Given the fact that litigation is generally not a problem in IDEA, in \nthis reauthorization we merely include a standard that is used in other \ncivil rights contexts--it is generally referred to by the case, \nChristiansburg Garment Company vs. Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, 98 S.Ct. 694 (1978). Both prongs of the Christiansburg \nstandard (filing or pursuing litigation that is groundless or for bad \nfaith/improper purpose) adopted today are very high standards and \nprevailing defendants are rarely able to meet them. They are designed \nfor only the most egregious cases.\n  Also, in deciding cases under this standard, courts have considered \nthe party's ability to pay. This is important because Congress does not \nintend to impose a harsh financial penalty on parents who are merely \ntrying to help their child get needed services and supports. So in \napplying this standard and deciding whether to grant defendants' fees, \nthe court must also consider the ability of the parents to pay.\n  A school district would be foolhardy to try to use these provisions \nin any but the most egregious cases. Not only would the school be \nwasting its own resources if it did not prevail, but it would be liable \nfor the parents' fees defending the action.\n  Unlike parents who are entitled to attorney fees if they win the \ncase, the fact that a LEA ultimately prevailed is not grounds for \nassessing fees against a parent or parent's attorney. As the Supreme \nCourt concluded in Christiansburg, courts should not engage in ``post \nhoc reasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff did not \nultimately prevail, his action must have been unreasonable or without \nfoundation. This kind of hindsight logic could discourage all but the \nmost airtight claims, for seldom can a prospective plaintiff be sure of \nultimate success.''\n  As GAO found, there has been a low incidence of litigation under \nIDEA. The cases that are filed are generally pursued because parents \nhave no other choice. Congress does not intend to discourage these \nparents from enforcing their child's right to a free, appropriate, \npublic education. This is merely to address the most egregious type of \nbehavior in very rare circumstances where it might arise.\n  In this reauthorization, we also include a 2-year statute of \nlimitations on claims. However, it should be noted that this limitation \nis not designed to have any impact on the ability of a child to receive \ncompensatory damages for the entire period in which he or she has been \ndeprived of services. The statute of limitations goes only to the \nfiling of the complaint, not the crafting of remedy. This is important \nbecause it is only fair that if a school district repeatedly failed to \nprovide services to a child, they should be required to provide \ncompensatory services to rectify this problem and help the child \nachieve despite the school's failings.\n\n  Therefore, compensatory education must cover the entire period and \nmust belatedly provide all education and related services previously \ndenied and needed to make the child whole. Children whose parents can't \nafford to pay for special education and related services when school \ndistricts fail to provide FAPE should be treated the same as children \nwhose parents can. Children whose parents have the funds can be fully \nreimbursed under the Supreme Courts decisions in Burlington and \nFlorence County, subject to certain equitable considerations, and \nchildren whose parents lack the funds should not be treated \ndifferently.\n  I also want to discuss the monitoring and enforcement sections of \nthis bill. I want to thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this \nissue. Again, GAO has issued a report that has informed our \ndeliberations around this issue. They noted that the Department of \nEducation found violations of IDEA in 30 of the 31 States monitored. In \naddition, GAO found that the majority of these violations were for \nfailure to provide actual services to children. That report, issued \nthis year, is titled, Special Education: Improved Timeliness and Better \nUse of Enforcement Actions Could Strengthen Education's Monitoring \nSystem.\n  When we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, we said that our \nfour national goals for people with disabilities were equality of \nopportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-\nsufficiency. But children with disabilities are never going to meet any \nof those goals if they don't get the tools that they need when they are \nyoung. So if we truly want equal opportunity for individuals with \ndisabilities, it has to start with IDEA, and with our youth, who are \nour future. The law must be enforced so they receive the services and \nsupports they need to get a quality education and a brighter future.\n  As part of the enforcement of this law, States must ensure that local \neducation agencies are meeting their targets to provide a free, \nappropriate public education. If they fail to do so, the State must \ntake action, including prohibiting the flexible use of any of the local \neducation agency's resources.\n  In addition to monitoring and enforcement, there are other \nimprovements in this bill. I will mention one area that is near and \ndear to my heart because of my brother, Frank, who many of you know, \nwas deaf. In this bill, we add interpreter services to the list of \nrelated services, a change that is long overdue. And we continue to \nrequire the Department of Education to fund captioning so deaf and \nhard-of-hearing individuals will have equal access to the media.\n  While I support the bill, I must point out, however, that I am deeply \ndisappointed that this bill does not include mandatory full funding of \nIDEA.\n\n\n                             Section 615(k)\n\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleague, Senator Kennedy, with whom I \nhave worked on these issues for many years, there are revisions in this \nbill to the provisions concerning the authority of school personnel to \nplace a student with a disability in an alternative educational \nsetting. That is section 615(k). As you know, this was a subject of \nmuch discussion when IDEA was reauthorized in 1997, and I think we \nreached a good balance at that time. Is there an attempt here in this \nnew reauthorization to change the balance we created in 1997?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I can answer without hesitation that there is no attempt \nto change the basic principles of what was done in 1997. As was \nrecognized at that time, the general rule is that a child with a \ndisability cannot be suspended or placed in an alternative placement \nfor more than 10 days. In order to meet safety concerns of school \npersonnel, Congress added specific exemptions in 1997 to deal with the \nmost dangerous situations. In keeping with that concern, the school may \nplace a child in an alternative setting if he has inflicted serious \nbodily injury on another person at school. However, even in these \ncircumstances, the child may not be removed for more than 45 days and \nmust receive a free, appropriate, public education and behavioral \nsupports in the alternate setting.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague, and I agree with his explanation. I \nask the Senator, what about the child with a disability who violates a \ncode of conduct in a way which does not reach that level of \ndangerousness? In 1997, we distinguished between situations where the \nconduct was related to their disability and those where it was not. Is \nthis distinction also preserved in our new bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Absolutely, it is a basic premise of disability civil \nrights law that someone should not be punished for disability-related \nconduct. Nowhere is this more true than in the educational setting. \nThat is why we have placed an emphasis on functional behavioral \nassessments and positive behavioral supports. We want to address \nbehavior educationally, hopefully before it becomes misconduct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wonder whether my colleague believes this \nreauthorization changes the factors for deciding whether the behavior \nis a manifestation of the disability?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I say to my friend from Iowa, the answer is no. While \nthere was an attempt to streamline the language, the information that \nshould be reviewed and the factors that should be considered should be \nthe same. In 1997, the act set forth specific instances when the \nchild's behavior would be a manifestation, when the child's disability \nimpaired the ability to understand or control the behavior, or when the \nindividualized education program\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\nor IEP was not being appropriately implemented. These instances would \nstill constitute grounds for finding that the conduct is a \nmanifestation of the disability, as would any other relevant factor or \nspecial circumstance which indicated that the conduct in question was \ncaused by, or in the alternative, substantially related to the child's \ndisability. If the student's conduct is a manifestation of their \ndisability, the student may not be moved to an alternative placement \nfor more than 10 school days unless one of the specific dangerousness \nexceptions apply.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague for his explanation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his very generous comments, but more importantly for \nhis extremely positive and constructive and aggressive role in bringing \nthis bill to fruition. He and his staff have done an exceptional job of \nreaching across the aisle to make sure that this bill, so critical to \nso many children in our Nation, was completed and completed in a manner \nwhere everybody could feel comfortable that the product was good and \nwas going to improve the lives of these special-needs children.\n  This bill has some exceptional strengths. It doesn't respond to all \nof the problems we know are out there relative to IDEA, but it makes \ndramatic strides forward in improving this very significant piece of \nlegislation, which many of us have worked on for a long time. I think \nit is a reflection of the good faith and the good attitude brought to \nthe table that we were able to reach an agreement.\n  This was not an easy piece of legislation to put together. It came \ntogether not only because of our side, in the Senate, with myself, \nSenator Kennedy, and other Members of the committee, but because over \non the House side Congressmen Boehner and Miller played a very positive \nrole in making sure we reached an agreement.\n  This bill's uniqueness is that it changes the paradigm relative to \nhow we help these children. The goal is to make sure the special-needs \nchildren have a reasonably decent shot at making sure they accomplish \nas much as they are capable of accomplishing. So we go from an input \nsystem, where we had a lot of T's to cross and I's to dot, where we ask \nare these children getting the best education they can get, and are \nthere results? It is an output look, a look at accountability to make \nsure these children are trained and given skills and the academic \npreparation they need. So it changes the emphasis of IDEA to that of \nbeing one of input and regulation--to say how far can we go to improve \nthis child's life and education capabilities? We have trained the \nteachers and given them more flexibility, hopefully, and less \nregulation and less paperwork and more time with students. We also hope \nwe have given parents tools to work with and given the school board \ntools to work with. We hope we have dramatically released the \nlitigiousness of this exercise that created an atmosphere where parents \nand school boards and teachers can work out a game plan for their \nchildren and not feel they have to resort to lawsuits.\n  In addition, we have addressed critical issues, such as the question \nof discipline in the classroom and how best to deal with a child who \nhas special needs, and how that child can interface with the classroom \nin a positive way. I thank Senator Sessions for that. This was the most \ndifficult part of the bill. Senator Sessions gave strong leadership and \nwe were able to work out a strong compromise.\n  Again, the reason this bill succeeded was because everybody came to \nthe table in good faith and tried to reach an agreement that would be \npositive for the children who have special needs in our Nation. And we \nhave been successful, in my opinion, in moving this ball well down the \nfield toward that goal. Will there need to be more tweaking and effort \nin this area? Of course. That is a fact of life. But have we made \ndramatic strides toward giving these children a better shot at a better \nlife? Absolutely, under this legislation.\n\n  Senator Kennedy listed all the different Members on his side and many \non ours who played a major role in making this bill work. I intend to \nput those in my statement, as I recognize my time is limited. A lot of \nplayers came to the table from a lot of different offices--on the staff \nside but, more importantly, on the Members' side, and worked very \nconstructively. Certainly, we appreciated the genuine effort put \nforward by Members who serve on the HELP Committee to reach agreement \nhere.\n  I especially thank Denzel McGuire of my staff, who leads our \neducation activities. She has been the author and the energizer of a \nlot of good law around here. Much of it is now bearing fruit; for \nexample, No Child Left Behind. This will be another legacy of hers, in \nwhich she can take great pride, and in which I also take great pride.\n  Again, I thank my ranking member, Senator Kennedy, and his staff, \nincluding Connie Garner, for their very constructive role and their \nwillingness to work so aggressively with us to reach a product that \nwill have a very positive impact on lives.\n  This bill is going to make a lot of kids who have special needs, with \nspecial problems, have a much better life and a much better chance at \nan education that fulfills their strengths and gives them a chance to \nuse those strengths in a positive way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President----\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from West \nVirginia has the floor, and I understand he is going to give a \nThanksgiving message. However, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia if he will yield to me for 10 minutes to address the \npending measure.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to the distinguished Senator \nfor not to exceed 10 minutes, and that I may then be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to address the pending measure, \nthe Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act. I was proud to \njoin the bipartisan efforts in the Senate to bring this important \nlegislation to conference. This bill is important to me and to the \npeople of Minnesota because it helps make our State and our Nation more \ncompetitive in a world market, which can be pretty rough and tumble.\n  That said, however, I am equally opposed to the extension of \npermanent normal trade relations to Laos, a provision slipped into this \ntrade bill in conference committee, notwithstanding the fact that \nneither the Senate nor the other body voted to include this provision \nin their respective versions of the bill.\n  The Laos trade provision was not included in the underlying bill \nmoving through the regular process because, as the saying goes, ``there \nare some things no amount of sunshine can disinfect.'' That is an apt \nway to describe the terrible human rights record of Laos. If the United \nStates were to ever extend normal trade relations to Laos under that \ncountry's current human rights conditions, it could only be done in \nthis way--without either body addressing the issue head on. It could \nonly be tacked onto a popular piece of legislation that was not \namendable, as was the case with the conference committee report, \nallowing this otherwise unacceptable provision to get a free ride \nwithout the scrutiny it deserves.\n  This provision did not emanate from the Senate negotiators but from \nthe negotiators in the other body. I commend Chairman Grassley and \nSenator Baucus, two good friends, for whom I have the greatest respect, \nfor all the hard work they put into the underlying bill. It is a good \nbill. But because the bill wound up with this Laos trade provision on \nit, I was put in the position of having to oppose invoking cloture on \nthe bill, a vote I took earlier today. This is the first time as a \nSenator I opposed cloture. I did not take this position lightly. I have \nseen too much good legislation in the Senate die not because it didn't \nhave majority support, but because it could not get a simple up-or-down \nvote. My vote earlier today was also not easy because I strongly \nsupport trade. Minnesota is the seventh largest agricultural export \nState in the Nation, and twelfth in overall\n\n[[Page S11549]]\n\nexports. Trade is good for America and for Minnesota.\n  Frankly, opposing normalized trade with a country is a tough call, \neven when trade with that country is of nominal value to the United \nStates, as is the case with Laos. But frankly, there are just some \ntimes where the actions of an unapologetic nation are so egregious that \nis is morally wrong to move forward on trade liberalization with that \nnation because if would effectively place the imprimatur of the United \nStates on those actions. The actions of Laos rise to this level. I know \nwe will not be able to stop this Laos trade provision today with it \nbeing attached to a bill that enjoys such overwhelming support on both \nsides of the aisle. But I am pleased that a resolution I introduced \ncondemning Laos for its human rights abuses will be taken up by the \nUnited States Senate today.\n\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Feingold, Kohl, and Dayton on \nthis resolution, and I appreciate the assistance of Chairmen Lugar and \nGrassley, Senators Baucus and Biden as well as the majority leader in \nhelping to work out this very important and very strong resolution. Our \nresolution essentially says to Laos, you have now got normal trade \nrelations with the United States, now, shape up and rise to that very \nbasic level of human decency expected around the civilized world by \ntoday's standards--and probably achieved by most of us in the Dark \nAges.\n  Laos is a Communist nation with a disturbing human rights record, \nparticularly with regard to its treatment of ethnic minorities.\n  Laos is home to an ethnic minority, the Hmong. The Hmong are a brave \nand freedom-loving people. During the Vietnam War, thousands of Hmong \naided American soldiers. The CIA trained and armed approximately 60,000 \nHmong guerrillas to disrupt View Cong supply lines and rescue downed \npilots during the Vietnam War. They served admirably and saved American \nlives.\n  When Laos fell to the Communists in 1975, the government began to \nsystematically persecute these people, in retaliation for their support \nof our soldiers and their rejection of communism. Tens of thousands of \nHmong were able to flee difficult conditions in Laos, and many have \nresettled in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and California where they are hard-\nworking, important members of our communities. In fact, this year the \nU.S. is welcoming another 15,000 Hmong refuges who fear returning to \nLaos from their camp in Thailand.\n  Thousands of Hmong remain in Laos, however, and fear for their lives \ndaily.\n  The Lao Government continues to employ ruthless tactics against them. \nAmnesty International has accused the government of Laos of using \nstarvation as a ``weapon of war against civilians.'' More recent \nreports--and even grotesque video footage--suggest the rapes and \nkillings of several young Hmong girls at the hands of Lao soldiers.\n  Let me give you an example from my State. A constituent of mine, a \nLutheran Minister from St. Paul who is Hmong, traveled to Laos last \nyear to translate for two European journalists who were investigating \nhuman rights in Laos. During their trip, Reverend Mua and his \nassociates were arrested by the Lao police on suspicion of murder. He \nwas denied consular access for over a week and subjected to a 1-day \nshow trial, after which he was convicted for 15 years in prison. \nAlthough he was eventually released after more than a month in \ncaptivity--thanks to the hard work of our American diplomats in \nVientianeReverend Mua's case is one more illustration of the Lao \ngovenment's disregard for human rights and due process, as well as its \napparent discrimination against this ethnic minority.\n  The State Department's Human Rights Report on Laos catalogues the \nmany failings of this regime with regard to human rights. Permit me to \nshare some key findings of this report:\n\n       The Government's human rights record remained poor, and it \n     continued to commit serious abuses . . . Members of the \n     security forces abused detainees, especially those suspected \n     of insurgent or anti-govenment activity . . . Police used \n     arbitrary arrest, detention, and surveillance . . . The \n     Government infringed on citizens' privacy rights and \n     restricted freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and \n     association. . . . The Government restricted some worker \n     rights. Trafficking in women and children was a problem.\n\n  The report goes on and on.\n  According to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom:\n\n       There continue to be serious religious freedom problems in \n     Laos. The government interferes with and restricts the \n     activities of all religious communities . . .\n\n  Now the Commission does note some recent improvement by the Lao \ngovernment.\n  Nevertheless, ``Lao officials, primarily those at the provincial and \nlocal levels, have continued to harass, detain, and arrest individuals \nreportedly for participating in certain religious activities.'' Bear in \nmind that this state of affairs--harassment, detention and \nincarceration for one's religious convictions--is apparently an \nimprovement over the Lao Government's performance of last year.\n  My office has received troubling reports from Laos about shocking \nbehavior on the part of the Lao military toward the Hmong minority. As \nI have mentioned, a new video documents alleged rapes and murders of a \nnumber of young Hmong girls. The Lao Government, not surprisingly, has \ndisputed these reports. But the areas in which these atrocities appear \nto have been committed are not open to outside observation. Outside \ngroups are not allowed to enter these communities to verify--or even \ndispute--these allegations. The Lao Government certainly has acted as \nthough it has something to hide.\n  This United States is not alone in our concern. In August 2003 the \nUnited Nations Committee to Eliminate Racial Discrimination ``deeply \nregretted that the Lao People's Democratic Republic had failed to honor \nits obligations . . . expressed its grave concern at the information it \nhad received of serious and repeated human rights violations in that \ncountry; was extremely disturbed to learn that some members of the \nHmong minority had been subjected to serve brutalities;'' and, \n``deplored the measures taken by the Lao authorities to prevent the \nreporting of any information concerning the situation of the Hmong \npeople . . .''\n  Finally, they say you can tell a lot about a man by the company he \nkeeps. Let us then consider the government of Laos, which counts among \nits closest friends such nations as North Korea and Burma. Last year \nLaotian representatives met with representatives of North Korea where, \naccording to the BBC, ``both sides . . . exchanged views on the need to \nboost cooperation . . . (in) talks (that) proceeded in a friendly \natmosphere.''\n  And according to the Vietnam News Agency and other sources, in May of \nlast year, ``Top leaders of Myanmar and Laos . . . expressed their \ndelight with the two countries' growing friendship and highly valued \nthe mutual assistance and successful cooperation in the spheres of \npolitics, security, economy, trade and socio-culture.'' I am sure I do \nnot need to remind the members of this body that North Korea is a \ncharter member of the ``axis of evil,'' nor need I recall that this \nvery body has voted twice in the last two years to impose sanctions \nagainst Burma. A country that seeks to boost ``friendly'' cooperation \nwith North Korea and delights in its ``growing friendship'' with Burma \nought to give us some pause, some opportunity to examine this \nnormalized trade relationship, giving us an opportunity to vote against \nit rather than putting it in a bill we all know will pass.\n  I believe in trade. I believe it helps the people in my state, and \nthat it can help to create a more inter-connected and ultimately more \npeaceful world.\n  But I am wary about the signals we send by extending permanent normal \ntrade relations to a nation with such an abysmal human rights record.\n  The timing is particularly troublesome, coming as it does on the \nheels of such highly disturbing reports.\n  I wish we had an opportunity to debate this issue on its face. I wish \nwe had a chance to hold a hearing on trade with Laos, or to debate it \nas part of an amendable piece of legislation. My colleagues in the \nother body also wish they had been afforded the opportunities, or even \nbeen advised of the inclusion of the Laos measure in what is otherwise \na very popular bill. I will be watching Laos closely and if progress is \nnot made, expect to revisit this issue.\n  I know my colleague, Senator Feingold, will expect to revisit the \nissue. This is a bipartisan issue.\n\n[[Page S11550]]\n\n  Finally, let me say, 99 percent of this bill is good for the country \nand good for Minnesota. My home State has a strong tradition in support \nof trade, and normally the underlying bill would be a slam-dunk back \nhome. But Minnesota also has a strong tradition of respect for human \nrights and the culture of life, and at least with this Senator, and \nwith respect to this extremely egregious case, the human rights and the \nculture of life must be the first consideration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may speak without regard to germaneness, with the understanding \nthat the time be charged against me under the cloture rule, and that I \nnot speak beyond 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to explain \nor review where we are procedurally. The Senate has voted for cloture \non the miscellaneous trade bill, including the Laos NTR issue. Under \nrule XXII, 30 hours of debate is available postcloture for further \ndebate on the conference report.\n  I would like to ask how much time remains available for debate on the \nmiscellaneous trade bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 hours for all consideration, which \nincludes the debate, quorum calls, and votes, which would end tomorrow \nat 4:44 in the afternoon.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time have we consumed of the 30 \nhours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture was invoked this morning at 10:44, so \nwe have consumed slightly less than 5 hours.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we apparently have a little over 25 \nhours remaining of the 30-hour period. I have with me a number of State \nDepartment and international reports from which I would at some point \nlike to read. They describe further some of the horrific human rights \nabuses that have been perpetrated by the Lao Government. Senators \nColeman, Kohl, Dayton, and I have drafted a resolution condemning these \nabuses and urging the Lao Government to allow international access to \nvulnerable populations.\n  I don't want to shut this place down, but this is a very important \nissue, and it is my intention to remain on the floor and to prevent us \nfrom transacting any business unrelated to the conference report before \nus until we reach agreement to pass this important resolution. I \nrealize I do not have the votes to block NTR from passing, but I cannot \nstand by and let that pass without insisting the Senate take strong \naction noting and condemning the Lao Government's actions.\n  I hope we can work things out quickly, and I think we can. I \nappreciate the support and hard work of my colleagues, particularly \nSenators Kohl and Coleman, who are working hard to get this resolution \nthrough.\n  At this point, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering a conference report \nunder cloture.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for \nas much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Country-of-Origin Labeling\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we near the end of the legislative \nsession and its final day or 2 day, it is interesting what kicks around \nthese Chambers: some people have ideas about adding things to the \nOmnibus appropriations bill. Other people want to take something out \nthat they think is in that bill.\n  I came across a story in the newspaper this morning that describes \nsomething I discussed on the floor of the Senate yesterday. It says, \n``GOP looks to repeal food label law.'' Then it quotes the House \nmajority whip saying he expects the Senate to agree to repeal the \ncountry-of-origin labeling law now that its proponent, Senator Tom \nDaschle, is no longer in office.\n  First of all, Senator Tom Daschle remains in office until the end of \nhis term.\n  Second, it is true that Senator Daschle is the strongest proponent \nand actually the architect and the author of the legislation that has \ncreated country-of-origin labeling. But I say to those in the GOP who \nlook now to repeal the country-of-origin labeling law that they are in \nfor a fight. Repeal is not going to happen just because somebody has a \nhiccup in the morning and decides they don't like this law. It is the \nlaw. We passed it.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture dragged her feet and didn't want to \nimplement it. The omnibus conference legislation last fall actually \ndelayed the implementation time for the law, and now they just want to \nkill it outright, apparently. Let me describe again what it is we are \ntalking about. We are talking about labeling for meats and vegetables.\n  In the morning, when you put your T-shirt on, there is a label that \ntells you where that T-shirt was produced. Slip on a pair of shoes or \nslippers and you will find out where they were produced because they \nhave a label. Go to the grocery store and pick up a can of peas off the \nshelf and take a look at its label and what is in this can, and you can \nsee where it was produced. Most items that consumers are able to buy \nthese days has a label that tells you where those things were produced. \nBut that is not the case with meats and vegetables.\n  Country-of-origin labeling is something that is important for our \nfarmers and ranchers because they produce the finest quality of food in \nthe world for the lowest percent of consumers' disposable income. And \nit is also very important for consumers.\n  I held up a piece of beef on the floor of the Senate the other day. I \nsaid: I defy anyone to tell me where that piece of beef was produced. \nWhere does it come from? Does it come from the processing plant in \nMexico that was processing beef and shipping it to the dinner tables of \nAmerican consumers?\n  By the way, that processing plant was only inspected once. And when \nit was inspected, the inspector found that carcasses were hanging in \nrooms that were not cooled, with feces on the carcasses. The meat was \nbeing walked on by the folks who were working in that plant, with \nbacteria all around. The most unclean conditions you can imagine were \nin that plant, and eventually it was shut down. But that meat was going \nto the American kitchen table. Meat was produced in that Mexican \nprocessing plant under the most unsanitary of conditions.\n  That plant was closed down, but it has reopened under a new name, a \nnew ownership.\n  Does anybody know whether the slab of beef that I held up the other \nday came from that plant? You don't. It is because there is no \nlabeling. No one has any idea where any of it comes from. That is why \nfarmers and ranchers in this country support labeling. Fruits and \nvegetables ought to be labeled. Consumers deserve it.\n  Farmers and ranchers in this country produce the best quality food in \nthe world, and we ought to have country-of-origin labeling for meats \nand vegetables. Who doesn't want it? The big economic interests don't \nwant it.\n  When they start whistling, we have people around here who start \ndancing. The faster they whistle, the faster these folks dance.\n\n  Now, apparently, they say let us just dump this proposal that is now \nlaw, or let us rather repeal the country-of-origin labeling law.\n\n[[Page S11551]]\n\n  I say, again, there are those of us who will wage an aggressive fight \nwith those who want to decide to repeal that law.\n  Not only do we have people who want to stick legislation like this to \nrepeal the country-of-origin labeling in the omnibus bill at the end of \nthis session, which would be a huge step backwards and a real slap in \nthe face not only of consumers but also of farmers and ranchers, but we \nalso still have people blocking legislation that should be completed by \nthis Congress. Let me describe specifically what that is.\n  We have been working in the Senate for a long while to allow the \nreimportation of prescription drugs. U.S. consumers pay the highest \nprices in the world for prescription drugs. Brand-name prescription \ndrugs cost a great deal of money in our country. Miracle drugs offer no \nmiracles to those who can't afford to buy them. I commend the drug \ncompanies for producing miracle medicines. But there is no excuse for \ncharging the American consumer the highest prices in the world.\n  I will give you some examples.\n  If you are a woman and have breast cancer, God forbid and have to \ntake the drug tamoxifen, I have had people tell me that they went to \nCanada and paid one-tenth of the price they were charged in the United \nStates for that anti-cancer drug.\n  I spoke just recently, in fact, to a couple in North Dakota who have \ngone to Canada for 3 straight years to buy tamoxifen. They said they \npaid one-sixth of the price that was charged locally in this country.\n  As I indicated, I have heard people say they paid 10 times more in \nthe United States for that drug than you would pay in Canada for that.\n  What about Lipitor for cholesterol? Lipitor is one of the top selling \ncholesterol-lowering drugs in the United States. I have two bottles in \nmy office that I have used previously on the floor of the Senate. They \nlook identical because they are made by the same company; the same pill \nput in the same bottle, sold by the same pharmaceutical company. One \nwas sold in Winnepeg, Canada, and the other one in Grand Forks, ND--the \nsame pill, the same tablet called Lipitor.\n  The only difference is the price. Buy it in the United States and you \npay $1.86 per tablet. Buy it in Canada and you pay $1.01 per tablet.\n  Why is the price for that cholesterol-lowering drug almost double in \nthe United States? It is because U.S. consumers are charged the highest \nprices in the world for most brand-name prescription drugs.\n  We have been trying very hard in the Congress to pass a bill that \nwould allow the consumers to make the choice where to purchase those \ndrugs. In fact, the legislation Senator Snowe and I and others have \nintroduced would allow American pharmacists to go to Canada and buy \nthat lower priced prescription drug and bring it back to our country \nand pass the savings along to the consumers. But we have been blocked \nin this effort.\n  Many of us in the Senate put together a bipartisan bill, and that \nbipartisan legislation was authored by myself, Senator Snowe, Senator \nKennedy, Senator McCain, Senator Daschle, and many others. That bill \ndid not get through the Senate because it was blocked.\n  I thought I had an agreement with the majority leader. He believed \nthat he had reached a different agreement at about midnight one evening \nin exchange for releasing a hold on a key nominee. I believe I was told \nthat we were going to be able to see action on that legislation. The \nmajority leader feels differently. I regret that we have that \ndisagreement.\n  But we come to the end of this session, and the fact is that the \neffort to help American consumers by putting downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices in this country has been scuttled. It has been \nblocked. The White House has blocked it. The FDA has blocked it. The \nmajority in the Senate has blocked it.\n\n  In the Presidential debates, in fact, this issue came up. The \nPresident was asked, why are you blocking the reimporting of \nprescription drugs to put downward pressure on prescription drug \nprices? And the President said, ``I haven't yet''--meaning he hasn't \nblocked it yet. Of course he has, he has continually blocked it. The \nPresident went on to say during the debate:\n\n       Just want to make sure they're safe. When a drug comes in \n     from Canada, I want to make sure it cures you and doesn't \n     kill you. Now it may well be here in December you'll hear me \n     say, I think there's a safe way to do it. If they're safe, \n     they're coming.\n\n  But the President meanwhile goes on blocking the reimportation of \nprescription drugs.\n  The bill we have written is a bipartisan bill. This is not Democrat \nversus Republican. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Let me point out with respect to the safety issue, in testimony from \nan executive of a drug company, a vice president for marketing at \nPfizer, Dr. Peter Rost:\n\n       The biggest argument against reimportation is safety. What \n     everyone has conveniently forgotten to tell you is that in \n     Europe reimportation of drugs has been in place for 20 years. \n     It is called parallel trading.\n\n  In Germany, if you want to buy a prescription drug from Spain because \nit is cheaper, you can. If you are in France and you want to buy it \nfrom Italy, you can do it. It is called parallel trading. The Europeans \nhave done it for 20 years routinely and there is no safety issue.\n  Our legislation would give American consumers and pharmacists the \nability to access FDA-approved drugs that are produced in FDA-approved \nplants. This approach allows the marketplace to put downward pressure \non prescription drug prices here by being able to buy the identical \nprescription drug, FDA-approved, from Canada, or another country. As \nlong as there is a chain of custody that is safe--and no one argues \nthat the Canadian chain of custody for prescription drugs is not safe--\nthere is no reason why we should not allow the marketplace to work for \nthe benefit of consumers.\n  We end this legislative session with this proposal having been \nblocked.\n  It is estimated that if Americans could pay the same price as the \nCanadians for prescription drugs, the consumers of this country would \nsave $38 billion. This is not a small issue. This is a big issue. The \nfastest rising portion of health care costs is prescription drugs, and \nwe are trying desperately to do something about it.\n  I don't denigrate the pharmaceutical industry. They are a big \nindustry, strong and tough. They fight hard to protect what they have. \nI don't denigrate that. But there needs to be some competition in order \nto put downward pressure on prices. It is unsound public policy for our \ncountry to decide to allow the pharmaceutical industry to charge the \nAmerican consumer the highest prices in the world. It is especially \ntough for senior citizens. Senior citizens are about 12 percent of the \npopulation of this country and they consume one-third of the \nprescription drugs in America. They have reached that point in their \nlife where they are receiving a lower income and having to shell out \nsubstantially more for prescription drugs. Many of them simply say, we \ncannot afford it.\n  That is why Republicans and Democrats, together in a bipartisan \neffort, have tried very hard this year to get this reimportation \nlegislation through the Senate. I regret we come to the final day or \ndays and it remains blocked.\n  My hope is that those who I felt had reached an agreement with us to \ngive us an opportunity to have a vote on this legislation will \nunderstand we will be back the minute the Congress returns, in a new \nCongress, ready to fight this battle again. This battle is not over. We \nare not quitting. On behalf of the consumers of this country, they \ndeserve fair treatment with respect to the prices of prescription \ndrugs.\n  It appears to me we are one or two days from completing this \nlegislative session. I will have great regrets--I believe I speak for \nmy colleagues Senator McCain, Senator Snowe on the Republican side, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Kennedy, Senator Stabenow and Senator Feingold \non the Democratic side--that we have gotten to this point and have been \nblocked each and every step of the way.\n  Then we have the President say, I haven't blocked it. Of course, he \nhas blocked it. The FDA, the White House, and the majority in the \nSenate have blocked our bipartisan bill, an opportunity to try to do \nsomething to put downward pressure on prescription drug prices. That, \nin my judgment, is a\n\n[[Page S11552]]\n\nfailure of this Congress, and it is a failure I hope we will soon \nremedy when we turn the calendar over to January and begin a new \nCongress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the \nsenior Senator from Minnesota, Senator Dayton, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Medical Research\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nbriefly about medical research in the United States. The Senate is now \nworking through, as we all know, an Omnibus appropriation bill, which \nincludes the appropriations bill for the subcommittee which I chair on \nthe Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. One \nof the component parts of this bill involves the funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health. Our allocation is grossly insufficient. \nIt impacts on many areas. It impacts on education. It impacts on worker \ntraining. It impacts on many aspects of the delivery of health \nservices.\n  One line which I think is particularly troublesome is the absence of \nadequate funding for the National Institutes of Health. I say that \nbecause of the very remarkable advances which NIH has made in the past, \nand the enormous potential for the future.\n  I was elected to the Senate in 1980. In the first year I served on \nthe subcommittee, which I have for the full 24 years of service, the \nNIH funding was something less than $3.6 billion. By this current \nfiscal year, funding had increased to some $28 billion, significantly \nas a result of the leadership of Senator Tom Harkin, who is the senior \nDemocrat on the subcommittee, and my pressure to increase the funding, \nbacked up by the full committee and by the full subcommittee, Senator \nStevens, Senator Byrd, and then approved most of the time by the full \nbody. This year, our funding is very insufficient.\n  If we look at where medical research has brought us, it is \nremarkable. Life expectancy has increased from 47 years in the year \n1900 to 77 years in the year 2001. Polio, smallpox, and other \ninfectious diseases no longer kill or cause suffering to large numbers \nof people. The rate of death due to heart disease has been cut by more \nthan half since 1950. Death rates from cancer for 11 of the top 15 \ncancers in men have decreased; 8 of the top 15 cancers in women have \nbeen decreased. Diagnoses with multiple myelomas have been reduced from \na death sentence to living with a chronic condition as a result of new \ndrugs developed through biomedical research.\n  But there is still an enormous challenge. Heart disease continues to \nbe the number one killer; cancer, the number 2 killer, not far behind. \nThe tragic aspect of these deadly diseases is that they could all be \ncured, I do believe, if we had sufficient funding.\n  Two of my closest friends have died recently as a result of breast \ncancer. Being the chairman of this subcommittee for many years has \nbrought me into contact with many people who have maladies, whose \nchildren have maladies, who suffer from Parkinson's, whose family \nsuffers from Alzheimer's, and varying categories of cancer.\n  My Chief of Staff, a young woman named Carey Lackman Slease--well \nknown in the Senate community--died on July 14 of this year at the \ntender age of 48. She was known by practically everybody in the Senate. \nShe came to the Senate to work for Senator Heinz 24 years ago when she \nwas 24. She left the Senate for a time for a variety of private \nenterprises, but her heart and soul belonged to the Senate, and she \ncame back as my Chief of Staff and did a spectacular job.\n  The breast cancer disease lingered in her body, and notwithstanding \nthe pain, suffering, and torture she went through; she stayed at the \njob. And she stayed at her desk, insisting on staying, although many of \nus tried, including me personally, to have her ease off. She was in \nlove with the Senate and found the Senate work the best therapy, so \nthat when she passed, it was a shock to people who had been working \nwith her in very recent periods of time before. All of us took her \ndeath very hard, especially in the context of our thinking that her \ndeath could have been avoided had medical research had sufficient funds \nand sufficient resources to do the job.\n  A few days ago, on November 11, a very close personal friend, Paula \nKline, who was the wife of my son's law partner, who I was very close \nto, who was practically a daughter, died at the age of 54 of breast \ncancer. In a very valiant and very courageous way, Paula Kline \nstruggled with all of the advanced protocols and possibilities which \nmight have spared her or elongated her life. And going through the \nvarious forms of treatment, they turned out to be worse than the \ncancers themselves. But again, the tragedy is that Paula Kline's death \ncould have been avoided had sufficient resources been devoted by this \nvery wealthy country to medical research. We have a gross national \nproduct in excess of $11 trillion. We have a Federal budget of $2.4 \ntrillion this year, and it will be more next year. And when we take a \nlook at the budget for the National Institutes of Health at $28 \nbillion, it is, candidly, scandalous that with our resources, our \nresource capability, research capability in biomedical science, that \npeople are still dying of breast cancer or colon cancer or heart \ndisease.\n  There is a long list of maladies that people suffer from where there \ncould be cures: autism, Parkinson's, scleroderma, muscular dystrophy, \nosteoporosis, cervical cancer, lymphoma, prostate cancer, colon cancer, \nbrain cancer, pediatric renal disorders, glaucoma, sickle cell anemia, \nspinal cord injury, arthritis, a variety of mental health disorders, \nhepatitis, deafness, stroke, Alzheimer's, spinal muscular atrophy, \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis--commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease--\ndiabetes, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, pancreatic \ncancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, multiple sclerosis, macular \ndegeneration, heart disease, infant sudden death syndrome, \nschizophrenia, polycystic kidney disease, Cooley's anemia, stroke, \nprimary immune deficiency disorders.\n  That list was compiled by Bettilou Taylor, who is the most--I was \nabout to say the most extraordinary staffer; we have a lot of \nextraordinary staffers in the Senate family--but a most devoted worker. \nI will take just a moment to commend her and the staff on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation. They have been working around the clock, home for an early \nmorning shower, and back at work, turning out an omnibus bill for some \neight of the subcommittees which had not been able to turn out bills \nbefore.\n  It continues to be mystifying to me, after being here for 24 years, \nthat we cannot complete our work in a more orderly way. It is a \nregrettable fact of life, but it is a fact of life that everything is \ndone in the Congress at 11:59 if there is a 12 o'clock curfew. Some of \nit does not get done until after midnight, until after the curfew. We \nhave worked the bill every which way. A couple years ago, we had the \nbill concluded on June 29, floor action by the Senate. But by the time \nwe get through the complex conferencing--and I do not ascribe any fault \nanywhere, to the other body or to this body--it seems to be endemic of \nthe way we do our business.\n\n  But we are about to have a bill filed. There have been various \npredictions. The most recent one is for 5 o'clock. We will see if that \nhappens. There are so many items that our constituents come to us for, \nand they want included in the bill. It is such a complex and difficult \nmatter. We struggle with it. And the House will take it up some time \ntonight. I do not know how anybody can intelligently or intelligibly \nread that bill, let alone to comprehend it, through the limited period \nof time which is available.\n  In struggling through the bill this year, for my subcommittee, there \nare many disappointments, but the biggest one is on the National \nInstitutes of Health. I focus particularly on the tragic death of my \nChief of Staff, Carey Lackman Slease, who died July 14 at the age of \n48, and a very close personal friend, Mrs. Paula Kline, who died on \nNovember 11, just a few days ago, at the age of 54. The deaths are \nmarked by the tragedy of the fact they could have been eliminated had \nwe devoted sufficient resources to medical research.\n  I call this to the attention of my colleagues in the Congress and the \npeople who may be watching on C-SPAN or\n\n[[Page S11553]]\n\nwho may read the Congressional Record of the importance of renewing our \nefforts, in a wealthy country with a gross national product of $11 \ntrillion and a Federal budget of $2.4 trillion, that we could do better \nthan $28 billion for this very important subject.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmatters be set aside and I be allowed to speak 10 minutes on another \nmatter, and that the 10 minutes count against my hour under the cloture \nrules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Individuals With Disabilities Education Act\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, on another matter, I am rising to support \nthe conference report that is being proposed for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. I support this legislation. I commend the \nconferees for their efforts to streamline, make less bureaucratic and \nless time-consuming, the current IDEA legislation and its \nadministration.\n  In Minnesota, my home State, special education teachers--in fact, \nsome of our most experienced special education teachers--are leaving \nthat field, leaving special education classrooms, because of the \nbureaucratic burdens, the time-consuming paperwork.\n  They lament the time they cannot spend in those classrooms, the time \nlost to working directly with schoolchildren, in order to have to \ncomply with all of the State, Federal, and local school district \nreporting requirements.\n  Those reporting requirements are mostly well intended, and one layer \nof them is mostly necessary and appropriate. However, the second and \nthe third layers of bureaucracy have become duplicative, redundant, \nexcessive, and oppressive.\n  Sadly, previous attempts to ``reform'' this bureaucratic overload \nhave resulted, according to many of the teachers in Minnesota, in more, \nnot less, reporting requirements, more forms, more time required away \nfrom their classrooms and from their students. No one benefits from \nthat bureaucratic overload--not the special education students, their \nfamilies, the teachers, or the taxpayers.\n  Like too many other well-intended programs, we try to micromanage the \nprocess, rather than analyze the results. We tell educators, or other \nexperts in their fields, how they ought to do their jobs, rather than \ntelling them to do their jobs as efficiently and effectively as \npossible, and then report to us and to our constituents their \nprogress--in this case, improving the educational attainments and \nability of their students, and what they need from us to do their jobs \neven more effectively.\n  When IDEA was enacted back in 1975, there was opposition to it from \nsome States and school districts and from some schools. But now, in my \nState, schools and teachers are committed to doing special education as \nwell as possible. We need to get out of the way and let them do it. So \nI hope this legislation will be a step in that direction--better yet, \ntwo or three steps in that direction.\n  Something else we should do, though--and we should have done it long \nago, and certainly have done it during the last 4 years I have been \nhere--is fully fund the Federal commitment to IDEA, to fulfill a \npromise Congress made 29 years ago--29 years ago, when it passed the \nspecial education mandate. Congress back then promised the States, \npromised local school districts and, most important, promised the \nchildren and parents of America that they would pay for 40 percent of \nthe cost of special education. When I arrived here 4 years ago, that \npercentage was only 13 percent, less than one-third of the amount \npromised 25 years before. To his credit, President Bush has proposed in \neach fiscal year an increase in the amount of Federal funding for \nspecial education. To our credit, we have passed those increases, and \neven somewhat more, so that this year the Federal funding for special \neducation totals 19 percent of total spending nationwide, which is an \nimprovement, but is still less than half of what was promised 29 years \nago.\n  That broken promise by the Federal Government cost my State of \nMinnesota nearly $200 million this year. It has cost every other State \nspecial education funding. I am, frankly, mystified at why my five \npieces of legislation--five times I have attempted to increase the \nFederal share of special education to that promised 40-percent level--\nhave been defeated every time in the Senate. I am mystified--because I \ncannot believe that most other States and most school districts in \nAmerica could not use that additional special education funding. In \nschools in Minnesota, the underfunding of the Federal share of special \neducation results in local school districts having to make up those \nshortfalls either out of funding for other school programs for \nstudents, or by increasing local property taxes, because states and \nschools are being mandated by us to provide special education services. \nThey are subject to lawsuits if they don't. But we are not providing \nthem with the money to carry out that mandate.\n  This bill before us would not fully fund the Federal share for \nspecial education until the year 2011. Even then, that funding level is \nnot assured. It may not be enough. It is not guaranteed. It is not made \na requirement. The appropriations still have to come each year.\n\n  So we have, once again, evidence that we lack the proper priorities. \nWe propose and pass tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and the \nPresident proposes to make them permanent. Some colleagues propose \neliminating the estate tax, which affects 2 percent of the people in \nAmerica, by 2010, and to make that permanent starting in 2011. While \nsome call that the death tax, special education is a life commitment, a \nlifesaving commitment. Yet, we will not make that lifesaving commitment \nto the schoolchildren of America.\n  I will try again next year, and I will keep on trying with my \nlegislation to fully fund the Federal share of special education, which \nshould be well within our reach financially. It is the right thing to \ndo, and it is the necessary and moral thing to do, and it would serve \nwell the interests of this Nation in the years ahead. I regret that it \nis not part of this conference report coming before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is under cloture on the conference \nreport to H.R. 1047.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, when the Senate concludes its business in \nthe coming days, the congressional career of a remarkable man will come \nto an end. After 26 years of representing South Dakotans as their voice \nin Washington, Senator Daschle will be leaving the Senate.\n  His story is a classic one. As a young man from Aberdeen, SD, Tom \nDaschle graduated from South Dakota State University and immediately \nbegan 3 years of service in the Air Force of the United States. After \nhis service, he got an early introduction to Washington as he went to \nwork for Senator Abourezk, eventually returning to South Dakota to work \nout of the Senator's state offices.\n  Tom was elected to Congress in 1978 and went on to serve four terms \nin the House of Representatives before being elected in 1986 to the \nSenate.\n  After the resignation of George Mitchell in 1994, Senator Daschle won \na very tight race for minority leader. I was proud to have supported \nhim at that time. 1994 was a difficult year for our party and we had \nsome serious soul searching to do. Tom displayed the strong leadership \nthat was necessary to take Democrats in the Senate forward. That is \nwhy, after that first tight election for leader, he was reelected \nunanimously as leader each time thereafter. He has always been a man \nwho radiates optimism and hope, making him an excellent face for our \nparty.\n  I have known Tom since he first came to this body in 1986. I closely \nfollowed his Senate race against James Abdnor, and I was impressed by \nhim. A few days after Tom won that race, he and his wife Linda joined \nmy family in Vermont for Thanksgiving dinner. When they came to the \nfarm, my mother said to me, ``That is the nicest\n\n[[Page S11554]]\n\nyoung man I ever met.'' Well, she was right. Tom is a man of deep \nresolve and strong character.\n  The Nation saw that character exhibited in the days following \nSeptember 11. Senator Daschle showed the country the importance of \nsetting labels aside when he publicly embraced President Bush. In the \nface of that terrible tragedy, America united behind our leadership.\n  Only a few short weeks later, Senator Daschle and I were both targets \nof anthrax attacks--some of which killed several people--in letters \naddressed to the two of us. I know that the attacks brought home the \nreality of terrorism to both of us, but also to the Senate community as \na whole.\n  In the ensuing years, Senator Daschle continued to show resolute \nleadership in the Senate, routinely reaching across the aisle even when \nthose on the other side of the aisle were at their most partisan.\n  On more than a few occasions, Senator Daschle and I have joined \ntogether to work on a variety of national legislative efforts. \nTogether, we advocated for expanded benefits for members of the \nNational Guard and Reserve. Senator Daschle has shown courage and \nresolve in holding the line against the President's most objectionable \njudicial nominations. We worked together on tort reform, combating \ncorporate crime, and efforts to help off-duty police protect Americans. \nThose are just a few of the initiatives on which we collaborated.\n  But during that time, he has also been a strong voice for South \nDakota on those issues important to his constituents. He has fought for \nimproved health and education for Indians. He has led efforts to expand \nhealth services in rural areas and to prevent companies from canceling \nretiree benefits without notice. He is well known as a champion for \nranchers and farmers in South Dakota. In fact, he made sure their \nvoices were always heard. He worked to ensure they had drought aid, but \nalso he worked to do what a true South Dakotan would do: He wanted to \nmake sure they could compete on a level playing field.\n  Despite a well-run campaign and putting forth his best effort, \nSenator Daschle was not reelected to the Senate this fall. The morning \nafter election day, he gave a speech before his supporters in Sioux \nFalls. He finished that speech by recalling two memories. The first was \nof a magnificent Washington skyline sunset he witnessed one fall \nafternoon leaving his office in the Capitol. The second was watching \nthe Sun rise at Mount Rushmore with his family, and the warm, sweet \noptimistic feeling inspired by that sunrise. Tom said that, seeing \nboth, he likes sunrises better. I agree. For the past 18 years with \neach daily sunrise, he sought to bring hope and optimism to this body. \nHe has worked to better his State and his country, to ensure our \nchildren and grandchildren have a brighter world in which to live. He \nis a remarkable friend and colleague, and I thank him for his service \nto this institution.\n  If I can be very personal, in my 30 years in the Senate, I have not \nknown a more honest and more decent Senator than Tom Daschle. I believe \nthat part of our Senate fabric and our Senate conscience leaves with \nthis special person.\n  Mr. President, I see others seeking recognition. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in a few minutes Senator Coleman will \noffer a resolution. I join Senators Coleman, Kohl, and Dayton in \nsupporting this resolution. By taking this up and passing it at this \ntime, we signal that congressional concern about the deplorable human \nrights situation in Laos will be intense and ongoing.\n  As I have discussed today, I hear regular reports from constituents \ndistraught about the conditions faced by their relatives in Laos. This \nis especially wrenching--and this is the point we have been trying to \nmake all day--when we remember that the Hmong communities reportedly \ntargeted for abuse are the same communities that worked side by side \nwith U.S. forces during the Vietnam war. We simply cannot ignore the \ndismal human rights situation in Laos and be the country and the people \nwe wish to be.\n  Just a word on the language of the resolution which Senator Coleman \nwill describe in a moment. This resolution expresses the Senate's \nhope--hope--that a more open society will develop in Laos in the wake \nof the extension of NTR. Certainly this is my hope, although I, \nfrankly, really see no reason to believe it will happen.\n  But the reality is that Laos will get NTR. The votes are there, and \nwhile I may disagree with the wisdom of colleagues taking that step, \nwe, of course, all do hope for change in Laos--a greater respect for \nbasic human rights, an end to repression aimed at ethnic minorities, \nsuch as the Hmong, and religious minorities, such as the Christian \ncommunity, and for access to vulnerable populations.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues who join me in sponsoring \nthis resolution and the efforts of the leadership on both sides, the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Feingold for his \nleadership on this issue, for his perseverance, persistence and being \non the floor, as we discuss the miscellaneous tariff provisions, to \nmake sure that, before we finish our work, we put forth a resolution \nreflecting the sense of this body that there are problems with human \nrights in Laos. They have to be recognized. That is what this \nresolution does.\n  I thank Senator Feingold. I thank my colleague, Senator Dayton, who \nhas been working with us, and Senator Kohl.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the adoption of \nthe resolution relating to Laotian human rights, which I will send to \nthe desk in a moment, that the pending conference report to accompany \nH.R. 1047 be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 475\n\n       Whereas the Lao People's Democratic Republic is an \n     authoritarian, Communist, one-party state;\n       Whereas the Government of Laos has a poor human rights \n     record, particularly with regard to its treatment of \n     minorities;\n       Whereas the United States Central Intelligence Agency \n     trained and armed tens of thousands of Hmong guerrillas to \n     disrupt Viet Cong supply lines and rescue downed pilots \n     during the Vietnam war;\n       Whereas in 1975, the Kingdom of Laos was overthrown by the \n     Communist Pathet Lao regime, and tens of thousands of \n     Laotians, including the Hmong, were killed or died at the \n     hands of Communist forces while attempting to flee the Lao \n     Communist regime, and many others perished in reeducation and \n     labor camps;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of Hmong became refugees, \n     eventually resettling in the United States, where they now \n     reside as American citizens and lead constructive lives as \n     members of our communities;\n       Whereas remnants of former Hmong insurgent groups and their \n     families who once fought with the United States and the Royal \n     Lao Government still remain in remote areas of Laos, \n     including Xaisomboun Special Zone and the Luang Prabang \n     Province;\n       Whereas in August 2003 the United Nations Committee to \n     Eliminate Racial Discrimination strongly criticized the Lao \n     People's Democratic Republic for failing to honor its \n     obligations, expressed its grave concerns regarding reports \n     of human rights violations,\n\n[[Page S11555]]\n\n     including brutalities inflicted on the Hmong, and deplored \n     the measures taken by the Lao authorities to prevent any \n     reporting of the situation of the Hmong;\n       Whereas in October 2003, Amnesty International issued a \n     statement detailing its concern about the use of starvation \n     by the Lao Government as a ``weapon of war against \n     civilians'' in Laos and the deteriorating situation facing \n     thousands of family members of ethnic minority groups;\n       Whereas the Department of State reported in its most recent \n     Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Laos that the \n     ``Government's human rights record remained poor,'' and \n     highlighted press reports that one group of Hmong in \n     Xaisomboun Special Zone, mostly women and children, was being \n     systematically hunted down and attacked by government air and \n     ground forces and that it was at the point of starvation;\n       Whereas international organizations, the Department of \n     State, and Members of Congress have received reports of \n     mistreatment over the past 6 months of Hmong in Laos emerging \n     from remote areas of Laos, including the Xaisomboun Special \n     Zone, the Luang Prabang-Xieng Khouang border area;\n       Whereas the Lao Government has not allowed independent \n     organizations to monitor the treatment of the Hmong emerging \n     from remote areas of Laos;\n       Whereas in September 2004, Amnesty International issued a \n     statement condemning recent reports that Lao soldiers \n     murdered 5 Hmong children, raping 4 girls, who were foraging \n     for food close to their camp, and called it a war crime; and\n       Whereas the Lao People's Democratic Republic has failed to \n     substantially improve the status of human rights for its \n     citizens: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) Condemns the consistent pattern of serious human rights \n     abuses in the Lao People's Democratic Republic;\n       (2) Urges the Government of Laos to increase international \n     access to vulnerable populations and to respect the basic \n     human rights of all Laotians, including ethnic and religious \n     minorities; and\n       (3) Hopes that the Lao government intensifies its efforts \n     to make its economy and society more open and transparent in \n     light of the congressional grant of normal trade relations to \n     the Lao People's Democratic Republic.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

Mr. President, this is an issue in which I, Senators \nFeingold, Coleman, and many others have taken a deep interest. I \nbelieve this resolution is an important statement.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues Senator Feingold and \nSenator Coleman for permitting me to have this time and also to commend \nthem for their outstanding leadership regarding the violation of human \nrights in Laos.

Mr. President, today I voted against invoking cloture and \nending debate on the conference report accompanying the Miscellaneous \nTariff Bill, H.R. 1047. Normally, this is a non-controversial bill \npassed by unanimous consent. However, this year's bill is different. \nWhile it contains many provisions that I support and have worked with \nother Senators to someday enact, it also includes a specific provision \nto repeal the Antidumping Act of 1916. This bill would repeal the 1916 \nAct in response to an international ruling, which found that this U.S. \ntrade law is WTO-violative even though no court ruling under this U.S. \nlaw has resulted in any need for the United States to compensate any of \nAmerica's trading partners.\n  I disagree with repeal of the Antidumping Act of 1916, because I \nbelieve that this attempt by the WTO to force the United States to \nabolish this trade law, legitimately enacted at the start of the prior \ncentury, is misguided and unfair. Our trade foes have little reason to \ncriticize this trade law; few cases have been brought under its \nprovisions, and even fewer have resulted in judgements against any \nforeign firm. The WTO's attempt to abolish this law is simply one of a \nlong line of decisions by this international body meant to open U.S. \nmarkets to cheap, unfairly traded imports, and to undermine the ability \nof the United States Congress to exercise its sovereign right to \nregulate domestic and foreign commerce.\n  Repealing this U.S. trade law would set a bad precedent and could \nonly encourage other nations to seek similar, ill-informed ``justice'' \nat the WTO. That, in turn, will lead to disaster for the U.S. \nindustrial base, where American producers will assuredly suffer the \nill-effects of increased, dumped imports, which will drive down the \nprices of American-made goods and put more and more American \nmanufacturers out of work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise with some sadness on my last \ntime to speak on the Senate floor. It is a very bittersweet occasion \nfor me because I have loved every minute of the last 6 years, and I \nwill miss this body greatly. I am sure I will think about it every \nremaining day in my life hence forward. The past 6 years have been \namongst the most thrilling in my life, and it has been a privilege and \nhonor to serve here.\n  I rise really to thank my colleagues for their kindness to me over \nthe years and to thank my staff and my family and the entire Senate \nstaff and everyone who is part of this institution for the wonderful 6 \nyears I have had here.\n  I was first elected to the Senate from Illinois in 1998. I was sworn \nin in 1999, and almost immediately thereafter, the first Presidential \nimpeachment trial in 130 years began. For my first 35 days, I think it \nwas, or 38 days, on the Senate floor, I was immersed in the impeachment \ntrial of former President Clinton. Thereafter, we had times of war, war \nin Kosovo and Afghanistan and now Iraq. We had the events of 9/11. I \nhave served in times of war and peace, in times of great prosperity, as \nwell as in times of recession. I have seen a whole lot.\n  What I will remember most probably is the wonderful people who are \npart of the Senate. When I entered the Senate in 1999, I came in as the \nyoungest Member. I was 38 at the time. I am older now, obviously, and \nhave probably less hair and more gray hair. The oldest Member of the \nSenate at that time was Strom Thurmond. He was 96 years of age. I will \nnever forget Strom Thurmond telling me, when he was 96, about how he \nused to work out 45 minutes every day, and I was thinking about whether \nI might be as active as Strom when I am 96, if I make it that long. \nEven at that age, I remember Strom giving me advice, telling me about \nhow I could help the coal industry in southern Illinois. It was \nremarkable to meet someone like that.\n  There are many who have retired. There are others like Strom who have \npassed away. There are some giants who are still with us, such as \nSenator Robert Byrd. One of my first memories of meeting Senator Byrd \nis going in to talk to him after I first got elected and asking him to \nsign for me a copy of his book on the history of the Roman Republic. \nEarly on in my term in the Senate, I actually read Senator Byrd's whole \nbook on the history of the Roman Republic. I have to say it is a \nmarvelous book, and any Member of the Senate who has not read that book \nshould please go out and get it because it has bountiful lessons for \nevery Member of the Senate. It traces the decline and fall of the Roman \nRepublic. It traces the decline of the Republic to the Roman Senate \ngiving up more and more of its powers to the Executive, finally to the \npoint where the Senate became meaningless and Rome was just governed by \nCaesers, dictators, and kings. It is an outstanding book.\n  To meet the man who wrote this book and to realize that book was\n\n[[Page S11556]]\n\ntaken from a series of speeches that he delivered on the Senate floor, \nwithout notes, as to the hundreds of thousands of names and dates in \nthat book, is truly astonishing.\n  Senator Byrd has written a much larger four-volume history of the \nSenate, which when I retire from this body I hope to have time to \ntackle. But just to think of someone who could be so productive not \nonly in the Senate for so long but accomplish so much in other areas \nwriting such scholarly books, I will miss people like Senator Byrd and \nSenator Thurmond and all the others, the leaders with whom I have had \nthe privilege to serve.\n  Senator Trent Lott was the majority leader when I entered. For a \nperiod of time, Tom Daschle was the majority leader. Now Senator Frist \nis the majority leader, and soon Senator Harry Reid will be the \nminority leader. Each one of those individuals is remarkable, in my \njudgment. They have always been gentlemen of the highest order, and \nthey work very hard. They are very good at what they do in representing \ntheir perspectives. They are good and honorable people whom our country \nis lucky to have.\n  Our whips on the Republican side, Don Nickles and Mitch McConnell, \nDon Nickles has done such a good job for the taxpayers of this country. \nIt has been an absolute pleasure to watch him fighting excessive \nspending and confiscatory taxation. I have been pleased to join him \nover and over again to hold the line on spending and to vote against \ntax increases and for tax relief, something that I view as very \nimportant.\n  I am retiring at the same time as Senator Nickles. I will miss him \ngreatly as part of this body, but I hope to see him often in life \noutside of the Senate.\n  Other colleagues of mine are so important to me for reasons one might \nnot think of. I did not know what I might have in common with Senator \nBunning from Kentucky. He was elected at the same time I was in 1998. \nSenator Bunning is always so kind in giving me advice, as I advise my \nown son how to practice his pitching for his Little League games.\n  The other night, I saw Senator Bunning in his car, and I said: Jim, \nhaving been a Hall of Fame baseball pitcher--where else can you get \nthat kind of advice for your son's pitching lessons--I am not going to \nbe able to ask you for advice on how to coach my son on pitching.\n  He said: You know what. You can still call me afterwards. I will \nalways be there.\n  It is comments like that and the friendships like that, where I have \nspent so much time with the other 99 Members of this body, so many late \nnights and long weekends and sometimes retreats together, all of us \nreally have become almost kind of like a family. It is much more family \nlike than I think the media in America recognizes because so often the \ndifferences between the parties or the personalities get emphasized by \nthe media. But I will miss them all.\n  John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee on which I \nhave been privileged to serve the last 4 of my 6 years, a man I admire \ngreatly. Most Americans know about his heroism as a prisoner of war \nduring the Vietnam War, where he was in the Hanoi Hilton for 5 years \nand the enemy forces tortured him, crushed his bones and could never \nget him to buckle or back down. Few men have the kind of courage that \nJohn McCain has. It is not just physical courage but the courage he has \nhad to always fight for what he believes is right. Sometimes I have not \nagreed with him, but when he believes he is right he is willing to \nstand up to some very powerful forces that often threaten him \npolitically, but nothing scares this American hero, John McCain. I am \nso thankful to him for the opportunity he gave me to chair the Consumer \nAffairs Subcommittee on the Senate Commerce Committee where I have been \nable to work on child safety and booster seat safety and automobiles \nand also to play a very critical role in the corporate governance \nhearings that we had a few years back first with Enron, Adelphia, \nWorldCom and those other corporate scandals.\n  We have also worked on aviation and transportation, the Internet, \ntelecommunications. There is never a dull moment with Senator McCain \nchairing the committee, and for the seven new Senators who are coming \nin who are thinking of what committees they might want to serve on, \nthat is one I have always loved. With Senator McCain, there is never a \ndull moment.\n  Susan Collins, the chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee--what a great American, what a hard-working American. We all \nsaw that recently with her hard work on putting together the \nIntelligence bill under very difficult circumstances with a very short \ntime to work. I thank her for giving me the opportunity to chair the \nFinancial Management, the Budget, and International Security \nSubcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee, together with my \nfriend and colleague Danny Akaka, from Hawaii, who has been my ranking \nmember on that subcommittee. Danny is such a gentleman. I tell you, I \nam going to miss him personally, and I am also going to miss the \nmacadamia nuts that he regularly sent over to me. But I may have time \nto visit him on a beach in Hawaii, now that I think about it. Maybe \nthat is where I will see him and Senator Inouye next.\n  But Senator Akaka and I were able to wake up what might normally be \nthought of as a very sleepy subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, where we dealt with improving accountability of Government \nfinancial reporting. We increased audit requirements on Federal \nagencies, we extended the Chief Financial Officers Act to the Homeland \nSecurity Department, and we put it in to apply to the new Intelligence \nDirectorate. But, also, we have worked very hard in that subcommittee \nto spotlight some of the great challenges our country confronts.\n  I think in that regard, with the staff on that committee on both \nsides of the aisle being so able, we have been able to put together \nsome of the best hearings the Senate has had on issues such as our \ndefined benefit pension problem in this country. The Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation has a massive deficit with no end to increasing \ndeficits on the horizon.\n  We have had hearings on the Government-sponsored entities such as \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Homeowner Bank Boards and other \nentities that are privately owned but have Government charters, and \nwhat risk they may or may not pose to the system.\n  We had a series of hearings on huge funds and the problem of high \nfees. Mr. President, I was honored to have your cosponsorship on a \nlandmark bill to reform the mutual fund industry. While we were not \nsuccessful in passing that legislation this year, the Securities and \nExchange Commission has adopted many of the items in that bill, \nincluding requiring independent chairmen of the boards of mutual funds \nin America.\n  Just this week we did a hearing on the problems that we have seen in \nthe insurance brokerage industry in which we heard from experts on all \nsides and got Washington's first perspective on the indictments that \nhave come out of Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's office in New York. \nWe had a hearing on the issue of the expensing for stock option \ncompensation, which has been so actively debated amongst accountants in \nour country.\n  Finally, the Accounting Financial Standards Board is going to require \npublicly traded corporations to expense stock option compensation on \ntheir earnings statements.\n  On the Agriculture Committee, if I think of the word ``gentleman,'' I \nwould think of Senator Lugar, who was the chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee when I first came in, and Senator Cochran, from Mississippi, \nwho is the current chairman of the Agriculture Committee. It is \nregretful I will not be here a second term because I now have enough \nseniority on the Agriculture Committee to chair it in the second term, \nbelieve it or not.\n\n  But Senators Lugar and Cochran have been a pleasure to work with. We \npassed a number of measures to make life better for our Nation's \nfarmers, some very simple but important allowing farmers to file all \ntheir USDA paperwork on the Internet.\n  We improved child nutrition and passed legislation to make it easier \nfor people who depend on Government assistance for their nutrition and \nfood needs, that those people through the Food Stamp Program can now \nget their benefits across State lines--somebody\n\n[[Page S11557]]\n\nwho may live in St. Louis and goes back and forth to Illinois, or \nsomebody living in northwest Indiana and goes back and forth to \nChicago.\n  Also, a very important industry in my State, Mr. President, and in \nyour State as well, is the commodity futures industry. In Chicago, we \nhave the Board of Trade and the Chicago Merchantile Exchange. We also \nhave the Chicago Board Options Exchange. I am told, directly and \nindirectly, in Chicago we employ some 200,000 people in the futures \nindustry.\n  The Agriculture Committee has given me the opportunity to work on the \nrewrite of our commodity trading laws. I was pleased to be an active \nparticipant in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, where we first \nallowed the trading of futures on individual stocks in this country. \nThat market is now developing. I hope to see it come back.\n  I want to say some words of thanks to the senior Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Dick Durbin. He referred to us as the political odd \ncouple--one conservative Republican, one liberal Democrat, from the \nland of Lincoln.\n  More often than not, we probably disagreed from a policy perspective \non some of the key issues confronting our Nation, but it never \nprevented us from working well together. In fact, we jointly held 163 \nbreakfasts, constituent breakfasts together. Every Thursday morning at \n8:30 when the Senate was in session, Senator Durbin and I would host a \nbreakfast, allow constituents who were visiting Washington from \nIllinois to ask us any question that was on their mind, whether it was \npolitical or policy related, and we paid for the breakfast. My \nunderstanding is, there are not many other examples of bipartisan \nbreakfasts where you have one Republican and one Democrat who have such \na weekly gathering for their constituents.\n  We worked well together on the selection of judges. We almost never \nhad an open vacancy that we couldn't resolve on the district courts in \nthe northern, central, or southern Illinois districts.\n  Senator Durbin was terrific in supporting me in my effort to clean up \ncorruption in Illinois. One of the most important things I did in that \nregard was to bring in independent U.S. attorneys to the State of \nIllinois who were not beholden to the political class in the State. \nThat was something new. When I went to appoint U.S. attorneys, I found \neverybody and their brother, particularly all the local politicians on \nboth sides of the aisle, trying to influence the selection of my U.S. \nattorney.\n  I didn't want to lay awake at night wondering who was trying to \ninfluence my U.S. attorney, either to go after someone unjustly or to \nprotect someone wrongly from prosecution. I, ultimately, decided for \nthat reason to do a nationwide search for our U.S. attorneys, which \nyielded, I think, amongst the best U.S. attorneys anywhere in the \ncountry: Patrick Fitzgerald in the Northern District of Illinois, Jan \nPaul Miller in the Central District of Illinois, and Ron Tempas, in the \nSouthern District of Illinois. They are doing a tremendous job and no \none is asking whether they are influenced politically or what their \nmotivation would be. I thank Senator Durbin for supporting that effort \nto bring independent U.S. attorneys to Illinois.\n\n  Senator Durbin is a man whose stamina, hard work, and intelligence I \ngreatly admire. He is very devoted and hard working. He travels back to \nhis hometown of Springfield every weekend. That is a harder commute \nthan my commute. I travel back to Palatine, IL, which is only about 12 \nmiles northwest of O'Hare. So I had a fairly easy commute; I just had \nan hour and a half plane flight and then a short drive and I was at my \nhouse. But Senator Durbin would go back to O'Hare every weekend and \nthen catch another flight down to Springfield and he does that every \nweekend. He is constantly back in the State of Illinois.\n  I think we worked well on just about everything, except aviation. We \nhad a disagreement over O'Hare Airport. I think I am right. He thinks \nhe is right. But aside from that difference of opinion, it has been a \npleasure to work with him.\n  I am sure Senator Durbin will be an effective spokesman for his side \nof the aisle as the whip for the incoming Democratic caucus in the \n109th Congress. I do not necessarily wish Senator Durbin success in \nthat role, but I do wish him well.\n  Barack Obama, my successor, I wish him well. It was a privilege to \nhave lunch with him yesterday in the Senate dining room. I served with \nBarack Obama in the State senate for 2 years. He was coming in, in the \nlegislature in Springfield, in my last 2 years of service there. He is \nan uncommonly bright and talented young man. He is 1 year younger than \nI. He is the first African-American president of the Harvard Law \nSchool. He is almost unequaled in his potential and promise. I am \nconfident he will be a credit to the State of Illinois. I think he may \nsurprise the political pundits by voting, crossing party lines at times \nthat you don't expect him to. It may be a challenge for him with \nSenator Durbin as his whip. But I see Barack Obama as possibly being a \nfairly moderate voice, more moderate than many people suspect.\n  To my staff, many of whom are gathered in the Senate Chamber, I could \nnot have been blessed with a more wonderful staff to have gotten me \nthrough the last 6 years. I first need to start by thanking former \nSenator Bob Dole and the current Senator Elizabeth Dole for \nrecommending to me the man who is my chief of staff, Gregory Gross. \nGreg worked for Senator Bob Dole when he was the leader in the Senate \nand during his Presidential campaign in 1996. He worked for Mrs. Dole \nwhen she was at the American Red Cross. He is extremely bright, as Bob \nDole told me when I first called for a reference on Greg Gross.\n  Bob Dole said to me: Greg is what you call a genius. And I thought, \nthat is the kind of person I want, a genius on my staff. But he is more \nthan just a brilliant and talented and knowledgeable chief of staff.\n  He is also incredibly devoted and incredibly loyal, and I thank him \nfor that.\n  For the first 3 years, my chief of staff was Richard Hertling. He is \nnow at the Justice Department. Richard did an outstanding job in \ngetting us up and running. It is very hard when a new Senator is coming \nin and assembling a new staff, as some of the new Senators are finding \nout.\n  I have been blessed to have had an outstanding legislative director, \nTerry Van Doren from Macoupin County, IL, whose father owns a cattle \noperation in Macoupin County. Terry started out doing agriculture \npolicy for me. Terry was just what the doctor ordered. He had straight \nA's from the University of Illinois in agriculture sciences. Then he \ngot a master's in agriculture policy from Colorado State University. He \nhad a 4.0 there. I was called by the dean of the University of Illinois \nAgriculture School. He told me what an outstanding young man Terry is. \nTerry has been instrumental in agricultural policy. He has been my \nlegislative director.\n  Before him, Joe Watson was my legislative director, a brilliant young \nHarvard Law School graduate whom I pocketed out of the Sutter and \nHopkins law firm. He is now at the Commerce Department serving under \nSecretary Evans.\n  My office manager, Sherri Hupart, has done such an outstanding job; \nalways pleasant and kind and willing to help, and calm under pressure.\n  Her predecessor, Tina Tyrer, came to me from Senator Fred Thompson's \noffice. She had some 20 years of experience in Washington running \nSenate offices.\n  My Chicago chief of staff, Maggie Hickey, is a one-woman army, \nentirely devoted, very hard working. I want to thank her.\n  My staff director for my Financial Management and Budget and \nInternational Security Subcommittee, Mike Russell, and the team he has \nput together, which I think enabled us to do the best hearings on some \nof the key issues confronting our financial markets in this country, I \ncan't thank them enough.\n  I thank my schedulers and executive assistants, Lanae Denney, Julie \nCate, Julie Crisolano, and Doris Gummino. Scheduler has to be the \ntoughest job on Capitol Hill because you know how busy Senators' \nschedules get and how it is for them to hear when a Senator is tired, \nor frustrated, or thinks he is overscheduled. Senators hear about it. \nThere is no question about that. I thank my schedulers for being there,\n\n[[Page S11558]]\n\nstaying here working late into the evening. They have to be here even \nwhen the rest of the staff has gone home.\n  My campaign manager and first communications director, Mike Cys, is \nnow in the private sector. He is brilliant and energetic and \nenthusiastic. I thank him for all his support.\n  I thank my communications, legislative assistants, legislative \ncorrespondents, receptionists, front office and back office, duty entry \npersonnel, the interns, the kids we have had serve over the years.\n  My staff handled 6,000 to 10,000 letters a week for the past 6 years. \nThe first year we came in, we were getting some 22,000 e-mails a day on \nthe impeachment. My State office has handled over 22,000 individual \nconstituent cases. They conducted traveling office hours all over the \nState, 1,574 traveling office hours in 675 towns. My State staff met \nindividually with 831 mayors and village clerks telling them how to \napply for Federal grants for sewer and water.\n  I thank the staff on the floor of the Senate: Dave Schiappa, the \nfloor staff; Myron Fleming, the chief doorkeeper, the cloakroom staff, \nthe Parliamentarians, leadership and Sergeant at Arms staff, and the \npages who come and go every semester. I always look at them. They have \nto get up at 5 in the morning to do school work before they can come \nhere. But they work so hard. I hope their experience has been as \nwonderful as we want it to be for them.\n  And, finally, I would be remiss if I didn't thank the most important \npeople in my life, my family, my mother and father, who always \nsupported me through my 12 years in public service, but through all the \nyears of my life. It was always clear they would have been there to lay \ntheir lives down for their son.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I would like to \nthank him for his kind words and wish him very well. We have served \ntogether for 6 years. Every Thursday morning when we were in session we \nhad free coffee and doughnuts, a tradition that was started by Senator \nPaul Simon. I believe we were the only two Senators, being Democrat and \nRepublican Senators, offering this opportunity for the visitors who \ncome to Washington to ask a few questions and take a few photographs. \nBut it worked very well. It became a very interesting experience for \nIllinoisans and others coming to Washington. We did it many times. It \nreached the point where I would give his answers to the questions and \nhe would give my answers to the questions. We distinguished ourselves \nas being the only two Senators offering free coffee and doughnuts, \nwhich may account for the crowds that showed. But we did that for 6 \nyears. We have worked closely together and effectively and successfully \ntogether on the appointment of judges, U.S. attorneys, and many \nprojects that were local to Illinois. We disagreed on some issues but \nmanaged to maintain our friendship and warm relationship throughout.\n  Senator Fitzgerald announced his retirement for the right reasons. He \nsaid he wanted to spend more time with his family. That is something \nwhich we all admire very much.\n  I have enjoyed serving with Senator Fitzgerald, and I wish him the \nvery best, whatever the next venture might be, and I hope we will \ncontinue to work together.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin for the kind \nwords. I hope to come back to his breakfasts and get some of those free \ndoughnuts myself. I might not have to pay for them. But I will miss it.\n  I thank Senator Durbin.\n  Finally, I thank my brothers and sisters, Gerry, my older brother, \nJim, Tom, my sister Julie. A lot of people in public office worry that \ntheir siblings might embarrass them. I have never had to worry because \nthey are wonderful, upstanding people, all of whom I think are probably \nworried about what I might do that they might worry about. They are \nwonderful people.\n  I thank my wife Nina. We met together in D.C. when we were interns \nback when we were 19 years old, and after college and law school we got \nmarried. I moved her, plucked her from her home State of Colorado. She \ncame to Illinois. I want to thank her for her steadfast support through \nall my years in public office.\n  Finally, last but not least, I thank my 12-year-old son Jake. Jake \nmissed his father at baseball and basketball games. I have been in \npublic office for his entire 12 years. I am going to make it up to Jake \nnow. I am pleased that he is doing so well as a baseball pitcher. I \nthank Jim Bunning and others for their advice.\n  And finally, the people of Illinois from one end of the State to the \nother, to the south, from Rockport to Freeport in the north, thank you \nfor your kindness to me. I have loved every minute of it. You gave me \nyour trust, and I worked hard every day to keep it safe.\n  Thank you all. God bless. I will miss you all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, like the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, I take a couple of minutes this afternoon to come to the \nfloor to express in the most heartfelt way, as he just has, my profound \nthanks for the opportunity I have had to serve in the Senate.\n  I congratulate him on his successful career and wish him well in all \nof his endeavors.\n  I would like to begin where he ended--by thanking my family: my wife \nLinda, my mother, my daughter Kelly, Eric, our son Nathan, and Jill, \nand our daughter Lindsey.\n  I thank my staff. I actually believe--and I am sure each of our \ncolleagues shares this view--that I have the finest staff the Senate \nhas ever assembled. They have served me, they have served this \ninstitution, they have served the people of my State, and they have \nserved this country with remarkable professionalism, dedication, \nloyalty, patriotism, and commitment in ways that nobody could possibly \nregister.\n  I thank the people of South Dakota, most importantly, for the \nopportunities they have given me to live my passion for these past 26 \nyears. No Senator has ever been more grateful, more fortunate than I.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for their friendship and their loyalty, their \nsupport, and the remarkable strength they have given me each and every \nday.\n  I congratulate the man on my left, Harry Reid. No Senate leader has \never had the good fortune I have had to have an assistant like the man \nfrom Searchlight. He is a profoundly decent man who loves his State, \nthis institution, and his country. If friends are relatives that you \nmake for yourself, then he is my brother.\n  I thank Dick Durbin and congratulate him and Debbie Stabenow and \nByron Dorgan and Hillary Clinton for their willingness to take on the \nleadership roles in the 109th Congress. I will say that this Senate and \nthe caucus could not be served better.\n  I congratulate especially Chuck Schumer for taking on what may be one \nof the most challenging of all leadership positions. I know that he \nwill serve us well.\n  I can remember so vividly 10 years ago when I was elected by one \nvote. I came to the Senate very nervous and filled with trepidation, \nbut I recognized that we had a job to do. I wanted to use the power I \nhad been given wisely, recognizing that it was entrusted to me so we \nmight make the lives of all people better.\n  Shortly after I was elected leader, I was asked to come to dinner \nwith a good friend of mine, a man in his eighties, whose name was \nReiners, from Worthing, South Dakota. Dick was a farmer, had been one \nof my strongest supporters, most loyal and dedicated friends, one of \nthose people we can all identify with. He asked me to come to dinner \nthat night and I went out to his farmhouse. We had dinner. I asked him \nfor advice. He paused and he looked at me and he said, ``There are two \nthings I will hope for you. One is that you never forget where you came \nfrom. Come home. Remember us.''\n  And then he pointed to some pictures on the wall that I recognized \nvery readily. They were pictures of his grandchildren. He said, ``You \nhave held each one of those grandkids, as have I. Give them hope. Every \nday you walk onto the Senate floor, give them hope.''\n  We hugged each other and I left. Later on that night, I got a call in \nthe middle of the night that Dick Reiners had passed away. I never, \never, have been given better advice in all the\n\n[[Page S11559]]\n\nyears before or since and I remember it now.\n  We come to this body with great goals, and our challenge is to stay \nfocused on those goals, to never lose sight of them in the daily \nchallenges and the battles we take on as we come to these desks.\n  Two touchstones, in particular, have helped me remember my goals.\n  The first touchstone is this desk, the leader's desk. You pull open \nthis drawer and you see the names of all the leaders carved in it. It \nis a constant reminder that we are part of a continuum, a continuum \nthat makes us the heirs and the guardians of a miracle. That miracle is \ndemocracy--a government founded on the ideal of freedom.\n  We have sworn to protect that ideal. We have a challenge, as we sit \nat these desks, to do what soldiers have done for 200 years. We either \nhave to fight for this freedom or work at it. In more than 30 wars, 1 \nmillion men and women have given their lives for that freedom, and our \njob is to work at it as if we have given our lives, too--every day. We \nhave to protect and defend that freedom and we must pass it on to \nfuture generations undiminished.\n  My second touchstone is a practice I acquired many years ago, making \nit a habit to get into my car and drive without a schedule to all the \ncounties of South Dakota. There are 66 of them. I do it to be \nenergized, to refresh, to touch the land, to watch the sunsets and the \nsunrises, the majestic beauty of my State. But more than anything else \nI do it to be inspired, and to remember how what we do here touches the \nlives of those I represent.\n\n  It is an amazing feeling to drive from one county to the other and to \nsee the results of our work in this body. I am honored and very \ngrateful that there is not one county in the State of South Dakota that \nhas not been touched by our work and our efforts these years I have \nbeen here, touched in ways large and small.\n  We now are an energy-producing State, which means a lot to me. People \nsaid that would never be possible. We have little oil, very little \nnatural gas, no coal--but we now produce 400,000 gallons of fuel a year \nthat otherwise might be imported. We passed farm legislation that is \ntruly giving our farmers and ranchers hope for a better future.\n  My State suffers from poorly distributed water. Our challenge has \nalways been to find a way to take the good water and get it to those \nlocations where they have none. One of the most emotional experiences I \nhave ever had was to watch a family turn on a tap for the first time \nand cry and embrace each other and pass around a glass and look at it \nand say ``thank you.''\n  I am honored to have been a part of creating a new future for Indian \nstudents who had long ago given up any hope of graduating in a \ntraditional way, but who now can walk through the doors of tribal \ncolleges with a true sense of fulfillment and optimism that they only \ndreamed of just a few years ago.\n  The joy of walking into a town and talking to people and being \nembraced by total strangers who tell you that saved their lives because \nof something your staff did, recognizing that if it had not been for \nyou, perhaps there would be no life to save. What an honor. What a \nsense of gratitude.\n\n  As leader, I have been privileged to meet some of the greatest \nleaders of our time. I believe that Nelson Mandela would probably rank \nin a class by himself. Vaclav Havel, Lech Walesa, Mother Teresa, Rosa \nParks, Presidents and kings: I have been inspired by them--but not as \ninspired as I have been by people who are not well known:\n  Carolyn Downs, who runs the Banquet in Sioux Falls, SD, touching \nlives every day and giving them hope.\n  Louie and Melvina Winters on the Pine Ridge Reservation, who had \nabsolutely nothing to their name and took a burned out trailer house, \nrebuilt it, and have literally saved the lives of hundreds, if not \nthousands, of children who had no other place to go, whom they found on \ntheir doorstep when the word got out that somehow they were the ones to \nwhom children could turn.\n  Chick Big Crow, who witnessed the death of her daughter, only to make \nthe lives of young people on Pine Ridge richer with her steadfast \ndetermination to build a Boys and Girls Club.\n  And there are those like Elaine, who gets up at 4:30 in the morning \nto go to work. She's 77 years old, with $900 a month in Social Security \nand $900 a month in drug bills. She works at McDonald's to be able to \npay for the rest of her living expenses, and says she is proud to do \nso.\n  And Mary Ann, who works three jobs, has a blood disease and no health \ninsurance. She says: ``I want you to know something, Senator Daschle. \nI'm going to make it. I'm going to make it, but I would like a little \nhelp along the way, if you can find a way to remember me.''\n  They are the heart and soul of America, and they need us now maybe \nmore than ever before.\n  We are each given a number when we come to the Senate. I think it is \na wonderful tradition. And I have always been so proud of my number. My \nnumber is 1776, the year of our Revolution.\n  I think of that number not just because of its unique nature, but it \nreminds me every day that we are still part of an American revolution.\n  As a nation, we are making monumental decisions about what kind of \ncountry this will be.\n  Will we use our powerful might as a force just for vengeance and \nprotection against those who would destroy us, or will we use it for \nprogress the world around?\n  Will we recognize that power is not just our arms, but our wisdom, \nour compassion, our tolerance, our willingness to cooperate not just \nwith ourselves but with the whole world?\n  Will we honor the uniquely American ideal that we are responsible for \npassing onto our children a future that is better, or will we forfeit \nthe promise of the future for the reward of the moment?\n  These are questions that we will continue to face.\n  Several months ago, I came to the floor and gave a speech at this \ndesk expressing the hope that regardless of how the election turned \nout, we could continue mightily to search for the politics of common \nground.\n  I am proud of those times in this body when we showed our very best.\n  I am proud of that moment on the Capitol steps when we joined hands \nand sang.\n  I am proud of the effort we made after 9/11 to come together to pass \nlegislation that our country so desperately needed, not just for what \nit said, but for the message it sent.\n  I am proud of that moment, on October 15, when we were the target of \nthe greatest biological attack in our Nation's history and again we \ncame together.\n  I am proud of those moments when we found common ground on campaign \nfinance reform and the farm bill and Patients' Bill of Rights, \nhighways, measures that in some cases have not yet become law but \ndemonstrated that here, collectively, with common will, there is common \ngood.\n  I know we can continue to find common ground because we have found it \nin the past, as those instances have demonstrated.\n\n  If I could leave this body with one wish, it would be that we never \ngive up that search for common ground.\n  The politics of common ground will not be found on the far right or \non the far left. That is not where most Americans live. We will only \nfind it in the firm middle ground of common sense and shared values.\n  Ten years ago, my wise friend pointed to his grandchildren and asked \nme to give them hope. Linda and I now have two beautiful grandchildren. \nI implore my colleagues to give my grandchildren, Henry and Ava, hope; \ngive all the children and grandchildren of this Nation hope.\n  Let us treasure and protect the great freedoms that we have \ninherited, and let us always promise and commit that we will pass them \non undiminished.\n  I said a moment ago that one of my touchstones is my unscheduled \ndriving. I make notes constantly on these trips. A couple of days ago I \nwas telling my colleagues about how I had been looking through the \nnotes of a trip I made a few years back. I noted I had met with some \ntribal leaders, and met with a businessman who was trying to find a way \nto provide childcare for his family as well as his employees. I met a \ncouple who wanted to tour the White House. At the end of all my notes, \nI made the comment: ``Everything was worth doing.''\n\n[[Page S11560]]\n\n  The same could be said for my service here. It has had its \nchallenges, its triumphs, its disappointments, but everything was worth \ndoing. And I am grateful for every moment.\n  I love history, and there is wonderful history about the relationship \nbetween John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. They were rivals, but they \nrespected each other. And that respect grew as they left office and \nbegan correspondence that today is some of our most treasured writing.\n  In one letter to John Adams, Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``I like the \ndream of the future better than I like the history of the past.'' So it \nis with me. I have loved these years in the Senate, but I like the \ndream of the future.\n  It is with heartfelt gratitude to the people of South Dakota, with \ngreat respect and admiration for my colleagues, and with love for this \ninstitution and the power it has to make this Nation even greater that \nI say farewell and look to the future with great optimism, with hope \nand anticipation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what we just heard on the floor of the \nSenate captures the essence of this remarkable, remarkable body, the \nleadership, which dictates the character, which dictates the fabric of \nthe body that all of us have the real privilege of participating in.\n  I know several Members want to speak, so I will be very brief. I take \na moment to pay tribute to a truly exceptional leader with whom I have \nhad the honor to serve alongside, and whom I have had the opportunity \nto serve with over the last year. We first began working together 2 \nyears ago, when I suddenly became majority leader of the Senate. \nOftentimes, we have been on the opposite side of issues. But I want to \nsay how much I deeply respect his abilities and his judgment as a \nSenator, as Democratic leader, and as a person.\n  This environment is fiercely competitive, and as leaders, both he and \nI are thrust into that competitive environment. Yet Senator Daschle has \nalways, always, without exception, handled each and every situation in \nthat competition with class and with honesty, with integrity, with \nforthrightness, and with true grace.\n  Clearly, I have had the opportunity to learn from him much more than \nI could have ever possibly given him in any way. I was the beneficiary \nof that each and every day. From that very first day that I became \nmajority leader, he has treated me in that position with respect and \nwith that very same grace. For that, I will forever be grateful.\n  I wanted to pay tribute to Senator Daschle and close with one \nreference. The great Daniel Webster once remarked that the Senate is a \ncommunity of equals, of men of individual honor and personal character. \nIndeed, Senator Tom Daschle is no exception. He is the epitome of that \nand a great credit to this venerable institution. On behalf of all of \nour colleagues, I wish all the best for Tom and Linda and their entire \nfamily in the years ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, all of us in the Senate have just had \nan opportunity to hear an extraordinary speech by the outgoing \nDemocratic leader. We are indeed in a very tough and competitive \nbusiness. On the other hand, when we enter this Chamber, we take on \npublic responsibility and have the obligation to deal with each other \nin a civil and forthright manner. I think Senator Daschle has always \nmet that standard. We all admire his work here. He is one of the \nlongest serving leaders in the history of the Senate. We wish him well \nin the coming years. He can look back on his extraordinary career here \nwith great pride.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, you can learn a lot about a person by the \nway he handles winning, and you can learn even more about someone by \nthe way he handles and accepts defeat. Tom Daschle does not know that I \nknow this, but I saw an e-mail he sent recently to someone on his \nstaff.\n  Tom Daschle was concerned about a man with whom he talked one day \nlate in the campaign when he was calling undecided voters in his home \nState of South Dakota. The man was not rich or powerful. He was just an \naverage South Dakota citizen.\n  This man used to work for the Government. He received many awards at \nhis work. This is what Tom Daschle wrote in that e-mail:\n\n       One day, the man started to suffer extreme stress and even \n     depression. The psychiatrist told him he had to retire from \n     his work . . . under a medical discharge. Afterwards, (the \n     government) denied him a medical retirement. They said it can \n     only be for physical reasons.\n       He was denied medical access and retirement pay. He has \n     since also had a heart attack. He asked me for help in \n     getting a medical retirement. I told him we would be happy to \n     try and would follow up.\n\n  Tom Daschle in his e-mail went on to say:\n\n       Could you have someone contact him and look into this? It \n     just doesn't seem right.\n\n  The date on that e-mail was November 8, 6 days after the election, 6 \ndays after what had to be one of the most heartbreaking losses in his \nlife.\n  The reason Tom Daschle got into politics in the first place, the \nreason he ran for leadership positions in the Senate, and the reason he \nworked his heart out for this job was never to get rich or to get \nattention. He tried to bring power to help the powerless, the average \nperson, the people to whom life had given some unfair breaks.\n  Even now, until the minute he has to relinquish his power, Tom \nDaschle is using his power to help people who still look to him as \ntheir last best hope.\n  Golda Meir once famously told a political rival:\n\n       Don't be humble. You're not that great.\n\n  But Tom Daschle is great enough and good enough to be truly humble. \nHe will never talk about all the people he helped, all the people to \nwhom he has given hope, but I can tell you there are people all across \nSouth Dakota and all across America whose lives are better because Tom \nDaschle was in the Senate.\n  ``It just doesn't seem right''--that is what Tom Daschle wrote in \nthat e-mail, and it just doesn't seem right that we are going to have a \nSenate without Tom Daschle to keep fighting for what is all good and \ndecent about America.\n  My consolation is that I know Tom and Linda and their family will \nfind another noble way to continue serving this Nation, defending the \nvalues we cherish and making life better for people who need a \nchampion.\n  Someone noted that this is a cruel business, and it is. There are \nthree ways to leave the Senate. Two of them are not very good. In this \nsituation, we have seen a man who has given 26 years of his personal \nlife to South Dakota and to the Nation, and he made a decision a year \nago to retire. In the past year, I am sure there would have been a \nsuccession of tributes, dinners, schools, and highways and bridges \nbeing named after him and maybe statues and plaques commissioned. But \ninstead, he stood for election. He had the courage to stand again. \nAlthough he did not succeed, I hope the people of South Dakota realize \nthat he was a man who loved them throughout his political life and \nthose of us who were honored to call him a friend and a colleague love \nhim and will miss him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, when the 109th Congress convenes this \ncoming January, the Senate will be a poorer place for not having Tom \nDaschle among its Members.\n  By nature, Tom Daschle is a South Dakotan to the core, born and \nraised and regularly returning to his hometown of Aberdeen, with a \npopulation today of not quite 25,000. He was the\n\n[[Page S11561]]\n\neldest of four children in a family who knew the meaning of hard work \nand family. He went to college, the first in his family to do so, at \nSouth Dakota State University, some 150 miles from his home. When his \ncolleagues elected him Democratic leader, Tom Daschle asked an old \nfriend back in South Dakota, as he told us on the floor only a few \nmoments ago, for advice, and was promptly told: Never forget where you \ncame from.\n  That was something Tom Daschle knew without being told. If he had set \nout to forget where he came from, he could not have done it. The \nunscheduled driving tour that he made every year around South Dakota \nwas a kind of pilgrimage. It did not create his close ties to South \nDakota and its people; rather, it reflected them. As an editorial \npublished on November 6 in Tom's hometown newspaper, the Aberdeen \nAmerican news, noted, ``Personal stories abound of how Daschle and his \nstaff have been able to get things done for the average South \nDakotan.''\n  The editorial concluded with a tribute worth quoting:\n\n       On behalf of all the thousands of people you have helped, \n     we would like to offer you our deep gratitude and respect. \n     With quiet dignity, you fought for the State that raised you \n     and which still so obviously holds a special place in your \n     heart. Thanks, Tom, and good luck.\n\n  If by nature Tom is a South Dakotan, by choice he is a public \nservant. After receiving his college degree in 1969, he served 3 years \nin the Air Force Strategic Air Command, one of the relatively small \nnumber of Members now serving in the Congress who served in the \nmilitary in that period. And he has remained a forceful advocate for \nveterans throughout all his years in public office.\n  He entered the House of Representatives after a vote so close that it \ntook a recount almost a full year, and Tom became known as \n``landslide'' Daschle.\n  Following his service in the House in 1986, he was elected to the \nSenate. In his 18 years in this body, Tom's agenda for action on behalf \nof the people of South Dakota has focused on health care, education, \nthe outdoors, security and safety, economic opportunity, and rural \nlife. Any State would be doubly fortunate to have an agenda and an \nadvocate as dedicated and skillful as Tom Daschle.\n  By temperament, Tom Daschle is a Democrat in the fundamental meaning \nof that word--respectful of others, a scrupulous listener, seeking \nconsensus in the middle ground on complex and controversial issues.\n  Time magazine has accurately described his instinct for courtesy, \nreputation for humility, a willingness to compromise, and a sense of \nMidwestern civility.\n  Tom Daschle's steadiness and reasonableness made him especially well-\nsuited to assume the responsibilities of majority leader in that \npainful period when the country was dealt successive hammerblows by a \nrecession, the crisis in the capital markets, and, above all, the \ntragic attacks of 9/11 and their aftermath.\n  While others shouted at fever pitch, Tom Daschle never raised his \nvoice because it is not in his temperament to do so. His calm manner \nwas profoundly reassuring to worried Americans, as was the strength of \nhis resolve.\n  In the end, it is Tom Daschle's own words that tell us all we need to \nknow about him.\n  They explain why he is so respected around his State and here in the \nSenate. His November 3 statement to the people of South Dakota who \nsupport and love him speaks again and again of gratitude--gratitude for \nthe opportunity to serve, gratitude to his family, gratitude to his \ndevoted staff, gratitude to the State that is his extended family. It \nspeaks of belief-in our people, in the future, in what can be \naccomplished by people working together. It speaks of work--of work yet \nto be done. And it speaks of hope.\n  On November 3, Tom compared the sunset over the mall with the sunrise \nover Mount Rushmore and concluded, ``Having seen sunsets and sunrises, \nI like sunrises better.''\n  There is no question of Tom's public service having ended; the only \nquestion is the direction it will now take. Tom Daschle has honored \nTeddy Roosevelt's dictum that ``Far and away the best prize that life \noffers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.''\n  It has been my privilege to work with so dedicated and honorable a \npublic servant, a dear friend. I like to think that our work together \non behalf of the people of this great country will continue as we move \non into the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues in \ncomplimenting Senator Daschle for his years of service. I did not \nreally know Tom Daschle when he served in the House. I have had the \npleasure of serving with him for the last 18 years in the Senate. Many \nof those we were both in leadership, and I will just say our \nrelationship has always been very good.\n  Having the pleasure of working with Tom Daschle and Harry Reid, both \nfor whom I have great respect, many times we were political \nadversaries, but we were always friends. We never had a heated \nexchange, maybe elevated on occasion, but we always were friends and we \ncould always shake hands at the time we might have somewhat of a heated \ndiscussion. We would always remain friends, and he continues to be my \nfriend to this day.\n  I compliment him for his many years of public service to his State of \nSouth Dakota, for his service in the House of Representatives, his \nservice to the Senate, and his service as the Democrat leader. He is a \nvery competent individual, speaker, and representative of his \nviewpoint, and he happens to be my friend. I wish Tom Daschle and his \nwife Linda all the best for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am going to be very brief. For many \nof us who knew Tom Daschle and know Tom Daschle, we never thought this \nday would come. We never thought Tom would really be defeated in an \nelection. I thought a lot about that. Why? I mean, this man is such a \ngood man. He is such a good friend. He is a good leader. I do not know \nanyone who cares more about their State and who has worked harder.\n  He talked about the State's energy sufficiency, and it was Tom \nDaschle's sheer will of support to develop an ethanol industry for the \nState. I know because I tangled with him year after year because from a \nCalifornia perspective this was not such a good idea; from a South \nDakota perspective, it was. For Tom, his State always came first.\n  I thought he was unbeatable. He is for the little people. I remember \nbeing in the State. I remember hearing him talk about the Pine Ridge \nIndian Reservation and the state of the people in Pine Ridge and how \ndeeply he felt. When he feels very deeply, his voice gets that quaver \nand it drops low.\n  This is a very hard day for many of us. As I went down the aisle to \nembrace Tom, two people said this really is a tough business. And, in \nfact, it is a tough business.\n  I also want to say that Tom Daschle was a great leader for our \ncaucus. Many of us on many days watched him convince, cajole, push, and \nbring us together when we had to be together. We watched him on the \nSenate floor in the middle of the night, early in the morning, late in \nthe day, always gracious, always patient, always articulate. We never \nhad to worry about Tom Daschle's integrity or his credibility.\n  I still wonder, how could he be beat? This is such a good man, such a \ngood leader, such a good State representative. For me and my husband he \nwas a personal friend. When Dick was in Washington, early in the \nmorning he would run with Tom and they would talk about all kinds of \nthings. The run was always a good one and my husband would come home \nand always say what a great guy Tom Daschle is.\n  I think for all of us we wish him all the best. For me, I do not \nbelieve this man has reached his potential yet. I think he still has \nenormous gifts to give to this Nation, to his State, and I believe he \nwill, perhaps in a different way. Perhaps we will see him come back in \na different form. For Tom Daschle, these 10 years were very special \nyears and for us we were so privileged because we had an opportunity to \nbe led by a good man, by a great friend, and by a great leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I first join the voices of my friends and \nmy\n\n[[Page S11562]]\n\ncolleagues in talking about our dear and great friend, Tom Daschle, \nwith whom I had the privilege to serve for the last 6 years, and to be \nled by for the last 6 years. I have never known a better human being or \na better public servant than Tom Daschle. He is a good, honest, decent, \nand honorable man. The Senate will miss him. The country has benefited \nfrom his long and extraordinary service to this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11562-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11562-S11566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FAREWELL\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, life has a great way of handing us \nmoments that are bittersweet. I am sad today to rise for the final time \nto represent the State of North Carolina as their Senator, but I am \nalso filled with a great deal of joy because I will be heading home to \nthe place and the people and the family I love so much. I also want to \nthank everyone who is listening and all Members of the Senate and the \nstaff who have been so extraordinary about my wife Elizabeth for their \nprayers and their support.\n  Elizabeth and I and our family draw so much strength from all of you. \nWe are comforted by your words and your prayers.\n  We are grateful to the more than 50,000 people who have sent e-mails \nand letters to Elizabeth. As Elizabeth's brother said when he was asked \nabout it, he would not want to be cancer inside of Elizabeth's body, \nand I agree with that.\n  She is the love of my life and a woman of great strength. I am sure \nshe will be successful in this fight. Both of us hope and pray that by \ntalking about it in the way that Elizabeth has, and with the grace and \ncourage that she has shown, it will help other women who are faced with \nthe same kind of struggle so they can avoid the same kind of struggle.\n  Sometimes when hardship comes, one feels alone, but thanks to all of \nyou and our family in the Senate, we know that we are not alone. We are \nblessed to have the love, affection, and support of our friends and our \nfamily, our great staff in Washington, DC, in the Senate office and \nback in North Carolina and our Senate offices there, and also the staff \nin the Senate.\n  Those who serve on the floor of the Senate who have been wonderful \nfriends and so much help and support for all of us, we thank all of \nthem. To Marty and to Lula, whom Elizabeth and I adore, who have been \nwonderful friends to us and have advised us and shown us our way around \nhere, we appreciate both of them. To the people in the cloakroom who \nhave helped us and taken care of us for the last 6 years, and to the \nmen and women--and I hope they will hear my voice--who take us up and \ndown the elevators, whom we see as we go in and out of these office \nbuildings and the Capitol, who serve all of us and who are wonderful, \nextraordinary people, I have to say, since I have come back from the \ncampaign trail, to a person they have spoken their support and \naffection for Elizabeth and for our family and what we are going \nthrough. I just want them all to know how much they mean not only to us \nbut to all of us who serve in the Senate.\n  And, of course, to all the men and women I have had the privilege to \nserve with here in the Senate. To those who think the men and women who \nserve in this institution do not work hard, I wish they could spend one \nday here and see how hard it is and how devoted everyone who serves in \nthe Senate is, and how much they want to do good things for the \ncountry--whatever our disagreements are. We have many and they are \nstrong. The truth is, everyone here serves because they love their \ncountry and they want to do good things for their country.\n  All of you, you keep us strong. You keep us going. You remind us, in \ngood times and in bad, when we work together, everything is still \npossible here in America. It is the North Carolina way. That is the way \nI like to look at it. I have never loved my home State or my country \nmore than I do today. We have had some triumphs, we have had some \ntragedies over the last 6 years. But one thing is clear: I will never \nstop representing the people of North Carolina, the values they \nrepresent and the values that I grew up with there and the values I \nbelieve in. The truth is, it is who I am.\n  It is what I learned in Robbins, NC growing up, watching my father \nand the men and women who worked alongside him in the mill for all \nthose years. It is what I learned from going to church, from going to \nour schools, and from going to all 100 counties in North Carolina, \nwhich I am proud to have done, and listening to the people of North \nCarolina. It is what I learned when I shook the hands of the people who \ncame on Tarheel Thursday, which we had on Thursday when we were here in \nthe Senate. I will never forget you.\n  I will never forget the first struggle we had in the wake of \nHurricane Floyd, hard-working people like Bobby Carraway. He owned a \nrestaurant in Kinston near the Neuse River. It sat under 3 feet of \nwater for days. He lost everything. He and so many like him didn't want \na Government handout, they wanted a hand up and a chance to do what \nthey were capable of doing and a chance to go back to work, which is \nall he and his family had ever known their entire lives. What we did \nthen for so many, and this year, too, in the western part of our State, \nwhich has been hit by hurricanes and flooding, is we worked together, \nwe picked ourselves up, we dusted away the disappointment, and we got \nback to work to make North Carolina stronger.\n  I will also never forget the men and women who worked at Pillowtex. \nThey did everything right. They took care of their families. They went \nto work every day, some of them for days and years, some of them for \ndecades. They still couldn't stop their jobs from moving overseas.\n  I met one woman whose question I hear over and over--I heard it over \nand over again as I traveled around the country. She looked at me and \nsaid: What am I supposed to do now? Have I not done what is right in \nAmerica? I worked hard, I raised my family, I was responsible. Now my \njob is gone and what am I supposed to do?\n  Together we fought to help her pay for health care and get training \nfor a new job but, most importantly, we fought to keep North Carolina \njobs in North Carolina where we need them so badly. We stood up against \ntax breaks that shipped our jobs overseas. We fought for fair trade \nthat gave our workers and businesses a chance to compete, and \nrepresented the values we believe in.\n  I will also never forget Dr. Clay Ballantine. He works at Mission St. \nJoseph's Hospital in Asheville, NC. Every day he sees kids and adults \nand seniors who come in with respiratory problems, problems with \nasthma. He told his story as we fought the battle to protect the \nquality of our air for our children and for our seniors.\n\n  I will never forget the farmers and the men and women who live in our \nsmall towns, our rural areas where I grew up. That is who I am. The \ntruth is, you are the heart and soul of North Carolina. When our \nfarmers were struggling, especially our tobacco farmers, I am proud in \nthe end we were able to do something, to do something to help them, \nbecause they deserve it. They have done so much for their towns and \ntheir communities and for my State. They deserve something, finally, to \nbe done to help them and support them. All of us together were able to \ndo that.\n  It also matters, it matters to good, hard-working people like Blythe \nand Gwendolyn Casey. They have had a family farm for decades. They did \ntheir part and they never dreamed they would be close to retiring, \nmired in debt, debt they can never recover from. Together we helped \nthem and we maintained family farms across our State of North Carolina.\n  I will never forget the mothers and the fathers, the husbands and the \nwives, the brothers and the sisters who wanted nothing but to make sure \ntheir loved one got the care they needed in their darkest hour. \nTogether with Senator John McCain and Senator Kennedy, my friends and \nmy colleagues, two men for whom I have enormous respect and affection, \nwe went to work on something that matters--making sure you and your \ndoctors could make your own health care decisions, especially when they \nwere important to you and your family. It wasn't easy. There were \nlobbyists all over this place from every drug company, HMO, and big \ninsurance company. They prowled these halls, but we did it and we got \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights passed in the Senate. I have absolute \nfaith that\n\n[[Page S11563]]\n\nthe Senate will do it again and the President will sign the Patients' \nBill of Rights into law for all Americans.\n  I will also never forget the brave soldiers I met in Afghanistan on a \ndark night. They are so proud--they were so proud and still are--of \nserving their country, going after terrorists and Osama bin Laden. I \nwill never forget the thousands of men and women from Fort Bragg, Camp \nLejeune, Cherry Point, Seymour Johnson, and Pope Air Force bases, who \nwere serving this country abroad and who were serving the country at \nhome, and whose families were there to support them. I represented them \nand represented their families and it was an extraordinary honor for me \nto be able to represent them.\n  It is simple for me. If you take care of us, if you serve our country \nto protect the freedoms and ideals we cherish, we should be there for \nyou. Your country should be there for you. That means health care and \nhousing, it means relief on your student loans, and help covering your \nchild care cost when your spouse has to go to work.\n  The men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of \nAmerica, they are who we think of and pray for when we look at our \nflag. The Stars and Stripes wave for them. The word ``hero'' was made \nfor them. They are the best and the bravest, and we will always stand \nwith you when you are standing in harm's way. This is what we have \nfought for together. It is something of which we should all be proud.\n  We built on North Carolina's model to improve our schools, to \nstrengthen standards, to expand afterschool, and to pay teachers more. \nWe fought to strengthen security at our ports and our borders, chemical \nand nuclear plants, and to give our police and firefighters the support \nthey needed to keep this country safe. We fought to make Washington \nlive within its budget, to make sure Washington did what most families \nin America do every single day, to live within their means, and to \nrestore fiscal responsibility. And we fought to reward work--not just \nwealth, work--and to ensure that the American dream stays alive and \navailable to every single American, no matter where they live or who \ntheir family is or what the color of their skin. This is the America we \nbelieve in. This is the America we fought for.\n\n  All my life I have fought for those who do not have a voice. I did it \nbefore I came to the Senate. I have done it here in the Senate. I will \ndo it for the rest of my life. It is what my life has been about: \nFighting for people who need someone to fight for them.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for all of his guidance and for showing me the \nropes during the time I have been here in the Senate.\n  I want to take a moment and say a word about Senator Reid, who has \nalso been a great leader here in the Senate and who I want to wish \nGodspeed in the important work in front of him.\n  Again, my thanks to my leader, to our leader, Senator Daschle, for \nthe work he has done and the leadership he has shown and the grace and \nstrength and courage he has shown in leading in very difficult times, \nas others have said. He is a good and decent man and we all look up to \nhim and respect him.\n  I thank Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy for including me in \nworking on the Patients' Bill of Rights, two great leaders in this \nSenate, two great leaders for the country, two Americans that Americans \ndo and should look up to and respect.\n  I thank my friend, my seatmate, Senator Evan Bayh, for all the times \nwe have spent together, working here on the floor of the Senate, \nrunning together. He and his wife and his family are great friends of \nours. His friendship means the world to me.\n  I also thank my fellow Senate retirees Senator Breaux and Senator \nHollings. One thing I guarantee you: Our accents will be missed here on \nthe floor of the Senate. Hopefully, there will be others who will be \nable to speak the way we speak.\n  I also want to say a word about my friend Senator Kerry. I embarked a \nfew months ago on a journey with Senator Kerry, a fight, as we traveled \nacross the country and fought for the things in which we believe. We \nshared our hopes for this country together. We worked hard to make \nAmerica stronger. I developed a very strong, close, personal friendship \nwith John Kerry during that time. John Kerry is a good man and he is a \ngood American. I got the chance to see him when others didn't, when \nthere were no cameras around, when there were no crowds. This is a man \nof strength and conviction and courage. He loves his children. He has a \nbeautiful family, by the way. He and his wife Teresa and their kids \nbecame very close with my family and our children.\n  We feel an enormous affection for them and enormous connection with \nthem because we were engaged in what we thought was a very important \ncause. It still is a very important cause.\n  But the reality is that John Kerry is somebody who has loved this \ncountry his entire life. He stood up and fought for this country his \nentire life. I am proud to have been able to spend the last few months \nfighting alongside him as he traveled throughout the country and the \nwork that he did not just in this campaign but for all the years he \nserved in this Senate before this campaign, and the years he will serve \nfrom here on are important. Every day he walks onto the floor of this \nSenate, the American people will be better for it.\n  He is my friend. He is my colleague. I trust him.\n  I believe, of course, that he would have made a great President, and \nI believe he has great work to do for this country in the days and \nyears to come. It is an honor for me to be able to serve with him in \nthis term.\n  I also want to thank my staff. I ask unanimous consent to have their \nnames printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Sophie Milam, Blair B. Milligan, Joyce Mitchell, Carlos A. \n     Monje, Kevin A. Monroe, Robert Morgan, Matthew L. Nelson, \n     Elizabeth E. Nicholas, Ashley I. O'Bryan, Sacha M. Ostern, \n     Joseph W. Parry-Hill, Lauren Partner, Elizabeth Pegram, \n     Philip J. Peisch, Sarah L. Pendergraft.\n       Anthony Petty, Aaron S. Pickrell, Lesley Pittman, Sally \n     Bussey Plyler, Mary Margaret Propes, Hunter L. Pruett, \n     Jacqueline F. Ray, Karen A. Robb, David E. Roberts, Judith M. \n     Rossabi, David A.

Mr. President, we couldn't do the work we do here \nwithout the support and help of all those who work so hard with us \nevery single day. You show up every day. You show up every day, in my \ncase as I saw it, with a simple question: What can I do to make my \ncountry better? And you did. Those of you who worked with me, I know \nthat you did; I saw it. I saw the hard work you did, and you will \ncontinue to do it because you believe public service is an important \nand noble calling. I thank you personally. I thank you on behalf of the \npeople of North Carolina and the people of this country. I have seen \nthe hard work you have done, and it is important.\n  This fight goes on.\n  I will be home in a place I love, North Carolina, the place that made \nme love America to begin with. I am going to have God's gift--more time \nto hear the screen door slam when my young kids run through the house \nafter school. I still have a couple of young kids, Emma Claire, who is \n6, and Jack, who is 4. I will be able to spend more time with my older \ndaughter Kate, who graduated from college and was out on the campaign \ntrail. I am very proud of her. I will have more time to spend with my \nown parents and my family and more time to be there for the woman I \nlove and have loved for a long time now, my wife Elizabeth.\n  It is bittersweet knowing what we have accomplished. And it is also \nbittersweet knowing what is left to be done. There is so much work left \nto be done in this country.\n  And in the end, I always think of North Carolina's own Thomas Wolfe. \nHe said:\n\n       I believe that we are lost here in America, but I believe \n     we shall be found. And this belief, which mounts now to the \n     catharis of knowledge and conviction, is for me--and I think \n     for all of us--not only our own hope but, America's \n     everlasting, living dream.\n\n  Our job is making sure that no one--no one--is lost in America; that \nthat\n\n[[Page S11564]]\n\ndream is everlasting. And together we will continue to make it stronger \nand more alive for all who grace our lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to make some comments about \nour friends who are departing the Senate.\n  I thank Senator Edwards for spending some time in this Chamber. When \nyou came in, we were faced with some tough legal issues. We turned to \nyou and you stepped up to the plate. I appreciate that. I thought you \ndid us proud--I am not only speaking as a Democrat, I am speaking as an \nAmerican--on the campaign trail with the passion for people. You are so \narticulate and you brought the economic issues home to everyone. I \nthink everyone is better for it.\n  You are right about Senator Kerry. I think he would have made a great \nPresident. I think history will look at his campaign and be kind to him \nbecause John Kerry had dignity in his campaign. He stuck to the issues. \nThe debates were fantastic. I believe it served our President well. He \nhad to step up to the plate as well on many of the issues.\n  I also want to say how much I am going to miss Fritz Hollings, an \namazing man; protector of the consumers, guardian of the budget.\n  Senator Graham is a champion on the environment and some other \nissues, protecting senior citizens and Social Security. We will need to \nhear his voice.\n  Senator Breaux was always out there trying to pull us together.\n  I have to say a word about Senator Fitzgerald because of some tough \nenvironmental votes. There he was standing with me. I remember one time \nhe said, I have to stand with you because my son will never talk to me \nagain. It was good to work with him as well.\n  I want to finish my remarks by saying Tom Daschle is a man of great \ncourage and compassion and wisdom, quiet leadership. I think today as \nwe listened to his remarks, his farewell to the Senate, we saw his \ngoodness, we saw his intelligence, and as my senior Senator said, it is \ntough to imagine people wanting something different than what Tom \nDaschle offered them. But that is what it is about. It is about \nelections.\n  I say that Tom Daschle will go down as a great leader of this Senate, \nas a man who put issues ahead of his own personal gain. I think he is a \nrole model for each and every one of us. He is a class act.\n  I say to him and Linda, Godspeed. I know that in future years you \nwill be very much on the scene because you have so much to offer. You \nhave such a sense of history and such a sense of the future. It is \nbittersweet. But it is an honor to have known Tom.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I want to close by associating myself with \nthe remarks of the Senator from California and her regards and respect \nto the other retiring Members, particularly Senator Edwards who has \njust spoken and has distinguished himself so impressively over the last \nyear and half in the service of our country by seeking the Vice \nPresidency.\n  I am proud of my State of Minnesota. They cast by a majority over \n100,000 votes for Senator Edwards and Senator Kerry, reflecting the \nwisdom of voters in the tremendous excitement of Senator Edwards and \nSenator Kerry. But Senator Edwards, in my personal experience, \ngenerated tremendous courage and enthusiasm in St. Paul, MN on Labor \nDay and on the Iron Range in Minnesota. He has a very bright future in \nwhatever future endeavors.\n  I join my colleagues in expressing to his wife Elizabeth our prayers \nfor a speedy recovery. I think that will be the result.\n  I thank the Senator for his outstanding service and as leader of our \nparty and our country.\n  I also want to join my colleagues in expressing my highest personal \nregard for Senator Daschle. It is, like others, a hard time for me. It \nwas very hard in the next day after the election to hear the results in \nSouth Dakota. I have always had and will continue to have the greatest \nrespect for the democratic process in this country. It is the ultimate \nand appropriate judgment of the people. I felt that way even when I \ndisagreed with the verdicts they rendered.\n  I must say to the very slightest of majority, the voters of my \nneighboring State in South Dakota, with all due respect to them and \ntheir rightful judgment, that in my humble opinion you were wrong. You \ncannot fully understand the extraordinary leader, the superb public \nservant, and the phenomenal human being you had in Tom Daschle as your \nSenator, and as all of us in his caucus knew we had in our Democratic \nleader.\n  What makes it so hard is he has been taken away from us despite our \nwishes, and taken away from the country. And it is very hard. It is \nhard, frankly, to hear all the false praise of someone who went beyond \nthe boundaries of comity, of bipartisanship, of deserved respect for a \nleader, who campaigned against Tom, who violated the boundaries of his \nown State and disparaged him; and, most recently, the comments of the \nincoming chairwoman of the Republican Senate Campaign Committee which \nwere untrue, unwarranted, and just plain foul. Tom Daschle has too much \ndecency to say so.\n\n  That was the irony in and the indecency of those remarks. They were \ndirected after the election, after the victory against the most decent \nman I have ever met in politics, Tom Daschle. He is a gentleman in the \nvery best sense of that word: strong in his principles, firm in his \nconvictions, fierce in his dedication to serving the people of South \nDakota and their best interests, but a gentleman in his decency, his \npersonal respect and the senatorial courtesies he extended to every one \nof his colleagues.\n  But Tom, being the man he is, would not want me to end on such a \nnote. So I will not. I end by thanking him, thanking him for his \nleadership over the last 4 years, from the time during which I have \nbeen privileged to serve under his leadership, for mentoring me, giving \nme the opportunities I have had in committee assignments, to listening \nto me and offering his astute guidance and experience and wisdom. I \nthank him for showing me by his living example every day and every \nnight in the Senate what it means to be a great Senator, what it \nentails, the dedication, the hard work, the hours, the travel; what it \nmeans when you can do what Tom Daschle has done for his State to save \npeople's lives, to improve people's lives, create new opportunities for \nyoung and old, what he has done for his country, what he has done for \npeople who are not his constituents who cannot even thank him and won't \nbe able to vote for him. But that did not matter because he had the \nopportunity and he seized the opportunity to do things that benefited \ntheir lives.\n  Thank you, Tom Daschle. Thank you for being a superb leader. Thank \nyou for being a great Senator. Thank you for being a phenomenal human \nbeing. I wish you well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we could not help but note the sadness \nwe all experienced as our friend and leader, Tom Daschle, made his \ngoodbye speech. As usual, when Tom Daschle spoke, it had meaning, \nsubstance. He certainly had that as he closed his chapter here--I hope \nnot his book, just his chapter.\n  He talked about things he cared about and people he cared about and \nwhat it is that drove him to take this job. Everyone knows how \ndifficult a task being a leader in the Senate is. It is not always \nrealized outside this Chamber how hard one has to work to please so \nmany, to sacrifice so much in terms of personal life.\n  Tom Daschle, our leader, distinguished Senator from South Dakota, \noutstanding leader--not just for this side of the aisle but the entire \ncountry. He lost an extremely tough, close race a couple of weeks ago.\n  Tom Daschle is the stuff of which so many of our lives in the Senate \nare made.\n  It is a sad day. It is not just a sad day for me, who treasured the \nfriendship I had with Tom Daschle, listened carefully to his words and \nfollowed, for the most part, the directions he portrayed for all \nMembers here, it is a sad day, obviously, for Tom Daschle's family; it \nis a sad day for the Senate and a sad day for everyone in this great \ncountry of ours.\n\n[[Page S11565]]\n\n  I said Tom is the stuff of which so many of our lives are made. It is \nquite hard to see in this place of splendor the route so many Members \ntook to get here. There is a substantial difference in age between Tom \nDaschle and me but I had a similar experience. I was the first in my \nfamily to go to college. My parents were hard-working people. They did \nnot work on a farm but they worked in the store. They worked in the \nmills. My father worked in the silk mills of Patterson, NJ, a factory \ntown.\n  What was the legacy they imparted? It was to work hard, to believe in \nAmerica, to believe in yourself. Try to achieve a degree of respect and \ndignity. That is what my father did for me, even after I had enlisted \nin the Army and he was on his deathbed from cancer. The messages were \nall profound: work, study, learn.\n  He took me into his factory one time and said: You must never work \nlike this, so dirty, so dusty, so noisy, so dangerous. He knew it was \ndangerous, that there was something in the weaving of that silk fabric \nwhere they used chemicals to keep it from growing too brittle, to keep \nthe machinery oiled. It took my father, his brother, their father, at \nvery young ages.\n  When we hear Tom Daschle talk about his background, how his parents \nworked to provide him with not the funds but the incentive to make \nsomething of his life, to give something back to America, we know Tom \nDaschle is a model for so many to follow, with that commitment to \ndecency and honor.\n  It is a sad day when we reflect on what happened in Tom Daschle's \nlast race. He wanted to be here. We wanted him to be here. Tom has been \nan effective leader for us for 10 years. The Republicans threw \neverything they could at him, including some $20 million in that race, \nincluding some insults in recent days. And then to not permit the man \nto leave with grace and hold his head high--no, called him an \nobstructionist.\n  I know when the shoe is on the other foot what happens, when the \nminority has to fight like the devil to keep from being rolled over by \nthe majority. We saw it when we were in charge. How I miss those days \nwhen we were in charge. The Republican Party, the minority party, they \ndid their filibustering. They did their obstruction. They did the \nthings needed to protect the interests they thought served their \nconstituents, their States, and their country.\n  It was ungracious when the Republican side could not find enough of \ntheir Members to sit here out of respect. I remember being here when \nBob Dole left and I could not wait to sit in my chair and salute his \ncontribution to America and to this body, because, although Bob Dole \ncould disagree with you, he was always interested in the well-being of \nthe country. You saw it from the result of his service to country and \nthe military.\n  I do not know why, in the closing days, some element of comity, some \nelement of grace, some element of respect for a human being could not \nhave gotten some of our friends out of their offices to come down to \nthe floor. You saw the applause. The applause that I paid most of the \nattention to was from the people who work back here, the people who saw \nTom Daschle at work every day. They know what he meant to them \npersonally, to this country, to this institution. That is why they \nstood and applauded so vigorously. You saw Tom's colleagues standing \nhere, hating to let go, hating to let him leave the room. They did it \nwith their applause and their hugs, their glances, and their tears.\n  So we are sorry that the Tom Daschle segment of service to this \ncountry and to this body is over. As usual, as always, there was a \ncharacteristic graciousness in his departure, in acknowledging that he \nhad lost the race. Everyone here has some sense of how painful it could \nbe, especially being leader of the party, especially when they threw \neverything in the book at him that they could pick up.\n  It is not going to be easy to forget Tom Daschle. We are going to \nmiss him. He had wonderful service to country. He served as an \nintelligence officer in the Air Force for 3 years. He won his first \nrace. Many cited the chronology of his climb to leader of the \nDemocratic Senate. He carved out a national reputation. People knew who \nhe was, but he never forgot his South Dakota constituents.\n  We heard him talk about them. He talked about traveling to each of \nthe State's counties every year as an unscheduled driving tour, where \nhe stopped at the local clubs, the Elks Club, the cattle auctions, the \nhealth clinics, schools, cafes, police stations, or any other place \nwhere people could gather to hear him talk about what was on his mind, \nand to listen to them talk about what was on their mind.\n  Tom has been an effective legislator. His aim: to help his \nconstituents, help his country, help those who were less fortunate \nacross America. He fought hard for small farmers in his State.\n  We did not always agree. Those of us who come from an urban \nenvironment disagreed with some of the votes he took. But he always \nremembered from whence he came. He fought hard for the people that he \nbelieved in, for Native Americans from his State, veterans exposed to \nAgent Orange. I joined him in that fight because I always believed \nanyone who had any remote contact, no matter how remote or how short a \nperiod of time, with Agent Orange should be treated as any other \nveteran or any other soldier who had a wound because we know what Agent \nOrange has done to so many who have served so well, so loyally in a war \nwe could not agree on, much like what we are seeing now in our country. \nAnd we had to respect his insistence that we remember these people, the \nseniors, and the people in the rural parts of the country where the \neconomy has never really been robust.\n  Nature always takes its toll. But Tom insisted we fight back, that we \nmake sure the farm community continued to exist in this country so we \ncould produce the nutrition that is so vital--the products we all use \nso regularly.\n  And Tom is so young looking, soft spoken, self-effacing, and \nfundamentally decent. He was actually mistaken for a paperboy one time. \nBut beneath that wonderful exterior, that almost placid view of things, \nthere was a spine of steel. He could get up and fight hard and fight \nfor the issues. His leadership for us--and, believe me, it was not \neasy. It is not easy on the Democratic side, it is not easy on the \nRepublican side, I am sure, to pull everybody together because each of \nus has differences that come from our geography, from our State, from \nthe culture within our States. But the fact is, Tom could get us \ntogether on the most difficult issues, not always 100 percent, not \nalways in victory, but always with vigor and always with commitment.\n\n  Tom has devoted practically all his entire life to public service. We \nare going to miss his leadership, his counsel, and his friendship.\n  In my closing comments to him I said: We are saying kind of so long \nbut hopefully not really goodbye. We want to hear from Tom Daschle. I \nhave made a plea to him that he stays involved with the public \ninterest. I hope he is going to do that. Tom will have many offers for \ncommercial development and to make lots more money, but he feels an \nobligation down deep, as I would think most of us or all of us do here, \nto try to do something that counts.\n  I encourage him and his great wife Linda to get through this \ndifficult, difficult period. It is not easy when you are the leader to \nlose a race. It is never easy, but it is particularly difficult when \nyou have had leadership responsibilities.\n  So my message to Tom is: Tom, keep that spine of steel. Keep that \ninterest that you have in the well-being of our society, in the belief \nthat America can recover from all kinds of difficulties, some of the \nworst that we are facing right now. It is not just the war, as painful \nas that is.\n  I have a display in front of my office of young faces, of people, \nmany of whom are in their teens, late teens, 18, 19. I enlisted in the \nArmy when I was 18. I did not realize then I was such a baby. I realize \nnow that 18 is so, so young. But I have those photographs there as \nreminders about what the price of this war really is. It is not just \nthe financial side, which is enormous. It is not just the humiliation \nside, which is enormous, the humiliation because we failed to have the \nappropriate intelligence, intelligence to tell us even most recently \nhow difficult Fallujah was going to be. We underestimated, and as a \nconsequence the costs\n\n[[Page S11566]]\n\nare heavy. In the last week, we lost two people from New Jersey. We are \nnow over 1,200 who have died in the course of that fight.\n  But again, Tom Daschle, and I think all of us here, have to continue \nto fight for what is right. We can endure our differences here. I will \ntell you what we cannot endure. We cannot endure the bitterness that \nexists across the dividing line here. We cannot endure the vitriol that \nis constant in this room of ours. We cannot endure the anger that \nexists. We have a cause that is greater than all of us.\n  I am not saying it all comes flowing this way, but I am saying it is \nunpleasant. I have now had 22 years since I arrived. It is now 22 years \nsince I arrived in the Senate. I remember different days. I remember \ndays when you could disagree and still be able to say hello without \ngrimacing when you saw one of your colleagues. Lord willing, I hope Tom \nDaschle taught us some of that, with his graciousness, his \ncharacteristic willingness to listen and to understand and get back to \nyou when a problem existed.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor, but I do want to \ntalk about our other colleagues who are retiring in a few minutes. \nThere are a lot of good people here on both sides of the aisle.\n  We are going to miss all of our friends over here, but I am going to \nmiss Don Nickles. I have had a lot of fights with him, but I know he \nalways knew where he wanted to go. I respected that.\n  Peter Fitzgerald, newer among us, but a gentleman to be noted, and \nBen Nighthorse Campbell comes from a State I love. I have two \ngrandchildren there. He is a decent fellow. We are going to miss all of \nthem. I will talk about them later.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I know this is a time of recognition of our \nretiring Members on both the Republican and Democratic sides. If I can \nstep in for a moment, we have cleared a variety of bills to be moved at \nthis time. I will proceed to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I say to Senator Campbell, as chairman \nof the Indian Affairs Committee upon which I serve, I appreciate his \nleadership in helping this important bill become law. I support S. 2605 \nand believe it codifies a fair and equitable settlement of Snake River \nBasin water rights in Idaho. However, I am concerned that the bill \ncurrently pending before the Senate may have inadvertently altered the \nrights of my constituents and obligations of the downstream States of \nWashington and Oregon in the application and implementation of Federal \nenvironmental laws.\n  Therefore, I have a few questions to ask regarding the effect of \nsection 4 of S. 2605 and the agreement, as expressed in the Mediator's \nTerm Sheet, that S. 2605 would approve. Specifically, I am concerned \nabout (1) whether some inference might be drawn from the language in \nsection 4(a) of the act that, by approving, ratifying and confirming \nthe agreement, Congress has in effect altered the obligation of Federal \nagencies to consult under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act; (2) \nwhether the act might be interpreted to require that Federal agencies \nimplement the agreement without taking into consideration the interests \nof other affected States; and (3) whether the act or the agreement \nmight be construed to alter any obligations that the parties might have \nunder the Clean Water Act, particularly in relation to the protection \nof federally approved State water quality standards of downstream \nStates.\n  I noticed that these three specific issues were not expressly \naddressed in the report of the Committee on Indian Affairs that has \nbeen filed and accompanies the substitute amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. These three issues were not specifically addressed in \nthe report issued by the committee, although the part of the report \nthat discusses the meaning of section 4(a) of the substitute amendment \ndoes make the point, and fairly clearly I think, that there is no \nintent to alter or amend Federal environmental laws like the Endangered \nSpecies Act and the Clean Water Act or to somehow limit the rights of \npersons or organizations to pursue any remedies that are otherwise \navailable to them under such laws. The three precise issues you mention \nwere not deliberately omitted from discussion in the report--to the \ncontrary, they were not discussed in the report simply because those \nspecific issues, as you have articulated them, were not aired during or \nafter the hearing held on this legislation and, in fact, arose only \nafter the amendment in the nature of a substitute was reported to the \nSenate on October 7, 2004.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. As the principal sponsor and architect of the \nsubstitute amendment approved by the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs, what was the intent about the meaning of the substitute \namendment and the agreement it would approve with respect to those \nthree issues?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. My intent with respect to all three of the issues that \nthe Senator has mentioned is consistent with my intent regarding the \nmeaning of section 4 of the substitute amendment and the agreement \nitself--that is, neither the substitute amendment nor the agreement \nshould be interpreted to somehow restrict the rights of any State, \nperson or organization to pursue remedies otherwise available under \nFederal environmental laws such as the Clean Water Act and the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  I would point out that neither the substitute amendment nor the \nagreement should be read to create, enlarge or limit any obligation of \nFederal agencies to consult under section 7 of the Endangered Species \nAct. Also, the\n\n[[Page S11572]]\n\nintent behind the substitute amendment is that Federal agencies \nimplement the terms of the agreement and any applicable Federal laws \nwith due consideration of both the interests of the parties and those \nof other affected States so that no interests are prejudiced. Finally, \nneither the substitute amendment nor the agreement should be \ninterpreted to create or alter any obligations of the parties under the \nClean Water Act with respect to the protection of federally approved \nState water quality standards of downstream States. However, with that \nI do not mean to imply or suggest that any such obligations exist or do \nnot exist.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator for clarifying these important \nmatters.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator for her inquiry.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Speaking as the subcommittee chairman with jurisdiction \nover the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, I concur in \nthe clarifications expressed by my colleagues.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2605), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11572-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11572-S11577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INDIAN TRIBAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION FEASIBILITY ACT OF 2004\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 519) to establish a \nNative American-owned financial entity to provide financial services to \nIndian tribes, Native American organizations, and Native Americans, and \nfor other purposes, which had been reported from the Committee on \nIndian Affairs, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting \nclause and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n  (Strike the part shown in black brackets and insert the part shown in \nitalic.)\n\n                                 S. 519\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     [SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       [Congress finds the following:\n       [(1) From 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the \n     Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its \n     tributaries to determine sites at which power could be \n     produced at low cost.\n       [(2) The Corps of Engineers--\n       [(A) identified a number of sites, including the site at \n     which the Grand Coulee Dam is located; and\n       [(B) recommended that power development at those sites be \n     performed by local governmental authorities or private \n     utilities under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.).\n       [(3) Under section 10(e) of that Act (16 U.S.C. 803(e)), a \n     licensee is required to compensate an Indian tribe for the \n     use of land under the jurisdiction of the Indian tribe.\n       [(4) In August 1933, the Columbia Basin Commission, an \n     agency of the State of Washington, received a preliminary \n     permit from the Federal Power Commission for water power \n     development at the Grand Coulee site.\n       [(5) In the mid-1930's, the Federal Government, which is \n     not subject to the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.)--\n       [(A) federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project;

\n     and\n       [(C) the inundation of land with loss of potential power \n     sites previously identified by the Spokane Tribe.\n       [(7) In the Act of June 29, 1940, Congress--\n       [(A) in the first section (16 U.S.C. 835d) granted to the \n     United States--\n       [(i) all rights of Indian tribes in land of the Spokane \n     Tribe and Colville Indian Reservations that were required for \n     the Grand Coulee Dam project;

and\n       [(B) to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n     Reservation, $63,000.\n       [(9) In 1994, following 43 years of litigation before the \n     Indian Claims Commission, the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit, Congress ratified an agreement between the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the \n     United States that provided for damages and annual payments \n     of $15,250,000 in perpetuity, adjusted annually, based on \n     revenues from the sale of electric power from the Grand \n     Coulee Dam project and transmission of that power by the \n     Bonneville Power Administration.\n       [(10) In legal opinions issued by the Office of the \n     Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, a Task Force \n     Study conducted from 1976 to 1980 ordered by the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate, and hearings before Congress at \n     the time at which the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n     Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act (Public Law 103-\n     436;

and\n       [(B) an attempt by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to \n     impose improper requirements on claims attorneys retained by \n     Indian tribes, which caused delays in retention of counsel \n     and full investigation of the potential claims of the Spokane \n     Tribe.\n       [(12) As a consequence of construction of the Grand Coulee \n     Dam project, the Spokane Tribe--\n       [(A) has suffered the loss of--\n       [(i) the salmon fishery on which the Spokane Tribe was \n     dependent;\n       [(ii) identified hydropower sites that the Spokane Tribe \n     could have developed; and\n       [(iii) hydropower revenues that the Spokane Tribe would \n     have received under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.) had the project not been federalized; and\n       [(B) continues to lose hydropower revenues that the Federal \n     Government recognized were owed to the Spokane Tribe at the \n     time at which the project was constructed.\n       [(13) More than 39 percent of the land owned by Indian \n     tribes or members of Indian tribes that was used for the \n     Grand Coulee Dam project was land of the Spokane Tribe.\n\n     [SEC. 3.

and\n       (17) by vote of the Spokane tribal membership, the Spokane \n     Tribe has resolved that the payments and land transfers made \n     pursuant to this Act constitute fair and equitable \n     compensation for the past and continued use of Spokane Tribal \n     land for the production of hydropower at Grand Coulee Dam.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As directed by Congress in section 723 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 613), as added by \n     section 305 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law \n     104-104; 110 Stat. 126), the Federal Communications \n     Commission adopted rules requiring closed captioning of most \n     television programming, which gradually require new video \n     programming to be fully captioned beginning in 2006.\n       (2) More than 28,000,000 Americans, or 8 percent of the \n     population, are considered deaf or hard of hearing, and many \n     require captioning services to participate in mainstream \n     activities.\n       (3) More than 24,000 children are born in the United States \n     each year with some form of hearing loss.\n       (4) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services and a study done by the National Council on Aging--\n       (A) 25 percent of Americans over 65 years old are hearing \n     impaired;\n       (B) 33 percent of Americans over 70 years old are hearing \n     impaired; and\n       (C) 41 percent of Americans over 75 years old are hearing \n     impaired.\n       (5) The National Council on Aging study also found that \n     depression in older adults may be directly related to hearing \n     loss and disconnection with the spoken word.\n       (6) Empirical research demonstrates that captions improve \n     the performance of individuals learning to read English and, \n     according to numerous Federal agency statistics, could \n     benefit--\n       (A) 3,700,000 remedial readers;\n       (B) 12,000,000 young children learning to read;\n       (C) 27,000,000 illiterate adults; and\n       (D) 30,000,000 people for whom English is a second \n     language.\n       (7) Over the past 5 years, student enrollment in programs \n     that train court reporters to become realtime writers has \n     decreased significantly, causing such programs to close on \n     many campuses.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF GRANT PROGRAM TO PROMOTE TRAINING \n                   AND JOB PLACEMENT OF REALTIME WRITERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The National Telecommunications and \n     Information Administration shall make competitive grants to \n     eligible entities under subsection (b) to promote training \n     and placement of individuals, including individuals who have \n     completed a court reporting training program, as realtime \n     writers in order to meet the requirements for closed \n     captioning of video programming set forth in section 723 of \n     the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 613) and the rules \n     prescribed thereunder.\n       (b) Eligible Entities.--For purposes of this Act, an \n     eligible entity is a court reporting program that--\n       (1) can document and demonstrate to the Secretary of \n     Commerce that it meets minimum standards of educational and \n     financial accountability, with a curriculum capable of \n     training realtime writers qualified to provide captioning \n     services;\n       (2) is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by \n     the Department of Education; and\n       (3) is participating in student aid programs under title IV \n     of the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n       (c) Priority in Grants.--In determining whether to make \n     grants under this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall \n     give a priority to eligible entities that, as determined by \n     the Secretary of Commerce--\n       (1) possess the most substantial capability to increase \n     their capacity to train realtime writers;\n\n[[Page S11587]]\n\n       (2) demonstrate the most promising collaboration with local \n     educational institutions, businesses, labor organizations, or \n     other community groups having the potential to train or \n     provide job placement assistance to realtime writers; or\n       (3) propose the most promising and innovative approaches \n     for initiating or expanding training and job placement \n     assistance efforts with respect to realtime writers.\n       (d) Duration of Grant.--A grant under this section shall be \n     for a period of two years.\n       (e) Maximum Amount of Grant.--The amount of a grant \n     provided under subsection (a) to an entity eligible may not \n     exceed $1,500,000 for the two-year period of the grant under \n     subsection (d).\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, that concludes the unanimous consent \nrequests at this time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, briefly, I wish to thank the Senator from \nIdaho. The bill that was just passed is a bill that provides grants for \ntraining court reporters for closed caption reporting. In 1996, the \nCongress passed a bill that said by 2006 all television shows have to \nbe closed captioned. By 2010, all Spanish-speaking shows have to be \nclosed captioned. That is going to take about 3,000 people trained to \ndo this. We have less than 500 trained right now. We are not going to \nmeet that date, but we have to move ahead and try our best to get these \npeople trained in our community colleges all over the country. That is \nwhat this bill does.\n  I especially want to thank Senator McCain, the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, for his expeditious handling of this bill and \nletting it go through. I am assured the House is going to pass it \nunanimously, so we can get on with the business of training our \nreporters so that they can do realtime closed captioning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11587-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11587-S11588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, so our colleagues will know what our plans \nwill be tonight and tomorrow--and I talked with the Democratic leader \nbriefly earlier--the House will finish the omnibus tonight, midnight or \n1 o'clock. Because I know many Senators have lots of other things to \ndo, since we cannot say with definition when the House will complete \nthe bill, I think it is best that we say there are no more rollcall \nvotes tonight and that we will address the omnibus tomorrow.\n  In addition, we have IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, which we need to vote on tomorrow as well. We will talk \nback and forth as to what time we will be coming in tomorrow morning.\n  We have had a very busy day. It has been a very constructive day, a \ngreat day in terms of tributes on both sides of the aisle. So we have \nhad a good day.\n  We will, unfortunately, not be able to complete our business until \ntomorrow. There will be a lot of phone calls in terms of what time we \nwill be voting. We cannot really say at this juncture--depending on how \npeople view the omnibus coming over--whether or not a rollcall vote \nwill be required on IDEA. My expectation is we will have one or two \nvotes over the course of tomorrow. As soon as we get some sort of \ncertainty in the schedules--it is a little bit out of our hands, \ndepending on what action is taken in the House--we will be sure, \nthrough our respective conferences, to let everybody know tonight.\n  Before we leave tonight, we will set a time to come in tomorrow \nmorning. I assume it is going to be around 9:30 or 10 o'clock. We will \naddress that accordingly.\n  That is it in terms of information. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n[[Page S11588]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Iowa be recognized upon the completion of the remarks of the \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while the Senate is holding in \nabeyance for the final Omnibus appropriations bill that the House is \ngetting ready to file sometime tonight, I want to take the opportunity \nto pay tribute to our retiring Senators: Tom Daschle, Fritz Hollings, \nDon Nickles, John Breaux, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, John Edwards, Peter \nFitzgerald, Zell Miller, and Bob Graham.\n  I wish to make a speech about each one of these Senators who has \nbecome a dear friend, in some cases, over the years, such as Fritz and \nPeatsy Hollings, who took special interest in me as I came to the \nSenate and made sure I got on his Commerce Committee, which has been \njust an extraordinary experience with him as chairman, as well as with \nthe present chairman, John McCain.\n  Don Nickles, whom I have known over the 24 years he has been in the \nSenate, for I was in the House at the time, has been a regular in our \nWednesday morning Senate prayer breakfast. He is a good friend.\n  John Breaux, the very mention of his name brings a twinkle to your \neye as you recall the wonderful good times and the great sense of humor \nthat John Breaux has. He is the most popular politician in the State of \nLouisiana. He is going to be sorely missed as the dealmaker of the \nSenate.\n  Ben Nighthorse Campbell has this wonderful new museum for Native \nAmericans which would not have happened--just a stone's throw from this \nCapitol--had it not been for his leadership. There is, as you go \nthrough this museum, a special display on the artwork of Ben. I commend \nit to our colleagues.\n  Peter Fitzgerald is a very active member of our Commerce Committee, \nwho, in the comments by his colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, \ntoday said it very well, could work so well with Members of both sides.\n  A southern icon, Senator Zell Miller, will go down in southern \nhistory as one of the great progressive Governors of the new South. He \nis one who has always extended wonderful courtesies to me.\n  I wish to say a special word about John Edwards, for he came to the \nSenate in a seat that was already held by an incumbent Senator, and \nthey said it could not be done. They said a Democrat could not win in \nNorth Carolina. Of course, John did and took the national stage by \nstorm.\n  I spent several days with him over the course of the past several \nmonths in the campaign. I can tell you it was a wonderful inspiration \nto see the amount of energy, focus, discipline, and intelligence he \nbrought not only as a Senator but as a candidate for Vice President of \nthis great country.\n  And then, of course, we all know the story of how on the very day \nthat John had to concede the election, along with our colleague, the \nSenator from Massachusetts, his wife told him that she had breast \ncancer. I want Elizabeth and John to know that our prayers are with \nthem and that we are all sharing a great deal of optimism about her \ncomplete recovery.\n  I had the wonderful privilege of observing their three loving \nchildren on the campaign trail--their daughter Kate, and then, of \ncourse, the two young ones, Jack and Emma Claire, as they would bounce \nwith such boundless enthusiasm on that campaign plane.\n  There is a special part in my heart for Tom Daschle. We came to the \nCongress together in 1978. Among the freshman class in the House of \nRepresentatives that year, we knew Tom as ``Landslide'' Daschle. He won \nhis race for Congress by 14 votes. Of course, he says that was a big \npercentage of the total vote in South Dakota at that time.\n  We saw him grow over the years into a great Democratic leader, both \nminority and majority leader of the Senate, and we saw the pressure \nthat Tom was under.\n  Who here would not remember exactly where you were and what you were \ndoing on September 11, 2001. We were in a leadership meeting only a few \nfeet from here on the West Front of the Capitol watching the television \nof the World Trade Center, and had tried to resume our meeting when \nsomeone burst through the door and said: The Pentagon's been hit.\n  We leapt to the window looking west across the Mall in the southwest \ndirection of the Pentagon and saw the black smoke rising.\n  People went their separate ways. I leapt to a telephone to try to get \nword to my wife because we had just moved into an apartment overlooking \nthe southwest corner of the Pentagon.\n  That day I remember so vividly seeing the Constitution at work, \nbecause as I came back into the room and saw the people pouring out of \nthe majority leader's office, under the orders of the Capitol Police to \nget out of the building, evacuate immediately, I saw the security \npeople of the Capitol Police take Tom in a different direction to an \nundisclosed location where he, along with the rest of the congressional \nleadership, was to be sequestered as a protection of this \nconstitutional government and its continuity.\n  Tom grew a lot in those ensuing days. That was in the morning, \nsometime right after 10 on September 11. I remember that evening, as \ndark fell, Members of the House and the Senate of all parties on the \neast front steps of the U.S. Capitol holding hands and singing ``God \nBless America'' to demonstrate in what little way we could that those \nwho sought to strike us down were going to see the resolve and the \nunity of the Government of the United States.\n  I could keep going on about Tom, but we heard his comments today. Of \ncourse it is with a heavy heart that we see Tom leave this Chamber. It \nis under circumstances that I hope we never see replicated.\n  There has to be civility in this body. There has to be a mutual \nrespect. There has to be a respect for the truth. There has to be \nrespect for the dignity of individuals and their families. Have we lost \nour compass? Have we lost our anchor? Have we lost our sense of human \nbeings?\n  This Senator can do something about that, as I have tried in the \npast, by the way I conduct myself with regard to my relationship to \nother Senators in wanting to treat others as I would like to be \ntreated. Now that the fractiousness and the divisiveness of this highly \npartisan, highly ideological, rigid time of debate is behind us, it is \nmy hope this Senate can start to come together for the good of the \npeople, even as we approach another election time. It is for the sake \nof the Nation that we must do this.\n\n\n                               Bob Graham\n\n  I conclude my comments about my colleague from Florida, my mentor, my \nfriend of many years. It is hard to believe Bob Graham has been elected \nto serve almost 40 years--38 years to be exact. From when he was first \nelected to the State legislature in 1966, he has been in elected office \never since--two terms in the State house, two terms in the State \nsenate, two terms as the Governor of Florida, where he had a \nmagnificent record, where he has put his stamp as one of Florida's \ngreat Governors, starting programs to save the Florida Everglades, the \nRiver of Grass, the Kissimmee River, and the Everglades restoration \nthat has now started that is an $8 million project shared half and half \nbetween the State and the Federal Government. That is a great legacy \nfor Bob.\n  Then, of course, his three terms in the Senate, 10 years of which he \nserved on the Senate Intelligence Committee, the last 2 of which he \nserved as chairman of that committee. Of course, with that great \nknowledge and expertise, in the course of the debates here, Bob has \ngiven us great insight and wisdom.\n  Finally, some of his fellow Senators convinced him that he ought to \nsit down and write a book and that book is entitled ``Intelligence \nMatters.'' It is my hope that with other Senators on this floor that we \nare going to be able to help Bob fulfill one of his dreams, which is \nthat in an intelligence service that has been decimated from time \nto time as a result of the whims of appropriations, that a professional \ncore of\n\n[[Page S11589]]\n\ncareer intelligence officers can be enhanced by starting an ROTC for \nintelligence officers.\n\n  We are going to try to get the appropriations to start that and to do \nit at one of our Florida universities named for Bob Graham. Let that \nlittle incubator show the way to see whether that is a system we can \nadopt around the country to give an ample supply of officers who are \nready for service in the intelligence service.\n  So it is again with a heavy heart that I see my colleague, Senator \nGraham, retire after a distinguished career. He will not be retiring as \na public servant, because whether it be from the position of a \nuniversity--and it is my understanding he will be going to Harvard for \na year at the Kennedy School--or whether it be back in our State \naffiliated with several of our universities in Florida, Bob will be \nrendering public service to the people of this country for some period \nof time.\n  So for all of these names I have mentioned, in the great poem \n``Ulysses,'' he says, ``I am a part of all that I have met,'' and I am \na part of all these great Senators. I am much richer for it and for \nhaving been their friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                              Tom Daschle\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in these final working days of the 108th \nCongress, as so many speakers before me have said, we are saying \nfarewell to a number of our retiring colleagues. I intend to speak \nabout a couple of them this evening and will have more to say about \nsome of the others tomorrow.\n  A most painful farewell will be to my good friend Senator Tom \nDaschle. I do not know that I have heard a more heartfelt, soul-\nsearching, and inspirational speech about what a Senator should be, \nought to be, and must be than the speech given by our great leader \nSenator Daschle earlier this evening.\n  As I sat and listened to that speech, especially when he talked about \nDick Reiners, my mind went back to 1978 when I was just a second-term \nCongressman from the State of Iowa and I was asked to go campaign in \nSouth Dakota for this young guy running for the House whose name was \nTom Daschle. His former employer, Senator Jim Abourezk, came to Iowa to \ncampaign for me and asked me to reciprocate. Because I had been active \nin some farm issues and agricultural issues, he asked me to campaign in \nSouth Dakota, and I did.\n\n  I struck up a friendship with Tom Daschle at that point that endures \nto this day and will endure forever. So I would go out and campaign for \nhim and then he would come and campaign for me and I would campaign and \nwe would go back and forth from Iowa to South Dakota. Of course, we \nshared a common border up at Sioux City. Much of Sioux Falls's \ntelevision comes into Iowa. Much of Sioux City's goes into South \nDakota. So we have shared kind of a common area there of constituents, \nconstituencies over all these years.\n  So it is a painful farewell to my good friend Tom Daschle. These \ndays, there are fewer and fewer bipartisan agreements in this body. But \nI sense today that there was bipartisan agreement about Tom Daschle. We \nrespect his decency, his fairness, his courage and leadership, his \nextraordinary capacity for hard work. I cannot imagine a more difficult \njob in the Senate than being leader of the Democratic caucus. We have \nall heard Will Rogers quip that he belonged to no organized party, he \nwas a Democrat.\n  Those independent, hard-headed habits flourish within our caucus. For \nthe last decade, Tom Daschle's amazing skills and unlimited patience \nhave brought us together as a team. That is an accomplishment of which \nhe can be very proud.\n  The President of the United States, it is said, has the persuasion of \npower. But the leader of our Senate Democratic caucus has only the \npower of persuasion. I cannot imagine anyone more persuasive than \nSenator Tom Daschle. He has always been willing to talk with us, \naccommodate us whenever possible, to do whatever it takes, however long \nit takes, to forge a consensus and move us ahead. We are grateful. I am \ngrateful for his leadership, his diligence, for his grace that he has \nunfailingly brought to this job as our leader. I cannot emphasize \nenough this fairness and this underlying grace of this wonderful human \nbeing. Unfailingly fair to all.\n  When Democrats were in the majority, Majority Leader Daschle was \nrespectful of the rights and the prerogatives of our Republican \nminority. Conversely, as our minority leader, he has steadfastly \ndefended the rights and the prerogatives of the Democratic minority. In \nthe heat of a partisan campaign, some have labeled this \n``obstructionism,'' but that characterization is incorrect. The duty of \nthe opposition party is present compelling alternatives, and to do so \nfairly, forthrightly, and within the rules of the Senate. The duty of \nthe leader of our opposition is to protect the rights of the minority \nso that our voice and our votes can be heard; so that we can speak out \nand offer a different way, a different path. That is our duty as \nopposition. Senator Daschle protected the rights of the minority, so \nimportant in our country, not just in the Senate, but important for us \nas a country.\n  If there is one thing that is pervasive in our Constitution and our \nBill of Rights, it is just that; it is the protection of the minority \nso the minority can be heard. That is so the minority's voice and votes \nwill be counted. That is exactly what Senator Daschle has done. There \nis not one hint of obstructionism. What he has done is to protect and \nenhance the rights of the minority, and he did it with skill and \npersistence, with fairness and with grace.\n  Over all these years of service with Tom Daschle in the House and in \nthe Senate, I have always respected how he fought and advocated for his \nconstituents in South Dakota. No one has fought harder in the House and \nin the Senate for the revitalization of rural America than Tom Daschle. \nNo one has fought harder to bring health care and good schools and \neconomic opportunity to Indian country. No one has fought harder to \nincrease the income of family farmers and give them a fair shake in the \nmarketplace.\n  Another jewel in the crown of Tom Daschle's legacy is the emerging \nethanol industry in the United States. Since Tom arrived in Congress in \n1978, he has been a relentless champion of ethanol. He mentioned that \nin his farewell speech today. I know he was a relentless champion \nbecause I was there, too, during those early years. People said those \nof us who were advocating the expanded use of ethanol didn't have a \nchance against big oil. But Senator Daschle persevered. He used the \n1990 Clean Air Act to put in place policies that gave birth to the \nethanol industry in our country. He continued to promote tax incentives \nand a renewable fuel standard to advance ethanol and to move our \ncountry towards energy independence.\n\n  No doubt about it, Senator Daschle's leadership on ethanol brought us \nto where we are today in the production of this renewable and clean \nfuel in America. His leadership on ethanol will be greatly missed in \nthe future.\n  It has been a privilege to serve in this body with Tom Daschle. I \nwill miss him as a colleague. I will miss his leadership, that \nfairness, that gentleness of nature, but that steely determination to \nmake sure that our views and our votes were counted; that steely \ndetermination to make sure that people who live in small towns in rural \nAmerica are not forgotten, that their interests are protected here. I \nwill miss him as a friend. Oh, I am not going to lose contact with Tom \nand Linda. My wife and I will continue to count them as good friends. \nBut I will miss him as a friend here in the Senate.\n  As Tom Daschle said today, he has always been an optimist. I have \nnever known Tom Daschle to ever utter a pessimistic word. For him the \nsunrise was always better than the sunset. So the Sun rises on a new \nchapter in Tom Daschle's life. That Sun is going to be bright. It is \ngoing to be bright because of who Tom Daschle is, what he is. So there \nare going to be some new days and important chapters ahead written in \nthe life of Tom Daschle. Both Ruth and I wish Tom and Linda and his \nfamily the very best in the years ahead.\n  We will continue to look forward to his input into the political life \nof America and into the common wheel that binds us as a country.\n\n\n                              John Edwards\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would also like to express my respect to \nand\n\n[[Page S11590]]\n\nadmiration for the retiring senior Senator from North Carolina, Senator \nJohn Edwards, who also spoke earlier. We will miss his unique, \nskillful, and persuasive voice in the debates here on the Senate floor. \nTime and again we have seen his knack for taking complex arguments and \nmaking them accessible and persuasive to ordinary people. Time and \nagain his skills have carried the day.\n  I fully understand the advice uttered by one of my Republican \ncolleagues one time, when he said, ``Never yield the floor to John \nEdwards.''\n  Over the last year and a half, people in my State of Iowa have gotten \nto know John and his wonderful wife Elizabeth very well. As I have \noften said, John Edwards was the only person to run for national office \nas a Vice Presidential candidate who visited each one of Iowa's 99 \ncounties. He has been all over our State, in our schools, in our coffee \nshops, and in our living rooms. In fact, we have often said in Iowa if \nit weren't for that southern accent, you would think John was born and \nraised in Iowa.\n  I can say that we on the Democratic side, we Democrats in Iowa and \nall over the country, are proud of his race to secure the nomination of \nour party, which he did not get, which went to another of our \ncolleagues, Senator John Kerry. But we were proud of how John Edwards \nsought that nomination. And we are doubly proud of his conduct as our \nnominee for Vice President of the United States.\n  He always comes across as just folks, which is what you would expect \nfrom a person raised in very modest circumstances, the first in his \nfamily to go to college. That humble background was an enormous \nstrength for John Edwards. It is a strength we saw on that campaign \ntrail that allowed him to understand people and to communicate \npowerfully with ordinary people. People responded in kind. All over \nthis country, people just plainly liked John Edwards. They trusted him \nbecause he spoke to them in a language they understood.\n  But if Iowans and other Americans see just plain folks in John \nEdwards on the campaign trail, Senators here have been privileged to \nsee a different side of him, hard at work in this Senate. He has only \nbeen here one term. He surely made his mark. He made his mark first by \nchallenging an incumbent Senator, and took on the Jesse Helms machine \nin North Carolina, and he beat it. That is no small feat in North \nCarolina.\n  He made his mark here as lead cosponsor of the Patients' Bill of \nRights, along with Senators Kennedy and McCain. He managed the bill on \nthe floor. He was the lead negotiator in hammering out a bipartisan \nconsensus on the bill.\n  He made his mark by sponsoring and passionately advocating for a bill \nto speed up the approval of generic drugs.\n  As I said in my State of Iowa, John Edwards made his mark and won \npeople's hearts with his big smile, his friendly manner, and his \nboundless optimism.\n  He won our respect with a campaign that was always positive. Even \nunder provocation, even when stakes were the highest in the final weeks \nof the campaign leading up to the caucuses, John never wavered from his \npositive message of hope and opportunity for ordinary Americans.\n  We are proud of our colleague Senator Edwards, and we know we will \nnot hear the last of him as he leaves this body.\n  We say farewell to Senator John Edwards. I know and I hope and I \ntrust we will hear more from him in the future. We wish him the very \nbest. Of course, we all hope--and our prayers are with him and with \nElizabeth--for a full recovery for his wonderful wife Elizabeth. We \nwill miss them both here. But our friendship endures, and I know that \nSenator Edwards, Elizabeth, and his family will be heavily involved in \nthe course of our political life and our Democratic Party in the \nfuture.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                              Tom Daschle\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in saying \nthank you to a great senator, a great American, a wonderful leader, and \na dear friend, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota. In Hawaiian we say, \nmahalo nui loa. ``Mahalo'' means thank you; ``nui'' means large; and \n``loa'' means wide. It is used to convey profound and deep gratitude. I \nwant to say mahalo nui loa to Tom Daschle for his great service to our \ncountry and to the Senate as an institution.\n  During his 26 years in the House and Senate, Tom Daschle has \nepitomized the ideal that we can disagree without being disagreeable. \nHis prairie optimism and can-do attitude served his constituents well \nand served our Democratic caucus well.\n  I have always marveled at the fact that despite his responsibilities \nas majority leader and Democratic Leader, Tom Daschle always kept the \nneeds and interests of South Dakotans as his top priority. He never \nlost sight of the people back home. Perhaps that is best reflected by \nhis annual ``unscheduled driving'' tour, when he drives across his home \nstate, visiting every county, with no staff and no schedule, just Tom, \nstopping to visit his constituents and hear what is on their minds.\n  As Senator Daschle has said, these visits remind him of where he came \nfrom, and why he came to Washington--to put the priorities of America \nfirst. For that, and for so much more, I say mahalo nui loa, Tom \nDaschle. Godspeed. God bless Tom and his wife Linda.\n  This comes from me and my wife Millie. Aloha.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, our colleague from Alabama was \ngenerous enough to step aside and permit me to make a few remarks. I \ndeeply appreciate it.\n  I talked before about Tom Daschle. I also will discuss the rest of \nour colleagues who are leaving the Senate.\n  When the 109th Congress convenes in January, nine of our current \ncolleagues will not be here. I take a few moments to pay tribute to \nthem. Collectively, our colleagues have served in the Senate for 144 \nyears. We will miss them.\n\n\n                             Fritz Hollings\n\n  First of all, Fritz Hollings, the most senior Member leaving the \nSenate at this time, had a distinguished career in public service. It \nstarted in 1942, the same year I joined the Army. After he graduated \nfrom the Citadel and he received a commission from the U.S. Army, he \nserved as an officer in the North African and European campaigns in \nWorld War II. He had a lot of time in combat. He got the Bronze Star \nand seven campaign ribbons.\n  In 1948 he was elected to the South Carolina House of \nRepresentatives. Ten years later, and still only 36, Fritz Hollings was \nelected Governor of South Carolina. As Governor, he showed his \nfearlessness and independence as a progressive southern Democrat, \nespecially when he integrated Clemson University.\n  In 1966, Fritz was elected to the Senate. I don't have time to list \nall of the things he has done in 30 years in the Senate or 56 years in \npublic office, but early in his Senate career Fritz focused on poverty \nand hunger that gripped the rural South and urban areas of the country. \nIn 1968, he embarked on his now famous hunger tours. In 1970, he wrote \nabout what he saw in a highly acclaimed book entitled ``The Case \nAgainst Hunger: A Demand for a National Policy.'' What a wonderful \nprogram that was.\n  He followed up by coauthoring a bill that created the special \nsupplemental food program for Women, Infants and Children. We call it \nWIC.\n  In 1972, continuing this very active campaign of writing legislation, \nhe wrote the National Coastal Zone Management Act, the Nation's first \nland use law designed to protect coastal wetlands. He played a pivotal \nrole in establishing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Ocean Dumping \nAct, and the Fishery Conservation Management Act.\n  Perhaps he is best known for his tireless fight for fair trade and \nbeing a true fiscal conservative. Who can forget Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. \nI served with him many years on the Committee on the Budget and I can \nattest to his determination to put our Nation on the pay-as-you-go path \nrather than burdening future generations with escalating Federal \ndeficits and debt.\n  On a parochial note, I thank the Senator from South Carolina on \nbehalf of the people of New Jersey. After September 11, he made our \nports safer by helping to get security funding for our\n\n[[Page S11591]]\n\nports. Fritz Hollings gallantly laid out an inspiring vision for the \nfuture of passenger rail service in our country. Through it all, Fritz \nHollings has always been a southern gentleman and a Senator's Senator.\n  Fritz's remarks in committee and his speeches in the Senate have \nalways been worth listening to even if some of us had difficulty \ndeciphering them. He has been a true original and the Senate will be \npoorer for his departure.\n  I know he wants to spend more time with his beloved Peatsy, his four \nchildren, and his seven grandchildren.\n  Fritz, we will miss you. I never stop being surprised when Fritz \nHollings recalls things he did 20 or 40 years ago and recall them with \nfairly precise detail. He always has colorful language--except in \nplaces like the Senate--that attract attention and yet he completes his \nserious mission with humor, candor, and courage.\n  I ask unanimous consent a press release entitled ``38 Years in the \nSenate, 38 of His Greatest Hits'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        [Tuesday, Nov. 16, 2004]\n\n            38 Years in the Senate, 38 of His Greatest Hits\n\n       Washington, DC.--In 38 years in the U.S. Senate, Fritz \n     Hollings has compiled one of the most remarkable legislative \n     records of any Senator in the last century. From his first \n     days in office to his last, he has written legislation that \n     has changed America. Following are 38 ways the nation will \n     remember him:\n       1. Started the Women Infants Children (WIC) program, one of \n     the most successful government health care measures ever \n     undertaken. It has reduced infant mortality, low birth rates, \n     and premature births. Today, WIC provides nutritional \n     counseling and access to health services for low-income women \n     and children in 10,000 nationwide clinics. Impetus for the \n     program came from Senator Hollings' 1970 book ``The Case \n     Against Hunger.''\n       2. Championed the Community Health Center Program to bring \n     medical care to low-income Americans. In 1969, South Carolina \n     opened one of the first community health centers in the \n     nation, and today the centers nationally provide primary and \n     preventive health services for 10 million patients in under-\n     served communities.\n       3. Initiated the nationwide breast and cervical cancer \n     screening program. Begun in 1990 as a project in South \n     Carolina and five other states, the program quickly expanded \n     to a highly successful national effort. Through the years, \n     Senator Hollings also has led efforts to significantly boost \n     funds for cancer research and to double the National \n     Institutes of Health's budget.\n       4. The father of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) \n     Standards, Senator Hollings wrote the law in 1975 forcing \n     automakers to build more fuel efficient cars. Thirty years \n     later, CAFE standards save more than 3 million barrels of oil \n     per day.\n       5. Authored the Aviation Security Act, immediately after \n     September 11th. It created the Transportation Security \n     Administration and set up the screening system now underway \n     for airport passengers. Always a strong believer in the need \n     for security, Senator Hollings knew the aviation system, and \n     America's economy, would not recover without government's \n     help. He authored the legislation at age 80.\n       6. Authored the Maritime Security Act, also immediately \n     following September 11th. Concerned for many years that ports \n     and borders were the weak link in America's security system, \n     he pushed the legislation through--the first ever aimed at \n     increasing security at America's ports.\n       7. The father of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration (NOAA), he established the agency in just his \n     fourth year in office. He did it at a time when the ocean was \n     not the popular topic it is today. In 2000, he created the \n     U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, to help Congress determine \n     the future of the nation's oceans.\n       8. Authored the National Coastal Zone Management Act of \n     1972, which established federal policy for protecting coastal \n     areas. It also authorized grants to states to establish and \n     operate coastal zone management programs.\n       9. A friend of marine mammals, he wrote the legislation in \n     1972 to protect whales, dolphins, sea otters, and other \n     mammals. It became the model for other countries.\n       10. Authored the Ocean Dumping Act of 1976, which extended \n     federal authority over previously unregulated dumping of \n     pollutants in the ocean. It banned dumping by U.S. vessels, \n     or vessels sailing from a U.S. port.\n       11. Wrote the Oil Spill Bill in 1990, following the \n     disaster of the Exxon Valdez. Senator Hollings led the Senate \n     investigation of the oil spill, and pushed the legislation \n     requiring more effective clean-up, and forced oil companies \n     to use double-hull ships, which are less likely to have a \n     spill.\n       12. At the forefront of promoting American technology, he \n     created the Advanced Technology Program in the Commerce \n     Department, which invests in high-risk research projects that \n     promise big payoffs and widespread benefits to the nation.\n       13. Co-authored Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, the landmark \n     legislation that broke budget gridlock in the mid-`80s. By \n     making automatic spending cuts, it reversed 20 years of \n     increased federal spending and cut tens of billions from the \n     budget deficit.\n       14. Was the first Senator to decry the practice of looting \n     Social Security, and made truth in budget reporting a \n     priority. In 1990, his legislation required that the \n     President and Congress, when reporting a budget, do not count \n     Social Security surpluses to mask the true size of the \n     deficit.\n       15. Has been the voice for fiscal sanity on the Senate \n     floor for three decades, but too often the lone voice. \n     Twenty-two years ago, he was the first to offer a budget \n     freeze, and has offered them many times since. He has slammed \n     tax-cutting Republicans for voodoo economics. He promised he \n     would jump off the Capitol Dome if ever there was a balanced \n     budget, but because too few listened to the only original \n     member of the Senate Budget Committee, the country has a $600 \n     billion deficit, and Senator Hollings retires without \n     jumping.\n       16. The Senate's loudest voice on trade issues, he opposed \n     NAFTA, GATT, and trade deals with China and Africa--all of \n     which have sent massive jobs overseas. Time has proven him \n     right. He opposed giving the President fast-track negotiating \n     authority, constantly reminding his colleagues of Article 1, \n     Section 8 of the Constitution: ``Congress shall have power to \n     regulate commerce with Foreign Nations.''\n       17. Textile's best friend in the Senate, he has pressured \n     every President since Lyndon Johnson to protect the industry \n     so important to South Carolina.\n       18. Created the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \n     Centers, in 1988 to help small manufacturers survive and \n     grow. Now with 350 locations around the country, they \n     annually help almost 20,000 companies. In honor of the \n     Senator, federal legislation was passed to rename them the \n     Hollings Centers.\n       19. A friend of the consumer, he created a competitive \n     telecommunications industry through the Telecommunications \n     Act of 1996, the first major rewrite of the Communications \n     Act of 1934. He fought to ensure it provided new services to \n     consumers at affordable rates.\n       20. Strengthened on-line privacy and gave Internet users \n     control over their own personal data with legislation he \n     authored in 2000 and 2002.\n       21. Gave millions of Americans freedom from telemarketers, \n     by co-authoring the do-not-call list law in 2002, and the law \n     that banned computer voiced telephone calls and restricted \n     junk faxes in 1991. Calling it ``telephone terrorism'' \n     Senator Hollings has given tens of millions of Americans \n     quiet evenings at home.\n       22. Reined in the cable TV monopolies, as the driving force \n     in the early 1990s for the Cable and Consumer Protections \n     Act. Persistent service and rate abuses by TV cable companies \n     around the country prompted Senator Hollings to lead the \n     charge in giving the Federal Communications Commission \n     authority to regulate basic cable TV rates and set minimum \n     service standards.\n       23. Authored the 1990 Children's TV Act, requiring stations \n     to carry educational programming for children and limiting \n     the amount of commercials aired during children's \n     programming.\n       24. Wrote laws to drug-test transportation employees and \n     military enlistees. By requiring mandatory random drug and \n     alcohol testing for safety-sensitive transportation \n     employees, he has made America's roads safer. The law has \n     allowed the military to confront drug abuse in uniform and \n     has significantly increased overall readiness.\n       25. Was one of the first to re-build America's defense in \n     the '80s, authoring amendments in the 1980 budget that \n     provided the first significant increase in defense spending \n     in the post-Vietnam era.\n       26. Saved the Department of Education through budget \n     amendments, after Ronald Reagan took office with the express \n     purpose of abolishing the Department. In the mid-1990s he \n     stopped House Republicans from radically cutting student loan \n     programs.\n       27. Authored energy conservation standards for federal \n     buildings, during the 1970 energy crisis, resulting in \n     millions of dollars of savings for taxpayers.\n       28. Led the efforts to fund innovative law enforcement \n     programs, such as Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) \n     that put more than 100,000 police officers on the streets in \n     13,000 communities across the country.\n       29. To prevent crime that has hit American schools, he \n     steered through the Senate his Safe Schools Initiative, \n     putting police officers on patrol in schools nationwide.\n       30. Authored legislation to nail criminals involved in \n     church burnings, by strengthening federal authority to \n     prosecute them.\n       31. For the first time in American history, he got the full \n     Congress to give its highest honor, the Congressional Gold \n     Medal, to a farmer, gas attendant, maid, and preacher for the \n     hardships they faced in desegregating South Carolina's \n     schools. The medals were presented in 2004, the 50th \n     anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education.\n       32. Champion for American Embassies across the world, he \n     fought hard to ensure government preserves their historic \n     significance.\n       33. The longest serving junior Senator in American history, \n     he served 36 years as a\n\n[[Page S11592]]\n\n     junior Senator before becoming South Carolina's Senior \n     Senator at age 81 in 2003.\n       34. As governor of South Carolina from 1959-1963, he was \n     the first modern southern governor to bring about economic \n     and social progress. He started South Carolina's technical \n     education system that now trains 235,000 students annually; \n     balanced the state's budget for the first time in 65 years; \n     obtained the state's first AAA bond rating; traveled 200,000 \n     miles around the world to bring industry to South Carolina; \n     and peacefully integrated Clemson University while other \n     southern governors resisted the civil rights movement.\n       35. Was the Senator with no poll in his pocket, He gave \n     unforgettable floor speeches, where he spoke his mind and \n     told the truth. No one dared debate him, because they'd lose.\n       36. He brought different points of view to complex \n     situations and identified solutions long before others \n     recognized there were even problems.\n       37. Though many of his favorite bills never passed, he \n     never stopped pushing for what he believed, He is still \n     calling for tax hikes to pay for the War on Terrorism; \n     legislation to protect children from violence on television; \n     and a constitutional amendment permitting limits on campaign \n     expenditures, preventing wealthy candidates and their friends \n     from buying elections.\n       38. He leaves at the top of his game, writing meaningful \n     legislation for America and working for his constituents \n     until his last day in office.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is amazing to see how many things Fritz Hollings \nhas touched in his life. Once again, he will be sorely missed.\n\n\n                              John Breaux\n\n  Another dear friend from the south, John Breaux, senior Senator from \nLouisiana, probably the Senate's consummate deal maker. I don't think \nanyone in this Chamber has ever worked harder to bring the two parties \ntogether on taxes, on health care, and especially our two biggest \nentitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare.\n  He is the logical choice to chair the National Bipartisan Commission \non the Future of Medicare and the cochair of the National Commission on \nRetirement Policy. He has always been an effective champion for \nLouisiana's oil and gas, agriculture, and tourism industries, which is \nwhy his constituents have sent him to Washington with 60, 70, or even \n80 percent of the vote. He was only 28 when he first won a seat in the \nHouse in 1972. With 14 years in the House and 18 years in the Senate, \nhe spent more than half of his entire life as a Member of Congress \ndoing the public's mission.\n  We will miss his Cajun humor, his legislative savvy, and his tireless \ndedication of bringing Republicans and Democrats together for the good \nof all America.\n\n\n                               Bob Graham\n\n  Another esteemed colleague from the South, Senator Bob Graham, the \nsenior Senator from Florida, is clearly one of the State's most popular \nelected officials. He won two terms as State representative, two terms \nas a State senator, two terms as a Governor, three terms as a U.S. \nSenator, with a 9-9 record. For a short time he put his hat in the ring \nin the recent Presidential race. He had a 9-9 record of elections \ndating back 38 years.\n  Like Senator Breaux, Bob Graham has worked diligently to forge \nbipartisan solutions to the most pressing problems. He is a fiscal \nconservative, dedicated to strengthening and improving Social Security \nand Medicare. Bob Graham is the author of a comprehensive, bipartisan \nplan to restore the Everglades, a plan that created an unprecedented \npartnership among Federal, State, and local governments and private \nindustries to reverse the damage done by fragile ``River of Grass'' \ndecades of dredging, dumping, and destruction. He has fought hard to \nprotect Florida's coastline from oil and gas exploration.\n  One of the things that made Bob Graham so popular has been his \ndetermination to spend time working side by side with people he \nrepresents. Over 30 years he has worked 400 workdays. On those \nworkdays--and most have seen him in costume--he has worked as a police \nofficer, railroad engineer, construction worker, fisherman, garbage \nman. I don't think I would have taken all the jobs he did, but he did \nthem wonderfully and endeared himself to his constituents. He was a \nfactory worker, busboy, teacher. If Bob does not want to retire, I am \nsure he will be able to find some kind of work. He is experienced in so \nmany fields.\n\n\n                              John Edwards\n\n  The senior Senator from North Carolina, John Edwards, has streaked \nacross the political firmament like a shooting star. Six years ago, he \nwas a trial lawyer who won a Senate seat in his first try at elected \noffice and 2 weeks ago he was very nearly elected Vice President.\n  John Edwards, like Tom Daschle, was the first person in his family to \ngraduate from college. His father worked in the textile mills. His \nmother held several jobs, working in a post office, running a furniture \nrefinishing business. After he graduated from the University of North \nCarolina Law School, he put his formidable legal skill to work for \nordinary people as a trial attorney. He was good at it. In 1997, he won \nthe largest personal injury verdict in North Carolina history, $25 \nmillion, for a 9-year old girl injured by a swimming pool drain the \nmanufacturer knew was faulty.\n  John proved if there is injury or damage, take it to a jury of your \npeers. Let them make the judgment regarding careless operation of a \npiece of machinery or automobile. The damage is incalculable in terms \nof a monetary value. So John Edwards did what he ought to do. He \nprotected those who had recourse for terrible damages that they \nincurred.\n\n  John knew what it was like for that little girl's parents I just \ntalked about because he and his wife lost their 16-year-old son. His \nname was Wade. He died in a car accident.\n  When he got to the Senate, John continued to fight for working-class \nAmericans, and despite being a freshman Member, he was a principal \nauthor of a Patients' Bill of Rights bill which passed the Senate in \nJune of 2001.\n  He also fought hard for his constituents, securing more than $250 \nmillion in disaster funds following Hurricane Floyd in September 1999.\n  I don't know what the future holds for John. One looks at that face, \nand sees such a young man. He is only 51 years old, and to me that is \nlike a child. But somehow or other I do not think we have seen the last \nof him.\n  Of course, his first task is to help his wife Elizabeth get through \nher bout with breast cancer. We send our prayers to both of them, for \nher quick and complete recovery. He and Elizabeth have the good wishes \nand prayers of each and every one of us here in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I will talk about a couple of my friends on the \nRepublican side.\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  I have had my differences with Don Nickles. We both have served on \nthe Budget Committee, and it is hard to believe that he, at his tender \nage, has been here for 24 years. He is still so youthful looking. As a \nmatter of fact, the two Senators from Oklahoma at one point in time did \nnot equal the age of one of the Senators from South Carolina. They are \nboth very young. But he was so young when he came here in 1981. He was \nbarely 32.\n  On the subject of age, if I might digress, after 30 years of business \nI never dreamed I was going to be here 24 years, Lord willing. And for \nmy friends on the Republican side, don't count me out at the end of 24 \nyears.\n  I worked with Don Nickles for many years on the Budget Committee. He \nhas been a passionate, articulate spokesman for conservative causes, \nbut he has always been a good opponent, a gracious opponent. The Senate \nis going to miss his energy and his knowledge.\n\n\n                        Ben Nighthorse Campbell\n\n  Another friend from the other side of the aisle is Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell, the senior Senator from Colorado. He is one of the true \noriginals in the Senate. He is one of 44 chiefs of the Northern \nCheyenne Tribe. He served our country in Korea. He is a renowned \njewelry designer, athlete, trainer of champion quarter horses. He \nparticipated in the 1964 Olympics as a member of the U.S. Olympic judo \nteam.\n  He was elected to the Colorado State legislature in 1982, serving for \n4 years before coming to Washington. He has livened up the place with \nhis string ties, beautiful jewelry, and his Harley Davidson \nmotorcycles. And he has been our conscience when it comes to meeting \nour treaty obligations to Native Americans.\n\n\n                            Peter Fitzgerald\n\n  Peter Fitzgerald, the junior Senator from Illinois, like me, came to \nthe\n\n[[Page S11593]]\n\nSenate after a good business career. He has been here only for one term \nbut in those 6 years he established a solid reputation as an \nindependent Member, committed to doing what he thinks is right, even if \nit puts him at odds with other members of his party.\n  He and I serve on the Governmental Affairs Committee, and I have been \nimpressed by his willingness to hold hearings on scandals and \nmalfeasance in the mutual fund and insurance industries. Perhaps \nbecause of his business background, he understands the importance of \neffective oversight by the Federal Government.\n  I regret he is leaving. He has been a gentleman, and it is too bad \nthat we do not have more like Peter Fitzgerald. He is a wonderful \nperson to work with. He has got a ready smile, and he is a gentleman at \nall times.\n  I close my remarks by noting that these men have made remarkable \ncontributions to our society, and all Americans should be grateful. I \nwould tell those who are retiring, I retired 4 years ago, and I did not \nlike it. So here I am. Perhaps there is hope for any of them who want \nto rejoin. If you want to come back, I am here to tell you it can be \ndone. Just make sure that you get to keep your seniority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank my colleagues for their \nindulgence while I made my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me say--this is probably the first and \nonly time I have ever said this--I have been listening carefully to my \nfriend from New Jersey, and I agree with everything he said.\n  I have had a chance to talk a little bit about some of these people \nwho are retiring, and at some length about Senator Nickles, and I \ncertainly appreciate the Senator's remarks about him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11593-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO AIR FORCE SECRETARY JAMES G. ROCHE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have been paying a lot of tributes to \nretiring Members of the Senate, and I think it is appropriate to pay \ntribute to at least one of our retiring public servants, and I would \nlike to do that right now for the Secretary of the Air Force, Dr. James \nG. Roche.\n  I know Secretary Roche has been attacked from time to time. That goes \nwith the job. It is a tough job. He knew that when he came. I think we \ncan put that aside and pay tribute for the things he has done that are \nnot as controversial but have been good for the Air Force and for our \ncountry.\n  You have to keep in mind that Secretary Roche left a lucrative career \nin private life to take this job as Secretary of the Air Force. He \nbrought a lot of savvy with him from his private business career. I \nremember so well when he was first confirmed, his first trip was to go \nwith me to Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma. After visiting that base, \nhe returned to Washington with Secretary Gibbs and immediately put in \nplace a plan to revitalize the depots using the existing Air Force \nbudget. This is something that previous administrations have never \naccomplished. They seemed to be more interested in letting the depots \nrust away.\n  Secretary Roche invested money, time, and industrial know-how into \nthe depots, and he did it in a partnership arrangement where he \nactually stimulated the communities to pass very large bond issues to \nexercise the private participation. He started a program where depots \nwere benchmarked off similar commercial enterprises and started \ninformal competition that drove maintenance days down ever lower. He \nbrought LEAN manufacturing processes to the depots and other similar \ncommercial practices that revitalized the workforce, decreased the \nfailure rates, raised readiness standards, and decreased overall costs \nat the depots.\n  I look at the record he had. In fiscal year 2003 alone, AMC reported \nthat the mission-incapable aircraft part hours decreased by 37.6 \npercent, the percentage of hours grounded. It bettered the goal by \n922,000 hours. The mission-incapable aircraft part incidents decreased \nby 23.4 percent, which bettered the goal by 4,400 incidents. Logistics \nresponse time was reduced 20.4 percent. Stockage effectiveness \nincreased by 5.5 percent. It goes on and on.\n  His record is there. He has done a magnificent job at applying his \nbusiness practices in making our scarce dollars in the military go a \nlot further.\n  I was very impressed with his focus on depots, but his ability to \nguide the Air Force through the troubled waters after 9/11 were equally \nimpressive. He restructured the force and focused training to support \nnew missions: homeland defense, renewed focus on Close Air Support, \nclose partnering with the Army in joint operations and Space support to \nwarfighters.\n\n  He expanded the role and support for special operations. He \naccelerated the delivery to the battlefield of Armed Predators and \nGlobal Hawks, bombers in support of close air support, tactics enabling \nengagement or the Time Sensitive Targets, networked Intelligence, \nSurveillance, and Reconnaissance, and advanced Combined Air Operations \nCenter capabilities.\n  Secretary Roche and General Jumper have done a remarkable job. I \nremember, back in the late 1990s, after we downsized and downgraded and \nhad done away with a lot of the modernization programs in our military \nunder the previous administration, General Jumper had the courage to \nstand before our committee and say and admit we were going to have to \ndo something about modernization, something about the F-22, something \nabout the Joint Strike Fighter, because the Russians were making the SU \nseries that was actually better than our best strike vehicles, which \nwere the F-15s and F-16s. And this was done. This is the type of \ncourage that came forth during Secretary Roche's administration.\n  The investigation into the tanker lease continues, and it will \ncontinue until all individuals who acted inappropriately are held \naccountable. That is appropriate. However, we must move forward on \nrecapitalizing our tanker fleet, fighting the war on terrorism, and \ngetting back to the business of supporting the warfighters, \nspecifically, moving forward on confirmations of senior military \nleaders so our troops in the field have the leadership they deserve.\n  I think it is time to allow the investigations to find out who is \nguilty of wrongdoing. Yes, it was wrong to take the tanker deal to the \nAppropriations Committee and skip the authorizers. But that was fixed. \nWe held hearings. We compromised, and it looks like we have killed the \ntanker deal. We have investigations underway, some complete, and those \nwho committed crimes are going to pay for their crimes. So let's not \noverreach this subject and bring innocent men and women under public \nattack.\n  Let me say that Secretary Roche has been innovative. He has \ntirelessly pressed new ideas. I thank Secretary Roche for the very fine \ncontributions he made to the U.S. Air Force and to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to share a few remarks about our \nfriend and colleague Peter Fitzgerald. It has been a real honor for me \nto serve with him. We have had quite different backgrounds.\n  Peter grew up in suburban Chicago and attended very fine parochial \nschools. He attended Dartmouth College where he graduated cum laude \nwith highest distinction majoring in Latin and Greek. He got his law \ndegree from the University of Michigan and came from a very prominent \nfamily there.\n  He is a wonderful person, a person I got to know, although our \nbackgrounds are different, I having grown up in south Alabama, the son \nof a country store owner, going barefoot and swimming in the creeks. We \nenjoyed talking with one another. He liked Bear Bryant, and we talked \nabout a number of things.\n  One thing he shared with me on a number of occasions is his belief \nthat there should be in government, in the business of the United \nStates and the State governments, integrity. He talked with me about \nhis recommendation to President Bush about a U.S. attorney appointment \nin Chicago. He wrestled with it and talked with me over a period of \nweeks about the fact\n\n[[Page S11594]]\n\nhe believed that even if he chose any of the very fine candidates who \nhad been discussed in Chicago, he would be choosing somebody from that \narea that people would think was not the best, was not independent, \nthat they might be influenced by someone.\n  He had a growing feeling that he should choose someone from outside \nthe area. It is an usual thing to do, but that is what he did. He \nsearched the country over and chose U.S. Attorney Fitzgerald, a \nnonrelative, I believe, who tried some of the biggest terrorist cases \nin New York. That is who he recommended and that is who he put there. \nWhy? Because he wanted the best prosecutor with the best background, \nwith the most integrity, and total independence to do the right thing \nthere. That indicated to me just how serious he was about this issue.\n  When he ran for the Senate, he was in the banking business, an \nattorney in the banking business. He promised he would not involve \nhimself and would recuse himself from decisions dealing with banking. \nPeople said that was not necessary. Others did not do that. He said he \nthought it was the appropriate thing to do, and he adhered to that the \nentire time he was here, recusing himself on a number of such issues.\n  He chose the higher standard, the road less traveled. He did not like \nfraud, corruption, and abuse. As a member of the Consumer Affairs \nSubcommittee of the Commerce Committee, he took a key role in the \ninvestigation of Enron and the abuses that occurred there.\n  He was a constant and strong opponent of no-bid contracts. He saw a \nlot of those in Illinois. He did not like it, and he spoke out against \nit in a very strong way. Particularly, there was a matter involving \nSpringfield and a major construction contract. He feared the good old \nboys, those with influence and inside word, would be the beneficiaries \nof those contracts rather than the taxpayers. He thought it should be \nbid on a professional basis, and he battled very hard for that. He did \nnot like and does not like cronyism, and he spoke out against it.\n  His commercial banking experience led him to study the behavior of \nthe stock markets and brokerage firms in the Federal thrift plan, which \nhe admired greatly, saying it was the most efficient and best plan for \ninvestors that he was aware of because the fees and costs were so low.\n  He, therefore, was a champion of integrity and full disclosure of \nfees in the brokerage business and spoke out aggressively in favor of \nthat. Why did he say that? Because he thought insiders were taking too \nbig a piece of the pie and if that money, instead of being paid out in \nfees, sometimes never seen by the investors, had been reinvested in the \nstocks or mutual funds, that the investor would have ended up with a \nlot more money over a lifetime, and he had charts to show it.\n\n  He spoke out against that special interest group because he believed \nit was the right thing to do. He believed in representing the \nconsumers, and those are the people who make America go.\n  He has a wonderful wife Nina who attended Smith College, the London \nSchool of Economics, and Harvard Law School. They have one son, Jake. \nHe has chosen to spend more time with them. We can certainly understand \nhis decision to do that.\n  I also thank him for his service to the people of the United States. \nHe did so in this single term with integrity, courage, decency, and a \ngreat spirit of cooperativeness. I have enjoyed serving with him, as \ndid all of us in this body, and I wish him Godspeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I know the hour is getting late and others \nwant to be heard, but I briefly want to express some thoughts about our \ncolleagues who are leaving this wonderful body. Today we have heard \nsome very compelling speeches, particularly the one given by my good \nfriend, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, our Democratic leader.\n  I was pleased to see so many of our colleagues remain on the floor to \nlisten to the departing Democratic leader. The words he expressed about \nhis State, his staff, his colleagues, his feelings about the country, \nand the future, are instructive. I know it can sound repetitive when \npeople hear us talk about our colleagues this way, but I think it is \nimportant for the public to note that while they might hear only about \nthe bickering, the part that you do not often see is the deep respect, \naffection, and caring that goes on among the Members of this body. This \naffection comes despite the differences that exist in red States and \nblue States, or being strongly conservative or strongly liberal.\n  There is this weaving of a common denominator through each and every \none of us, particularly after years of common service in this \nremarkable institution we call the Senate. There is a deep and abiding \nrespect for those who have come here, those who have served here, those \nwho have tried to make a difference for our country.\n  It may seem like it is inside discussion, but I hope the public \nunderstands how deeply felt these comments are about colleagues who \nwill no longer have the pleasure of spending each and every day in this \nChamber, but whose friendship and collegiality will continue in the \nyears ahead as we encounter each other in different walks of life.\n\n\n                            Ernest Hollings\n\n  First, Fritz Hollings has now served with two generations of my \nfamily. He served with my father briefly, and over the last 24 years we \nhave served together in this Chamber. I have not had the pleasure of \nserving with Fritz Hollings, except once on the Budget Committee for a \nfew years.\n  We have become very good friends though. We have traveled together. \nWe have spent a lot of time together. I have been to his State. I have \ngone to South Carolina at his invitation to speak to South Carolinians. \nInviting this swamp Yankee from Connecticut to come south of the Mason-\nDixon line was a source of tremendous joy and pleasure, especially to \nbe with Fritz Hollings, his lovely wife Peatsy, and their \nconstituents not too many months ago, on a St. Patrick's Day event in \nCharleston, SC.\n\n  Fritz Hollings has done a remarkable job for his State of South \nCarolina, as well as for his nation, beginning with his career in the \nmilitary, serving in North Africa and in Europe during World War II. He \nwas awarded the Bronze Star and seven campaign ribbons; elected to \nSouth Carolina's House of Representatives at the age of 26, the \nyoungest Governor in that State in the 20th century; and during his 4 \nyears as Governor, balanced the State budget, dramatically improving \nSouth Carolina's economy.\n  He was elected to the Senate in 1964. His resume included an \nincredible list of legislative accomplishments. Anyone who would have \naccomplished any one of these things could have considered their career \na successful one. He was the author of the Women, Infants and Children \nProgram, the WIC Program. During my early years in the Senate, I had \nthe pleasure of working with him on the famous Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \nAct in 1985, which was called by the Brookings Institution one of the \nmost significant pieces of legislation in the 20th century.\n  He wrote the first law designed to protect our coastal wetlands, and \ninitiated a nationwide effort to encourage women to screen themselves \nfor breast and cervical cancer.\n  Over the past few years he spoke forcefully about the dangers facing \nthis country due to the outsourcing of jobs.\n  Senator Hollings has always been a strong and loud voice against \nfiscal irresponsibility in our Government and in favor of creating \nAmerican jobs.\n  Fritz is an American original. The Senate is not likely to see his \nlike here again. Whatever else you may have thought, he was direct and \nforceful, and spoke with great passion about the things he believed in. \nIt is the kind of public service and the kind of stewardship in this \nbody that others could duplicate in years to come. They would do well \nto follow the example of Fritz Hollings, a wonderful Senator, a \ndelightful friend. I shall miss his service here, but I am very \nconfident I will see him over and over again in years to come. And I \nwish, as my colleagues have, that he, Peatsy, and his family have many \nyears of joyful retirement.\n\n\n                               Bob Graham\n\n  Bob Graham is also leaving the Senate. I would like to recognize him \nand the State of Florida for sharing Bob Graham with us. He served for \n18 years in the Senate. Prior to his election to this body, he served \nas a Governor for 8 years in Florida, and served previously in both the \nFlorida State Senate and the House of Representatives. He is without a \ndoubt one of the most respected and popular public figures who have \never represented the State of Florida. He is well known in Florida for \nworking over 400 days alongside his constituents, as others mentioned \nthis afternoon, giving him a unique perspective on the issues and \nproblems they deal with each and every day.\n  But not only was he doing it for Floridians, those 400 days he spent \nworking along with others became a national symbol of someone who went \nout of his way to understand and learn how other people work and live \nevery single day.\n\n[[Page S11596]]\n\n  He has been a tireless advocate for priorities that affect Florida's \ncitizens, including prescription drug coverage for seniors, and \npreservation of the Everglades and the Florida coastline. I have been \nprivileged to work with him on several occasions. I particularly \nappreciate his work for the people of Haiti.\n  Since the attacks of September 11, Senator Graham has shown an \nunyielding and passionate commitment to making our Nation stronger, \nsafer, and far more secure. In particular, he has spoken out forcefully \nand candidly in favor of reforming our intelligence agencies.\n  As chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence during the \nprevious Congress, he was the primary author of sections of the USA \nPatriot Act that require greater information sharing among intelligence \nand law enforcement agencies. He has been outspoken about what our \nNation could have done before 9/11 to protect itself, and how it is \njust as important that we do everything in our power to make this \ncountry safer in the 21st century.\n  Bob Graham leaves this body as one of its most respected Members, and \none of the most well liked public servants in his State and in this \nChamber. We will miss him in this body and I wish Bob and his lovely \nwife Adele and the rest of their family all the best in the years to \ncome.\n\n\n                              John Breaux\n\n  Our colleague, John Breaux of Louisiana, follows a great tradition of \nsome remarkable people who served that State in this body. For 35 \nyears, John has been, first a staff member, then a House Member for 14 \nyears, and for the past 18 years a Member of the Senate. John Breaux \nwas elected to the Senate to fill the seat of the late Russell Long, \nconsidered one of the most capable and effective men ever to serve in \nthis body. In fact, my father, who served with Russell Long, as I did \nfor some time, saw Russell Long as a great and dear friend.\n  I am proud to call John Breaux a friend as well. Without a doubt, \nSenator Breaux has ably filled the imposing shoes of Russell Long \nduring his service here.\n  John Breaux has won great respect on both sides of the aisle for his \nability to reach across party lines and bring Senators together. He is \na legislator's legislator. We don't often celebrate legislators. People \noften run to serve in this body by promising to be independent, to be \ntheir own person, to not compromise. It is an appealing political \nargument. But all of us who serve here know that our ability to get \nanything done requires our ability to compromise with one another.\n  We are 100 coequals serving in this great legislative body. The only \nway anything ever happens is if people are willing to compromise and \nwork together. John Breaux understood that from the day he arrived here \nand never failed to seek out the means to achieve those goals during \nhis 18 years of service.\n  He is a wonderful example of what Senators need to do if they are \ngoing to be successful. If I could offer any words of advice to the \nincoming class of Senators who will be arriving on January 4, it is to \nfollow the model set by John Breaux. I don't care what your politics \nare, if you want to succeed, if you want to help your State, if you \nwant to make a difference for your country, then find out ways to work \nwith people across the political aisle. If you do not, you may enjoy \nyour service here but you will accomplish very little.\n  John Breaux accomplished great things because he understood the \nimportance of reaching out to people, people with whom he disagreed but \nhe would constantly seek them out if there were some common ground \nabout which they could agree. As a result, his accomplishments were \nsignificant. Many times the accomplishments don't bear his name. You \nmight not find John Breaux's name on the bill, but ask anybody who was \naround when the bill became law, and they will tell you it happened \nbecause John Breaux brought people together.\n  I will miss him. This body will. He had some wonderful \naccomplishments here which made a huge difference, and I wish him and \nhis family the best in the years to come.\n\n\n                              John Edwards\n\n  John Edwards, as well, is leaving the Senate. What a remarkable 6 \nyears. Short in some ways but rather significant considering what he \nwas able to accomplish. He brought enthusiasm, optimism, and eloquence \nthat won him voters and supporters in his first effort to seek election \nin the State of North Carolina. He was a powerful voice for the \nDemocratic Party throughout the Democratic primaries. He was a powerful \nvoice for our party this past year as a Vice Presidential candidate. \nThat is a rather remarkable set of accomplishments in 6 short years.\n  He distinguished himself, of course, by exceeding expectations in \nmany cases. He rose from a background of modest means. As we have heard \nsaid, he became the first in his family to go on to higher education, \nthen law school, becoming one of the most successful attorneys in \nAmerica, not only in his home State of North Carolina.\n  He won difficult cases motivated by trying to see to it that people \nwho had little means to protect themselves would have an advocate when \nhe represented them in a court of law.\n  Here in this body he took a leading role on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. He brought a compelling and compassionate message to America. \nHe talked about two Americas: the America of those who have, and those \nwho lack the good things in life, who lack the essentials and basics. \nJohn spoke of the real moral values shared by mainstream America. He is \na young man whose voice will be heard, I will predict, in the coming \nmonths and years.\n  He spoke of our moral obligation to honor hard work, to lift \nAmericans out of poverty, expand health care, break down racial and \neconomic barriers, to enact fair tax policies to make sure that all \nAmericans pay their fair share. He spoke honestly and directly about \nsome of the widening gaps in our society. America listened, paid \nattention, and rewarded him their respect.\n  I certainly believe he would have been an asset to his country had he \nstayed in the Senate. I am sorry he is not going to be here. He made \nthe decision when he sought the Presidency to leave the Senate. I \nbelieve John Edwards would have made a tremendously fine Senator in the \nyears ahead had he stayed here. He has decided to take another path. I \nam confident, as I said a moment ago, he will find a way to continue to \nbe heard.\n  I also want to take a moment to express my best wishes and those of \nmy wife Jackie to his wife Elizabeth. America knows and deeply \nappreciates Elizabeth. As we all heard a few weeks ago, the family now \nfaces a very different kind of fight. I am certain I speak for everyone \nin this body, across the country, regardless of their political views \nand how they voted on election day, when they heard that Elizabeth \nEdwards had breast cancer, every single person in this country prayed \nto the dear Lord that Elizabeth Edwards will be rid of this dreadful \ndisease, and that she and her young children will have years and years \nof good health ahead.\n  I am confident that will be the case knowing what a fighter she is \nand what a fighter her husband is.\n  We all wish them and their family nothing but the best during this \ndifficult time.\n\n\n                        Ben Nighthorse Campbell\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to take a few minutes to speak about \nanother dear friend, Ben Nighthorse Campbell.\n  Ben and I have served together for a while on the same side of the \naisle. Ben made a decision to move to the other side of the aisle a few \nyears ago. We talked at great length about his decision. I recall how \nit was very difficult. In fact, we talked into the wee hours of the \nmorning about his decision to go from the Democratic side of the aisle \nto the Republican side of the aisle.\n  Despite that change, we have continued our strong friendship over the \nyears. I respected his decision. I was disappointed by it, obviously, \nbut nonetheless, I respected the decision he made and the reasons for \nhis arriving at that decision. I have great affection for him and wish \nnothing but the best in the years ahead.\n  He has a compelling story. He is the son of a Portuguese immigrant \nand a Northern Cheyenne Indian. He is 1 of 44 chiefs of the Northern \nCheyenne Indian Tribe. He is the first American Indian to chair the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs. Without a doubt, Senator Campbell's \nheritage has enabled him to\n\n[[Page S11597]]\n\nbring a unique perspective to this body, a perspective I know all of us \nhave valued over the years.\n  Throughout his 12-year tenure in the Senate, Senator Campbell has \nrepresented not only his constituents in Colorado but Native Americans \nall across our Nation. For some years, he, along with Dan Inouye of \nHawaii and others, have worked hard to establish the National Museum of \nthe American Indian. Finally, this past September, the dream finally \nbecame reality. It never would have happened had it not been for Ben \nNighthorse Campbell and Dan Inouye.\n  As a result of their determination over the years to see that there \nwould be adequate recognition for America's Native peoples, the museum \nwould not have happened.\n  Ben Nighthorse Campbell has been involved in many other issues such \nas the Helsinki Commission. But his particular contribution, I think, \nwill always be raising the profile and the interests of our Native \nAmericans.\n  All of us, again, wish him and Linda and their family the very best \nin the years to come.\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  Mr. President, Don Nickles and I arrived here on the same day in \nJanuary of 1981. There were 16 Republicans and 2 Democrats. If you \nthink we had a sweep one way or the other a week or two ago, in 1981 \nthere was truly a sweep. There were 16 Republicans and 2 Democrats. The \nother Democrat was Alan Dixon of Illinois, my good friend. Of the 16 \nRepublicans who were elected, there will now only be 2 left in the \n109th Congress. Today there are three of the sixteen Republicans \nelected in 1980. Don Nickles is the third, and he is leaving. I always \nsay 50 percent of the Democrats are still here after 24 years.\n  It was an interesting class. Don Nickles certainly was a remarkable \npublic servant. Here he is after 24 years. I think Don is barely over \n50. He was one of the youngest people ever elected to the Senate. He \nlooks even younger. I think he ran the marathon just a few weeks ago, \nand is certainly in great health. He is truly a remarkable person.\n  We have disagreed on issues and have different points of view on many \nquestions facing our country. But there has been no tougher, tenacious \nfighter for policies which he holds so dear, particularly in budgetary \nmatters.\n  He has been a staunch supporter of lower taxes on business, of free \nmarkets, of limited government regulation. He is as tough a competitor \nas you are ever going to find.\n  I will tell you that when the battle is over--again, this is my \nadvice to the new Members coming in, if you want a real role model to \nlook to on how to serve--you could have one of the most fierce debates \nin your life out here on the floor with Don, but the minute that debate \nwas over, you wouldn't have a better friend when you walked off the \nfloor. He knew how to separate differences on public policy and not \nhave it contaminate personal relationships.\n  Again, the new Members arriving here, as you get involved in debates, \nif you have disagreements with your colleagues on matters, don't let it \nbecome personal. That very colleague you are having the fight of your \nlife with today, tomorrow may be your most significant ally on another \nissue. Don Nickles is a wonderful example of that kind of stewardship \nin the Senate.\n  So to Don, Linda, and their family and children, we wish them the \nvery best in the coming years. I am confident one way or the other that \nDon Nickles is going to be directly and deeply involved in the public \ndebate and discourse in our country in the coming years.\n\n\n                            Peter Fitzgerald\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, Peter Fitzgerald is also a good friend. He \nhas represented his State of Illinois and is leaving after only one \nterm.\n  Again, as Senators from the opposite sides of the aisle, Senator \nFitzgerald and I often disagreed. We found some common ground on some \nissues, including the Patients' Bill of Rights, the gun show loophole, \nand campaign finance reform. I wish him good luck when he returns to \nthe private sector where he has been an extremely successful attorney \nin the banking industry. I caution him not to do too well. I am on the \nSenate committee responsible for overseeing that carefully. I say that, \nof course, with tongue in cheek.\n  I certainly wish he, Nina, and Jake all the best in the years to \ncome.\n\n\n                              Tom Daschle\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to share a few thoughts about our \nDemocratic leader.\n  I mentioned at the outset of these remarks that I was so deeply moved \nand impressed today by the words of Tom Daschle. I hope all of our \ncolleagues, if they were not here, will read his remarks. It was about \nas good a speech as I have heard given in this body in a long time. It \nlaid out some pretty important standards for all of us to keep in mind, \nparticularly those of us serving here--the notion of hope that he \ntalked about; the notion of not forgetting where you come from no \nmatter how important you think you are at any given moment; to remember \nyour staff; to remember the people who helped make us successful and \nwho deserve great credit for their tireless contributions; remembering \npeople who work in the Senate, arrive here in the wee hours of the \nmorning to make these buildings operate; and remembering his \nconstituents and his family. It was as eloquent a farewell address as \nyou are ever going to hear in the Senate.\n  Tom Daschle, of course, has served with me in the Senate since 1987. \nHe has served as Democratic leader for the past decade. He has been a \nvery able leader and spokesman for our party and our beliefs on the \nSenate floor or on national news programs.\n  Anyone who has observed Tom Daschle over these past 18 years knows he \nis generally not one to raise his voice. But beneath his gentle \ndemeanor and soft tone and human decency is a fierce determination to \ndo what is right for both his constituents in South Dakota and the \nAmerican people. His service to the people of South Dakota has been \noutstanding.\n  I noted earlier that Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland quoted some \neditorials from newspapers of South Dakota talking about his service to \ntheir State over these past 26 years in the House and the Senate.\n  As a Senator from our Nation's third smallest State in terms of area, \nI am somewhat spoiled by the ease with which I am able to meet with my \nconstituents. Tom, on the other hand, has represented a State of over \n77,000 square miles, smaller I might add than the State of the \nPresiding Officer of Montana, but nonetheless daunting if you come from \na State such as Connecticut which is so much smaller. You have counties \nin your State of Montana which are larger, I think, than the State of \nConnecticut.\n  Each year Tom set aside time to drive to each of the 66 counties in \nthe State alone in his car with no staff, just arriving in town, seeing \npeople and talking to them regardless of the lofty position he held \nhere on the Democrat side of the aisle. He always took that time out \neach year to go back to reconnect with the roots of South Dakota and to \nmeet with his people at home is one of the reasons why he never was \nconfused by the title of ``leader.'' He was always very firmly planted \non the ground and why he would fight as leader not only for our \nnational issues but for State issues.\n\n  He was completely understanding of other Senators who would come to \nhim and talk about the needs in their own States. Because he was so \nrooted in understanding of his own constituent needs, he was deeply \nsympathetic to other Senators as they lobbied on behalf of matters that \nwere important to their constituencies.\n  He championed legislation to provide disaster relief for farmers, \nexpand health care services in rural area, expand health care to Native \nAmericans, and the list goes on.\n  In his role as Democratic leader Tom Daschle has stood for the values \nthat are the bedrock of our Nation, such as a strong middle class, a \nforeign policy that keeps America strong by working with our allies, \nfiscally responsible economic policies that invest in critical national \npriorities such as jobs, education, and health care.\n  During President Clinton's term he helped advance the agenda that \ncreated over 22 million new jobs in our Nation, the longest period of \neconomic expansion in American history.\n\n[[Page S11598]]\n\n  Over the past 4 years, he has led our party's efforts to return to \nmore responsible policies that can make our Nation stronger both at \nhome and abroad.\n  On a personal level, I will miss Tom Daschle very much. I am the \nindividual who lost to him by one vote 10 years ago. I remember that \nday very well as we competed to become Democratic leader. Many people \nassume when anyone goes through a battle like that, an intense battle \nof some 24 days, that it may cause a permanent divide in a \nrelationship. We quickly got over that. I certainly did, and Tom did. \nHe reached out to me directly, invited me to be part of a circle that \nwould help shape positions within our party. He is a gracious human \nbeing. We have become very good friends, and we will retain that \nfriendship.\n  I would be far less than candid with my colleagues or my constituents \nif I didn't tell you I will miss this man very much. He is as decent a \nhuman being as I have ever known in my life, in public or in private \nlife. He is a good, good man. Whatever he does, he will bring great \nintegrity, great honor, and great decency to any endeavor that he \nbecomes involved in.\n  I look forward to many years of good friendship with him and Linda. I \nwish he and his family the very best in the years to come.\n  I apologize for taking this extra time. It is important that the \npublic hear Members talk about each other, even those who disagreed on \nmatters, that they understand why this institution works more than 230 \nyears after the Founders created it.\n  I, as a Senator from Connecticut, take unique pride in the Senate \nbecause it was Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, both of Connecticut, \nwho offered at the Constitutional Convention the idea of the Senate \nrepresenting small and large States. Arguing over a unicameral system, \nSherman and Ellsworth said, how about having a second body with equal \nrepresentation, regardless of the size or the population of the State. \nAs a result, this institution was created. It has been a great place \nthat has served our Nation for so long and I am confident it will in \nthe future.\n  We have been blessed by the participation of those who are leaving. \nAll of us wish each and every one of them the very best in the years to \ncome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd for his comments. \nMy relationship and experience with Tom Daschle was a man who was a \nstraight shooter. Every time I asked him something, I got a legitimate \nanswer. If he committed to do something to help me, he did it. He was a \ngentleman at all times. We never had a harsh word. We may disagree--and \nwe did disagree over policies, we all did--and debated and argued and \nfussed, as we do in this Senate, but there is something special about \nthis body.\n  Senator Dodd, a son of a Senator himself, has deep connections and \nmany years here and understands it better than most. It is important \nthat we recognize the humanity, the skill, the dedication of each \nMember of the body, whether we agree politically, whether we are in the \nsame party, and we recognize that.\n  Senator Dodd, thank you for the comments. It means a lot to the body, \nas does your leadership.\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. president, the year was 1980. Inflation was 13 \npercent, mortgage rates were hitting 15 percent, unemployment was 7.1 \npercent, and the economy was suffering its fourth year of recession in \n10 years.\n  The Soviet Union was on the march in Afghanistan, its puppets were \nleading insurgents in Central America and South Africa, and U.S. \nEmbassy officials were being held as hostages in Iran.\n  ``Stagflation'' and ``malaise'' were the new words of the American \nlexicon.\n  Then the Reagan revolution swept across this Nation and into this \ntown. And while Ronald Reagan was the leader, he was not alone. Across \nthis broad Nation, ordinary people came to this city with similar \nvision and they helped President Reagan accomplish extraordinary \nthings.\n  One of these ordinary people was a young businessman from Ponca City, \nOK. At the tender age of 31, Don Nickles was the youngest Republican \never elected to the U.S. Senate.\n  But while he might have been young, it didn't take long for the \nSenate to discover that this young man--a former janitor who worked his \nway through college--was wise beyond his years and as solid as the Rock \nof Gibraltar.\n  Freedom has had no greater defender than Don Nickles. He has been a \nstrong proponent of the free enterprise system. On budget, tax, debt \nmatters--in fact on almost every conceivable question of fiscal policy, \nDon Nickles was dead on target.\n  He was absolutely committed to the bedrock Republican principles of \ncutting taxes, reducing the size of the Government, and slaying the \nbudget deficit leviathan.\n  And to these seemingly insurmountable goals, he brought a relentless \nyet cheerful determination.\n  He has served this Nation and the people of Oklahoma so very well, \nwith distinction and unwavering courage.\n  Too often, public servants come to Washington to drain the swamp \nuntil they see it as a hot tub. Not Don Nickles. He changed Washington \nrather than letting Washington change him.\n  When he came to the Senate, he wanted to rein in Government so people \ncould keep their hard-earned dollars, and when he leaves now, his \nbelief is the same today as it was when he placed his hand on the \nBible.\n\n  That is the way it was then and now, and every day of his almost \nquarter of a century of Senate service. And he still looks like he is \n31.\n  Back then, he fought to eliminate the inheritance tax on spouses and \nnow he works to eliminate the inheritance tax altogether.\n  Back then he fought natural gas price controls which contributed to \nour energy crisis and now he fights price controls on prescription \ndrugs.\n  Back then he fought the windfall profits tax and now he fights to \nease the tax on profits and wages of businesses and families alike.\n  Mr. President, there isn't a Member of this body who doesn't respect \nDon Nickles as a man of strong conviction, character, and deep faith.\n  I think there is good reason why he is seen that way. When the \nFounding Fathers designed the Senate to be one of the central pillars \nof American democracy, I think Don Nickles is exactly the sort of \ncitizen legislator they envisioned.\n  He has been a strong but happy warrior, and used the rules of this \nbody to bring honor to the Senate and good service to our country. He \nloves the Senate and it showed every time he spoke. And we grew to love \nhim in that process.\n  Through it all, he has never forgotten where he came from, or the \npeople who put him here 24 years ago, or those who supported him, \nespecially his wonderful wife, Linda and his four children.\n  He will be remembered as the ``keeper of the conservative flame,'' \nand like Ronald Reagan, should enjoy the legacy of freedom and economic \nprosperity he has created for all Americans in the years to come.\n\n\n                            peter fitzgerald\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Peter Fitzgerald came to the Senate 6 years ago already a champion. \nHe was the first Republican to win a Senate seat in Illinois in 20 \nyears. He was the only Republican challenger to defeat an incumbent \nnationwide that year. And upon his arrival 6 years ago, he was the \nyoungest member of the U.S. Senate. So expectations for this new \nSenator were high.\n  Senator Fitzgerald exceeded those expectations. From the beginning, \nhe fought to cut wasteful Government spending, fraud at the public \ntill, and mismanagement of the people's money. He led the fight against \nthe recent corporate scandals that damaged our economy.\n  Senator Fitzgerald has been a leader in bringing government into \ncyberspace by sponsoring successful bills to allow farmers to work with \nthe Agriculture Department online. He has also been a champion for \nimproving child nutrition, by making it possible for consumers to use \nfood stamps to make purchases online. He has focused on consumer safety \nby requiring stricter standards for child car seats and car safety \nfeatures.\n  Illinois, where Senator Fitzgerald was born and raised, is the State \nthat\n\n[[Page S11599]]\n\nsent Abraham Lincoln to the White House. Abraham Lincoln was one of \nAmerica's greatest Presidents, and the first President of the \nRepublican Party. The great State of Illinois is known as ``The Land of \nLincoln.''\n  But I am a little jealous of Illinois's claim on this great American. \nAbraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Hodgenville, KY, my home \nState, and we Kentuckians like to think of him as one of our own.\n  I have welcomed Senator Fitzgerald to my home State before, and he is \nwelcome again in the Bluegrass State anytime, especially Hodgenville.\n  Senator Fitzgerald had a long career of public service even before \njoining this body, and I have no doubt he will continue to serve the \npeople of Illinois when he returns to the Prairie State. Most of all, \nhe will enjoy the company of his wife, Nina, and their young son, Jake.\n  Because Senator Fitzgerald is a passionate Chicago Cubs fan, I \nsuspect Jake will be going to a lot more games. The Senate's loss is \nJake's gain, and a gain for the Fitzgerald family and the people of \nIllinois. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his service to his \nState, the Land of Lincoln, and to the Nation.\n\n\n                        ben nighthorse campbell\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to the Olympian from \nColorado.\n  Forty years ago, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell carried the American \nflag in the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. He \nwas the captain of the U.S. judo team and already a Gold Medalist in \nthe 1963 Pan-American Games. For most men, that would be accomplishment \nenough for a lifetime. But for Ben Nighthorse Campbell, it was only the \nbeginning.\n  Every one of us who has been privileged to serve in the Senate knows \nthat we will never again see anyone quite like Ben Nighthorse Campbell. \nHe is probably the only Senator equally comfortable driving a truck or \na Harley-Davidson motorcycle. He has been both a Democrat and a \nRepublican, although he is now a Republican, and I remind the President \nthat wisdom blooms with age.\n  In 1995, Senator Campbell heroically subdued and handcuffed a man who \nhad assaulted the late Senator Strom Thurmond in the Capitol subway. I \nsuspect many Senators became a little more inclined to vote for his \namendments after that.\n  Senator Campbell has consistently fought to reduce the burden the \nFederal Government places on American families by cutting taxes and \nspending. Hailing from the home of the Rocky Mountains, he has led the \nRepublican Party in preserving our environment. He was instrumental in \nestablishing the National Museum of the American Indian on the National \nMall, which opened this fall. He is the only Native-American Indian \nSenator currently serving, and only the eighth in the history of \nCongress.\n  And the Senate is not the only exclusive club in which he claims \nmembership. He also is on the Council of 44 Chiefs for the Northern \nCheyenne Tribe of Lame Deer, Montana.\n  Senator Campbell is an honest, straightforward man who likes simple \npleasures. He served his country with the U.S. Air Force in the Korean \nWar. He and his wife of over 35 years, Linda, have two children and \nthree grandchildren.\n  He has designed award-winning jewelry and trained champion quarter \nhorses. And being from Kentucky, the horse capital of the world, he has \nmy special appreciation for that. I have welcomed him to my home State \nbefore, and he is welcome again in the Bluegrass State anytime.\n  In 2001, Senator Campbell rode a motorcycle specially designed in \nred, white, and blue in the Inaugural Parade. I, for one, would not be \nsurprised to see him ride that bike all the way from here to his \nhometown of Ignacio, CO, now that his 12 years with us draws to a \nclose. It has been an honor to share this Chamber with him, and I \nsalute his service, tenacity, and integrity.\n  But most of all I salute his courage. He stood tall as one of 100, \nand he stood just as tall alone.\n\n\n                            ernest hollings\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the past 38 years, Senator Hollings \nhas served the state of South Carolina in the U.S. Senate with honor, \ngrace, and, most famously, a fiery wit. It is an understatement to say \nthat the Senate will not be the same without him. During his 38-year \ncareer, he has been an outspoken champion of fiscal discipline, an \nearly proponent of maintaining Social Security solvency, and a fighter \nagainst trade agreements that put the domestic textile industry at an \nunfair disadvantage.\n  I will particularly miss Senator Hollings whenever I attend meetings \nof the Budget Committee. Senator Hollings is the only serving Senator \nwho has served on the Senate Budget Committee since it was created in \n1974. As the last of the original members of the, committee, his \ninstitutional knowledge and passion for fiscal discipline will be \nmissed.\n  Budget issues have always been a passion of Senator Hollings, and he \nshares my penchant for using charts to prove a point. Senator Hollings' \nfavorite chart shows gross debt, and I am sure he will be taking it \nwith him when he leaves. Senator Hollings was tireless in his efforts \nto educate his Senate colleagues and the public on the dangers of gross \nFederal debt and the need to use honest numbers in describing our \nbudget outlook. His dedication to bringing truth to budgeting was \nunsurpassed.\n  Senator Hollings also relentlessly defended Section 13301 of the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990--requiring official budget \nnumbers to exclude Social Security. As a number of OMB and CBO \nDirectors came to discover, Senator Hollings was not one to sit quietly \nthrough a Budget Committee hearing while they attempted to obscure \ndeficit figures by including Social Security revenues in their budget \ncalculations.\n  Perhaps most of all, Senator Hollings will be remembered for his \nefforts to protect Social Security, long before protection of this \nentitlement became fashionable. As we move into a new debate over the \nfuture of this vital program, the Nation will surely regret that we did \nnot earlier pay heed to his warnings to prepare for the baby boom \nretirement by paying down Federal debt. Senator Hollings will be missed \nin the coming discussion over Social Security, but I am sure he'll make \nhis views well known with his uncanny ability to describe complex \nissues in simple and straightforward terms.\n  Finally, I will remember Senator Hollings for his fierce criticism of \ntrade agreements that threatened the textile and agricultural sectors \nof South Carolina. He spoke out against GATT and NAFTA, and continued \nto fight for fair trade throughout his service. His strong opposition \nto unfair trade agreements will be sorely missed by the workers and \nfarmers for whom he fought.\n  Given his long history in the Senate, and his penchant for speaking \nout with a cutting wit on important issues, I know that Senator \nHollings will continue to fight for the causes in which he believes. \nHowever, his individuality, his respect for learning the complexities \nof issues, and his dedication to South Carolina and the U.S. will be \nmissed in the Senate. I wish him well as he heads home to Charleston, \nand thank him for his many years of hard work.\n\n\n                              john breaux\n\n  Mr. President, the State of Louisiana has grown accustomed to sending \nits Senators to Washington and keeping them there for a long time. By \nthe standards of his illustrious State colleagues like Allen Ellender, \nRussell Long, and Bennett Johnston, some might think Senator Breaux is \nmaking an early exit after only three terms. However, add in the 14 \nyears that he represented his States's 7th Congressional district in \nthe House of Representatives and that comes to 32 years of \nCongressional service for the people of Louisiana.\n  During a period when it has become increasingly difficult to work \nacross party lines, I admire Senator Breaux's determination to continue \npursuing bipartisan efforts. He has a genuine respect for the \nSenatorial traditions that can still help this body reach consensus, \neven on difficult issues.\n  Since I became a member of the Finance Committee in 1993, the \ngentleman seated to my left has been John Breaux. I know firsthand his \ncommitment to the Social Security and Medicare programs and how deeply \nhe cares\n\n[[Page S11600]]\n\nabout their long-term stability. He also made effective use of his \nposition as chairman and ranking member of the Special Committee on \nAging to highlight the importance of these programs to seniors both \ntoday and in the years to come.\n  Just over a decade ago, Senator Breaux was one of a handful of \nmoderates who came together to seek a bipartisan approach to health \ncare reform. When the budget process stalemated a few years later, \nSenator Breaux went to our late colleague, Senator John Chafee, to \ndevelop a centrist approach to fiscal discipline. As a founding member \nof what came to be called the Chafee-Breaux group, I saw how Senator \nBreaux worked to expand participation and come up with compromises on \nthe key sticking points of tax and entitlement policies. In 1996, we \nput forward an alternative budget that got 46 votes despite the active \nopposition of both the Democratic and Republican leadership. This \neffort directly laid the groundwork for the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, \nwhich put us on the track to balance the moral budget in fiscal year \n1998 for the first time since fiscal year 1969.\n  Senator Breaux put the same energy into Medicare reform. He refused \nto be discouraged by the slings and arrows of partisans on both sides \nwho complained that his approach did not sufficiently adhere to either \nside's vision of ideological purity. His tireless efforts paid off last \nyear when Congress adopted the most far-reaching changes to the \nMedicare since its inception. Due in large part to the efforts of \nSenator Breaux, Medicare for the first time will provide prescription \ndrug coverage to our seniors.\n  I also had the privilege of working closely with Senator Breaux on \nthe Finance Committee to protect the interests of our highly efficient \nsugar industry. As co-chair of the Senate sweetener caucus, Senator \nBreaux was a zealous advocate for the Louisiana sugar cane industry. We \njoined together to fight misguided provisions of the NAFTA that would \nhave threatened the U.S. sugar industry and succeeded in getting the \nClinton administration to renegotiate this part of the agreement. More \nrecently, Senator Breaux has taken a lead role in opposing the Bush \nadministration's efforts to trade away the future of our sugar industry \nin ongoing trade negotiations with Central America, Australia, and \nother countries.\n  Senator Breaux already has one lasting legacy firmly in place as one \nof the creators of the Wallop-Breaux Aquatic Resources Trust Fund. This \nfar-sighted and innovative idea resulted in a funding mechanism for \nprograms to promote recreational boating safety and sport fish \nrestoration by using proceeds from the excise taxes on motorboat fuel \nand fishing equipment, along with duties on related imported goods. The \nbeneficiaries are the more than 70 million recreational boaters and \nsport fishing enthusiasts across the country.\n  I doubt that Senator Breaux will be out of the public policy business \nfor long. Someone with his experience and ideas will be a valuable \nasset wherever he decides to go after leaving the Senate. We will miss \nhim as a colleague, but I would not be surprised to see our friend John \nBreaux back here often.\n\n\n                         ben nighthorse campbell\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague and friend \nSenator Ben Nighthorse Campbell.\n  Since his election to the Senate in 1992, Senator Campbell has been \nthe only Native American in this body and only the eighth to serve in \nCongress. Senator Campbell's road to the Congress took many interesting \nturns--a truck driver, veteran, athlete, jewelry designer, and trainer. \nHe served honorably in the Air Force during the Korean War. He \nrepresented the United States as captain of the 1964 U.S. Olympic Judo \nTeam. Later, he built a successful jewelry business as well as bred and \ntrained quarter horses.\n  During our time in the Senate, I have come to know Senator Campbell \nbest as a fellow member of the Committee on Indian Affairs. Senator \nCampbell has served as Chairman and Ranking Member of that committee \nsince 1997. In that capacity, he proved to be an outspoken leader and \ntireless advocate for all Native Americans. He invested the time to \nlearn about the diverse interests impacting tribes across the country \nand worked across party lines to develop workable solutions to those \nproblems.\n  Senator Campbell often focused on developing and refining Federal \nprograms that would provide a hand-up and build reservation economies \nto help make sure all Native Americans share in the prosperity other \nAmericans have seen. He was also instrumental in securing a National \nMuseum for American Indians, an effort that started more than 15 years \nago and culminated with a museum opening this September along the \nNational Mall.\n  I particularly appreciated Senator Campbell's role in helping the \ntribes in North Dakota make sure the, Federal Government fulfilled its \nlongstanding commitment to compensate them for the infrastructure lost \ndue to the construction of the Missouri River dams. Senator Campbell \nhas helped me shepherd legislation through Congress that would fulfill \none of these vital promises to the Three Affiliated Tribes, the \nreplacement of its hospital. I truly appreciated his support.\n  Senator Campbell has been a true champion for Native Americans. His \ncompassion and conviction will be missed in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n                               bob graham\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to Senator \nBob Graham, a man who has served in the U.S. Senate with great \ndistinction for the last 18 years. The people of Florida have been \nfortunate to be represented by a man who is as thoughtful, as tough-\nminded and as independent as Bob Graham.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I was proud to work with Senator \nGraham to bring the deficit under control. Senator Graham was a leader \nfor fiscal responsibility in the Senate, and he helped to focus our \nefforts to cut wasteful spending and institute budget reforms that \nbrought the deficit under control, and ultimately created a budget \nsurplus. His leadership will certainly be missed in this area in the \nnext Congress, as we must come to terms with the largest deficit in our \nNation's history.\n  Senator Graham was also a voice for fiscal sanity on the Finance \nCommittee, a committee that in recent years has too often promoted \npolicies that have deepened our fiscal problems. It isn't easy to go \nagainst your colleagues, whether in a committee or in a caucus, to \nstand up for what you believe is right. But that's exactly what Bob \nGraham has done throughout his time in the Senate, and I greatly admire \nhim for it.\n  His independence has also extended to his work in the fight against \nterrorism, where he has been an unyielding voice for a stronger, more \nfocused war on terror, and I thank him for his outspoken leadership on \nthis critically important issue.\n  Here in the Senate, we will miss Bob Graham's thoughtful leadership, \nhis unfailing civility, and his unstinting friendship. I thank him for \nhis service to the State of Florida and to this country, and wish him \nall the best in his retirement.\n\n\n                              don nickles\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the decision of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, to retire from the Senate will deprive this \nbody of one of our most trusted and insightful leaders. I will miss \nvery much the pleasure of serving with such an honest, forthright, and \ndiligent colleague.\n  He brought to the Senate the valuable experience of running a family \nbusiness which was translated through the use of his legislative skills \ninto public policies that strengthened our economy by improving our tax \nand labor relations laws.\n  As chairman of the Budget Committee he was successful in his efforts \nto curb unnecessary spending. He was fairminded in his dealings with \nSenators on both sides of the aisle.\n  He was a true friend to me in the Senate and a great help as a coach \non the golf course. I wish him and his wife, Linda, much happiness and \nsuccess in the years ahead.\n\n\n                        BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL\n\n  Mr. President, I regret that my friend from Colorado, Mr. Campbell, \nis retiring from the Senate. He and his wife, Linda, have become good \nfriends who will be truly missed.\n  I enjoyed serving for a few years on the Committee on Indian Affairs \nwith him, and I have had the pleasure of traveling with him on official \nbusiness of the Appropriations Committee.\n\n[[Page S11601]]\n\n  His service in the Senate has been exemplary. He has taken his \nresponsibilities seriously, and he has reflected credit on his State.\n  I did worry about his motorcycle riding. But it was an asset when the \nnew King of Jordan visited the Senate and asked to go for a ride.\n  I hope we will continue to look to Senator Campbell for advice and \ncounsel in the years ahead, especially on the finer points of self \ndefense as an Olympic Gold Medal winner in judo.\n\n\n                              ZELL MILLER\n\n  Mr. President, as I think about the retirement of our colleague from \nGeorgia, Mr. Miller I am reminded of the song, ``Johnny, I Hardly Knew \nYou.''\n  It doesn't seem very long ago since I heard his maiden speech. He \nsaid in a strong voice that he had not come to the Senate to represent \na political party but rather he was here to represent the interests of \nthe people of Georgia. He has proven to be a man of his word. He has \ndemonstrated great courage and much conviction as he has carried out \nhis promise to the Senate and to the people he has represented and \nvoted for here in the Senate.\n  I have observed closely his work in the Agriculture Committee where \nhe has been a very thoughtful and effective voice for his State and our \nNation.\n  His well-reasoned and well-informed method of approaching all the \nissues that come before the Senate is very impressive. He is serious \nminded about his responsibilities, and he works very hard to be an \neffective force for solving the problems that face our country.\n  If more public servants had the character and the commitment to doing \nthe right thing, whatever the consequences as Zell Miller does, our \ndestiny would be assured.\n\n\n                              john breaux\n\n  Mr. President, it is hard to believe that my good friend from \nLouisiana, John Breaux, is retiring from the Senate. We served in the \nother body together when we were very young, and we have been friends \never since, even though he almost always beat me on the tennis court.\n  John Breaux always took his responsibilities in the House and in the \nSenate very seriously but he was always humble and courteous to his \ncolleagues. His pleasant manner, his quick wit, and his diligence were \ngreat assets which he has used over the years to fashion an impressive \nlegislative record.\n  His service in the Senate has been truly outstanding. I will miss him \ngreatly. I wish for him and his wife, Lois, much happiness and \nsatisfaction in the years ahead.\n\n\n                             fritz hollings\n\n  Mr. President, the retirement of our colleague from South Carolina, \nMr. Hollings signals the end of an era in Southern politics. He \nsucceeded as few in our section of the country did in leading us \nthrough a troubled time of transition. From segregation to integration \nin our public schools, and from an agrarian economy to a more modern \nand diversified industrial economy, he led with political courage and \nkeen insight about what was right and what was wrong, and what was \nhopeless and what was possible.\n  I have always admired Fritz Hollings because he acted on his \nconvictions. But, he was not a gadfly. His efforts to enact new budget \nrules under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill were an example of his \neffective leadership to impose restraints on Federal spending.\n  He was an effective leader on the Budget Committee, the \nAppropriations Committee, and the Commerce Committee in a wide range of \nissues including national defense, trade, communications, ocean policy, \nbudget policy, education, and foreign relations.\n  I always enjoyed hearing Fritz tell stories about his fellow Southern \nGovernors. He will be missed for many reasons, but especially for \nalways being himself, without pretense or apology.\n\n\n                              Tom Daschle\n\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Daschle, on his remarkable career in the U.S. Senate.\n  Soon after he was elected to the Senate, in 1986, my wife, Rose, and \nI had the pleasure of taking a trip to Russia with Tom and his wife, \nLinda. We thoroughly enjoyed their company; and, in spite of the \ndifference in party affiliation, I have had a feeling of respect and \nappreciation for the Democratic leader ever since.\n  We have served together on the Agriculture Committee and worked to \nhelp farmers solve their problems. I have admired his dedication to the \nSenate and his intensity of motivation as the opposition leader. He has \nbeen a very effective leader, and I wish him and Linda much happiness \nand satisfaction in the years ahead.\n\n\n                            PETER FITZGERALD\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, It truly has been a privilege to serve in \nthe Senate with my good friend Peter Fitzgerald. As many Illinois \nnewspapers wrote when Peter announced he would not seek re-election, \nhis decision to retire from the U.S. Senate is a true loss for the \npeople of Illinois. I could not agree more.\n  In the 1998 race for his Senate seat, Peter proved himself to be an \nexceptional campaigner, defeating a well-known incumbent in a State \nthat had not elected a Republican in 20 years. And in that year, he was \nthe only Republican challenger in the country to defeat an incumbent \nDemocratic Senator. But Peter's vision, message and leadership \nresonated with Illinoisans, and they elected him by a 6 point margin.\n  Arriving in Washington as the youngest member of the Senate, Peter \nhit the ground running as a strong voice for Illinois. He has been a \nsteadfast advocate for taxpayers, consistently backing efforts to cut \nwasteful spending and reduce taxes. And he has been a proponent for \nconsumer safety issues, focusing on areas such as improving car safety \nand child booster seats.\n  I have the utmost respect for Peter. His courage and determination, \neven when faced with a daunting challenge, are remarkable. He has gone \nup against unscrupulous corporations and political corruption. He has \nhad significant roles in investigating corporate accounting fraud, and \nPeter also has fought political corruption across party lines, leading \nthe Chicago Tribune conclude that ``no one person has done more for \npolitical reform in Illinois than Peter Fitzgerald.''\n  I have been privileged to serve alongside Peter on the Senate \nAgriculture committee, working together on issues important to our \nstrong agriculture States. As an advocate for increasing hunger \nawareness myself, I admire his work to make food stamp benefits for \nlow-income families more easily accessible, including making program \nbenefits available over the Internet.\n  Peter and I share many similar views, but what is not widely known is \nthat we look for the same qualities in our extraordinary staff members. \nIn fact, managing the Fitzgerald office is chief of staff Greg Gross. \nGreg is a very talented member of his team, and I can attest to this \nbecause Greg also did such good work with me at the American Red Cross. \nI thank Greg for all his counsel during my first 2 years in the Senate.\n  It is widely known that Peter Fitzgerald is a principled and \nindependent leader. He has time after time proven that he will go \nagainst the flow, go against what is popular, because he is loyal to \nhis own ideals and doing what he believes is right for the people and \nfamilies he represents. Peter is a refreshing elected official; a \ndevoted family man to his wife Nina and son Jake; and a diligent public \nservant. It goes without saying, people in Washington and people in \nIllinois will sorely miss Senator Peter Fitzgerald.\n\n\n                              TOM DASCHLE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to Senator \nTom Daschle, who has served South Dakota, and the Senate, with dignity \nand devotion during his tenure in this body.\n  I am proud to have worked with him on a wide range of issues over the \nyears, but perhaps most of all I thank him for his work and leadership \nto reform the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This is a fight that will \ngo forward in the next Congress, where we will build on Senator \nDaschle's hard work and commitment to this important issue.\n  I also want to take a moment to recognize Senator Daschle's \nleadership, as both majority and minority leader, here in the Senate. \nHe has led the Democratic caucus, and the Senate as a whole, through a \ntime of great change and many difficult challenges: through a closely \ndivided Senate,\n\n[[Page S11602]]\n\nthrough the tragedy of 9/11, and through the anthrax attack on the \nSenate, which so personally affected both of our offices. Through all \nof this, Senator Daschle has inspired us with his dedication and \nability to work through tough problems, to guide the policies of our \nparty, and to provide steady leadership when we needed it most.\n  Finally, I also want to extend my thanks to many of Senator Daschle's \nstaff, who were especially helpful to my office over the past 12 years, \nand in particular, were so thoughtful and generous with their time in \nthe wake of the anthrax attack on our offices. It is often the case \nthat a Senator's staff reflect the personality of the Senator for whom \nthey work, and I believe that is certainly the case with Senator \nDaschle and his staff.\n  I thank Tom Daschle for his leadership and his service to South \nDakota and our country, and I wish him all the best as he moves on to \nbegin a new chapter in his distinguished career.\n\n\n                            peter fitzgerald\n\n  Mr. President, today I take a moment to recognize the contributions \nthat Senator Peter Fitzgerald has made to this Senate, to the State of \nIllinois, and to the Nation.\n  As a fellow Midwesterner, I have always appreciated Senator \nFitzgerald's honest and fair-minded approach to the issues. From the \nmoment he arrived here in the Senate, it was clear that he would keep \nhis own counsel, doing what he thought was best for the people Illinois \nwithout regard to powerful interests on either side of the aisle.\n  Above all else, I appreciate Senator Fitzgerald's unfailing \ncommitment to reforming our campaign finance system. He was among that \nsteadfast group of Republican senators who stood firm in their support \nof the McCain-Feingold bill, despite enormous pressure to do otherwise. \nHis support of our bill took a great deal of personal and political \ncourage, and it is something that I truly admire, and for which I will \nalways been grateful.\n  As he moves on from the Senate, Senator Fitzgerald can be assured \nthat his friends and colleagues here will long remember the \ncontributions he made, and the dignity with which he served. I wish him \nall the best as he moves on to a new phase of his career.\n\n\n                              don nickles\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am reminded of the words of Will Rogers, \nthat great Oklahoman whose statue is a few steps removed from the old \nSenate chamber, who once said, ``The income tax system is the only \nthing that has made a liar out of more of the American people than golf \nhas.''\n  Coincidentally, the tax system and golf are passions of another great \nOklahoman who I am proud to honor at the end of this Congress--our \nfriend and colleague Don Nickles.\n  Don has accomplished a great deal during his 24 years in the Senate. \nChief among them is the fact that he somehow has managed to look almost \nexactly like he did when he first entered the Senate at the ripe old \nage of 32 in 1981.\n  But the accomplishment of Don that I admire the most is remarkable \nrecord of success he has achieved in putting more money in the pockets \nof America's families by reducing their taxes and by restoring some \nfairness to the system.\n  To paraphrase Will Rogers, Don never met a tax he liked. And from \nreducing and then repealing the death tax to equalizing the tax system \nfor the self-employed to being the guiding force behind the child tax \ncredit, lowering the capital gains tax, and reducing tax rates for all \nAmericans, no Senator has done more in the past 20 years to earn the \nenduring respect of our hard working taxpayers than Don Nickles.\n  Don will be greatly missed as a legislator, but he will also be \ngreatly missed as a friend. I have long believed that you can learn a \nlot about someone by playing golf with them, and I've been privileged \nduring my 8 years in the Senate to play a little bit of golf with Don.\n  And it should come as no surprise that his actions on the golf course \nare very much like his actions in the Senate.\n  He is good, very good, at both.\n  And yes, there are times on the golf course like here in the Senate \nwhere he can be found on the right, the far right, but for the most \npart he plays it straight down the middle.\n  It is on the golf course where Don and I became more than colleagues, \nwe became friends. And I know I am not alone in saying that I will miss \nDon's friendship, and the friendship of his wife Linda, on a day-to-day \nbasis. When tragedy befell my family last year, Don was at my house \nwithin the hour. Don and Linda have been incredibly kind and supportive \nto Sharon and me.\n  Don, as a taxpayer I thank you for your service, as a golfer I thank \nyou for more good memories than I can count, and as a friend, I thank \nyou for being there when I needed you most.\n  I know your contributions to your state and your country are far from \ncomplete, and all your colleagues join with me in wishing you and Linda \nGodspeed as you begin this new chapter in your life.\n\n\n                              TOM DASCHLE\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I honor the long and dedicated service that \nTom Daschle has given to our country. He has been a true leader \nthroughout his life in public service, and South Dakota and the entire \nNation are better off because of his efforts.\n  For 29 years, South Dakota has been fortunate to have Tom Daschle \nrepresent their interests--first as a Senate staffer, then as a Member \nof the House of Representatives, and finally as a United States \nSenator. He has worked tirelessly to make sure that the people of South \nDakota have a strong economy, access to quality, affordable health \ncare, and the highest quality education system. He has worked with \nunfailing determination to enchance the quality of life in rural \ncommunities across South Dakota and the Nation. Throughout his service, \nTom has always kept the interests of his State and his constituents as \nhis top priority.\n  Tom Daschle has been a wonderful leader for South Dakota, for the \nDemocratic party, and for all Americans. I deeply respect and applaud \nhis lifelong commitment to public service, and his leadership and his \nfriendship will be missed by many in the Senate. I know he moves on to \nthe next phase of his career as a happy and wise man who will continue \nto make important contributions to our country long after he leaves the \nSenate. He is a true patriot who has always served and will always \nserve his country. I want to thank Tom for his dedication and his \nservice, and I wish him the very best in his future endeavors.\n\n\n                              tom daschle\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in these final working days of the 108th \nCongress, we are saying farewell to a number of retiring colleagues. A \nmost painful farewell will be to my friend Senator Tom Daschle.\n  These days, there are fewer and fewer bipartisan agreements in this \nbody. But there is bipartisan agreement about the senior Senator from \nSouth Dakota. We respect his decency, his fairness, his courage, his \nleadership, and, of course, his extraordinary capacity for hard work.\n  I cannot imagine a more difficult job in the Senate than being leader \nof the Democratic caucus. We've all heard Will Rogers's quip that he \nbelonged to no organized party, he was a Democrat. Well, those \nindependent, hardheaded habits flourish within our caucus. But, for the \nlast decade, Tom Daschle's amazing skills and unlimited patience have \nbrought us together as a team. And that is an accomplishment he can be \nvery proud of.\n  The President of the United States has the persuasion of power. The \nleader of the Senate's Democratic caucus has only the power of \npersuasion. And I can't imagine anyone more persuasive than Tom \nDaschle. He has always been willing to talk with us, to accommodate us \nwhenever possible, and to do whatever it takes to forge a consensus and \nmove us forward. I am grateful for his leadership, and for the \ndiligence and race that he has unfailingly brought to his job as \nleader.\n  I cannot emphasize too much Tom Daschle's sense of fairness as \nleader. He has been unfailingly fair to others. And he has demanded \nfair treatment in return. When Democrats were in the majority, majority \nleader Daschle was respectful of the rights and prerogatives of the \nRepublican minority. Conversely, as minority leader, he has\n\n[[Page S11603]]\n\nsteadfastly defended the rights and prerogatives of the Democratic \nminority.\n  In the heat of a partisan campaign, some have tried to label this \nobstructionism. But that characterization is incorrect. The duty of the \nopposition party is to oppose, and to do so fairly, forthrightly, and \nwithin the rules of the Senate--to protect the rights of the minority. \nThat is exactly what Senator Daschle has done--with great skill and \npersistence.\n  I also have enormous respect for the way Senator Daschle has \nadvocated for his constituents back home in South Dakota. No one has \nfought harder for the revitalization of rural America than Tom Daschle. \nNo one has fought harder to bring health care, good schools, and \neconomic opportunity to Indian County. No one has fought harder to \nincrease the income level of family farmers, and to give them a fair \nshake in the marketplace.\n  Another jewel in the crown of Tom Daschle's legacy is the emerging \nethanol industry in the United States. Since Tom arrived in Congress in \n1978, he has been a relentless champion of ethanol. I know because I \nwas there, too, during those early years. People said that those of us \nwho were advocating the expanded use of ethanol didn't have a chance \nagainst big oil. But Senator Daschle used the 1990 Clean Air Act to put \nin place policies that spurred the ethanol industry. And he has \ncontinued to promote tax incentives and a renewable fuel standard to \nadvance ethanol and to move our country in the direction of energy \nindependence. So, no doubt about it, Senator Daschle's leadership on \nethanol will be greatly missed.\n  It has been a privilege to serve in this body with Senator Tom \nDaschle. I will miss him as a colleague. Most of all, I will miss him \nas a friend. The good news is that there are important chapters yet to \nbe written in the life of Tom Daschle. I wish Tom and his wonderful \nwife Linda the very best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                              John Edwards\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my respect and admiration for the \nretiring senior Senator from North Carolina, John Edwards.\n  We will miss his uniquely skillful and persuasive voice in debates \nhere on the Senate floor. Time and again, we have seen his knack for \ntaking complex arguments and making them accessible and persuasive to \nordinary people. Time and again, his skills have carried the day. So I \nfully understand the advice of one of our Republican colleagues: \n``Never yield the floor to John Edwards.''\n  Over the last year and a half, people in my state of Iowa have gotten \nto know John and his wonderful wife Elizabeth very, very well. John has \nbeen in every one of Iowa's 99 counties. He's been in our schools, in \nour coffee shops, in our living rooms. In fact, if it weren't for that \nSouthern accent, Iowans would think John was one of us. We Democrats \nare proud of his race for the nomination and his conduct as VP nominee.\n  He always comes across as ``just folks''--which is what you'd expect \nfrom a person raised in very modest circumstances, the first in his \nfamily to go to college. This humble background is an enormous strength \nfor John Edwards. It's a strength we saw last night. It allows him to \nunderstand people. It also allows him to communicate powerfully with \nordinary people. And people respond in kind. They just plain like John \nEdwards. People trust him.\n  But if Iowans and other Americans see a ``just folks'' John Edwards \non the campaign trail, Senators have been privileged to see a different \nside of him, hard at work in this body. John has been in the Senate for \nonly one term. But he has made his mark.\n  He made his mark by challenging an incumbent Senator and single-\nhandedly taking on the Jesse Helms machine in North Carolina--and \nbeating it.\n  He made his mark as a lead cosponsor of the Patients' Bill of Rights \nin the Senate, along with Senators Kennedy and McCain. John managed the \nbill on the floor. And he was the lead negotiator in hammering out a \nbipartisan consensus on the bill.\n  He made his mark by sponsoring--and passionately advocating for--a \nbill to speed up approval of generic drugs.\n  And, in my State of Iowa, John Edwards made his mark--and won \npeople's hearts--with his big smile, his friendly manner, and his \nboundless optimism. At the same time, he won our respect with a \ncampaign that was always positive. Even under provocation, even when \nthe stakes were highest in the final weeks of the campaign leading up \nto the caucuses, John never wavered from his positive message of hope \nand opportunity for ``ordinary'' Americans.\n  So here at the end of this 108th Congress, we say farewell to Senator \nJohn Edwards. But, clearly, we have not seen the last of this \nremarkably able person. I wish John the very best. And, of course, we \nall pray for the full recovery of Elizabeth. We will miss them both \nhere in Washington, but our friendship will continue.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to some of my \ncolleagues who will be leaving the Senate at the end of this session.\n\n\n                              tom daschle\n\n  I particularly want to pay tribute to a great Senator, someone who I \nam proud to call a friend, our leader, Tom Daschle.\n  Senator Daschle is truly one of the giants in the history of the \nUnited States Senate and it has been a privilege to serve with him for \nthe last 4 years.\n  Tom Daschle has given his entire life to public service. After \nserving in the Air Force, he came to Washington to work for South \nDakota Senator James Abourezk. A few years later, he won election to \nthe House and later won three terms in the Senate.\n  Senator Daschle has been through some tough elections and tough \nbattles on the floor of this Senate. But he has always conducted \nhimself with grace, integrity and respect for his opponents. He has \nbeen a leader in the Senate on health care, veterans' benefits, \nethanol, agriculture and rural development and has fought hard for the \npeople of South Dakota.\n  He is known all over South Dakota for his down-to-earth manner and \nthe personal relationships he has with his constituents.\n  Every year, Tom Daschle would go on a driving tour of all 66 counties \nin South Dakota, stopping in at diners, bowling allies, Elks clubs and \nfeed stores. He would talk to his constituents on a one-on-one basis \nand really feel the pulse of different communities.\n  Therefore, when he debated an issue here on the Senate floor, he knew \nfirsthand what his constituents thought. He represented them so well, \nthe way our founding fathers would have envisioned a model Senator.\n  He was also a great leader. He worked with all members of our caucus \nand did the hard work to develop a consensus on many difficult issues. \nAnd he was always willing to listen.\n  Tom Daschle would work across the aisle to get things done for his \nState and the country. I remember how he rose to the occasion after \nSeptember 11th and worked hand-in-hand with President Bush to protect \nour country, rebuild New York and keep the airlines from going \nbankrupt.\n  If you were trying to get something done here in the Senate, you \nalways wanted Tom Daschle on your side.\n\n\n                             fritz hollings\n\n  The Senate is also losing a legend with the retirement of Senator \nFritz Hollings. For 38 years, he has fought for South Carolina, \nbringing home jobs and economic development, and he has made a lasting \nimpression on the lives of Americans across this country.\n  Senator Hollings helped start the Women Infants Children-WIC program, \none of the most successful Government health care measures ever \nundertaken, helping reduce infant mortality, low birth weights, and \npremature births nationwide.\n  He is the father of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration--NOAA. Senator Hollings pushed through the legislation \nthat created NOAA during his very first term as a Senator.\n  And he co-authored Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, the landmark legislation \nthat broke budget gridlock in the mid-80s. By making automatic spending \ncuts, it reversed 20 years of increased Federal spending and cut tens \nof billions from the budget deficit.\n  Senator Hollings strong leadership and sense of humor will be deeply \nmissed in this chamber.\n\n[[Page S11604]]\n\n                               bob graham\n\n  We will also miss the leadership and service of Senator Bob Graham.\n  Senator Graham has dedicated his life to public service, serving in \nthe Florida State house and State senate, and as Governor of Florida \nbefore his 18 years here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Graham and I share a passion for healthcare. And he has been \na tireless advocate and leader on the need for a prescription drug \nbenefit for America's seniors.\n  As founder of the New Senate Democrats, Senator Graham has worked to \nbring together coalitions on issues ranging from education to the \nnational debt and fiscal responsibility.\n\n\n                              john breaux\n\n   The Senate will be saying goodbye to another great centrist, Senator \nJohn Breaux. Senator Breaux has a well-earned reputation on the Hill of \nbeing able to bring both sides together and forge bipartisan \ncompromises.\n  In a time of blue States and red States, Senator Breaux has been a \nleader in bringing Americans together in the mainstream middle, instead \nof dividing Americans with the ideological extremism.\n\n\n                              john edwards\n\n  And finally, Mr. President, the Senate is also losing a champion for \nAmerica's working families with the retirement of Senator John Edwards. \nSenator Edwards is the embodiment of the American dream.\n  Raised in a small town in North Carolina by hard-working parents--his \nfather was textile mill worker for 36 years--Senator Edwards learned \nthe real American values of getting a good education, of hard work, \nfairness and playing by rules.\n  He was the first member of his family to go to college. And after \ngraduating from law school, he fought for the values his parents taught \nhim and by working for justice on behalf of those who couldn't fight \nfor themselves--working families and their children who were seriously \ninjured by irresponsible corporate actions.\n  I was proud to work with Senator Edwards on the Patients' Bill of \nRights where he brought that same passion to help working families by \nensuring that doctors and not HMOs make our medical decisions.\n  I know Senator Edwards will continue to fight for working families \nand be a national leader on these important issues.\n  I also want to wish his wife Elizabeth the best at this difficult \ntime. She is a strong, amazing woman and a fighter like her husband, \nand the entire Edwards family is in my thoughts and prayers.\n  I am proud to have served with these great Senators and I know that \nthey will be remembered long after the tribute speeches are given and \nthe farewell parties end, because of their leadership, their \ncompassion, and their hard work on behalf of all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to take this opportunity to \nhonor our departing colleagues who are leaving the Senate. Almost each \nnew Congress a different group of 100 men and women come together from \ndifferent backgrounds and political philosophies, representing \ndifferent interests and constituencies, but through all our \ndifferences, we develop respect and admiration for each other. Many \ntimes we step across the aisle and work together on legislation and \noften times genuine friendships are created. As I pay tribute to these \ndeparting Senators, whether they have been here 1 term or 7, they are a \nremarkable group and we thank them for their honorable service.\n\n\n                              Ben Campbell\n\n  Ben Nighthorse Campbell has been more than just a neighbor Senator \nfrom out west, but a close friend and colleague.\n  I have worked with Senator Campbell on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Indian \nAffairs Committee. During his 18 years in the United States Congress, \nSenator Campbell has earned the respect of members on both sides of the \naisle as being a statesman and staunch advocate for the State of \nColorado. In addition, he is the sole American Indian serving in the \nSenate, and he is also a Northern Cheyenne tribal chief. His work on \nbehalf of tribes is legendary, and I know he will be sorely missed by \nthe American Indian people.\n  Senator Campbell has been a recognized leader on public land and \nnatural resource policy. Since New Mexico and Colorado face similar \nchallenges, we have worked closely on these matters, and it has been a \nprivilege to work with someone so passionate about improving land \nmanagement policies.\n  Senator Campbell is a veteran, Olympian, and public servant, and he \nhas selflessly devoted himself to serving his State and country for \nover half a century. Senator Campbell is a unique individual who I call \na friend. His love of nature, his family and his roots is continually \nevident. As a father, grandfather, and Senator, I know that Senator \nNighthorse Campbell and his loved ones will be glad to have more time \nfor family activities.\n  He proudly represented Colorado and its people. His leadership and \npresence will be greatly missed by all. I wish him the best of luck in \nall of his future endeavors.\n\n\n                              John Breaux\n\n  John Breaux is retiring after serving 3 terms in the Senate. I would \nlike to take this time to acknowledge a friend, colleague, and \ndedicated public servant.\n  Senator Breaux was elected to the House of Representatives in 1972 at \nthe age of 28, and at that time, he was the youngest member of \nCongress. After serving 14 years in the House, the people of Louisiana \nelected John Breaux to the Senate in 1986.\n  I have had the pleasure of working closely with Senator Breaux on \nmany energy matters over the years. During this time, I have admired \nhis ability to find common ground between those who hold disparate \nviews. His uncanny ability to bring industry leaders, policy makers, \nand administration leaders together is unique, and I will always \nappreciate his candor in resolving energy policy differences. John was \nalways someone I could reach across the aisle to work with on the \nBudget Resolutions.\n  It is well known that Senator Breaux is passionate about improving \nhealth care for all Americans. He worked tirelessly on welfare and \nhealth care issues, and took an active interest in the elderly as a \nmember of the Finance Committee and a leader of the Special Committee \non Aging, just last year he played an integral part in drafting the \nMedicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003. This historic \nlegislation will provide relief to the millions of people struggling to \npay for prescription drugs and he should be honored for his dedication \nto this bill.\n  Senator Breaux's work has touched the lives of a great many \nAmericans, and his talents and unrivaled sense of humor will be sorely \nmissed in the Senate. Just as importantly, he has been a great advocate \nfor his home State of Louisiana, and his State has been lucky to have \nhis service for so many years.\n  In the course of working together for so many years, I have developed \ngenuine respect for Senator Breaux. I thank him for years of \ndistinguished service, and wish him the very best in all his future \nundertakings. I will miss Senator John Breaux.\n\n\n                              Zell Miller\n\n  I wish to take this time to honor a great senator and a true American \npatriot, Zell Miller. He is a man who has served Georgia with dignity \nand honor these past 4 years in the United States Senate.\n  Zell Miller embraced public service early on in his life. His mother \nserved as one of Georgia's first female mayors. She taught him early on \nabout public service and a strong work ethic, which he has exemplified \nthroughout his career.\n  In the late 1950s, Zell Miller served as mayor of his hometown of \nYoung Harris, GA. He then went on to serve as a State Senator, \nLieutenant Governor, and eventually served in the highest power in the \nstate of Georgia as Governor. Not surprisingly, Zell Miller was named \nby the Washington Post in 1998 as the most popular governor in America \nand the Governing Magazine named him Governor of the Year in 1998. \nThese career paths finally led him to the United States Senate in 2000.\n  While Zell Miller was invested in politics, he was also dedicated to \neducation and students. Throughout his career, Zell Miller was a \nprofessor of political science and history at the\n\n[[Page S11605]]\n\nEmory University, University of Georgia, and Young Harris College.\n  Senator Miller has continuously reached across the aisle to work with \nRepublicans, but it is probably best stated in his own words when he \npointed out that while he is a lifelong Democrat, he pledged to serve \nall 8.5 million Georgians and no single party in the Senate. Through \nthis approach, Zell Miller has been a supporter of a broad range of \nissues such as tax cuts, improving education, strengthening national \nsecurity, and fighting the global war on terrorism. While in the \nSenate, he dutifully served on the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \nCommittee, the Banking, Housing, and Urban Development Committee, and \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  His time here has been all too brief, but Senator Miller has made a \ndifference and I will miss him. While he may be leaving the U.S. \nSenate, I do not doubt that we have not heard the last of Zell. I bid \nhim farewell and extend my best wishes to him and his family.\n\n\n                              Tom Daschle\n\n  I would like to pay tribute to a respected colleague who is leaving \nthe Senate after a long and distinguished career. Senator Tom Daschle \nworked hard, for 8 years as a Member of the House of Representatives \nand for 18 years as a United States Senator, to represent the interests \nof voters across the State of South Dakota.\n  As the leader of his party for the past 10 years, Senator Daschle has \nproven himself to be a capable legislator and moreover, an advocate for \nhis State's and party's interests. During the 108th Congress, Senator \nDaschle served on four committees: Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry, Finance, and Rules and Administration; and today he serves as \nthe Senior Senator and the Democratic Leader of the Senate.\n  Influenced by his formative experiences during the Vietnam War as an \nintelligence officer in the Air Force, Senator Daschle worked hard to \nserve the interests of veterans across this great country. His most \nnotable achievement in this field was the enactment of legislation \nsecuring benefits for those soldiers exposed to Agent Orange.\n  During his tenure, Senator Daschle also developed a reputation for \nbeing a shrewd legislator on issues related to agriculture and South \nDakota's farming community. He was always apprised of even the most \nminute issues at stake and thus ensured that all of his constituents \nwere represented at the negotiating table.\n  Senator Daschle fought tirelessly for his beliefs throughout his time \nin the Senate. I wish Senator Daschle and his family the very best in \nthe years ahead.\n\n\n                               Bob Graham\n\n  I have a great affection for the departing Senator from Florida Bob \nGraham. After 18 years of dedicated service to his country and to the \npeople of Florida, all of us in this Chamber will certainly miss the \nSenator as he retires from elected office.\n  I had the pleasure of serving on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee with Senator Graham during the past 9 years. During that \ntime, I had the opportunity to work with Senator Graham on a number of \nimportant issues. He proved to be a sound leader for his party and a \nmember committed to bipartisan solutions.\n  Senator Graham's brief tenure as Chairman of the Select Intelligence \nCommittee, came during one of the most trying times our Nation has \nfaced, the attack on our country by terrorists on September 11, 2001. \nSenator Graham worked closely with his House counterpart, and current \nDirector of Central Intelligence, Porter Goss to lead a joint Senate-\nHouse inquiry into the attacks on our nation.\n  Although he was first elected to the Senate in 1986, Senator Graham \nhas been serving the people of Florida since 1966 when he was first \nelected to that State's House of Representatives. After serving in the \nHouse for 4 years and in the State Senate for 8 years, Senator Graham \nwas elected the 38th Governor of the State of Florida.\n  In spite of these accomplishments, it is fair to say that Senator \nGraham will perhaps be most memorable for instituting the ``Workdays'' \nhe began in 1974 and continued during his time in the Senate. Senator \nGraham began the ``Workdays'' by teaching a semester of civics courses \nat a Miami area high school.\n  I wish Senator Graham, his wife Adele, and his children and \ngrandchildren the very best in the coming years.\n\n\n                            Ernest Hollings\n\n  Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings devoted his entire adult life to public \nservice. He admirably served 7 terms as a U.S. Senator and today he is \nthe fourth most senior member of the Senate, and he also hold the \ndistinction of being the longest serving junior Senator in history.\n  His service to our country began immediately after he graduated from \nThe Citadel in 1942 when he received a commission from the U.S. Army. \nThroughout his honorable military service Senator Hollings received the \nBronze Star and seven campaign ribbons. He served as an officer in the \nNorth African and European campaigns during World War II.\n  After returning from the war, Fritz attended the University of South \nCarolina School of Law where he completed his Juris Doctorate in less \nthan 3 years. At the age of 26, Fritz Hollings launched his public \nservice career when he was elected to the South Carolina House of \nRepresentatives. He went on to become Speaker Pro Tempore, Lieutenant \nGovernor, and at the age of 36 Governor of South Carolina becoming the \nyoungest man in the 20th century to be elected Governor of South \nCarolina.\n  It has been a great honor to work with Fritz Hollings over these many \nyears. We were able to work together while serving on the Senate Budget \nCommittee and the Senate Appropriations Committee together. He \nconsistently fought for fiscal responsibility and a reliable Government \nfor the people.\n  As a principal author of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Senator \nHollings was a perfect candidate to serve as the ranking member on the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee during the 108th \nCongress. Through this position, Senator Hollings developed legislation \nto strengthen national security for our nation's port, railroad, and \naviation systems.\n  Senator Hollings has served the Senate in so many ways over the past \n42 years it is impossible to know where to begin showcasing his \ncontributions. Therefore, I would just like to say that he has \ncontinued over the years to work to better not only the lives of South \nCarolinians, but all the people of our nation.\n  Senator Hollings will certainly be missed around here. I bid him \nfarewell and extend my best wishes to him and his family.\n\n\n                            Peter Fitzgerald\n\n  Senator Peter Fitzgerald is retiring from the Senate after 6 years of \nservice to his home State of Illinois.\n  Prior to joining the Senate, Senator Fitzgerald was a commercial \nbanking attorney and in this position played a significant role in \ninvestigations of corporate accounting fraud, mutual fund industry \nabuses, chronic under-funding of employee pensions, and waste, fraud \nand mismanagement in various Federal agencies. In 1993, he embarked \nupon his public service work when he began serving as an Illinois State \nSenator until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1998 at the young age \nof 38.\n  Peter was the first Republican in Illinois to win a Senate race in 20 \nyears. Even though his time here was brief, he has been able to \nestablish himself as a fiscally responsible Senator. He has \nconsistently backed efforts to control spending and reduce taxes. \nThrough these actions, Senator Fitzgerald has received many awards from \ntaxpayer watchdog groups such as the Americans for Tax Reform, who has \nrepeatedly named him a ``Hero of the American Taxpayer.''\n  While serving as chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer \nAffairs and Product Safety, Peter has also led a successful fight to \nimprove outdated consumer safety regulations. These regulations brought \nabout higher testing and safety standards for child car seats and \nimproved car safety features that benefit all Americans.\n  Senator Fitzgerald will be missed, though I'm sure he is now looking \nforward to spending more time with his wife Nina and their son Jake. I \nwish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.\n\n[[Page S11606]]\n\n                              John Edwards\n\n  Finally, I would like to acknowledge my retiring colleague from North \nCarolina, Senator John Edwards.\n  Senator Edwards was the first in his family to attend college, \nworking his way through North Carolina State University and later \nearning his law degree from the University of North Carolina. \nAfterward, John Edwards established himself as a distinguished and \nsuccessful lawyer. These accomplishments alone are quite striking and \naptly demonstrate the intelligence and determination of Senator \nEdwards.\n  During his time in the Senate, Senator Edwards served on four \ncommittees: Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, the Judiciary, the \nSmall Business & Entrepreneurship, and the Select Intelligence. He \ncontinually championed for issues affecting the daily lives of regular \npeople in North Carolina and the nation.\n  I am sure Senator Edwards will find success in any endeavor he now \nchooses to undertake and I join with my colleagues in wishing him the \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11606-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, in a matter of days, families across this \nNation will gather around the table to celebrate Thanksgiving, that \nquintessential American holiday on which we pause to give thanks for \nour many blessings as a Nation and to celebrate that most precious gift \nof all, the love and fellowship of our families and friends.\n  There will be many empty chairs at the table this year as America \nobserves the second Thanksgiving holiday since the invasion of Iraq. As \nmany as 140,000 U.S. military personnel are currently serving in Iraq \nand another 20,000 in Afghanistan.\n  What that means in human terms is that tens of thousands of American \nfamilies will be sitting down to a somber Thanksgiving dinner, their \nprayers of thanksgiving tempered by their fears for the safety of their \nloved ones.\n  Others, the families and loved ones of the more than 1,200 American \ntroops who have been killed in Iraq, will sit down to a dinner seasoned \nwith sorrow, the empty chair at the table a wrenching reminder of the \nterrible cost of war.\n  Whatever one believes about the justification of the war in Iraq, it \nis an indisputable fact that the troops on the ground, and their \nfamilies and friends here at home, are bearing the heaviest burden of \nthe President's decision to go to war. And on holidays like \nThanksgiving, when family and friends are held especially close to the \nheart, the weight of that burden becomes especially hard to bear.\n  It is easy to talk about war in the abstract. It is easy for the \nPresident and his military advisers to point to the steady progression \nof U.S. victories against the insurgents in places like Falluja and \nMosel as evidence that we are winning the war in Iraq. It is easy to be \narmchair quarterbacks in a bloody battle raging halfway across the \nworld. But as anyone knows who has visited wounded troops at Walter \nReed Army Hospital, who has gazed into the eyes of young widows or \ngrieving parents, or who has read the poignant stories of the fallen, \nthere is no such thing as war fought in the abstract or battles waged \nin statistics.\n  War, to those who must fight it and to their loved ones who must \nendure it, is painfully real and painfully present at the table, on \nThanksgiving and on every other day of the week for the duration of the \nconflict--and sometimes for long after the fighting has ceased. These \nare the men and women on the front lines of the battle, and it is they \nwhom we must salute and thank for their sacrifice.\n  I was struck by an article in the November 14 edition of the Los \nAngeles Times on the psychological toll that the war in Iraq is taking \non U.S. soldiers and Marines. According to the newspaper, the Walter \nReed Army Institute of Research has found that 15.6 percent of marines \nand 17.1 percent of soldiers surveyed after returning from Iraq \nreported suffering from major depression, generalized anxiety, or post-\ntraumatic stress disorder.\n\n  Even more disturbing, the article predicted that the reported \nstatistics were only the tip of the iceberg. According to the Times \narticle:\n\n       Army and Veterans Administration mental health experts say \n     there is reason to believe the war's ultimate psychological \n     fallout will worsen. The Army survey of 6,200 soldiers and \n     Marines involved only troops willing to report their \n     problems. The study did not look at reservists, who tend to \n     suffer a higher rate of psychological injury than career \n     Marines and soldiers. And the soldiers in the study served in \n     the early months of the war, when tours were shorter and \n     before the Iraqi insurgence took shape.\n\n  The Los Angeles Times went on to quote Dr. Matthew J. Friedman, a \nprofessor of psychiatry and pharmacology at Dartmouth Medical School \nand the executive director of the VA's National Center for Post \nTraumatic Stress Disorder: ``The bad news is that the study \nunderestimated the prevalence of what we are going to see down the \nroad,'' he said.\n  What a chilling forecast. One has only to look at the video footage \nof the house-to-house, mosque-to-mosque combat in Falluja to understand \nthe tremendous psychological stresses on the young servicemen who form \nthe vanguard of our assault against the insurgents in Iraq. One has \nonly to read of the wary convoys of soldiers and Marines who are tasked \nto traverse the treacherous stretches of deadly Iraqi highways day \nafter day after day, or to edge their way into labyrinthine alleys of \nBaghdad's most dangerous neighborhoods, to understand the sheer \npsychological hell of the war in Iraq.\n  The Pentagon keeps a daily log of U.S. military troops killed or \nwounded in Iraq. As of this morning, November 19, the Pentagon reports \nthat 1,214 American troops have been killed in Iraq and another 8,956 \nwounded, more than half of them so severely injured that they could not \nbe directly returned to duty. Barely more than halfway through the \nmonth, November 2004 has already turned into the second deadliest month \nfor American military forces since the United States invaded Iraq in \nMarch of 2003. Where and when will the carnage end?\n  The casualty statistics are heartbreaking enough, especially on the \ncusp of what is supposed to be one of the most joyful seasons of the \nyear. But they do not represent the whole story. The Defense Department \ndoes not tally the walking wounded, those soldiers and Marines who \nreturn home from duty physically fit but emotionally scarred, sometimes \nfor life. These men and women are also casualties of the war in Iraq, \nand they and their families may suffer just as deeply as those whose \nwounds are plain to see. Modern medicine has come a long way in mending \nthe broken bodies of soldiers wounded in combat, but I fear the \nmilitary still has a long way to go in identifying and mending the \nbroken psyches of otherwise healthy veterans.\n  And so on this Thanksgiving, I hope that all Americans will take a \nmoment to pray for the safety of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nfor the eternal salvation of those who have died in service to their \ncountry, and for the speedy recovery of all who have been wounded, \nincluding those who are suffering from the invisible ravages of \nemotional wounds. I also hope that Americans will take a moment to pray \nfor the families and loved ones of all those who have been called to \nduty in the battle zones of Iraq and Afghanistan. We cannot fill the \nempty chair at the table, but we can offer an abundance of love and \nsupport for our neighbors and friends whose lives have been upended by \nthe war, and we can pray most fervently that our troops will be \nreturned home quickly, and that their families will not have to endure \nanother Thanksgiving without them.\n  Praise Almighty God for His kindness, His love, His mercy. Thank Him.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11606-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11606-S11607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATING THE CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National American \nIndian Heritage Month, an important celebration that acknowledges the \ntremendous contributions of native peoples to our Nation.\n  In 1990, President George H. W. Bush approved a joint resolution \ndesignating November 1990 ``National American Indian Heritage Month.'' \nThe origins of this celebration, however, can be traced back to 1915, \nwhen the Annual Congress of the American Indian Association directed \nits president to call upon the Nation to observe a day honoring Native \nAmericans. In 1916, New York became the first State to declare an \nofficial American Indian Day.\n  Over the years, our Nation has moved toward a greater appreciation of \nthe role of native peoples in American cultural, social, political, and \neconomic life. This is reflected not only in the celebrations around \nthe country associated with National American Indian Heritage Month, \nbut also by the opening of the Museum of the American Indian as part of \nthe Smithsonian Institution earlier this year.\n  As we celebrate the rich heritage and continuing contributions of \nnative peoples this month, it is also important to acknowledge the \nchallenges that many native communities face today. As a member of the \nIndian Affairs Committee, I am all too familiar with these challenges, \nand I believe we must empower native communities so every member can \nreach his or her full potential. That means respecting the sovereignty \nof tribes, strengthening education, improving health care, and \nenhancing economic opportunities for native peoples.\n  I look forward to working on these issues in the 109th Congress, and \nI hope my colleagues will join me in celebrating National American \nIndian Heritage Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11607-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JUAN GABRIEL\n\n  Mr. REID.

He \nhas entertained sold-out audiences throughout the world, and last \nSunday--November 14, 2004--he played to an energetic and enthusiastic \ncrowd at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas.\n  Juan has sold more than 30 million copies of his own albums.

Burgess\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the United States of America was founded on \na passion for freedom, personal liberties, and equality for all its \ncitizens. In a fierce battle for freedom and independence, the citizens \nof this new world cast off the shackles of tyranny and built for \nthemselves a land of hope and promise. So fervently held were the \nbeliefs and ideals of this country, that a son of New Hampshire, GEN \nJohn Stark, reminded us of the price of our liberties with his \nadmonishment to ``Live free or die.'' The heroes and Founding Fathers \nof that long ago time have been joined by another noble son of New \nHampshire, SP Alan J. Burgess of Landaff. It is in his memory that I \nrise today to honor Alan for his service and supreme sacrifice in the \ncontinuing defense of this country and for his relentless defense of \nfreedom.\n  Specialist Burgess demonstrated a willingness and dedication to serve \nand defend his country by joining the National Guard after this country \nwas attacked in September 2001, and we had begun the task of destroying \nthe enemies of our country. Just as many of America's heroes have taken \nup arms in the face of dire threats, Alan too dedicated himself to the \ndefense of our ideals, values, freedoms, and way of life. His valor and \nservice cost him his life but earned him a place on the rollcall of \nhonor within the pantheon of heroes this country has produced.\n  Following basic training, Alan joined his comrades in 2nd Battalion, \n197th Field Artillery Brigade, Army National Guard as a Military \nPoliceman and began training for his deployment to Iraq in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. From this unit's home base in Woodsville, NH, \nhe would deploy in March 2004 to Iraq in pursuit of those who would \nthreaten our way of life.\n  During his all too brief career, Alan accumulated a significant list \nof accolades and experiences which testify to the dedication and \ndevotion he held for the Army, his fellow soldiers, and his country. \nAlan's expertise contributed greatly to his unit's successes and \ncemented his place as a participant in the great endeavor known as \nAmerica. Alan was recognized for his service by the Bronze Star Medal, \nthe Purple Heart Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense \nService Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, and the \nArmy Reserve Overseas Service Ribbon.\n  I offer Alan's family my deepest sympathies and most heartfelt thanks \nfor the service, sacrifice, and example of their soldier, SP Alan \nBurgess. Alan exemplified the words of Daniel Webster who said, ``God \ngrants liberty only to those who love it, and are always ready to guard \nand defend it.'' Because of his efforts, the liberty of this country is \nmade more secure.\n\n[[Page S11608]]\n\n                         Corporal Kevin Dempsey\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in memory of Cpl Kevin J. \nDempsey, of Monroe, CT, who was killed in Iraq this past Saturday, \nNovember 13, 2004 at the age of 23.\n  Corporal Dempsey served with the 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, 2nd \nMarine Expeditionary Force, based out of Camp Lejeune, NC. He died in \nan explosion in the Al-Anbar province in Western Iraq. He had been in \nIraq for only 3 months, and was sent there shortly after finishing a \ntour of duty in Haiti.\n  Although Corporal Dempsey's given name was Kevin, he was known to his \nfamily and friends as Jack Dempsey, after the famous boxing champion. \nKevin Dempsey truly was a fighter. At New Canaan High School, he \nwrestled and played for the football team, and was known for playing \nthrough injuries. Kevin was also a young man who would stand up for his \nfellow students, and help them out when they were in need.\n  According to Corporal Dempsey's friends, he and the Marines were a \nperfect match. An individual known for his toughness and steadfast \ndedication found a branch of the Armed Forces with a reputation for \nthose same traits. Corporal Dempsey brought to the battlefields of Iraq \nthe same determination that he took to the wrestling mat. He loved his \ncountry, and he loved the U.S. Marines.\n  Kevin Dempsey had considered enlisting in the Marines since he \ngraduated from high school. But his decision became final after the \nattacks of September 11, 2001. Like so many others across this Nation, \nhe resolved on that day to do what he could to defend our Nation. He \ncalled his recruiter at noon on that day and said he was ready to sign \nup.\n  With each passing day we hear news out of Iraq about brave American \nmen and women who have lost their lives fighting there. As the toll \nrises, it is critical for us to remember that our soldiers overseas are \neach individual young men and women, each with their own families, \ntheir own reasons for serving, and their own stories. I have told one \nstory today, but there are, many others. Let us do our best to keep \nthose stories in mind, and let us keep heroes like Kevin Dempsey and \nhis family in our thoughts and prayers, particularly as we approach the \nholiday season.\n  I offer my deepest sympathies to Corporal Dempsey's mother, Barbara, \nto his sister Jennifer, and to all who knew and loved him.\n\n\n                 chief warrant officer william brennan\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to CWO Brennan, a native of \nBethlehem, CT, who was killed in Iraq last month. CWO Brennan died at \nthe age of 36 when his Bell helicopter went down over Baghdad on \nOctober 16, 2004.\n  William Brennan came from a family and community steeped in military \ntradition. His father Nicholas was a Navy commander during the Second \nWorld War. His uncle was a bomber pilot during World War II and the \nKorean War. And his godfather was a pilot who served in Vietnam.\n  With those influences, it comes as no surprise that William Brennan, \nknown to his friends and family as Will, dreamed from a young age of \nflying a plane. It wasn't an easy career path for William; in fact, the \nfirst time he applied to Army flight school, his application was tossed \nin the garbage after an Army official accidentally spilled coffee on \nit. But through persistence and perseverance, William Brennan realized \nhis dream.\n  William Brennan's military resume is one of which any soldier would \nbe proud. His career in the Army spanned 15 years. In addition to his \nservice in Iraq, he served as part of the peacekeeping mission led by \nthe United States in Bosnia. And shortly after the attacks of September \n11th, he flew surveillance flights over New York City.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Brennan was proud of his service, and was proud \nof his family as well. He and his wife Kathy, who met while they were \nboth stationed at Fort Drum, New York, were the parents of two girls, \nKaitlin and Cassidy. In fact, William's greatest concerns leaving for \nIraq were not about the danger he would face, but about the wife and \ndaughters he was leaving behind.\n  Next week we will be celebrating the holiday of Thanksgiving, and in \nanother month, we will encounter the traditional winter holidays. Most \nof us will be gathering together with our families and giving thanks \nfor all that we have. On these occasions, let us also remember families \nlike William Brennan's, who have lost loved ones over this past year in \nplaces like Iraq and Afghanistan. Let us remember them, and do what we \ncan to offer them a helping hand, or a shoulder to cry on, during what \nis surely a difficult time of year.\n  I offer my deepest sympathies to Kathy Brennan, to Kaitlin and \nCassidy, to William's brothers and sisters, and their entire family.\n\n\n                       Lance Corporal James Swain\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Kokomo, \nIN. LCpl James Swain, 20 years old, died on November 15th. When his \nunit was faced with determining who among them would go to Iraq, James \nvolunteered--a selfless choice that would cost him his life. James was \nshot while conducting combat operations in the Al Anbar province of \nIraq. With his entire life before him, James risked everything to fight \nfor the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway \naround the world.\n  After graduating from Kokomo High School in 2002, James followed a \nlong-standing family tradition by joining the Armed Forces. His father \nDan told the Kokomo Tribune that James had always enjoyed hearing \nstories of his days as an Army medic. However, James chose the path of \nhis grandfather, who had also been a marine. According to friends and \nloved ones, James was born to serve and had touched many lives with his \nservice and his generous spirit. He had dreams of continuing to help \nhis country by becoming a criminal profiler for the CIA or FBI.\n  James was the 39th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the Headquarters \nBattalion, 1st Marines, Regimental Combat Team-1, 1st Marine Division, \nCamp Pendleton, CA. This brave young soldier leaves behind his parents, \nDan and Mona Swain; his grandfather, Edward Swain; his brother, \nBenjamin Swain; and his sisters, Mary Ann and Melissa Swain.\n  Today, I join James' family, his friends, and the entire Hoosier \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nJames, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  James was known for his dedication to serving others and his love of \nfamily and country. When looking back on James' life, Charlie Hall, a \nformer coach at Kokomo High School, told the Kokomo Tribune, ``Anything \nhe tried, he did to the fullest. He did well. I think it says a lot \nabout the quality of our service people if there are people like James \nserving.'' His high school principal Harold Canady remembered him by \nsaying, ``James was an outstanding young man . . . The best way I can \ndescribe him is that he is the all-American boy. He chose to serve his \ncountry and was willing to make that sacrifice.'' Today and always, \nJames will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers \nas a true American hero and we honor the sacrifice he made while \ndutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring James' sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of James' actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of James Swain in the official \nrecord of the Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment\n\n[[Page S11609]]\n\nto freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think about this just cause in \nwhich we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss \nof our heroes, I hope that families like James' can find comfort in the \nwords of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in \nvictory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with James.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11609-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRUTH IN TRIALS ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Federal Government has a long-\nstanding obligation to monitor the purity, safety, and effectiveness of \nthe medicines that are available to the public. For this reason, I \nwould like to express my opposition to S. 2989, the Truth in Trials \nAct. This legislation reverses almost 100 years of progress that we \nhave made by undermining any scientific evidence about medicine and \nreplacing it with popular referendums passed by slick ad campaigns.\n  There was a time in this country when individuals and businesses \ncould market anything as a medicine and make any claim for its \neffectiveness. Because of this, a flood of narcotics and stimulants \nwere freely marketed as nostrums sold over the counter and through the \nmail. Often these ``miracle cures'' were miscellaneous concoctions made \nfrom unknown ingredients. In addition, these nostrums were often \naccompanied by endless testimonials from satisfied customers on how \nwell these products performed.\n  Thankfully, our grandparents and great-grandparents, who had to deal \nwith these practices, woke up to the fraud that was being perpetrated \non the public by these ``snake-oil salesmen.'' These dangerous drugs \nwere creating a major addiction problem, and the unknown ingredients in \nthese cures were actually doing a great deal of harm. In response to \ndemands from the public, truth in labeling was born.\n  Consumers in the early 1900s took steps to ban dangerous drugs to \ndetermine what drugs had medical uses that could be demonstrated to be \nsafe and effective. Based on this experience, the Pure Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act, FDCA, of 1906 was passed, which required food and \nmedicines be pure, and the contents of medicines be labeled. In 1938, \nthe FDCA was amended to add the requirement that all medicines be safe, \nand the Food and Drug Administration was created to regulate this. In \n1962, the FDCA was further amended by the Harris-Kefauver amendment, \nwhich added an additional requirement that any medicine must also be \neffective, and further required the FDA to establish efficacy \nstandards.\n  Furthermore, a variety of laws were passed to deal with the \ndistribution of dangerous drugs. The first of these was the Harrison \nNarcotics Control Act of 1914. The next major piece of legislation on \ndrug control was the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937. These and other laws \ncovering various types of drugs were replaced in 1970 when the \nControlled Substances Act was signed into law. This Act further defined \nthe process that a substance had to go through to become an acceptable \nmedicine. In addition, a five-tier scheduling system for all \npharmacological substances was established, allowing for the \ncategorizing of all medicines and other pharmacological substances \nbased on their abuse potential and accepted use as a medicine.\n  Unfortunately, this does not mean that we will no longer have \nunscrupulous business enterprises that promise salvation through snake-\noil products. Over the past 60 years, the FDA has developed a careful, \nproven method for testing and approving drugs. This process is \nthe standard by which the rest of the world measures the safety and \neffectiveness of their drug approval system.\n\n  Americans today have the world's safest, most effective system of \nmedical practice, built on a process of scientific research, testing, \nand oversight that is unequaled. Every drug prescribed as medicine in \nthis country must be tested according to scientifically rigorous \nprotocols to ensure that it is safe and effective before it can be \nsold.\n  To this date, over 15,000 scientific, peer-reviewed studies into the \nmedicinal value of marijuana have been published, and not one \ndemonstrates that smoking marijuana has any medicinal value for any \ncondition. In fact, there is medical evidence to suggest that marijuana \nmay actually aggravate some of the conditions it is supposed treat.\n  On top of all that, there are legal, effective medicines that are \nalready currently available and meet all of the guidelines that have \nbeen established by the FDA. This includes Marinol, which is a legally \navailable, FDA-approved form of a marijuana extract that is currently \nbeing used as a treatment for nausea and AIDS wasting syndrome. In \naddition, there are many other medicines that have been developed and \nreceived FDA approval that do not have the hallucinogenic side effects \nthat come with smoking marijuana. These are medicines that meet \nscientific standards and do not rely on anecdotes and testimony for \nvalidation.\n  Certainly, we all want to provide relief for people who are sick and \ndying, but smoking marijuana has not been scientifically proven to have \nany medicinal value. By allowing patients and caregivers to use and \nprovide marijuana through the political process, we clearly bypass the \nsafeguards established by the FDA to protect the public from dangerous \nor ineffective drugs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and other \nefforts to legalize marijuana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11609-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11609-S11614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUSTICE FOR ALL ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last month, the House and Senate \noverwhelmingly approved H.R. 5107, the Justice for All Act of 2004. \nThis important criminal justice package includes the Innocence \nProtection Act, a modest and practical set of reforms aimed at reducing \nthe risk of error in capital cases. I first introduced the IPA in \nFebruary 2000, and as time passed, the bipartisan coalition in support \nof this pioneering bill grew. Capping these years of effort, the \nPresident has now signed the bill into law.\n  As enacted, the Innocence Protection Act contains several key \nreforms. First, it ensures access to post-conviction DNA testing for \nthose serving time in prison or on death row for crimes they did not \ncommit. Second, it establishes a grant program to help defray the costs \nof post-conviction DNA testing. This program is named in honor of Kirk \nBloodsworth, the first death row inmate exonerated as a result of DNA \ntesting. Third, the IPA establishes rules for preserving biological \nevidence secured in the investigation or prosecution of a Federal \noffense. Fourth, it authorizes grants to States to improve the quality \nof legal representation in capital cases. Finally, it substantially \nincreases the maximum compensation that may be awarded in Federal cases \nof wrongful conviction.\n  Three weeks before the Senate approved H.R. 5107, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee wrapped up weeks of work on the Senate version of \nthe bill, S. 1700, the Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act of \n2003. The Committee voted to approve S. 1700 by a bipartisan vote of 11 \nto 7, but given time constraints and continuing negotiations, the \nCommittee did not issue a report. Nor was there a conference report on \nthe final legislation, as the Senate's acceptance of H.R. 5107 in \nsubstantially the form that it passed the House made a House-Senate \nconference unnecessary.\n  The upshot of all of this is that there is a substantial gap in the \nlegislative history of this landmark legislation. As the principal \nauthor of the Innocence Protection Act, I offer the following remarks \nto fill that gap and guide those who will be implementing and enforcing \nthese important provisions in the future.\n  I introduced S. 1700 on October 1, 2003, together with the Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, and 16 additional co-\nsponsors. On the same day, the Chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, Representative James Sensenbrenner, and 99 cosponsors \nintroduced an identical measure, H.R. 3214.\n  The bill moved swiftly through the House. On October 16, 2003, the \nHouse Judiciary Committee reported an amended version of the bill by a \nvote of 28 to 1. The few changes to the bill were largely technical, \nclarifying, or stylistic in nature, and are described in the report \naccompanying the bill to the\n\n[[Page S11610]]\n\nfull House. None of these changes affected title III of the bill, which \ncontained the Innocence Protection Act. On November 5, 2003, the House \npassed a further amended version of the bill by a vote of 357 to 67. \nThis version did include a significant change to the counsel provisions \nin title III, which I will address shortly.\n  In the Senate, the bill progressed more slowly. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee met in executive session on three occasions to consider S. \n1700. At the first of these meetings, on July 22, 2004, the committee \nadopted an amendment in the nature of a substitute which replaced the \ntext of S. 1700 with a modified version of H.R. 3214, as passed by the \nHouse.\n  The committee continued its mark-up of S. 1700 on September 9, 2004. \nThe only amendment offered during this session sought to expand on a \ntitle I provision regarding the national DNA database, and did not \naffect any provision of the Innocence Protection Act. The committee \nrejected this amendment after lengthy debate and then adjourned.\n  The committee completed its consideration of S. 1700 on September 21, \n2004. During this session, the committee rejected a total 21 \namendments, 17 of which pertained to the Innocence Protection Act.\n  Senator Cornyn offered two of the IPA-related amendments. The first \nproposed to replace the text of S. 1700 with that of S. 1828--a pared \ndown version of S. 1700 that stripped out the Innocence Protection Act \nin its entirety. The second Cornyn amendment proposed to strike an \nentire subtitle of S. 1700 dealing with competent counsel and \nsubstituting a different program that failed to require any \naccountability on the part of States accepting Federal money. The \ncommittee rejected both of these amendments by votes of 7 to 11.\n  Senator Kyl offered nine amendments to the IPA provisions regarding \npost-conviction DNA testing. Six of the amendments sought to restrict \naccess to post-conviction DNA testing in the Federal system, as by \nrequiring that any motions for such testing be filed within 5 years of \nthe bill's enactment. One amendment proposed to raise the standard for \nobtaining a new Federal trial based on exculpatory DNA evidence--\ninstead of proving that a new trial would probably result in an \nacquittal, a defendant would be put to the virtually impossible burden \nof proving that he did not commit the offense. Two of the amendments \nwould have reduced the incentive for States to adopt post-conviction \nDNA testing procedures comparable to the Federal procedures. The \ncommittee rejected all nine amendments by a vote of 7 to 10 or 7 to 11.\n\n  The other six IPA amendments, also offered by Senator Kyl, pertained \nto the IPA's requirement that Federal authorities preserve any \nbiological evidence secured in the investigation or prosecution of a \nFederal offense for as long as a defendant remained incarcerated for \nthat offense, subject to a number of practical and straightforward \nexceptions. All six amendments would have relaxed this requirement to \nsome degree, allowing for the premature destruction of biological \nevidence that could clear the innocent and identify the guilty. The \ncommittee rejected all six amendments, most by a vote of 7 to 11.\n  Having voted down all amendments to the substitute amendment, the \ncommittee approved the bill by a final vote of 11 to 7. Those voting in \nthe affirmative were myself, Chairman Hatch, and Senators Specter, \nDeWine, Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin. \nThose voting in the negative were Senators Grassley, Kyl, Sessions, \nGraham, Craig, Chambliss, and Cornyn.\n  The committee vote on September 21, 2004, was the last action taken \non S. 1700. As I discussed in a floor statement on October 7, 2004, no \nsooner had the bill been reported favorably to the full Senate than it \nwas blocked by the same Senators who had held it up in Committee, \nbuttressed by opposition from President Bush and Attorney General John \nAshcroft. As a result, the full Senate was never afforded an \nopportunity to consider S. 1700 as a free-standing bill.\n  With time running out before the congressional adjournment, the House \nacted again. On September 22, 2004, the House Judiciary Committee \napproved the text of S. 1700 as part of H.R. 5107, a larger criminal \njustice package known as the Justice For All Act of 2004. There \nfollowed several weeks of intense negotiations involving House and \nSenate sponsors of the legislation, the handful of hold-out Senators, \nand the Department of Justice. While no agreement was reached, and the \nDepartment continued to oppose the bill, the House made a number of \nchanges to the legislation to address concerns that had been raised. On \nOctober 6, 2004, the House passed a modified version of H.R. 5107 by a \nvote of 393 to 14 and sent it to the Senate. The Senate passed the bill \nthree days later by voice vote, the House made a number of enrollment \ncorrections the same day, and on October 30, 2004, President Bush \nsigned the bill into law.\n  The Justice For All Act of 2004 enhances protections for victims of \nFederal crimes, increases Federal resources available to State and \nlocal governments to combat crimes with DNA technology, and provides \nsafeguards to prevent wrongful convictions and executions.\n  Title I of the bill is the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy \nPreston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act. The \nprovisions of this title establish enhanced and enforceable rights for \ncrime victims in the Federal criminal justice system, and authorize \ngrants to help States implement and enforce their own victims' rights \nlaws.\n  Titles II and III of the bill establish the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog \nGrant Program, which authorizes $755 million over five years to address \nthe DNA backlog crisis in the nation's crime labs, and also creates \nother new grant programs to reduce forensic science backlogs, train \ncriminal justice and medical personnel in the use of DNA evidence, and \npromote the use of DNA technology to identify missing persons.\n  Title IV of the bill, the Innocence Protection Act, increases access \nto post-conviction DNA testing that may prove innocence; establishes \nthe Kirk Bloodsworth program to help defray the cost of post-conviction \nDNA testing; sets rules for preserving biological evidence secured in \nFederal criminal cases; authorizes grants to improve the quality of \nlegal representation in State capital cases; and increases compensation \nin Federal cases of wrongful conviction.\n  The Innocence Protection Act reflects years of work and intense \nnegotiation. I will now discuss its key provisions in greater detail.\n  Subtitle A of title IV enacts a new chapter in the Federal Criminal \nCode dealing with DNA testing. In little over a decade, some 153 people \nacross the country have been exonerated by this remarkable technology. \nThat number includes more than a dozen individuals who had been \nsentenced to death, some of whom came within days of being executed.\n  Post-conviction DNA testing does not merely exonerate the innocent it \ncan also solve crimes and lead to the incarceration of very dangerous \ncriminals. In case after case, DNA testing that exculpates a wrongfully \nconvicted individual also inculpates the real criminal. Just this year, \nfor example, the exoneration of Arthur Lee Whitfield in Virginia led to \nthe identification of another inmate, already serving a life sentence, \nas the true perpetrator of two rapes for which Whitfield had served 22 \nyears in prison. Last year, DNA evidence in the case of Kirk \nBloodsworth was matched to another man, a convicted sex offender who \nhas now pleaded guilty to the horrendous rape-murder that sent Mr. \nBloodsworth to Maryland's death row.\n\n  There are still numerous prisoners throughout the country whose \ntrials preceded modern DNA testing, or who did not receive pretrial \ntesting for other reasons. If history is any guide, some of these \nindividuals are innocent of any crime.\n  The new chapter 228A of title 18 is designed to ensure that Federal \nprisoners with real claims of innocence can get DNA testing of evidence \nthat could support such claims. It does this by establishing rules for \nwhen a court shall order post-conviction DNA testing--to be codified at \n18 U.S.C. Sec.  3600--and rules for when the government may dispose of \nbiological evidence--to be codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3600A.\n  Under section 3600, a court shall order DNA testing if it may produce\n\n[[Page S11611]]\n\nnew material evidence that would raise a reasonable probability that \nthe applicant did not commit the offense. This standard was the subject \nof intense negotiations, as members recognized that setting the \nstandard too low could invite frivolous applications, while setting it \ntoo high could defeat the purpose of the legislation and result in \ngrave injustice. I argued that in balancing these concerns, Congress \nshould be guided by the principle that the criminal justice system \nshould err on the side of permitting testing, in light of the low cost \nof DNA testing and the high cost of keeping the wrong person locked up. \nI am pleased that this view ultimately prevailed.\n  During the final round of negotiations on H.R. 5107--after the House \nJudiciary Committee reported the bill, and before final passage by the \nfull House--the standard for ordering a DNA test was modified in two \nrespects. First, as introduced in both the House and the Senate, \nsection 3600(a)(8) appeared to impose on applicants the virtually \nimpossible burden of showing that a DNA test ``would'' produce new \nmaterial evidence of innocence. Under section 3600(a)(8) as enacted, \napplicants need only show that a test ``may'' produce such evidence.\n  Second, the same provision was stripped of unnecessary language to \nthe effect that courts must ``assume the DNA test result excludes the \napplicant'' when considering whether DNA testing would raise a \nreasonable probability that the applicant did not commit the offense. \nSuch an assumption is already implicit, since a court could not \nreasonably assess the probability that a convicted offender was wrongly \nconvicted without weighing some new evidence of innocence, such as a \nDNA exclusion. With or without the assumption language, the question \nfor a court boils down to this: Would a DNA exclusion make it more \nlikely than not that the applicant was innocent? If so, the court \nshould order DNA testing, provided that the various technical \nrequirements set forth in section 3600(a) are met.\n  These requirements are simply stated. First, the applicant must \nassert his or her innocence under penalty of perjury. Second, the \nevidence to be tested must have been secured in relation to the \ninvestigation or prosecution of the offense. Third, the evidence must \nnot have been previously subjected to DNA testing or, if it was, the \napplicant must be requesting DNA testing using a new method or \ntechnology that is substantially more probative than the prior DNA \ntesting. If the evidence was not previously tested, the applicant must \nalso show that he did not waive the right to request DNA testing of \nthat evidence in a court proceeding after the date of enactment of the \nIPA, or knowingly fail to request DNA testing of that evidence in a \nprior motion for post-conviction DNA testing. A waiver of the right to \nrequest DNA testing must be knowing and voluntary, and will ideally be \nmade on the record and inquired into by the court before it is \naccepted.\n  Fourth, the evidence to be tested must be in the possession of the \nGovernment, subject to a chain of custody, and retained under \nconditions sufficient to ensure that it was not substituted, \ncontaminated, tampered with, replaced, or altered in any material \nrespect. Fifth, the proposed DNA testing must be reasonable in scope, \nuse scientifically sound methods, and be consistent with accepted \nforensic practices. Sixth, the applicant must identify a theory of \ndefense that is not inconsistent with an affirmative defense presented \nat trial, and that would establish the applicant's innocence. Seventh, \nthe applicant must certify that he will provide a DNA sample for \npurposes of comparison.\n  Eighth, if the applicant was convicted following a trial, the \nidentity of the perpetrator must have been at issue in the trial. If \nthe applicant was convicted following a guilty plea, this requirement \ndoes not apply. Congress rightly rejected the Justice Department's \nposition that inmates who pleaded guilty should be ineligible for DNA \ntesting in light of the many documented cases in which defendants \npleaded guilty to crimes they did not commit. Indeed, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee report in the 107th Congress on the Innocence \nProtection Act of 2002 describes four cases in which defendants pleaded \nguilty to crimes they did not commit and were later exonerated by DNA \ntests.\n  The final requirement established by section 3600 is that motions for \npost-conviction DNA testing be made ``in a timely fashion.'' Motions \nare entitled to a rebuttable presumption of timeliness if filed within \nfive years of enactment of the IPA, or three years after the \napplicant's conviction, whichever is later. Thereafter, it is presumed \nthat a motion is untimely, except upon good cause shown. As I explained \nin an earlier floor statement, the Justice Department has complained \nthat the ``good cause'' exception is so broad you could drive a truck \nthrough it, and its stubborn opposition to the IPA turned in large part \non the inclusion of this language. But while I agree that the language \nis broad, it is intentionally so; I would not agree to a presumption of \nuntimeliness that could not be rebutted in most cases. At the same \ntime, this provision should allow courts to deal summarily with the \nDepartment's hypothetical bogeyman--the guilty prisoner who ``games the \nsystem'' by waiting until the witnesses against him are dead and \nretrial is no longer possible, and only then seeking DNA testing.\n  As may be apparent from the awkwardness of the legislative language, \nthe rebuttable presumption language in section 3600 was a late and \nhastily-drafted addition to the legislation. It replaced a relatively \ngeneric requirement that motions be filed for the purpose of \ndemonstrating innocence, and not to delay the execution of the sentence \nof the administration of justice. The intention was to provide courts \nwith more specific guidance on how to weed out frivolous motions.\n  Significantly, this provision is far from the rigid three-year time \nlimit urged by the Justice Department. In rejecting a time limit, \nCongress recognized that the need for a DNA testing law is not \ntemporary. That need will likely diminish over time as pre-trial DNA \ntesting becomes more prevalent, but there will always be cases that \nfall through the cracks due to a defense lawyer's incompetence, a \ndefendant's mental illness or mental retardation, or other reasons that \nwe in Congress cannot and should not attempt to anticipate. Many of the \nindividuals who have been exonerated by post-conviction DNA testing did \nnot win freedom until many years after they were convicted and could \nstill be in prison, or executed, if an arbitrary limitations period had \nbeen applied to their requests for DNA testing.\n  In addition to the requirements I have just described, section 3600 \nprovides additional disincentives to filing false claims or trying to \n``game the system''. Test results must be disclosed simultaneously to \nthe applicant and the government. DNA submitted by the applicant will \nbe run through the national DNA database, which could conceivably \nproduce a match linking the applicant to an unsolved crime. Penalties \nare established in the event that testing inculpates the applicant. \nFurther, because an applicant's assertion of innocence must be made \nunder penalty of perjury, an applicant may be subject to prosecution \nfor perjury, as well as for making a false statement, if his assertion \nis later disproved. If convicted, the applicant is subject to a 3-year \nprison sentence, which shall run consecutively to any other term of \nimprisonment he is serving.\n  Section 3600 also establishes procedures to be followed when DNA \ntesting exculpates the applicant. A court shall grant relief if the \ntest results, when considered with all the other evidence in the case, \nestablish by compelling evidence that a new trial would result in an \nacquittal. The ``compelling evidence'' standard was another late \naddition; earlier versions of the IPA set the applicant's burden at ``a \npreponderance of the evidence.'' The point of the change, which I \nproposed, was to require courts to focus on the quality of the evidence \nsupporting an applicant's new trial motion rather than trying to \ncalculate the odds of a different verdict.\n  In setting the new trial standard in section 3600, Congress rejected \nthe Justice Department's proposal, under which an applicant would have \nto prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that he did not commit the \ncrime. That standard is substantially more demanding than the standard \nestablished for second or successive motions filed under 28 U.S.C. \nSec.  2255 based\n\n[[Page S11612]]\n\non newly discovered evidence--a remedy that is already open to Federal \ninmates with new evidence of a DNA exclusion. It would have made no \nsense for Congress to establish a more demanding new trial standard for \ncases involving a new DNA test result than for other cases involving \nnewly discovered evidence. To the contrary, because DNA testing \nconducted years and even decades after a conviction can provide a more \nreliable basis for establishing a correct verdict than any evidence \nproffered at the original trial, the standard should be and has \nappropriately been set a notch lower. This is consistent with Congress' \ndecision, in section 204 of the Justice For All Act, to toll the \nstatute of limitations in cases involving DNA evidence; both provisions \nrecognize the unique ability of DNA testing to produce scientifically \nprecise and highly probative evidence long after a crime has been \ncommitted.\n  Let me turn now to the new evidence-retention rules enacted by the \nIPA. As a general matter, section 3600A requires the preservation of \nall biological evidence secured in relation to a Federal criminal case \nfor as long as any person remains incarcerated in connection with that \ncase. But biological evidence may be destroyed--assuming that no other \nlaw requires its preservation--under certain limited circumstances, \nincluding, first, if a previous motion by the defendant for testing \npursuant to section 3600 was denied and no appeal is pending; second, \nif the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to request \nDNA testing of the evidence in a court proceeding conducted after the \ndate of enactment of the IPA; and third, if the evidence has already \nbeen tested pursuant to section 3600 and the results included the \ndefendant as the source. If the evidence is unusually large or bulky, \nor if it must be returned to its rightful owner, the government may \nremove and retain representative portions of the evidence sufficient to \npreserve the defendant's rights under section 3600.\n  Biological evidence may also be destroyed if the government notifies \neveryone who remains incarcerated in the case that the evidence may be \ndestroyed and no one requests DNA testing within 180 days of receiving \nsuch notice. It bears emphasis that this is a limited exception to the \ngeneral rule favoring preservation of biological evidence. It is not \nanticipated, nor is it anyone's intention, that prosecutors simply hand \nout standardized notices pursuant to section 3600A every time a \ndefendant is convicted. Indeed, one of the final changes made to H.R. \n5107 clarified that the defendant's conviction must be final, and the \ndefendant must have exhausted all opportunities for direct review of \nthe conviction, before a section 3600A notice may be served. Even then, \nthe better practice would be for the government to wait a number of \nyears, until the destruction of the evidence is truly imminent, before \nproviding notice.\n  In this regard, it should be noted that section 3600A does not \npreempt or supersede any law that may require evidence, including \nbiological evidence, to be preserved. Thus, if another law requires \nevidence to be retained for 10 years after conviction, the government \nshould wait at least that long before notifying the defendant that the \nevidence may be destroyed.\n  If the notice exception becomes the rule--if notices are routinely \nserved as soon as convictions become final, and evidence is routinely \ndestroyed six months later--Congress will need to revisit section \n3600A. Having rejected any time limit on motions for post-conviction \nDNA testing, Congress should not allow the government to impose a de \nfacto time limit of six months by rushing to destroy any evidence that \ncould be the subject of a motion for post-conviction DNA testing. In \nimplementing section 3600A, the government should never lose sight of \nits intended purpose, which is to ensure that biological evidence is \navailable to permit future DNA testing that may help clear the innocent \nand catch the guilty.\n  The provisions I have discussed to this point will be codified in the \nFederal Criminal Code and will have direct application to Federal cases \nand Federal defendants only. Earlier versions of the IPA recognized a \nconstitutional right of State prisoners to access biological evidence \nheld by the State for the purpose of DNA testing; as enacted, however, \nthe IPA contains no such provision. This is regrettable. As Fourth \nCircuit Judge Michael Luttig concluded in a 2002 opinion, ``A right of \naccess to evidence for tests which could prove beyond any doubt that \nthe individual in fact did not commit the crime, is constitutionally \nrequired as a matter of basic fairness.'' An inmate's interest in \npursuing his freedom--and possibly saving his life--is surely \nsufficient to outweigh any governmental interest in withholding access \nto potentially exculpatory evidence.\n  While taking no position on the constitutional question addressed by \nJudge Luttig, the IPA does encourage States that have not already done \nso to enact provisions similar to sections 3600 and 3600A. It does this \nin section 413 of subtitle A of title IV, by reserving the total amount \nof funds appropriated to carry out certain grant programs authorized in \nthe Act for States that have adopted reasonable procedures for \nproviding post-conviction DNA testing and preserving biological \nevidence.\n  It is never easy to attach strings to money that our States so \ndesperately need, but it is necessary in this instance. Ten years after \nNew York passed the nation's first post-conviction DNA testing statute, \nmany States have yet to establish a right to post-conviction DNA \ntesting, and others have erected unjustifiably high procedural hurdles \nto testing. For example, some States provide for post-conviction DNA \ntesting only if the inmate is under sentence of death, and some rely on \narbitrary and unnecessary time limits. To quote New York Attorney \nGeneral Eliot Spitzer, who testified in support of the Innocence \nProtection Act in June 2000, ``DNA testing is too important to allow \nsome States to offer no remedy to those incarcerated who may be \ninnocent of the crimes for which they were convicted.''\n\n  The IPA affords States that accept the conditioned Federal funding \nsome flexibility in crafting their DNA laws. State procedures for \nproviding post-conviction DNA testing and preserving biological \nevidence need only be ``comparable,'' not identical, to the Federal \nprocedures in sections 3600 and 3600A. This means that the procedures \nadopted by a State must, at a minimum, incorporate the core elements of \nthe Federal procedures. For example, a State post-conviction DNA \nstatute that covers only death row inmates and not inmates serving \nterms of incarceration would not be comparable to the Federal \nprocedures. Similarly, a State statute that included a time limit or \nany other provision that would systematically deny testing to whole \ncategories of prisoners who would receive testing under the Federal \nprocedures would not be comparable to those procedures and, so, would \nnot satisfy the Act.\n  When I first introduced the Innocence Protection Act in February \n2000, only a handful of States had enacted post-conviction DNA testing \nlaws. Today, a sizeable majority of States have enacted such laws, \nalthough as I already noted, the scope of these laws varies \nconsiderably. States that have already established a meaningful right \nto post-conviction DNA testing and reasonable rules for preserving \nbiological evidence should not be required to change their laws as a \ncondition of receiving Federal funds, and the IPA does not require \nthis. Section 413 includes a ``grandfather clause'' that should cover \nmany of the States that enacted DNA laws before enactment of the IPA, \nmaking them immediately eligible for the conditioned grant money. Not \nevery State DNA law meets the terms of the grandfather clause, however, \nand the Justice Department should take great care in scrutinizing the \nlaws of any State claiming its protection.\n  Post-conviction DNA testing is an essential safeguard that can save \ninnocent lives when the trial process has failed to uncover the truth. \nBut it would be neither just nor sensible to enact a law that merely \nexpanded access to DNA testing. It would not be just because innocent \npeople should not have to wait for years after trial to be exonerated \nand freed. It would not be sensible because society should not have to \nwait for years to know the truth. When innocent people are convicted \nand the guilty are permitted to walk free, any meaningful reform effort \nmust consider the root causes of these wrongful convictions and take \nsteps to address them. That is why subtitle B of title IV addresses \nwhat all\n\n[[Page S11613]]\n\nthe statistics and evidence show is the single most frequent cause of \nwrongful convictions inadequate defense representation at trial.\n  Subtitle B was enacted against the backdrop of a shameful record of \nfailure by many States to provide competent lawyers to indigent \ndefendants facing the death penalty. Testimony in both the Senate and \nHouse Judiciary Committees revealed that of the 38 States that \nauthorize capital punishment, very few have established effective \nstatewide systems for identifying, appointing and compensating \ncompetent lawyers in capital cases.\n  Too often individuals facing the ultimate punishment are represented \nby lawyers who are drunk, sleeping, soon-to-be disbarred or just plain \nineffective. Even the best lawyers in these systems are hampered by \ninadequate compensation and insufficient resources to investigate and \ndevelop a meaningful defense.\n  The Congress acted to remedy several major problems with the capital \ncounsel appointment process. First, in many States the appointment of \nindigent counsel in criminal cases is a county-by-county \nresponsibility. Unless a State legislature or court system adopts \nstandards, each county is left to decide who is competent to represent \ncriminal defendants and how much they should be paid. In smaller and \nless affluent counties where there is not a professional public \ndefender system, the compensation rate for this service can be \nshockingly low and the quality of lawyers abysmal. This problem \nafflicts the indigent defense system in general, but is more acute in \ncapital cases which are more complex and time consuming, and where the \nstakes are higher.\n  Second, in addition to the fiscal constraints on individual counties \nthere are political pressures that make it difficult for well-meaning \nadministrators to pay appointed lawyers a reasonable rate for their \nservices. Criminal defendants are highly unpopular recipients of \ngovernment largess, and accused murderers even less so. The Sixth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that defendants be afforded \neffective representation at State expense, but efforts to invoke the \nSixth Amendment to generate systemic change in State indigent defense \nsystems have been largely unavailing.\n  A third major problem is that in almost all States, the appointment \nof capital defense lawyers is made by the trial judge rather than by an \nindependent appointing authority. State trial judges, who are often \nelected officeholders, find themselves under political and \nadministrative pressure to appoint lawyers unlikely to mount a \nvigorous, time-consuming or expensive defense.\n\n  Several States--including North Carolina and New York have--acted in \nrecent years to establish statewide systems to deliver effective \nrepresentation. North Carolina, for example, has established a \ncentralized, independent appointing authority known as the Indigent \nDefense Services Commission. The Commission appoints a statewide \nCapital Defender who is accountable to the Commission but not \naccountable to the judiciary or to the political branches of \ngovernment. The Capital Defender compiles and maintains a roster of \nprivate lawyers and public defenders who are qualified to try capital \ncases. The Capital Defender appoints two defense lawyers for each \ncapital defendant. He may appoint himself and his staff, or he may \nappoint lawyers from the roster. The trial judge has no role whatsoever \nin the appointment of counsel. Congress viewed the North Carolina \nsystem as a national model for establishing an effective capital \ncounsel system.\n  Section 421 of the new law authorizes a grant program, to be \nadministered by the Attorney General, to improve the quality of legal \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants in State capital cases. \nGrants shall be used to establish, implement, or improve an effective \nsystem for providing competent legal representation in capital cases, \nbut may not be used to fund representation in specific cases.\n  In earlier versions of the Innocence Protection Act, I had proposed \nto condition certain State defenses in habeas corpus actions on the \nState's establishment of an effective system for appointing capital \ncounsel. In this manner, all capital States would have a strong \nincentive to improve their appointment systems, not merely those States \nthat choose to apply for Federal funds. While this more ambitious \nproposal was not adopted, it is my intention that the grant program be \nadministered in a manner that ensures meaningful improvements in this \nvital State function. Congress did not create this program to support \nexisting death penalty systems in the States but rather to leverage \nneeded improvements.\n  Under the new law, an effective system is one in which a public \ndefender program or other entity establishes qualifications for \nattorneys who may be appointed to represent indigents in capital cases; \nestablishes and maintains a roster of qualified attorneys and assigns \nattorneys from the roster; trains and monitors the performance of such \nattorneys; and ensures funding for the full cost of competent legal \nrepresentation by the defense team and any outside experts.\n  The Act's definition of an effective system evolved from standards \ndeveloped by the American Bar Association and adopted by other \nstandard-setting bodies and commissions, such as the Constitution \nProject's blue-ribbon commission on capital punishment. Ideally, the \nentity that identifies and appoints defense lawyers will be independent \nof the political branches of State government, as are the authorities \nin North Carolina and New York. For example, the Act explicitly states \nthat sitting prosecutors may not serve on the appointing entity. The \nunderlying purpose of the scheme is to help insulate the appointment \nprocess from the political pressures that make it difficult for \nindividual trial judges to appoint competent lawyers in individual \ncases.\n  In the course of negotiations to pass the bill in the House last \nyear, I and other sponsors of the bill reluctantly agreed to accept an \namendment, now section 421(e)(1)(C) of the Act, that has come to be \ndescribed as ``the Texas carve-out.'' Under this provision, a State may \nqualify for a capital representation improvement grant if it has \nadopted and substantially complies with a State statutory procedure \nenacted before this Act under which the trial judge is required to \nappoint qualified attorneys from a roster maintained by a State or \nregional selection committee or similar entity.\n  In fact, the ``Texas carve-out'' is not a carve-out at all. It simply \nacknowledges that Texas is in the process of implementing a recent \nstatewide reform law, the Fair Defense Act of 2001, and should be \npermitted to continue that process. If Texas is awarded a Federal grant \nit will still be required to improve its capital counsel appointment \nsystem, but Federal authorities will measure those improvements against \nstandards in the 2001 Texas law.\n  Texas is not yet living up to the promise of the Fair Defense Act. A \nNovember 2003 report by the Equal Justice Center and the Texas Defender \nService demonstrates that many Texas counties have failed to establish \neffective roster systems for identifying qualified lawyers and fail to \nprovide reasonable compensation to capital counsel. If Texas accepts \nFederal funds under this new program, it will be required to live up to \nits own State standards, including the all-important requirement of \nreasonable compensation. The TDS report should be a guidepost for \nneeded improvements.\n  It is conceivable that other States will qualify for consideration \nunder section 421(e)(1)(C) but the provision should be strictly \ninterpreted by grant administrators. The State law must have been \nenacted prior to enactment of the Innocence Protection Act, the trial \njudge must be required to make appointments from a roster of qualified \nlawyers, and the roster must be maintained by the State, a regional \nselection committee or a similar agency that is independent of the \ntrial court. Congress was aware that the trial courts in many States \nmaintain rosters from which lawyers may be chosen, but that is not the \nsort of rigorous quality control mechanism that section 421(e)(1)(C) \nrequires.\n\n  States that establish an effective system under section 421(e)(1)(A) \nor (B) must compensate lawyers in accordance with section \n421(e)(2)(F)(ii). That provision requires, among other things, that \npublic defenders be compensated\n\n[[Page S11614]]\n\naccording to a salary scale commensurate with the salary scale of the \nprosecutor's office in the jurisdiction. This requirement parallels the \nrequirement that capital representation improvement grants are to be \ndivided evenly between the defense and prosecution functions. In \nenacting the IPA, Congress generally approved of the concept of \nresource parity between the defense and the prosecution, a concept that \nis essential to ensuring fair trials in our adversarial system of \njustice.\n  Another important requirement concerning attorney compensation \nappears in section 421(e)(2)(F)(ii)(II) which states that appointed \nattorneys be compensated ``for actual time and service, computed on an \nhourly basis and at a reasonable hourly rate in light of the \nqualifications and experience of the attorney and the local market for \nlegal representation in cases reflecting the complexity and \nresponsibility of capital cases.'' Again, this concept is drawn from \nthe American Bar Association standards, which should be consulted by \ngrant administrators in implementing the program. This new statutory \nrequirement would clearly preclude a participating State from \ncompensating attorneys under a flat fee or capped fee system, because \nsuch a system would not compensate the attorney for ``actual time and \nservices, computed on an hourly basis.''\n  Moreover, the term ``reasonable hourly rate'' must be taken seriously \nby those who administer the new program. For example, there is general \nagreement among experts that the Federal compensation rate of $125 per \nhour is reasonable in most parts of the country.\n  In my view, a State rate comparable to the Federal rate should be \nconsidered ``reasonable,'' taking into account differences in the cost \nof living in various parts of the country. Capital cases are among the \nmost complex, high stakes cases tried in any courthouse, and the \nlawyers who represent defendants in such cases should be paid at a rate \ncomparable to that earned by other lawyers engaged in similarly \nimportant litigation.\n  One recent modification of section 421 would make clear that sitting \nprosecutors may not be members of the appointing authority established \nunder section 421(e)(1)(B), although others with expertise in capital \ncases may participate. I agree that under this new language members of \nthe judiciary may be members of the authority. On the other hand it \nwould be impermissible for the appointing authority to delegate its \nauthority to trial judges or to a group of trial judges. Such a \ndelegation would defeat one of the central goals of the Act, which was \nto insulate the appointment power from the political and administrative \npressures on trial judges.\n  As part of the same program established in section 421, section 422 \nauthorizes grants to improve the representation of the public in State \ncapital cases. Grants shall be used to design and implement training \nprograms for capital prosecutors; develop, implement, and enforce \nappropriate standards and qualifications for such prosecutors and \nassess their performance; establish programs under which prosecutors \nconduct a systematic review of cases in which a defendant is sentenced \nto death in order to identify cases in which post-conviction DNA \ntesting is appropriate; and assist the families of murder victims.\n  A key limitation on these prosecution grants is that they may not be \nused ``to fund, directly or indirectly, the prosecution of specific \ncapital cases.'' Consistent with the IPA's overarching goal of ensuring \nthat capital punishment is carried out in a fair and reliable manner, \nthese grants should be used to establish and improve systems within \nprosecutor offices to minimize errors and abuses that may lead to \nwrongful convictions. They may not be used to hire additional capital \nprosecutors.\n  Section 423 establishes requirements for States applying for grants \nunder this subtitle, including a long-term strategy and detailed \nimplementation plan that reflects consultation with the judiciary, the \norganized bar, and State and local prosecutor and defender \norganizations, and establishes as a priority improvement in the quality \nof trial-level representation of indigents charged with capital crimes \nand trial-level prosecution of capital crimes in order to enhance the \nreliability of capital trial verdicts.\n  In the case of a State that relies on a statutory procedure described \nin section 421(e)(1)(C), the Texas-related provision I have previously \ndiscussed, a State officer must certify that the State is in compliance \nwith State law. But such a certification should not be considered \ndispositive--Federal grant administrators must still assess the State's \ncompliance with State law. Thus, the certification does not obviate the \nneed for the Inspector General to carry out an independent assessment \nof the State's compliance under section 425(a)(3).\n\n  Section 424 requires States receiving funds under this subtitle to \nsubmit an annual report to the Attorney General identifying the \nactivities carried out with the funds and explaining how each activity \ncomplies with the terms and conditions of the grant.\n  Section 425 directs the Inspector General of the Department of \nJustice to submit periodic reports to the Attorney General evaluating \nthe compliance of each State receiving funds under this subtitle with \nthe terms and conditions of the grant. In conducting such evaluations, \nthe Inspector General shall give priority to States at the highest risk \nof noncompliance. If, after receiving a report from the Inspector \nGeneral, the Attorney General finds that a State is not in compliance, \nthe Attorney General shall take a series of steps to bring the State \ninto compliance and report to Congress on the results.\n  Section 425(a)(4) provides an opportunity for public comment during \nthe Inspector General's review. This provision is not intended to \npreclude a member of the public from seeking any other available legal \nremedy after the Attorney General has made a final determination of \nwhether a State is in compliance with the requirements of the statute.\n  A special rule is provided in section 425(f) to ensure that any State \nrelying on the Texas-related provision in section 421 is, in fact, \ncomplying with its own State law. Under the special rule, if the \nInspector General determines that the State is not in compliance, \nFederal funds that would have otherwise been available to the \nprosecution function shall be used solely for the defense function. A \nseparate determination by the Attorney General is not required to \ntrigger this special rule.\n  Section 426 authorizes $75 million a year for 5years to carry out \nthis subtitle. States receiving grants under this subtitle shall \nallocate the funds equally between the programs established in sections \n421 and 422, subject to the special rule in section 425(f) that I just \ndescribed.\n  The Justice For All Act is the most significant step we have taken in \nmany years to improve the quality of justice in this country. The \nreforms it enacts will create a fairer system of justice, where the \nproblems that have sent innocent people to death row are less likely to \noccur, where the American people can be more certain that violent \ncriminals are caught and convicted instead of the innocent people who \nhave been wrongly put behind bars for their crimes, and where victims \nand their families can be more certain of the accuracy, and finality, \nof the results. Once again, I thank my colleagues in both bodies who \nworked hard to resolve conflicts and congratulate them on this \nlegislative achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11614-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11614-S11615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to address a topic we have all \nbeen contemplating lately, one important to the American people, and \none that I hope we will address in the 109th Congress, tax \nsimplification and reform.\n  As we begin to put our ideas together to simplify Federal income \ntaxes for American individuals, families and small businesses, we \nshould be careful not to remove incentives for investment. While many \ninvestment opportunities exist today, perhaps none provides more \nbenefits for individuals, families and communities than the purchase of \na home. That is why we must continue to allow taxpayers to deduct the \ninterest paid on home loans from their Federal income taxes.\n  The mortgage interest deduction is a vital component of our Tax Code. \nAfter State taxes, it is the most common deduction. The tax savings \nindividuals\n\n[[Page S11615]]\n\nand families receive from financing a home factor strongly into the \neconomic decision people make to buy a house or apartment. In fact, \nstudies have shown that the deduction is critical to young families \ntrying to become homeowners.\n  According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the average homeowner \nhas $121,000 in net equity in their home, which represents half of \ntheir net worth. Equity in a home is not only a major source of \nhousehold wealth, but it can also be leveraged to finance goals such as \nhigher education or startup costs for a small business. Children of \nhomeowners are better educated, less likely to drop out of school, and \nless likely to be arrested. For these reasons and more, people often \ntell me that buying their house or apartment is the best investment \nthey have ever made for themselves and their family.\n  Benefits also extend beyond the homeowner. Due to positive social \neffects, promoting homeownership has been a bipartisan public policy \nobjective in this country since the 1930s. Regardless of income or \nother factors, homeowners are more likely to vote, a critical activity \nto the health of democracy. Studies have shown that municipalities with \nhigher homeownership rates spend more on schools and streets and less \non social welfare. Homeowners have a direct stake in the quality of \ntheir neighborhoods, work harder to make their community a good place \nto live, driving out crime, drugs and blight, and attracting investment \nin cultural, retail and commercial development.\n  Our Nation's homeownership rate reached a record 69.2 percent in the \nsecond quarter of this year. The number of homeowners reached 73.4 \nmillion, the most ever. And for the first time, minority homeownership \nrose above 50 percent. Despite this success, however, homeownership \nopportunities are not equally available to everyone. For example, while \nminority homeownership rates have increased, Hispanics and African-\nAmericans still lag significantly behind non-Hispanic whites and Asian-\nAmericans.\n  As we bring the 108th Congress to a close, I urge my colleagues to \ngive careful thought to America's longstanding tradition of encouraging \nhomeownership. With prudent tax polices we can continue to help \ncitizens on the path to homeownership and in pursuit of the American \nDream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11615-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11615-S11617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRAVEL TO THE UNITED KINGDOM, SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO, AND ITALY\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, earlier this week, I returned from \ntravel to England, Serbia and Montenegro, and Italy, where I joined \nSenator Gordon Smith, Senator Mike DeWine, Senator Chuck Grassley and \nSenator Mike Enzi as members of the Senate delegation to the fall \nsession of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.\n  We first spent time in London to discuss our bilateral relationship \nand issues impacting transatlantic relations. We met with Prime \nMinister Tony Blair and his Chief of Staff, Jonathan Powell. We also \nvisited with Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Jack Straw, as well \nas Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Michael Ancram and \nShadow Secretary for International Development Alan Duncan.\n  I was glad to have the opportunity to meet with the Atlantic \nPartnership. The Atlantic Partnership is a network of experts from both \nEurope and the United States who are willing to use their influence to \nfurther European-American relations. The Atlantic Partnership's role is \nto argue for setting major policy decisions in the context of their \nimpact on transatlantic relations, within the context of strengthening \nthe transatlantic relationship.\n  Fresh off the heels of the elections in the United States, British \nofficials and representatives of nongovernmental organizations were \ninterested in discussing the election results and the President's \nrelationship with the United Kingdom and the European Union. Some \nexpressed concern about the state of these relationships, and they also \ndiscussed some of the unhappiness in Great Britain with the war in \nIraq. They stressed the need to work in greater cooperation, and \nindicated that the United States and Europe should look for areas where \nwe share a common cause to tackle issues of concern, such as the \npromotion of democracy and peace in the Middle East, consolidating \ngains in Afghanistan, and peace and security and a viable self-\ngovernment in Iraq.\n  With the rapidly declining health of Palestinian leader Yasser \nArafat, we also spent a great deal of time discussing the Middle East \npeace process and prospects for moving forward with a settlement \nbetween Israelis and Palestinians. There was general consensus that it \nis important to make progress in the Middle East in order to help \nstabilize the region. In my view, success in Iraq is critical to this \nprocess.\n  Our time in London underscored the critical work that our diplomatic \ncorps is doing as we move forward with efforts to promote stability and \nsecurity in Iraq and Afghanistan, and as we continue to fight the \nglobal war on terror. We must continue to place a great deal of \nemphasis on efforts to strengthen our transatlantic relationships. \nSeveral British officials made it clear that the country must extend \nthe olive branch and put a new face on diplomacy.\n  Great Britain is, and will continue to be, a vital ally in the war \nagainst terror, and the United States must continue to maintain strong \nrelations with the country. An important aspect of this relationship is \na strong representative of the United States Government in London. I am \nhopeful that the President will soon appoint a new U.S. ambassador to \nthe United Kingdom, who will be a strong advocate for U.S. policy and \nhelp convey to the British people the important work that their country \nis doing as a key ally in Iraq, Afghanistan and other parts of the \nworld.\n  I now have a better understanding of the United States' perception in \nthe world and our need to continue to engage with our European allies \nin our diplomatic process. As the Scottish poet Robert Burns wrote, \n``Oh, that God would give us the very smallest of gifts, to be able to \nsee ourselves as others see us.''\n  Following our time in London, we traveled to Kosovo and Serbia and \nMontenegro. We stopped in Pristina, where we were greeted by Phil \nGoldberg, who is Chief of Mission of the U.S. Office in Pristina. We \nwere also welcomed by Brigadier General Tod Carmony of Ohio, who serves \nas the Commander of Task Force Falcon, the American contingent of one \nof four brigades in the NATO Kosovo mission. I was glad to have the \nchance to spend time at Camp Bondsteel visiting with the nearly 1,000 \nmembers of the Ohio National Guard who are serving as part of KFOR \nunder General Carmony's command. Their work is critical to the security \nin the region. As former Governor of the State of Ohio, I am pleased \nthat the Department of Defense has so much faith in the Ohio National \nGuard that they have put them in charge of the U.S. contingent of the \nKFOR mission.\n  This was my fourth visit to Kosovo since the end of the military \ncampaign in 1999. I was particularly anxious to assess the situation on \nthe ground following the violence that erupted on March 17, 2004, which \nclaimed 20 lives, displaced more than 4,000 people, including Kosovo \nSerbs, Ashkalia and others, and resulted in the destruction of more \nthan 900 homes and 30 churches and monasteries belonging to the Serbian \nOrthodox Church--adding to the more than 100 churches that had already \nbeen destroyed during the previous five years.\n  After the violence broke out, I was on the phone with the State \nDepartment, particularly Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs \nMarc Grossman, demanding that the United States step up its efforts to \nstabilize the region. During the last several years, I have continued \nto call on U.S. officials and members of the international community to \nenhance efforts in Kosovo. As the events in mid-March demonstrated, \nsignificant challenges remain. The death and destruction that took \nplace was a tragic and urgent reminder of the work that remains to be \ndone.\n  Following the violence in March, I urged the United States and \nmembers of the international community to redouble efforts to provide a \nstable and secure environment for all people in Kosovo, and I called \nfor the resignation of the head of the U.N. Interim Administration \nMission in Kosovo, UNMIK,\n\n[[Page S11616]]\n\nHarri Holkeri. We now have a new team in place. Soren Jessen-Petersen \nreplaced Mr. Holkeri as the Head of UNMIK and the Special \nRepresentative of the U.N. Secretary General, SRSG, and U.S. Ambassador \nLarry Rossin serves as his deputy.\n  It has been my conclusion that things have not gone well in Kosovo \nbecause members of the international community, including the United \nStates, the United Nations, the European Union, and others, have not \nmade it a high priority to stabilize the long-term situation. This has \ninfluenced the performance of UNMIK and KFOR.\n  As the events in March demonstrated, we must do a better job ensuring \nthat KFOR has troops with the necessary training, equipment and \nauthority to carry out its mission. For instance, at present, only 33 \nof the 55 units in Kosovo are trained to provide crowd and riot \ncontrol, the most likely type of violence to occur. Of those 33 units, \nonly 22 have the necessary equipment to use their crowd and riot \ncontrol capabilities. This must be fixed.\n  It is also important that NATO work to remove national caveats or \nrestrictions, which determine how soldiers from certain countries are \nable to respond in times of crisis. Brigadier General Carmony assured \nme that efforts are being made to remove these caveats. I have \nrequested information on this matter, which I will continue to follow-\nup on in my capacity as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  Later in the week, after we arrived in Venice for the NATO \nParliamentary Assembly meeting, I also raised the removal of caveats \nwith Ambassador Nick Burns, who serves as our Permanent Representative \nat NATO headquarters in Brussels, and with NATO Secretary General Jaap \nde Hoop Schaeffer. It is my understanding that this is not only a \nproblem in Kosovo, but also in Afghanistan and Iraq. If NATO is \nserious, restrictions must be removed and troops given the equipment \nthey need to provide the needed security.\n  In addition to making changes within KFOR, I believe it is essential \nthat UNMIK work with Kosovo's political leaders to ensure that the \nnecessary steps are taken to secure an environment where respect for \nhuman rights and the rule of law are protected. When I met with UNMIK \nrepresentatives, I made it clear that things must improve with regard \nto the enforcement of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244. Unless we \ndo a better job, minorities will continue to leave Kosovo, and the \ninternational community will be a witness as Kosovo moves further away \nfrom becoming the free, multi-ethnic and democratic society that we \nhope will become a reality.\n  This is not an easy process, but we must take a close look at how we \ncan more effectively move forward in Kosovo. Following the March \nviolence, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan asked Norwegian Ambasador \nKai Eide to conduct a comprehensive review of the policies and \npractices of all actors in Kosovo and prepare recommendations to move \nforward. Ambassador Eide prepared this report, which includes several \npoints of consideration for UNMIK and members of the international \ncommunity.\n  In his report, Ambassador Eide recommends prosecuting those \nresponsible for the atrocities in March and completing reconstruction \nof homes and churches. He also suggests streamlining the standards \nprocess, and transferring more authority to Kosovars. Further, \nAmbassador Eide recommends granting greater control over local areas to \nthe Serbian minority, and he suggests restructuring UNMIK to ensure \nconcentration on key priorities. Ambassador Eide also calls on the \nEuropean Union to develop an economic development strategy, and he \nsuggests that the international community open a more comprehensive \ndialogue with Belgrade. Finally, Ambassador Eide recommends that NATO \nmaintain the KFOR presence to ensure a safe and secure environment.\n  In our meetings, I asked UNMIK officials and Kosovo's political \nleaders for their reaction to the Eide report. Generally, the responses \nthat I received were positive. As we consider ways to move ahead, U.S. \nofficials and members of the international community should take a \nclose look at the report prepared by Ambassador Eide and consider \nimplementing a number of his recommendations.\n  While in Pristina, we met with leaders from both the Kosovo Albanian \nand Kosovo Serb communities. We visited with President Ibrahim Rugova \nand Bajram Rexhepi, who served as prime minister until parliamentary \nelections were held in late October. It seems increasingly likely Mr. \nRexhepi will lose this position as a new government is formed.\n  I have met with Mr. Rugova and Mr. Rexhepi on several other \noccasions, including a visit to Kosovo in May 2002. At that time, I \nreiterated a plea that I made in February 2000, urging Kosovo's leaders \nto start a new paradigm of peace and stability for all people in \nKosovo. I continue to believe it is essential that minorities in \nKosovo, including Serbs, Roma, Egyptians, Bosniaks, Croats, Turks, \nAshkalia and others, are able to move about as they wish and live lives \nfree from fear. As such, though it has been more than five years since \nthe end of the NATO military campaign, I was very disappointed that \nPresident Rugova did not decry the destruction that took place on March \n17th of this year. Until Kosovo's minorities are protected, there \ncannot be consideration of final status for Kosovo.\n  We also had the opportunity to visit with Kosovo Serb leader Oliver \nIvanovic. Part of our conversation focused on the results of the \nOctober parliamentary elections, in which less than one percent of \nKosovo Serbs chose to cast ballots. Mr. Ivanovic attributed the poor \nturnout in part to mixed messages from Belgrade, as well as calls for a \nboycott from the Serbian Orthodox Church. Many Kosovo Serbs chose to \nboycott the elections because they feel their lives have not improved \nby participating in the political process. However, I believe it is \ncrucial that they re-engage, and I encouraged them to get back into the \ngovernment, take the two seats promised in cabinet, and work to improve \nthe situation for Kosovo's minorities.\n  I also encouraged Kosovo Serbs to work with Kosovo Albanian leaders \nand members of the international community to move forward with the \nreconstruction of churches and monasteries damaged or destroyed in \nMarch. The Provisional Institutions of Self-Government have committed \n4.2 million for this purpose. However, the Serbian Orthodox Church has \nwithdrawn from the commission charged with the reconstruction of \nreligious sites.\n  I believe it is important that the Serbian Orthodox Church work with \npolitical leaders in Kosovo to find a way forward that is acceptable to \nall parties to repair and rebuild cultural and religious sites. If this \ndoes not happen, it will seriously undermine efforts to move toward a \nlasting, sustainable peace in Kosovo.\n  In summary, from all of our discussions in Kosovo, as well as our \nconversations in Belgrade, it was clear that the question of Kosovo's \nfinal status is on everyone's mind. Kosovo Albanian leaders call for \nimmediate independence, while Kosovo Serb leaders argue that this is \nimpossible given the current situation for minorities in the province. \nPolitical leaders in Belgrade maintain that Kosovo remains a part of \nSerbia and Montenegro, while varied opinions exist among members of the \ninternational community. Despite different points of view, it is \nevident that there is a long road ahead as we look to guarantee \nsecurity and stability for all people in Kosovo. Until minorities are \nprotected, I believe it is very difficult to answer questions about \nKosovo's final status.\n  Following our time in Kosovo, we traveled to Belgrade, where we met \nwith U.S. Ambassador Michael Polt, Serbian President Boris Tadic, \nSerbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, President of Serbia and \nMontenegro Svetozar Marovic, Foreign Minister of Serbia and Montenegro \nVuk Draskovic, Serbia and Montenegro's Minister of Defense Prvoslav \nDavinic, and Serbia and Montenegro's Minister for Human and Minority \nRights Rasim Ljajic.\n  We had good conversations regarding positive developments in Serbia \nand Montenegro that have taken place during the more than four years \nsince Serbian voters went to the polls and removed Slobodan Milosevic \nfrom power in October 2000. Since that time, there has been \nconsiderable progress. We have worked with the Paris Club to negotiate \nfavorable terms on debt relief\n\n[[Page S11617]]\n\nfor Serbia and Montenegro. The United States has extended normal trade \nrelations (NTR), and we have continued to cultivate relations between \nWashington and Belgrade.\n  Additionally, along with my colleagues, I was thrilled to see Boris \nTadic's clear victory on June 27, 2004 to serve as the next President \nof Serbia. The significance of this development cannot be overstated. \nVoters in Serbia embraced democratic reform and European integration \nand rejected nationalism that has for too long marred the past. It \nremains my sincere hope that this is a sign of things to come in Serbia \nand Montenegro.\n  However, it is clear that challenges remain. Perhaps highest among \nthem is cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the \nformer Yugoslavia (ICTY). We made clear to Prime Minister Kostunica \nthat he must take a leadership role to ensure that indicted war \ncriminal Ratko Mladic and others are behind bars at The Hague. This is \nessential if Serbia and Montenegro hopes to move toward Europe's \ndemocratic institutions, including the European Union. It is also \ncritical if Serbia and Montenegro chooses to join NATO's Partnership \nfor Peace.\n  I have been urging Vojislav Kostunica to further cooperation with the \nWar Crimes Tribunal since he became President of Serbia in October \n2000, and I continue to call on him to take action on this matter in \nhis capacity as Serbia's Prime Minister. Thankfully, there are those in \nSerbia, including President Tadic, Foreign Minister Draskovic and \nothers, who understand the importance of ICTY cooperation and are \ntrying to make the case to the Serbian people. I am hopeful that they \nwill prevail in the end, and Serbia and Montenegro will move toward \nEuropean integration.\n  On a more positive note, I was glad to hear that economy is slowly \nimproving. This was underscored by the President of the American \nChamber of Commerce of Serbia and Montenegro. This is important to the \nSerbian people, and it will also help to further democratic reforms in \nthe country.\n  I was also inspired by the good work of nongovernmental \norganizations, such as the German Marshall Fund's Balkan Trust for \nDemocracy, as well as the charitable work that is being done by Crown \nPrince Alexander and Crown Princess Katherine.\n  During my time in Belgrade, I continued to be encouraged by the \nforward thinking of President Boris Tadic and his advisors, who ran on \na platform of democratic reform and European integration. This is the \ntype of agenda that will help to ensure a stable, secure and prosperous \nfuture for the people of Serbia and Montenegro.\n  We concluded our travel in Venice, Italy for the fall session of the \nNATO Parliamentary Assembly. In my view, this is an important forum \nwhere legislators and parliamentarians from NATO member and partner \ncountries gather to discuss transatlantic issues. I have regularly \nattended these meetings, and I serve as Vice Chairman of the Assembly's \nPolitical Committee.\n  Our participation in the session was limited to the first two days, \nas we had to return to Washington for work in the Senate for the \nconclusion of the 108th Congress. However, we had two solid days of \nwork, including meetings with our Permanent Representative to NATO, \nAmbassador Nick Burns, and NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop \nSchaeffer. We discussed a number of issues impacting the NATO Alliance, \nincluding NATO's role in Afghanistan and Iraq, the capabilities and \ncontributions of NATO allies, and the NATO Response Force, among other \nthings.\n  In celebration of its 50th anniversary, the NATO Parliamentary \nAssembly convened a special plenary session with the North Atlantic \nCouncil. NATO Secretary General de Hoop Schaeffer delivered an \nimpressive speech, in which he challenged delegates to the meeting to \nencourage their respective constituencies to enhance participation in \nNATO as the Alliance looks to meet new challenges in Afghanistan, Iraq \nand the war against terrorism.\n  As our meeting demonstrated, the NATO Alliance remains strong. NATO \nis playing a critical role in efforts to promote stability and security \nin Afghanistan. Many soldiers from our NATO allies are standing \nalongside American forces in Iraq, and other NATO members are providing \ntraining for Iraqi security forces. Moreover, NATO remains integral to \npeacekeeping missions in the Balkans.\n  That being said, it is clear that challenges remain as the Alliance \nreviews its role in Afghanistan and Iraq and the broader war against \nterrorism, and it is important that we remain engaged and active to \nhelp meet these challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11617-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11617-S11619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE NISEI INTELLIGENCE WAR AGAINST JAPAN\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the World War II war against Japan has been \ndescribed in John Dower's book ``War Without Mercy'' as the most \nsavage, bitterly fought racial war in history. Caught in between this \nepic struggle as innocent victims were the Nisei, American citizens of \nJapanese ancestry, who were neither accepted nor trusted by both \nAmerica and Japan. The widespread question and doubt as to their \nloyalty to America extended to grave uncertainty of whether the Nisei \nwould be willing to fight against an enemy of their same ancestry. This \ncalls for the telling of the little-known story that there were over \n6,000 Nisei who more than willingly and resolutely fought against the \nJapanese enemy during World War II as military intelligence linguists \nserving in the American and Allied forces. Briefly, this is that story.\n  As the probability of war against Japan mounted in the summer of \n1941, the U.S. War Department realized its deficiencies in the \nintelligence operations against Japan. The Military Intelligence \nService Language School, MISLS, was hastily authorized and created to \ntrain linguists skilled in interpretation, translation and \ninterrogation in the Japanese language, established at the Fourth Army \nIntelligence School located at Crissey Field, Presidio of San \nFrancisco. With a meager budget of $2,000 and an initial enrollment of \n60 students, the first classes commenced their studies of military \nJapanese on November 1, 1941, a scant 5 weeks before the Pearl Harbor \nattack by Japan. After a grueling 6 months of training, only 45 of the \ninitial enrollment of 60 students survived to graduate in May 1942, 35 \nof whom were immediately assigned and deployed out to the Alaskan and \nGuadalcanal campaigns.\n  From the outset the Army recognized that the American Nisei possessed \nthe best qualifications, competence and potential for Japanese \nintelligence specialist training, yet harbored grave doubts about the \nNisei's loyalty to America. Soon news came back from the field of vast \nsources of new Japanese intelligence uncovered by a pioneer linguist \nteam lead by Captain John Burden of Hawaii in the battle of \nGuadalcanal, and field commanders began flooding the MISLS with demands \nfor more Nisei linguists. The need to meet this surging demand for \nJapanese language linguists led the MISLS in December 1942 to recruit \n58 Nisei from the 100th Battalion then training at Camp McCoy, \nWisconsin, to secure the transfer of 250 Nisei from the 442nd \nRegimental Combat Team, RCT, at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, to scour the \n10 relocation camps to recruit MIS students from behind their barbed \nwire enclosures, and to conduct two recruiting trips to Hawaii in June \n1943 and February 1944 to enlist over 500 Hawaii Nisei for intelligence \ntraining at MISLS.\n  With the forced evacuation of 110,000 Japanese from the West Coast \nunder Executive Order 9066 in the spring of 1942, the MISLS was \ntransferred to Camp Savage, Minnesota where it continued to recruit, \ntrain and graduate successive classes of Japanese linguist specialists \nat roughly six month intervals totaling some 1,600 graduates. The ever-\nincreasing enrollment overtaxed the facilities at Camp Savage forcing \nthe MISLS to move to larger facilities at nearby Fort Snelling in the \nspring of 1944. Here, classes training WAC students, oral language \ntraining and occupation civil affairs administration were added to the \ncurriculum. By V-J Day in August 1945, 10 classes had been trained and \ngraduated from MISLS at Camp Savage and Fort Snelling and another 3,000 \nstudents were enrolled and learning Japanese at the Snelling facilities \nat that time. In all, during its history MISLS trained and graduated \n6,000 students for combat and occupational duty against Japan in World\n\n[[Page S11618]]\n\nWar II. In June 1946, MISLS was then moved to the Presidio at Monterey, \nCalifornia and was renamed the Defense Language Institute where it \nteaches over 25 languages in the military intelligence field.\n  MISLS graduates served in every combat theater and engaged in every \nmajor battle fought against Japan during World War II. Nisei linguists \nwere assigned to and served with the United States Army, Navy, Marine \nCorps and Air Force, as well as with British, Australian, New Zealand, \nCanadian, Chinese, and Indian combat units fighting on all fronts \nagainst the Japanese. Trained for duties as interrogators, interpreters \nand translators, cave flushers, radio interceptors, radio announcers \nand propaganda writers, the MIS graduates served as ``the intelligence \neyes and ears'' of American and Allied Forces in the war against Japan. \nThe Nisei linguists were sent out to serve in every battle front where \nwar was being waged against the Japanese enemy.\n  South Pacific Command: Commencing in May 1942 Nisei linguist teams \nwere sent out from Admiral Halsey's command headquarters in New \nCaledonia to participate in the battle for Guadalcanal where Japan \nsuffered its first defeat, in the invasion of New Georgia and \nBougainville and in the encirclement and cut off of Rabaul, New Britain \nto neutralize Japan's main Pacific stronghold. In April 1943, linguist \nHarold Fudenna intercepted and translated a Japanese radio message \nwhich outlined the schedule of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's inspection \ntrip to Bougainville. American P-38 fighters flown out of Guadalcanal \nintercepted and shot down Yamamoto's plane over Bougainville. General \nMcArthur described this incident as ``one of the singularly most \nsignificant actions of the Pacific War.''\n  Southwest Pacific Command: In July 1942 General McArthur established \nthe Allied Translator and Interpreter Section, ATIS, of his \nIntelligence Division in Melbourne, Australia to become the largest \nmilitary intelligence center to wage the tactical war against Japan. \nThroughout its history over 3,000 Nisei linguists served with ATIS, \ntranslating over 350,000 captured Japanese documents and interrogating \nmore than 10,000 Japanese POWs. Nisei language teams were assigned to \nand participated in the two-year campaign of jungle warfare along the \neast and northern coast of New Guinea and Borneo, invading and \ndefeating Japanese defenses along the way. The Nisei were part of the \ninvasion of the Philippines in October 1944 where General McArthur made \nhis triumphal ``I have returned'' landing at Leyte. In March 1944, the \n``Z'' Plan containing Japan's total defense strategy for the Western \nPacific fell into American hands following the fatal crash of Admiral \nKoga in the Philippines. The document was rushed to ATIS in Australia \nwhere two Nisei, Yoshikazu Yamada and George ``Sankey'' Yamashiro, \ntranslated the ``Z'' Plan, and copies were distributed to every command \nin the U.S. Navy.\n  When the invasion of the Marianas Islands began in June 1944, the \ncounterattacking Japanese aircraft were virtually wiped out by U.S. \nNavy carrier planes in ``The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot'' by virtue of \nthe prior knowledge of Japanese strategy contained in the ``Z'' Plan.\n  Southeast Asia Command. (CBI Theater): Nisei linguists joined \nBritish, Indian, Chinese and U.S. forces in the China-Burma-India \nTheater to drive Japanese invaders out of Burma and to reestablish the \nBurma Road supply lines to China. They were part of the two ground \nforces in Burma, the Merrill's Marauders and Mars Task Force, performed \nguerrilla tactics behind the enemy lines with the OSS Detachment 101, \nprovided radio intercept work for the 10th Army Air force, manned the \nSoutheast Asia Translator & Interrogation Center, SEATIC, in New Delhi, \nIndia, made propaganda broadcasts for the Office of War Information, \nand were leased out to the British forces fighting in southern Burma. \nIn China, Nisei MIS performed intelligence services for the ``Dixie \nMission'' to Communist China Headquarters at Yenan and OSS Detachment \n202 in Kunming, and fought with Chiang Kai Shek's Forces against the \nJapanese in southwestern China.\n\n  Central Pacific Command: Admiral Nimitz organized the ``Joint \nIntelligence Center Pacific Ocean Area (JICPOA) operating out of Pearl \nHarbor, staffed by hundreds of Nisei translator/interrogators who were \nassigned out to serve with the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force \nunits waging the Pacific War against Japan. Nisei participated in the \namphibious landings and land battles of the Marine Corps to capture \nTarawa, Makin, Kwajalein and Eniwetok and were part of Marine and Army \nattacking units invading and capturing Saipan, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. \nNisei radio interceptors flew as crews on U.S. Air Force bombing \nmissions over the Japanese mainland. With their language skills they \ncalled into caves at Saipan, Iwo Jima and Okinawa to persuade hundreds \nof Japanese soldiers and civilian natives to surrender and save their \nlives without needless mortality. T/Sgt Hoichi Kubo assigned to the \nU.S. 27th Division entered a cliffside cave alone at Saipan to face 9 \narmed Japanese soldiers to successfully persuade them not only to \nrelease the 120 civilians held captive there but for the soldiers \nthemselves to surrender. Kubo was awarded the Distinguished Service \nCross, the highest decoration received by any Nisei in the Pacific War. \nNisei linguists attached to the front line of American invading forces \nnot only assumed the normal hazards of combat but also faced the \nadditional danger of being mistaken for an enemy Jap and shot at by \ntheir own troops, so they were assigned personal bodyguards at their \nsides at all times!\n  Japan's Surrender and Occupation: With the atomic bombing of \nHiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan accepted the terms of the Potsdam \nDeclaration and surrendered on August 15, 1945. OSS Nisei like Fumio \nKido, Dick Hamada and Ralph Yempuku parachuted down into Japanese POW \nprison camps at Hankow, Mukden, Peiping and Hainan as interpreters on \nmercy missions to liberate American and Allied prisoners.\n  Over 5,000 Nisei served as the vital link between General MacArthur's \nOccupational headquarters and the Japanese people during the seven year \noccupation of Japan, contributing to the promotion of peaceful and \nharmonious relationships between occupation forces and Japanese \ncitizens. Nisei were part of military government offices established \nall over Japan to ensure proper implementation of occupational \npolicies, interpreting the directives and verifying that local \ngovernments carried them out. Nisei buttressed U.S. Army Counter \nIntelligence Corps efforts to detect and prevent subversive activities \nagainst Occupation Forces, screened hundreds of thousands of Japanese \nsoldiers repatriating back to Japan against communist influences, \nhelped design the Land Reform Law, and provided vital translator/\ninterpreter services at the War Crimes Trials against Japanese war \ncriminals. Nisei participated in every major assignment covering \nmilitary government, disarmament, civil affairs and intelligence and \nhelped to frame the new Japanese Constitution which pledged that Japan \nwould ``forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation.'' A \npersonal assessment of the Nisei's role in the occupation is stated by \nHarry Fukuhara, a combat veteran of the Southwest Pacific campaign and \nhimself a member of the occupation forces, thusly: ``The role of the \nMilitary Intelligence Personnel during the Occupation of Japan also was \nvery important in assisting the rapid recovery that helped Japan to be \naccepted back into the family of nations. Nisei soldiers, with their \nlanguage fluency and knowledge of Japanese culture and customs, bridged \nthe gap between U.S. forces and the Japanese government. This was one \nof the key elements contributing to the recovery of war-torn Japan, its \npeople and economy. Nisei efforts also laid the groundwork for the \nbilateral relationships that exists today between the United States and \nJapan.''\n  Summary: Such in brief is the story of the Nisei MIS linguist, \nAmerica's little known ``secret weapon'' against Japan during World War \nII. Their story is little known because their identity and their work \nwas conducted under the strictest security and secrecy and their vital \nrole in waging the successful intelligence war against Japan remained \nclassified for until over 30 years after the War. Their role was \nconsidered indispensable because they possessed and employed the most \neffective weapon knowledge to be able to\n\n[[Page S11619]]\n\ncomprehend and pierce the enemy's complex, difficult language and their \nservices contributed tremendously to the Allied victory. General \nMacArthur stated that ``Never in military history did any army know so \nmuch about the enemy prior to actual engagement.'' On April 1, 2000, \nthe President of the United States bestowed upon the Nisei MIS the \nPresidential Unit Citation, the highest honor that can be awarded to \nany military unit. The major part of the citations reads:\n\n       The key contributions made by the members of the Military \n     Intelligence Service in providing valuable intelligence on \n     military targets helped advance the United States and Allied \n     cause during World War II and undoubtedly saved countless \n     lives and hastened the end of the war. The significant \n     achievements accomplished by the faithful and dedicated \n     service of the linguistic-intelligence specialist graduates \n     of the Military Intelligence Service will never be forgotten \n     by our grateful nation. Their unconquerable sprit and gallant \n     deeds under fire in the face of superior odds, and their \n     self-sacrificing devotion to duty are worthy of the highest \n     emulation.\n\n  The Nisei served with distinction and honor; not a single case of \nsubversion or disloyalty was ever charged against them. Little is known \nthat nineteen Nisei gave up their lives in the line of duty in the \nPacific War. They convincingly proved that Japanese Americans were more \nthan willing and able to fight against an enemy of their own race, and \nvalidated the truism ``Americanism is not, and never was, a matter of \nrace or ancestry. Americanism is a matter of the mind and heart.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11619-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11619-S11620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MULTIVITAMIN USE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, over the last several years, a significant \nand growing body of scientific research has emerged detailing the \nimportant role micronutrients play in the prevention of many types of \nchronic disease.\n  While the science supporting optimal nutrition for disease prevention \nhas grown, the average American's diet has progressively gotten worse. \nAs we have heard so often, a large percentage of Americans do not eat \nthe right mix of foods to meet the Government's RDIs--or recommended \ndaily intakes.\n  Our top nutrition priority should be getting people to eat a more \nvaried, balanced diet. However, there is a simple and inexpensive way \nto help Americans get many of the micronutrients they need--encourage \nthe use of a daily multivitamin. Multivitamins--as a complement to a \nhealthy diet--are a simple, safe and cost-effective preventive measure.\n  Indeed, several recent studies have shown their efficacy. For \nexample, in June 2002, an article published in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association recommended that all Americans take a \nmultivitamin daily to help prevent chronic diseases such as heart \ndisease, cancer and osteoporosis. A year late, the Journal of Nutrition \npublished the results of the Stockholm Heart Study, which showed that \nthe use of multivitamins may aid in the prevention of heart attacks.\n  In March, a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found \nthat multivitamin use decreased the risk of infection for people with \ndiabetes. And the science continues to mount demonstrating the \npotential of daily multivitamin use which can have a whole range of \nbenefits. These include reducing the incidence of neural tube defects \nby 50 percent or more, decreasing the number of sick days in the \nelderly due to infectious illnesses by up to 50 percent, delaying or \navoiding more than 20 percent of hip fractures caused by osteoporosis, \ndelaying the onset of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration, \nreducing the incidence of heart disease, stroke and possibly \nAlzheimer's, and protecting against some types of cancer.\n  Additionally, I would like to recognize a study that was commissioned \nby Wyeth Consumer Healthcare and conducted by The Lewin Group. The \nstudy examined the potential cost savings--within the Medicare health \ncare model--that could occur if more of our aging population took a \ndaily multivitamin. This study also served as a means for evaluating \nthe impact daily multivitamin use can have on preventive health, \nparticularly in the areas of cardiovascular disease and immune \nfunction. The results of the study indicate that increased multivitamin \nuse by adults over 65 could result in an estimated savings to Medicare \nof more than $1.6 billion over a 5-year period.\n  Research shows that a significant number of elderly in our country do \nnot receive proper amounts of essential vitamins, minerals and other \nnutrients, making them more vulnerable to disease and infection. By \nadding a multivitamin to their diets, seniors--and all Americans--can \nhelp ensure they get the nutrients they need to stay healthy.\n  While it is always prudent for an individual to take supplements in \nclose consultation with his or her health care advisers, it is obvious \nfrom the research that dietary supplements continue to have important \nhealth care benefits for consumers and policymakers alike.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attached release outlining the Lewin \nstudy printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n New Study Finds Increased Multivitamin Use by the Elderly Could Save \n                         Medicare $1.6 Billion\n\n       Washington, Oct. 2, 2003.--The results of a new study \n     released today show that the daily use of a multivitamin by \n     older adults could lead to more than $1.6 billion in Medicare \n     savings over the next five years. The study, funded by Wyeth \n     Consumer Healthcare and conducted by The Lewin Group, was \n     presented at ``Multivitamins and Public Health: Exploring the \n     Evidence,'' a meeting which brought together leading experts \n     from government agencies, top research universities and \n     health advocacy organizations to examine the current science \n     supporting daily multivitamin use and help chart the course \n     for future research.\n       The study, the first of its kind, included a systematic \n     literature review of the most rigorous research available and \n     examined the health effects of multivitamin use among adults \n     over 65 years old. The researchers used an analysis of \n     Medicare claims files and widely accepted Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) cost accounting methods to determine the \n     costs and potential savings, monetizing the potential \n     preventive health benefits of multivitamin supplementation.\n       ``We were able to identify significant cost savings based \n     on improved immune functioning and a reduction in the \n     relative risk of coronary artery disease through providing a \n     daily multivitamin to the 65 and over population,'' said \n     Allen Dobson, Ph.D., senior vice president and director of \n     Healthcare Finance at The Lewin Group. ``In my experience, \n     finding any cost savings for preventive measures is unusual \n     and finding cost savings of this magnitude is very rare.\n       Over the five-year period from 2004-2008, the study results \n     show potential savings from a reduction in hospitalizations \n     for heart attacks, as well as from a reduction in \n     hospitalizations, Medicare nursing home stays and home \n     healthcare associated with infection.\n       While the evidence most strongly supports the beneficial \n     effects of multivitamins in improved immune functioning and a \n     reduction in the relative risk of heart disease, researchers \n     also reviewed literature that examined the preventive \n     benefits of multivitamin supplementation as it relates to \n     colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, diabetes and \n     osteoporosis. These other conditions were not included in the \n     cost estimation, however, because the research currently \n     available in these areas did not support a direct translation \n     from health effect to reduced heath care utilization within a \n     health insurance framework.\n       These disease states, along with a wide range of additional \n     topics, were among the themes at the Multivitamins and Public \n     Health: Exploring the Evidence meeting yesterday. The invited \n     panel of multidisciplinary thought leaders reviewed the \n     current state of the science and discussed the role \n     multivitamins play in reducing the risk of developing chronic \n     disease, as well as their role in immunity and public health. \n     They came to the following conclusions:\n       Most Americans do not get optimal amounts of key \n     micronutrients through diet alone, despite the evidence that \n     poor nutritional status increases the risk of birth defects, \n     and infectious and chronic disease;\n       Daily multivitamins should be recommended to help close \n     this nutritional gap;\n       Multivitamins are safe, affordable, cost-effective and \n     accessible;\n       There is promising evidence supporting multivitamin use for \n     the prevention of some chronic diseases such as \n     cardiovascular disease, making it prudent to recommend that \n     all adults take a daily multivitamin.\n       ``Despite our efforts to maintain a healthy diet, research \n     indicates most of us fall short of getting the vitamins and \n     minerals we need,'' said David Heber, M.D., Ph.D., director \n     of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition and a co-chair of \n     Multivitamins and Public Health. ``A daily multivitamin is a \n     simple and cost-effective way to help ensure good health.''\n       ``The current research indicates that multivitamins can \n     help protect against the cell damage that makes us vulnerable \n     to the development of many diseases common among older \n     adults,'' said meeting co-chair Jeffrey Blumberg, Ph.D., a \n     professor in the\n\n[[Page S11620]]\n\n     Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts \n     University. ``Multivitamins are a safe and effective tool for \n     the promotion of health and prevention of chronic disease.''\n       Multivitamins and Public Health: Exploring the Evidence, a \n     two-day meeting held October 1-2, 2003, in Washington, D.C., \n     brought together leading health and nutrition experts from \n     government agencies, top research universities and health \n     advocacy organizations to examine the state of the science \n     supporting daily multivitamin use and help chart the course \n     for future research.

Mr. President, as we near the end of the 108th Congress, I \nmust express my disappointment that this Congress has failed to pass \nsensible gun safety legislation. By ignoring these bills we are missing \nopportunities to increase the security of our families, communities, \nand particularly our police officers.\n  The greatest of these missed opportunities has been the failure to \nreauthorize the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. On September 13, 2004 this \nlegislation expired, allowing 19 previously banned assault weapons, as \nwell as firearms that can accept detachable magazines and have more \nthan one of several specific military features, such as a folding/\ntelescoping stock, protruding pistol grip, bayonet mount, threaded \nmuzzle or flash suppressor, barrel shroud or grenade launcher to be \nlegally sold again. Common sense tells us that there is no reason for \ncivilians to have easy access to guns with these features.\n  Earlier this year, I joined with the majority of my Senate colleagues \nin passing an amendment to reauthorize the assault weapons ban for \nanother 10 years. However, the bill to which it was attached was later \nderailed. Despite the overwhelming support of the law enforcement \ncommunity, the ongoing threat of terrorism, bipartisan support in the \nSenate, and the pleas of Americans who have already lost loved ones to \nassault weapons tragedies, the ban was allowed to expire, as the \nPresident and the Republican congressional leadership were unwilling to \nact.\n  We also missed the opportunity to close the gun show loophole. Under \ncurrent law, when an individual buys a handgun from a licensed dealer, \nthere are Federal requirements for a background check to insure that \nthe purchaser is not prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing a \nfirearm. However, this is not the case for all gun purchases. For \nexample, when an individual wants to buy a handgun from another private \ncitizen who is not a licensed gun dealer, there is no requirement that \nthe seller ensure the purchaser is not in a prohibited category. This \ncreates a loophole in the law, making it easy for criminals, \nterrorists, and other prohibited buyers to evade background checks and \nbuy guns from private citizens. This loophole creates a gateway to the \nillegal market because criminals know they will not be subject to a \nbackground check when purchasing from another private citizen even at a \ngun show.\n  I cosponsored an amendment offered by Senators Reed and McCain which \nwould have closed the gun show loophole because I believe it is a \ncritical change needed to prevent guns from getting into the hands of \ncriminals and other ineligible buyers. This amendment would have simply \napplied existing law governing background checks to individuals buying \nfirearms at gun shows. Like the amendment to reauthorize the assault \nweapons ban, the bill to which the amendment was attached was later \ndefeated, and despite the fact that a bipartisan majority of Senators \nvoted in support of closing the gun show loophole, Republican \nleadership has refused to schedule another vote on the issue.\n  This Congress has also failed to consider several other pieces of \nsensible gun safety legislation which would make it more difficult for \nconvicted criminals to gain access to firearms. One such bill, the \nMilitary Sniper Regulation Act, would change the way .50 caliber guns \nare regulated by placing them under the requirements of the National \nFirearms Act. This would subject these weapons to the same regimen of \nregistration and background checks as those weapons regulated under the \nNational Firearms Act. These powerful weapons can accurately hit \ntargets a mile away and tighter regulation is needed to prevent them \nfrom falling into the wrong hands.\n  Another bill not considered in the 108th Congress, the National \nInstant Criminal Background Check Improvement Act, would have provided \nfunding to fix the hole in the current NICS background check system \ncaused by the failure of many states to computerize and update their \ncriminal history records. This failure can result in delays for some \nwho lawfully seek to purchase a gun as well as an inability to block \ngun sales to some unlawful purchasers. To fix this problem, States need \nadequate funding to input and update criminal history data. This bill \nwould have authorized $1 billion to help states do just that.\n  Unfortunately, the 108th Congress has retreated from the goal of \ncreating a safer nation by keeping dangerous guns off of our streets. \nInstead of strengthening laws that would help prevent future gun crimes \nand terrorist attacks, Congress has allowed legislation like the \nassault weapons ban to expire, giving potential criminals and \nterrorists easier access to powerful weapons. The 108th Congress's \nrecord on gun safety is not one of which to be proud. I will continue \nto work toward passing sensible gun safety legislation to help make our \ncommunities more safe. I hope that next year in the 109th Congress, the \nRepublican congressional leadership and the President will begin to \nwork with the bipartisan majority who want to enact sensible gun safety \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11620-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11620-S11621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WHERE TO NEXT?\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in the next several weeks I will be \nvisiting Europe to meet with government and business leaders in London, \nParis, and Brussels. I believe the United States' relationship with the \nEuropean Union and the states of Europe is of supreme importance. \nAmerica's economic, security, political, and institutional links with \nEurope are stronger and deeper than with any other region of the world. \nRecently, the importance of this relationship was explained very well \nin an article written by the Honorable James Elles, who is a Member of \nthe European Parliament.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Elles's article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   On EU/US Relations: Where to Next?\n\n       Once the race for the US Presidency is finally over, the \n     new President and his advisors will move from reflecting on \n     the results of a successful campaign and will look for the \n     conduct of policy in the months ahead.\n       What are the immediate priorities with which to deal on \n     both the domestic and foreign fronts? How, for example, \n     should economic growth best be fostered? How are priorities \n     to be handled in far away places such as Iraq, Afghanistan \n     and Palestine? What is to be the real objective of the four-\n     year mandate by which he would like to be judged as being a \n     truly successful President?\n       As these questions are being mulled over between now and \n     the Inaugural address early next year, he might reflect that \n     thinking is taking place across the other side of the \n     Atlantic on many of the same issues. Although the incoming \n     Commission President has not yet got the approval of the \n     European Parliament for his new team, he will be also \n     considering how to answer a similar set of questions.\n       How similar are the policy challenges for the incoming EU \n     and US administrations? Is it correct that Europe is swamped, \n     as many would have us believe, by a huge anti-American wave \n     generated by hostility to the Iraq War? Or is there an \n     extensive common agenda which could be drawn up in the next \n     few weeks and serve as a basis for joint action over the \n     period 2005-2008?\n       Certainly, there is no shortage of potential flash points \n     in external policy which the pessimists can draw attention to \n     and which are already on the transatlantic agenda. The war \n     against terrorism will certainly be at the top of the US \n     agenda, in its continued search for ensuring domestic \n     security.\n       In this context, the run-up to elections in IRAQ will \n     require steel nerves. So will their aftermath, in particular, \n     determining what\n\n[[Page S11621]]\n\n     role European Governments will wish to play in a military and \n     financial capacity. Hot on the heels of this dilemma will be \n     the question of IRAN. How will the new US administration wish \n     to address this issue? Will it be happy to let the Europeans \n     take the lead or will it wish to take a more active approach \n     as some suggest should be done?\n       Linked to both these questions is the overall pursuit of \n     peace in the MIDDLE EAST. What has become of the initiative \n     to bring European and American involvement together to make \n     progress in the Broader Middle East? Should for example the \n     roadmap be resuscitated?\n       Last but not least is the question of ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE \n     to both Afghanistan and Africa (a potential priority for the \n     G8 next year). How should this best be coordinated by the two \n     major global donors--the EU and the US--who contribute about \n     80% of the world's assistance programmes?\n       This is all enough to cause indigestion. Certainly more \n     questions are posed than answers are available. Even if \n     cooperation is seen to be highly desirable, with the aim of \n     moving from a transatlantic community of values to a \n     community of action, how can it be done?\n       The best chance available to the incoming administrations \n     is, as they say, not to start from here. These problems have \n     been around for many months and will be around for many more.\n       A recently released document published by the Transatlantic \n     Policy Network (TPN) lays the groundwork for a potentially \n     successful approach to deepening joint cooperation between \n     the EU and the US.\n       At the outset, it recommends a strategy which articulates a \n     common purpose, building on strengths and reinforcing \n     linkages while accommodating differences. This is based on \n     the recognition of growing linkage between the partners' \n     economic, defence and security, and political interests.\n       In short, should strengthened partnership be a shared goal, \n     if so a bold new agenda for economic collaboration needs to \n     be linked with a commitment to enhanced joint action on the \n     highest shared political priorities.\n       What does this mean? Avoid well known areas of dispute such \n     as a free trade area (FTA) and focus instead on what already \n     exists to a large degree--the transatlantic market. The TPN \n     document recommends deepening and broadening the \n     transatlantic market, with a view to its completion by 2015.\n       An accelerated 2010 target date should be set for financial \n     services and capital markets; civil aviation; the digital \n     economy; competition policy and regulatory cooperation.\n       Furthermore, there should also be provision for a broad \n     security partnership between the EU and the US, together with \n     a mutually reinforcing interface between the EU and NATO.\n       Last, but not least, there should be put in place, by 2007, \n     an enhanced basis for cooperation between the two partners--a \n     transatlantic partnership agreement--building on the 1995 New \n     Transatlantic Agenda and reflecting the strategy proposed.\n       Is this approach realistic and practical? Maybe \n     surprisingly, the broad outlines of this approach have \n     already been approved by the European Parliament in May 2004.\n       The economic option has the great advantage that most of \n     the elements are already in place: the administrations are \n     jointly consulting stakeholders as to how to remove the \n     remaining barriers to trade and investment. Given the more \n     than quadrupling of cross investment over the past 10 years, \n     the process of interdependence between the EU and the US is \n     not likely to slacken.\n       The vital ingredient for the success of this proposal is \n     the factor of political will. Will transatlantic leaders take \n     a fresh look at how to bring the EU and the US together \n     before getting sucked into the daily grind of politics?\n       Perhaps the best advice for the incoming Commission \n     President would be to pay a short informal visit in early \n     January to Washington. This should be not just to compare \n     notes but also to put forward a joint plan which will allow \n     Europeans and Americans to work as closely as possible in the \n     interests of their peoples in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11621-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               H.R. 5365\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida.

The House of Representatives has now \nsent over a bill introduced by Representatives English and Pomeroy that \nclosely follows the intent of the Senate bill. I am pleased that this \neffort has been a bipartisan one in both bodies of Congress. I hope \nthis legislation will be enacted promptly.\n  I also thank Finance Committee Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member \nBaucus for their assistance in bringing this bill to the floor today. \nThe YMCA pension plan is an excellent example of how retirement \nsecurity can be provided through employer-sponsored plans.\n  This is a bill about protecting the retirement security for thousands \nof YMCA employees and retirees. There are 27 YMCA's in Florida, over \n977,843 members and over 4,400 plan participants and retirees. The \nretirement security provided by the YMCA pension plan is critical to \nthese people and their families, as well as over 80,000 plan \nparticipants across the country.\n  This country could learn much from the retirement security provided \nby the YMCA pension plan. As I have stated, the YMCA pension plan is a \nvery significant part of each YMCA employee's compensation package, \nmost of who are modestly paid. The YMCA pension plan exemplifies how \nour Nation should think about providing solid, substantial retirement \nsecurity.\n  I also want to extend my thanks to the Treasury Department and IRS, \nfor their patience while the Congress worked through finding a solution \nto ensure the YMCA pension plan could continue to offer the benefits to \nits participants and retirees.\n  In closing, I encourage all of my colleagues in the Senate to support \nthis bill, and I am pleased that we are moving forward with this \nlegislation today and look forward to its enactment soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11621-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11621-S11622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REAUTHORIZATION OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, much of the Senate's attention this week \nwas consumed with completing lingering business, be it, appropriations \nbills or debt extension. In contrast, I rise today to ask my colleagues \nto cast their eyes forward to a new matter that we must focus on when \nCongress reconvenes in January--the reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. As most know, I consider the Violence Against Women \nAct the single most important legislation I've championed during my 30-\nyear tenure in the Senate. I care deeply about this law, and take \nseriously my responsibility to ensure it is funded and renewed.\n  After more than 5 years of hearings, and legislative drafts and \nredrafts, in September 1994, the Congress passed and President Clinton \nsigned into law the Violence Against Women Act. The Violence Against \nWomen Act created new Federal criminal laws addressing domestic \nviolence and rape, and established discretionary grant programs within \nthe Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human \nServices for State, local, and Indian tribal governments and non-profit \nservice organizations. The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 renewed \nthese programs, made targeted improvements to certain provisions and \nintroduced new initiatives.\n  Since the bill was enacted, we've witnessed an incredible \ntransformation in State and Federal criminal and civil law enforcement, \ncommunities' victim services, and societal attitudes towards domestic \nviolence and sexual assault. In 2004 alone, Congress spent $520 million \nfor Violence Against Women programs. Over the past decade, nearly $3.8 \nbillion has been appropriated to make women's homes and communities \nsafer.\n  We've made extraordinary progress in ending violence against women \nand its devastating impact on families. With the passage of the \nViolence Against Women Act we started talking about that dirty little \nsecret that no one wanted to say out loud. A rape victim or battered \nwife can now turn to a trained police officer, an emergency room nurse, \nor a 1-800 Hotline operator. We transformed private ``family matters'' \ninto public crimes with true accountability and meaningful victim \nservices.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is working. Since its enactment, \ndomestic violence has dropped by almost 50 percent. Incidents of rape \nare down by 60 percent. The number of women killed by an abusive \nhusband or boyfriend is down by 22 percent. More than half of all rape \nvictims are stepping forward to report the crime. Over a million women \nhave found justice in our courtrooms and obtained domestic violence \nprotective orders. The signs of success abound.\n  But progress is not enough. Sadly, domestic violence and sexual \nassault persist. As more and more brave women are stepping forward to \nreport a rape or seek a restraining order against an abusive husband, \nmore demands are\n\n[[Page S11622]]\n\nplaced on women's shelters, state prosecutors, courtroom victim \nadvocates, and other resources. We cannot let the Violence Against \nWomen Act become a victim of its own success. Instead, it must be \nsoundly and quickly reauthorized next year.\n\n  Despite best efforts, a complete bill reauthorizing the Act is not \nyet ready for introduction today. However, a draft is near completion. \nI am listening closely to those on the front lines--police, trial \njudges, emergency room nurses and many others--and making targeted \nimprovements to existing grant programs and tightening up criminal \nlaws. We are learning about the new challenges and the persistent \nproblems of old. A wide variety of groups are working with me to put \ntogether the next iteration of the Violence Against Women Act, \nincluding the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the \nNational Network to End Domestic Violence, the Family Violence and \nPrevention Fund, the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape, Legal \nMomentum, the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the American \nBar Association's Commission on Domestic Violence, the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, the National Center for Victims of \nCrime, National District Attorneys Association, the National Council on \nFamily and Juvenile Court Judges, the National Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the National Sheriffs' Association and the American Medical \nAssociation.\n  The Violence Against Women Act of 2005 that I intend to introduce at \nthe commencement of the next Congressional session is a comprehensive \nand ambitious bill that will move our country forward in our fight to \nend family violence. The reauthorization will include at least nine \ntitles. Major components of title I on the courts and crime include \nprovisions to: 1. renew existing foundational programs for law \nenforcement, lawyers, judges and advocates; 2. stiffen existing \ncriminal penalties for repeat federal domestic violence offenders; 3. \nappropriately update the stalking criminal law to incorporate new \nsurveillance technology like Global Positioning Systems (GPS); and 4. \nensure that offender re-entry programs develop procedures and resources \nfor prisoners with a history of family violence. Title II on victim \nservices would, among other items: 1. create a new dedicated program \nfor rape crisis centers; 2. reinvigorate programs to help older and \ndisabled victims of domestic violence; and 3. strengthen existing \nprograms for rural victims and victims in underserved areas.\n  I am particularly heartened by new titles that deal with children and \nteenagers. Reports indicate that from three to ten million children are \nexperiencing domestic violence in their homes each year. Treating \nchildren who witness domestic violence, dealing quickly with violent \nteenage relationships and teaching prevention to children and teenagers \nare keys to ending the violence.\n  In some instances, women face the untenable choice of returning to \ntheir abuser or becoming homeless. Indeed, 44 percent of the Nation's \nmayors identified domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness. \nIn response, efforts to ease the housing problems for battered women \nare contained in my draft bill.\n\n  Doctors and nurses, like police officers on the beat, are often the \nfirst witnesses of the devastating aftermath of abuse. As first \nresponders, they must be fully engaged in the effort to end the \nviolence and have the tools they need to faithfully screen, treat and \nstudy family violence. My bill would strengthen the health care \nsystem's response to family violence with programs to train and educate \nhealth care professionals on domestic and sexual violence, foster \nfamily violence screening for patients, and more studies on the health \nramifications of family violence.\n  Leaving a violent partner often requires battered women to achieve a \nlevel of economic security. The next iteration of the Violence Against \nWomen Act should seek to help abused women maintain secure employment, \ninsurance coverage, and child support resources.\n  In addition, my bill would improve and expand the immigration \nprotections for battered women. I am very appreciative of Senator \nKennedy's leadership and expertise on this issue. In addition, it would \nensure that victims of trafficking are supported with measures such as \npermitting their families to join them in certain circumstances, \nexpanding the duration of a T-visa, and providing resources to victims \nwho assist in investigations or prosecutions of trafficking cases \nbrought by State or Federal authorities. Finally, my bill will focus \nmore closely on violence against Indian women and suggest ways to \nbetter coordinate services to Indian women.\n  I am pleased to be working on such a thorough effort to renew the \nViolence Against Women Act. I believe this bill raises important \nissues, and pushes local and federal policymakers to ask what more \nshould be done for battered women and their children. In the coming \nweeks, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to craft a compromise measure. Senator Hatch and the \nJudiciary Committee's new Chairman, Senator Specter and Ranking Member \nSenator Leahy, have long supported the Violence Against Women Act and I \nam confident that we will work together to create an effective \nreauthorization bill. I also appreciate the efforts in the House of \nRepresentatives including those of a long-standing champion of the \nViolence Against Women, Representative Conyers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11622-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11622-S11624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE ABUSE OF FOREIGN DETAINEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, nearly 7 months after the world learned of \nthe atrocities at Abu Ghraib, those of us in the Congress who strongly \nbelieve that oversight and accountability are paramount to restoring \nAmerica's reputation as a human rights leader remain stymied in our \nefforts to learn the truth about how this administration's policies \ntrickled down from offices in Washington to cellblocks in Abu Ghraib.\n  The Bush administration circled the wagons long ago and has \ncontinually maintained that the abuses were the work of ``a few bad \napples.'' I have long said that somewhere in the upper reaches of the \nExecutive branch a process was set in motion that rolled forward until \nit produced this scandal. To put this matter behind us, first we need \nto understand what happened at all levels of government. It is the \nresponsibility of the Senate to investigate the facts, from genesis to \napproval to implementation and abuse. However, this Senate, and in \nparticular the Judiciary Committee, continues to fall short in its \noversight responsibilities.\n  Several of the investigations into U.S. detention policies are now \ncomplete. They provide additional insight into how the prison abuses \noccurred, but their narrow mandates prevented them from addressing \ncritical issues. Overall, these investigations collectively suffered \nfrom a lack of scope and authority, leaving key inquiries into issues \nlike contractor abuses and ``ghost detainees'' unexplored.\n  Ultimately, what emerges from the reports is a striking \ncontradiction. The reports state that there was no official policy of \nabuse and they do not recommend punishment for high-ranking officials. \nAnd yet, the reports show that decisions made by top officials, \nincluding the President himself, led to the abuses that occurred in the \nfields of battle.\n  Recently, a Federal judge, recognizing the importance of government \naccountability, ordered the Bush administration to comply with a \nFreedom of Information Act--FOIA--request and release all documents \nrelated to the detentions at Abu Ghraib prison. Many of the documents \nreleased by the Administration are heavily redacted, yet reveal enough \ninformation to raise serious concerns.\n  One of the released documents, an FBI report dated May 19, 2004, \nillustrates a troubling pattern in this scandal. The redacted version \nof this document states that FBI employees at Abu Ghraib reported \nwitnessing incidents such as ``military personnel retraining a detainee \nwho was `spread eagle' on a mattress on the floor yelling and flailing \n. . . a detainee, either naked or wearing boxer shorts, lying prone on \nthe wet floor . . . [and] detainees who were ordered to strip and then \nplaced in isolation with no clothes.'' These practices potentially \nviolate the Geneva Conventions and clearly violate the FBI's own \ninterrogation rules, yet the agents did not believe they ``rose to the \nlevel of misconduct or mistreatment.''\n\n[[Page S11623]]\n\n  On May 20, 2004, I asked Director Mueller at a Judiciary Committee \nhearing whether any of his agents had encountered objectionable \npractices involving the treatment of prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan or \nGuantanamo Bay. He limited his answer to Abu Ghraib, stating that none \nof his agents had witnessed abuses in that facility. I wrote to \nDirector Mueller on October 29, 2004, asking him to clarify the \ndiscrepancy between his congressional testimony and the information \ncontained in the FBI memo. I also requested unredacted versions of all \nof the FBI documents released in response to the FOIA request. I have \nnot received a response.\n  I remain concerned about reports of prisoner abuses that have \noccurred since the Abu Ghraib scandal was publicly disclosed. Attorneys \nworking on behalf of a group of abused prisoners sent letters to \nmembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee on September 8, 2004, \nand to Vice Admiral Albert Church on October 13, 2004, notifying them \nthat torture may have continued after the Abu Ghraib abuses were \nuncovered. I sent a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld on October 29, 2004, \nasking him for assurances that the abuse of detainees has not continued \nand that all interrogation techniques now being used in U.S. detention \nfacilities comply with international treaty obligations and U.S. laws. \nAgain, I have not received a response. I hope that we do not learn of \ncontinuing abuses, yet given all that we have seen and all that we have \nyet to learn, I am still not confident that the problems have been \nsolved. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these \nthree letters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Allowing senior officials to avoid accountability sets a \ndangerous precedent. It is time for Congress, even this Republican led \nCongress, to do its job and take action. We must send a message that no \none in the chain of command--from an enlisted private stationed in Iraq \nto the commander-in-chief--is above the laws of our Nation.\n  Soon, the Senate will consider the nomination of Alberto Gonzales for \nthe position of Attorney General. The Judiciary Committee, which has \njurisdiction over the Department of Justice, will consider this \nnomination first. As I have said many times, and as I deeply regret, \nthe Committee has all but abdicated its oversight role with regard to \nthe issue of foreign detainee abuse. Last June, on a party-line vote, \nRepublicans defeated an effort to obtain documents regarding the \ndevelopment of interrogation policies that we believed to be in the \npossession of the Department of Justice.\n  Some of us had also asked Judge Gonzales, in his role as White House \ncounsel, to release documents that we believed relevant to our \ninvestigations. It is true that the White House and Department of \nJustice released a small number of documents last summer, but that \nself-serving subset of the memoranda offered a mere glimpse into the \ngenesis of the scandal. All of those documents should have been \nprovided earlier to Congress, and still much more remains hidden away \nfrom public view.\n  Judge Gonzales's role in formulating the administration's policies on \nthe detention and treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody overseas is an \nissue of significant concern. His January 25, 2002, memo to the \nPresident argues for a radical shift in our longstanding policy to \napply the Geneva Conventions to foreign prisoners. He later defended \nthis memo, stating that it only applied to al Qaeda and Taliban. As he \nstated in a June 22, 2004, news conference, ``in Iraq, it has always \nbeen U.S. position that Geneva applies . . . [B]oth the White House and \nDepartment of Defense have been very public and clear about that.''\n  Unfortunately, we have to ask Judge Gonzales if the Geneva \nConventions are actually being applied in Iraq. An October 24, 2004, \nstory in The Washington Post reveals yet another Justice Department \nmemo that relied upon questionable legal reasoning in order to \nauthorize actions that potentially violated the Geneva Conventions. The \ndraft memo, dated March 19, 2004, was written at the request of Judge \nGonzales, apparently in order to authorize the CIA to transfer \ndetainees out of Iraq for interrogation--a practice expressly \nprohibited by the Geneva Conventions. I look forward to discussing \nthese memoranda, as well as other policy decisions, in more detail with \nJudge Gonzales as we consider his nomination.\n  With the consideration of this nomination, the Judiciary Committee \nhas the opportunity to redeem itself. In my conversations with Judge \nGonzales earlier this week, I have expressed to him the need for our \nquestions to be answered. I believe that other members of the \ncommittee, on both sides of the aisle, are troubled by certain \nAdministration policies and are disturbed by the evidence of prisoner \nabuse. I hope that the Committee will fulfill its oversight \nresponsibility now.\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 2004.\n     Hon. Donald Rumsfeld,\n     Secretary of Defense,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Rumsfeld: As you know, I have closely \n     monitored the numerous ongoing and completed prisoner abuse \n     investigations instigated by the Pentagon, but remain \n     skeptical that these investigations will uncover the full \n     truth. Each of these probes is limited in scope or authority \n     and, therefore, none will comprehensively investigate the \n     abuse of detainees.\n       I am particularly concerned about the status of the ongoing \n     Pentagon investigations. In a Defense Department press \n     briefing on August 25, 2004, General Paul J. Kern said the \n     release of Admiral Albert T. Church's report was expected by \n     September 20, and would ``fill the gaps and seams.'' That \n     same day, in a separate Pentagon briefing, a senior Army \n     official said the Church report should be complete by mid-\n     September and the Formica report ``should be out soon.'' As \n     of October 29, 2004, neither investigation has been released. \n     In addition, Lt. Gen. David W. Barno stated in a Pentagon \n     briefing on October 19, 2004, that the report by Brigadier \n     General Charles Jacoby is complete, but it has not been \n     released.\n       The delay in the completion and public release of these \n     investigations raises two significant concerns. The first is \n     whether the investigations were extended due to the discovery \n     of abuses that previous investigations failed to uncover, or \n     the discovery of abuses that may have occurred since this \n     scandal was revealed in April. I recently received a copy of \n     a letter submitted to Vice Admiral Church suggesting that \n     abuses by soldiers and/or contractors continued even after \n     the abuses at Abu Ghraib were reported by the press in late \n     April. That letter is attached. My second concern is whether \n     the release of the reports is being delayed for political \n     reasons. I would like to believe this is unlikely, but \n     previous experience suggests otherwise. The Schlesinger and \n     Fay-Jones reports were released in the middle of a month-long \n     congressional recess, the Army Inspector General's report \n     received little attention because it was released on the same \n     day as the 9-11 Commission Report. Without any additional \n     information, I am forced to wonder whether the remaining \n     reports are being withheld until a politically expedient \n     time.\n       In order to better understand the current status of the \n     ongoing Pentagon investigations, I ask that you provide the \n     requested information and respond to the following questions \n     by November 15, 2004. I have not received a response to the \n     letter I sent you on October 1, 2004. 1 remain concerned \n     about the issues raised in that letter, which still awaits \n     your reply.\n       1. Please provide the current status and expected \n     completion and release dates for all ongoing investigations \n     into the abuse of detainees.\n       2. Please explain why the investigations conducted by Vice \n     Admiral Church, Brigadier General Jacoby, and Brigadier \n     General Formica are delayed beyond their expected completion \n     and release dates.\n       3. Has any ongoing investigation discovered incidents of \n     abuse that were not previously reported by the completed \n     investigations?\n       4. Has any ongoing or completed investigation discovered \n     incidents of abuse that have occurred since the Abu Ghraib \n     prison abuse scandal was reported by the press on April 28, \n     2004?\n       5. Can you assure me that all interrogation techniques now \n     being used in U.S. detention facilities comply with \n     international treaty obligations and U.S. laws?\n       As stated above, I request that you answer these questions \n     by November 15, 2004. Thank you for your prompt attention to \n     this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                September 8, 2004.\n     Senator John Warner,\n     Chair, U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Warner, Levin, and Members of the Committee: \n     On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq, \n     thank you very much for holding these hearings on the torture \n     and abuse of prisoners in Iraq. It is a great public service.\n\n[[Page S11624]]\n\n       We represent the class of persons tortured in Iraq in a \n     civil lawsuit brought against the two government contractors \n     who participated in the torture, CACI International, Inc. and \n     Titan Corporation.\n       We have learned from direct interviews conducted in Iraq in \n     August 2004 that the torture CONTINUES despite the publicity \n     surrounding the revelations of the Abu Ghraib torture. We are \n     enclosing for your information a detailed summary of facts \n     relating to the recent torture.

We ask that you hold \n     additional hearings and permit us or our clients, the \n     victims, to testify about what has and is transpiring. We \n     suggest that those hearings include questioning of \n     representatives from CACI International, Inc. and Titan \n     Corporation, the two corporations shown by the military's \n     investigation to be complicit in the torture.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact either of us if you have \n     any questions about the incidents described in the \n     attachment.\n     Susan L.

Church, III,\n     Naval Inspector General, Office of the Naval Inspector \n         General, Washington DC.\n       Dear Admiral Church: We are part of the legal team \n     prosecuting a class action seeking to hold government \n     contractors CACI and Titan Corporation accountable for their \n     role in the Iraqi prison scandal. As part of that effort, we \n     have been interviewing detainees who have been tortured or \n     abused. We have learned of many instances of torture by \n     Americans (both military and civilian) that do not appear to \n     be the subject of any ongoing military investigation.\n       We are attaching for your information a report that \n     summarizes eleven such incidents. We would very much \n     appreciate learning when investigations have been commenced \n     with respect to the incidents described in the attached \n     report. We also have additional incidents to report to \n     whomever you designate as the appropriate person to receive \n     the information.\n       Based on the information we have learned, it is clear that \n     Abu Ghraib prison was not the only prison where detainees \n     have been and are being tortured. It is also clear that the \n     publicity surrounding the Abu Ghraub photographs did not \n     prevent torture from continuing to occur.\n       As I trust you know and as explained in the enclosed \n     affidavits signed by two experienced military interrogators, \n     using torture during interrogation harms not only the victims \n     but also places American troops in grave danger. We are very \n     concerned that not enough action has been taken to halt past \n     practices. Given that the conduct at issue clearly violates \n     the Geneva Conventions and United States law, we find the \n     insufficient oversight troubling.\n       We look forward to hearing from you or your staff.\n           Sincerely,\n     Susan L.

Mr. President, I acknowledge a recent \naccomplishment in my home State of South Dakota. I am pleased to share \nwith this body that the University of South Dakota, Department of \nNursing has recently been awarded the prestigious honor of being \ndesignated as one of three National League for Nursing, Centers for \nExcellence in the United States for 2004-2007.\n  The National League for Nursing, Centers of Excellence is designed to \ndistinguish those schools that demonstrate innovation in nursing \nresearch and education. The award requires that beneficiaries be \ncommitted to continuous quality improvement in their programs. Being \nacknowledged by the National League in this regard indicates a firm \ncommitment by the school as a whole to pursue and sustain excellence in \nstudent learning, faculty development, and nursing education research. \nI am pleased that the USD Department of Nursing has earned such a high \nhonor, which is clearly the result of the hard work and dedication of \nthe faculty, staff, and students.\n  The associate degree nursing program at the University of South \nDakota is a State-funded program that is available at the main campus \nin Vermillion, SD and campuses in Sioux Falls, Rapid City, Pierre and \nWatertown. In addition, the program has a distance education \npartnership with the Good Samaritan Society in Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, \nMinnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. There are over 525 students \nenrolled in the nursing program, and 400 of those students are in \ncommunities away from the main campus in Vermillion. Such out of state \npartnerships coincides with the NLN mission to continually advance \nquality nursing education throughout the three years the school carry \nthe NLN Center of Excellence designation.\n  I am pleased with the USD Nursing School's excellent work in training \nand mentoring future health care providers. Nurses are an essential \ncomponent of the health care team and the work of the school will \nensure that in the years to come South Dakota will have access to these \nimportant health professionals. I look forward to the progress and \noutcomes that will result from this 3-year designation, and once again \ncommend the hard work of the faculty, staff, and student body who \ncontinuously strive towards improving the health and well being of \ntheir communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11624-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11624-S11625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VETERANS DAY, 2004\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, it is vital that we pause to \nremember Veterans Day, which was observed by this Nation last week. \nWhile our brave troops are protecting our freedom around the world, it \nis especially important that we honor those who have served before \nthem. We owe our 25 million living veterans our heartfelt appreciation \nfor answering the call to duty and serving this Nation in the United \nStates Armed Forces. And, this Nation must never forget the ultimate \nsacrifice paid by so many of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines.\n  Today, as it should be, military service is being held in high \nregard. The ongoing events in Afghanistan and Iraq have renewed \nAmerica's sense of gratitude toward the men and women of the Armed \nForces for the great sacrifices they make everyday on behalf of our \nNation. I personally want to thank all of our veterans and members of \nthe Armed Forces for their selfless service to this country.\n  As we observe Veterans Day, let us remember that we owe our veterans \nour honor and respect year around. It would be truly shameful if \nveterans felt forgotten except for this one day per year. There must be \nno wavering in our commitment toward those who served in the United \nStates Armed Forces.\n  I am proud to represent the State of Florida. Florida has one of the \nhighest veteran populations in the country. I am fortunate to represent \nnot only the almost 2 million veterans of Florida, but veterans all \nover this Nation. It has been my sincere pleasure and honor to serve as \nranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for these past 2 \nyears, and it is my hope that my term on the Committee has benefited \nthose men and women who have sacrificed and served on behalf of this \ngrateful Nation.\n  Throughout my tenure on this committee, I have fought very hard for \nimprovements in benefits and services to veterans. I constantly think \nof Abraham Lincoln's pledge, ``to care for him who shall have borne the \nbattle and for his widow and his orphans.'' It is especially fitting \nthat in the shadow of Veterans Day comes the passage of important \nveterans health and benefits legislation by both Chambers of Congress. \nWe must continue to advance benefits and health care for our Nation's \nbravest individuals and their families. This recently passed \nlegislation will improve and expand a host of veterans benefits, \nincluding: survivors benefits for spouses with dependent children; \nhousing benefits; and educational benefits for Guard and Reserve \nmembers, veterans, and spouses of veterans killed on active duty. I am \nproud of this legislation and hope that future Congresses continue to \nprovide veterans with a wide array of necessary benefits and services \nand strive to meet their evolving needs. Our veterans deserve no less.\n\n[[Page S11625]]\n\n  On Veterans Day, and everyday, we should honor those who have worn \nthe uniforms of our Nation. They are the best of the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11625-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NEW WAKE UP CALLS ON GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the last few weeks, we have all gotten \na loud wake up call about the changes taking place around the world due \nto global warming. Unfortunately, the Bush administration is still \nturning a deaf ear to these alarms.\n  It baffles me that anyone can still deride or ignore the signs of \nglobal warming. It's even more astonishing that some people are even \ntouting the benefits of global warming. Better access to oil and gas \nresources does not make up for flooded coastlines and the loss of \nentire species.\n  Yet the administration is still burying its head and hiding behind \nclaims of insufficient research. Despite the overwhelming scientific \nevidence put forward in two reports released by the Arctic Council and \nthe Pew Center, the President is still running away from his original \ncampaign pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n  In fact, the administration's top climate official reacted to these \ntwo new assessments of global warming by saying caps on greenhouse \ngases would not happen during this administration. Period.\n  These two reports clearly show that we cannot wait any longer. We \ncannot spend another four years hiding from the truth and delaying \nsolutions. According to the Arctic Council report, temperatures have \nrisen by up to 7 degrees in the last 50 years and the snow cover has \ndeclined 10 percent over the last 30 years.\n  These changes not only have a dramatic effect on Arctic communities, \nbut they also threaten the economy and environment of the rest of the \nworld.\n  In my corner of the globe, climate models predict that New England's \ntemperatures could rise by ten degrees over the next century.\n  In its practical effects on us and on our daily lives, that is even \ngreater than it sounds. That is greater than any climate change \nexperienced in our region in the last 10,000 years. In New England, our \neconomy and environment are directly linked. Tourism is one of the top \neconomic drivers in Vermont. Global warming threatens the revenues \ngenerated by the leaf-peepers who visit our communities in the fall, \nthe skiers who arrive in the winter, and the anglers and boaters who \ncome in the summer.\n  Climate models predict that New England forests will become populated \nmostly by oak and hickory. We will lose the brilliant red, orange and \nyellows of maple and birch trees.\n  Ski areas will have shorter seasons and will have to invest much more \nof their revenues in snowmaking. As our lakes and streams become more \nacidic and polluted, the attraction for anglers will decline.\n  Climate changes will also affect the heart of Vermont's working \nlandscape--the thousands of family-run farms, maple sugar operations \nand small woodlots. Milder winter temperatures will bring more exotic \npests that threaten our forests, worse air quality will degrade our \nsoils, and more severe weather--such as flooding and ice storms--will \ndamage farms and forests.\n  The maple sugar industry supports a $100 million annual economy in \nour state and 4000 seasonal jobs. If climate models play out, this \nindustry could be wiped out as sugar maples recede from all U.S. \nregions but the northern tip of Maine by 2100.\n  But even before that, sugarmakers are going to see their operations \naffected by warming. As every Vermonter knows, you need cold nights and \nwarm days to get the sap to run. Climate changes have already shortened \nthe tapping season by almost a month.\n  Although the changes predicted for New England are still several \nyears--and, I dearly, dearly hope, decades away--we must act now if we \nare to prevent them.\n  I applaud the actions taken by New England states to control \ngreenhouse emissions, but our states cannot do it alone. We are all in \nthis together. The Bush administration must act. Congress must act.\n  I hope that the two recent reports from the Arctic Council and the \nPew Center will prompt the White House and the Congress to recognize \nthe responsibility we all have to future generations as well as to our \nown generation to start now.\n  Passage of the Climate Stewardship Act is a first step, and it is one \nthat I hope we can take next year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one area in which the Department of the \nTreasury should increase their activities is in supporting U.S. \nfinancial service firms in opening up markets for our products in other \ncountries. In some of the most important financial markets in the world \nthe Department of the Treasury does not have personnel whose principal \nresponsibility is to assist American financial service firms expand \ntheir presence in those markets. The Department should establish \nFinancial Attaches in the following important capital markets:\n  Brussels: The expected pace of change in the EU financial markets in \nthe next few years and the complexity of capital markets legislation \nnow in formation justifies a focused U.S. presence at the center of the \nnewly expanded EU.\n  London: London's capital markets play a critical role in the global \neconomy and foreign exchange markets.\n  Shanghai: The rapidly growing Chinese economy might present \nsignificant opportunities for U.S. firms, but recent experience has \nshown that such opportunities will not materialize without vigorous \ninsistence that China abide by its commitments. It is critical that the \nU.S Treasury Department have an on-the-ground presence in China.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Department of \nTreasury to establish financial attache positions in Brussels, London \nand Shanghai and to expand opportunities for U.S. firms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11625-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11625-S11626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PRIVATIZATION OF AVIATION SECURITY SCREENERS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today the Transportation Security \nAdministration, TSA, will begin receiving applications from U.S. \nairports that wish to participate in the Screener Partnership Program. \nThis program will allow airports to hire security screeners employed by \nprivate-sector companies to provide baggage and passenger security \nscreening at their facilities for the first time since September 11, \n2001.\n  In the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11, security screening at U.S. \nairports was federalized because commercial airplanes were turned into \nguided missiles. Those attacks demonstrated that the then current \nairport security system was not working. Less than two weeks later, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, testified before the Senate \nCommerce Committee that screeners were deficient at detecting \nthreatening objects and were not given sufficient training by employers \nand access controls to secure areas in airports were weak.\n  The congressional conferees of the Aviation and Transportation \nSecurity Act, ATSA, also concluded that ``a fundamental change (is \nrequired) in the way (the U.S.) approaches the task of ensuring the \nsafety and security of the civil air transportation system.''\n  It is the responsibility of the administration and the Congress to \nensure that aviation security does not fall back to the pre-9/11 status \nquo. Congress understood the need to evaluate how well a federalized \nworkforce would compare to a privately employed workforce prior to \nallowing privatization which is why the ATSA included a 3-year screener \npilot program involving five U.S. airports.\n  Despite this pilot program, the Department of Homeland Security \nInspector General testified at a House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee hearing on April 22, 2004, that there was not \nsufficient basis to determine conclusively whether the pilot airport \nscreeners performed at a level equal to or greater than that of the \nfederal screeners. GAO, also testifying at the hearing, said, ``Little \nperformance data is currently available to compare the performance of \nprivate screeners and federal screeners in detecting threat objects.'' \nBefore the Nation's airports return to commercially hired and trained \nscreening workforces, we must make sure there has truly\n\n[[Page S11626]]\n\nbeen adequate analysis of the performance of private airport screeners \nprior to allowing privatization.\n  In a November 16, 2004, press release announcing the commencement of \nits Screener Partnership Program, TSA stated, ``An evaluation earlier \nthis year concluded there was little difference in the performance or \ncost of the private and federal screening forces.''\n  TSA is relying on a study that both the DHS IG and GAO found to be \ninconclusive. Given the high stakes involved in airport security, I am \nconcerned that the decision to begin this program is being made without \nsufficient data.\n  In addition, I have concerns about TSA's ability to award and \nadminister contracts with private screening companies based on a \nSeptember 2004 DHS IG report that found TSA mismanaged a contract with \nBoeing to install Explosive Detection Systems, EDS, and overpaid Boeing \nby approximately $49 million. According to the IG report, contractor \nperformance was not evaluated for each year of the contract until \napproximately a full calendar year later. Most troubling is that TSA \nrejected some of the IG's key criticisms, which makes me question the \nmanner in which it will manage future contracts. Moreover, I believe we \nmust also consider whether contractual mismanagement could lead to \nlapses in security. Are the right standards and policies in place to \nensure that private screeners will provide the same security as \nfederalized screeners, and is TSA equipped to enforce them?\n\n  As the ranking member of the Financial Management Subcommittee and \nthe Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I have long worked on the \nchallenges of Federal acquisitions. I want to make sure that DHS, which \nis a composite of 22 legacy agencies, has the people and tools needed \nto solicit and manage the Screener Partnership Program. Just this week \nI contacted Secretary Ridge to express my concern about the $49 million \noverrun of the Boeing EDS installation contract. That wasted money \ncould have gone a long way towards helping Honolulu International \nAirport in my home State of Hawaii install inline EDS machines.\n  My interest is to improve the management of contracts and the \ncollection of timely and accurate information and to stop erroneous and \nimproper payments to contractors. For that reason I was pleased to work \nwith my good friend, Senator Fitzgerald, in passing legislation to \nbring the Department of Homeland Security under the Chief Financial \nOfficers Act, CFO. The Department runs the risk of becoming a morass of \nhidden contract costs and poorly managed programs without a strong CFO \nto ensure accountability and transparency.\n  I would, however, like to commend TSA for honoring a commitment made \nby Admiral Stone at his confirmation hearing before the Governmental \nAffairs Committee that Federal screeners at airports which chose to use \na private workforce give TSA screeners the right of first refusal for \njobs. It is important that the substantial investment made by the \nFederal Government in the hiring, the training, and the deployment of \nFederal screeners not go to waste.\n  I plan to monitor very carefully how this plan develops, both in \nterms of the level of security provided to the traveling public and the \nlevel of transparency and accountability of the contracts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11626-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION OF FLIGHT SERVICE STATIONS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I express my concerns \nregarding Federal Aviation Administration proposals to consolidate and \noutsource the actions currently executed by our Nation's Flight Service \nStations.\n  Flight Service Stations are staffed by highly trained specialists and \nplay an important role in providing pilots with valuable weather \nbriefings and enroute communications, as well as facilitating search \nand rescue services. Each air traffic specialist is trained to \nunderstand the rapidly changing weather and geographic patterns of \ntheir area. Their expertise has kept flights running smoothly and has \nliterally saved lives.\n  In 1997, the Federal Aviation Administration completed a 16-year \neffort to consolidate Flight Service Stations, reducing their total \nnumber from 318 sites to 61 sites. Since July 2002, the FAA has been \ndeveloping studies regarding the outsourcing and further consolidation \nof 58 of the remaining 61 stations, excluding the three stations in \nAlaska. The FAA has announced that a final decision regarding the fate \nof these 58 Flight Service Stations will be made before March 17, 2005, \npossibly as soon as January.\n  I have received letters, phone calls, e-mails, and visits from South \nDakotans concerned about the FAA's proposed actions. After the first \nconsolidation in 1997, Flight Service Station sites in Aberdeen, Rapid \nCity, Watertown, and Pierre, SD, were closed. Closure of the Flight \nService Station in Huron, the last in South Dakota, would leave pilots \nisolated from weather updates, emergency assistance, and other vital \nnotices. Weather is the leading cause of aviation accidents and the \ngreatest contributor to fatalities. South Dakota cannot afford the loss \nof this crucial site.\n  My concerns and the concerns of South Dakotans are echoed in our \nState's legislature. In February 2004, the South Dakota Legislature \napproved a concurrent resolution supporting the Flight Service Station \nin Huron, SD, and encouraging efforts to preserve its functions. \nAdditionally, our Governor has publicly expressed his opposition to the \npossible outsourcing of operations conducted at the Flight Service \nStation.\n  Flight safety is paramount and must be the most important factor in \nany decision that is made. However, it is the concern of many in my \nState that the proposed action will be detrimental to flight safety. I \nstrongly urge the FAA to reevaluate their plans to allow for the \ncontinued effectiveness of Flight Service Stations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11626-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11626-S11627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HOUSE PASSAGE OF THE INTERNET TAX NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the House of \nRepresentatives passed today the Internet Tax Non-Discrimination, Act, \nS. 150, clearing this bipartisan bill for its signature into law by the \nPresident. This bipartisan legislation will continue to support \nelectronic commerce by keeping it free from discriminatory and multiple \nState and local taxes and from Internet access taxes.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor and strong supporter of this compromise \nlegislation to extend for the next 3 years the moratorium on taxes on \nInternet access and multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic \ncommerce. In addition, our bipartisan bill will safeguard fees for \nuniversal service and 911 or E-911 services and does not affect the \nemerging technology of Voice Over Internet Protocol, VOIP. I thank \nSenator Wyden, Senator Allen, Senator McCain, Representative Cox, \nRepresentative Sensenbrenner, Representative Conyers, and others for \ntheir leadership on this legislation.\n  The Internet has changed the way we do business. Today businesses can \nsell their goods and services all over the world in the blink of an \neye. E-commerce has created new markets, new efficiencies and new \nproducts.\n  The growth of electronic commerce is everywhere, and it has been \nimportant to the businesses and the economy of my home State of \nVermont. For example, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, which employs \nmore than 300 Vermonters, sells online 60 percent of its bears during \nits two busiest times of the year for Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. \nThat is 60 percent of all Vermont Teddy Bears sold online during this \nbusy time.\n  Hundreds of Vermont businesses are selling online, ranging from Al's \nSnowmobile Parts Warehouse to Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream. These \nVermont cybersellers are of all sizes and customer bases, from Main \nStreet merchants to boutique entrepreneurs to a couple of famous ex-\nhippies who make great ice cream.\n  What Vermont online sellers have in common is that Internet commerce \nallows them to erase the geographic barriers that historically limited \nour access to major markets. With the power of the Internet, Vermonters \ncan sell their products and services anywhere and at any time.\n  Although electronic commerce is beginning to blossom, it is still in \nits infancy. Stability is the key to reaching its full potential, and \ncarving out new\n\n[[Page S11627]]\n\ntax categories for the Internet is exactly the wrong thing to do.\n  E-commerce should not be subject to new taxes that do not apply to \nother commerce. Indeed, without a moratorium, there are 30,000 \ndifferent jurisdictions around the country that could levy \ndiscriminatory or multiple Internet taxes on E-commerce.\n  Let's not allow the future of electronic commerce--with its great \npotential to expand the markets of Main Street businesses--to be \ncrushed by the weight of discriminatory or multiple taxes.\n  Extending the bar on Internet access taxes will help Vermonters end \nthe digital divide and help Vermonters compete for better jobs. Earlier \nthis year, the University of Vermont released a study that found only \n39 percent of Vermonters who earn less than $20,000 a year have \npersonal computers, while 67 percent of Vermonters who earn more than \n$35,000 a year own personal computers. And 92 percent of Vermonters who \ndo own a computer are connected to the Internet. We have to close this \ndigital divide for Vermonters to have the skills for the good-paying \njobs of the 21st century.\n  The Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act will bar Internet access taxes \nand multiple or discriminatory taxes on goods and services sold over \nthe Internet to provide the stability necessary for electronic commerce \nto flourish, and to help close the digital divide for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11627-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PERMANENT NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS FOR ARMENIA\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

It allows Armenian products continued access \nto the U.S. market at low tariff rates and will go a long ways towards \noffsetting the impact of Turkish and Azeri blockades that cost Armenia \nas much as $720 million annually.\n  Simply put, this means jobs and rising living standards for Armenians \nwho want to stay in their country and create a better tomorrow for \ntheir children. Armenians have worked so hard to overcome the horrors \nof the past to build a country based on values Americans and Armenians \nboth share: freedom, democracy, open markets, respect for human rights \nand the rule of law. We should stand behind those efforts.\n  I am proud to represent over a half million Armenian Americans in \nCalifornia. They are a strong, vibrant community who have enriched the \nculture of our State and participated in every aspect of its civic \nlife.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting PNTR for Armenia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11627-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF CLARE COTTON\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto the outstanding contributions made to the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts by Clare Cotton, president of the Association of \nIndependent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts. Next month, \nClare will retire after 17 years of impressive service and advocacy on \nbehalf of 55 Massachusetts colleges and universities, their students, \nand faculty.\n  In fact, Clare's contributions to higher education reach far beyond \nour State. His dedication, knowledge, and passion for education have \nimproved the lives of countless students in communities across America. \nIt is difficult to consider any aspect of policy in higher education \nwithout thinking of Clare and calling upon his expertise. All of us who \nknow him will miss him greatly.\n  Clare's leadership in higher education is based on his brilliant \nintellect, his love of learning, and his sound political instincts. In \nconversation, he could call up specifics of accounting regulations \ngoverning private colleges and universities, refer to undergraduate \nenrollment trends in science and math, and discuss the impact of both \non a pending piece of legislation.\n  His work in 1997 as a member of the National Commission on the Cost \nof Higher Education is still cited by leaders of all sectors in the \nfield. Need-based aid never had a better advocate than Clare, when he \nserved first as a member and then as chairman of the congressionally \nauthorized Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance during \n2002 and 2003.\n  Whatever the issue, Clare is adept at assessing its political and \neconomic cost to students and institutions, and he has championed \ncolleges and universities and their students for nearly all of his \nprofessional life.\n  His impressive contributions have earned him distinguished status in \nthe national associations of Colleges and Universities, and he has \nserved in leadership positions in two of these organizations. Almost no \npolicy decision could be made without Clare's wise counsel and support.\n  Clare's brilliant career was very much honed at the local level. From \n1977 to 1987, he was president of the Boston-Fenway Program, an urban \nplanning group of 12 non-profit educational, cultural and medical \ninstitutions. Long before it became fashionable, Clare helped build an \neducational consortium that was able to maximize scarce financial \nresources and enhance both the quality and depth of these landmark \ninstitutions in Boston. Community policing in Boston was born through \nClare's work with the Fenway consortium.\n  Earlier in his career, Clare had also been a writer and a journalist. \nHe was director of European Securities Publications in London during \nthe 1960s, and he also served as a correspondent for The Wall Street \nJournal.\n  Anyone in our nation who hopes for a better life and sees college \neducation as the means for achieving it owes Clare Cotton a tremendous \ndebt of gratitude. Our colleges and universities and Congress alike \nhave benefited from his wise counsel, gentle humor, tireless \ndedication, and skillful advocacy. I wish him a long and happy \nretirement with his wonderful wife Helen, their four remarkable \nchildren, and their nine grandchildren, and I salute him for all he has \ndone so well for Massachusetts and our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11627-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11627-S11628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INTERNET ACCESS TAX MORATORIUM\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Internet plays a critical role in \ntoday's global economy. It allows us to work harder, faster, and more \nefficiently. With the click of a mouse, we can seal business deals, \nsend birthday cards, and buy cars. We have come to rely on its ability \nto connect us with people and places around the world. Today Congress \ncleared an important piece of legislation that will help keep the \ninternet affordable and accessible for all Americans.\n  Today's passage in the House of S. Con. Res. 146, which amends S. \n150, signals the end of months of long and difficult negotiations. I \nwould like to commend my colleagues, Senators Allen, Wyden, Alexander, \nCarper, Voinovich and McCain for their commitment to this issue. Their \nhard work has allowed us to pass a fair and reasonable moratorium on \ninternet access taxes. The moratorium will protect all Internet users, \nregardless of connection platform, while ensuring that states and \nlocalities do not lose billions in tax revenue.\n  The moratorium on internet access taxes is necessary now because \nbroadband technology is still in its infancy in many parts of the \ncountry. In Wyoming, we have a number of small towns where Internet \nservice is limited to 14.4 Kbps dial-up service. At that speed, it \ntakes all day to download one song--a song that was legally obtained, \nof course. The only way we are going to improve the availability of \nbroadband services in places like rural Wyoming is by eliminating \nunnecessary and burdensome taxation and regulation. Consumers in every \npart of the country want and deserve internet access. The internet \naccess tax moratorium will make sure they can afford to subscribe to \nwhatever service is available. I am confident that as more consumers \nspend their hard-earned money on Internet services, the cable \ncompanies, telephone carriers, satellite providers and other Internet \nservice providers, ISPs, will invest more of their money in deploying \nhigh-speed broadband services.\n  Renewing the Internet tax moratorium is important for consumers, but \nit is also a major issue for states and local communities that rely on \ncertain tax revenue from telecommunications.\n\n[[Page S11628]]\n\nThese state and local governments have made the decision to tax certain \nservices and, as a former mayor and State legislator, I respect their \nability to do so. However, I agree with my colleagues that Internet \naccess is a special service that should be tax free. The difficult part \nis trying to define what ``Internet access'' actually is. We have spent \nmonths listening to telecommunications providers, consumers, and local \nofficials define what telecommunications services are and when and \nwhere telecommunications taxes should start and stop. Not surprisingly, \nthe groups have disagreed more often than not. Despite the struggle, I \nbelieve we came up with a reasonable compromise on the definition and \nthe grandfather clauses, which will give our state and local \ngovernments the time they need to phase out taxes imposed prior to the \nmoratorium.\n  Now that we have passed the moratorium on Internet access taxes, I am \nanxious to refocus some of our energy on a bill I introduced in both \nthe 107th and 108th Congresses. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Act \nwould simplify the extremely cumbersome network of State sales and use \ntaxes and help States begin to recover from years of budgetary \nshortfalls. The bill would authorize States that have signed the \nStreamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement and have passed legislation \nsimplifying their tax system to require all sellers to collect and \nremit sales taxes.\n  My streamlined bill, which has 20 cosponsors this year, is a critical \nbill that many of my colleagues are learning more about and recognizing \nits growing importance as Internet usage explodes. Two years ago the \nrevenue loss attributed to the Internet sales tax loophole was fairly \nminimal. Today, the revenue loss has ballooned as online and other \nremote sales have increased. The States have responded to this budget \ncrisis by signing the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement and \nimplementing legislation that drastically simplifies their sales and \nuse tax systems. In fact, 21 States have already signed into law the \nnecessary implementing legislation, while 8 others are currently in the \nprocess of doing so.\n  As the States continue to make progress on reforming their sales tax \nsystems, I would urge Congress to make progress on a bill that will \nprovide to the states the authority they need to collect their own \ntaxes. I intend to introduce the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Act \nagain next year and hope to work with the Finance Committee Chair and \nother members of the Senate to pass it into law.\n  In the meantime, I am pleased we will have in place a moratorium that \nrecognizes the importance of the Internet and will allow it to grow and \nprosper in the coming years.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11628-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DR. RICHARD AXEL\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Richard \nAxel, the co-recipient of the 2004 Nobel Prize for Physiology or \nMedicine. Dr. Axel received this prize for research that he and his co-\nrecipient Dr. Linda Buck conducted on the ways in which our brains \nprocess smells. Drs. Axel and Buck are pioneers in the field of sensory \nbiology, and have contributed much to our knowledge of how humans \ncomprehend olfactory information. Their prize-winning research was \nconducted at Columbia University Medical Center, where Dr. Axel is a \nUniversity Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and \nPathology.\n  Dr. Axel grew up in Brooklyn and received his earliest training at \nManhattan's Stuyvesant High School. Because of his interest in science, \nhe found a job as a glassware washer at a Columbia medical research \nfacility, where he was soon promoted to a research position. By the \ntime he graduated from Columbia College, his work had already been \npublished in scientific journals. Dr. Axel has spent the majority of \nhis subsequent career performing neuroscience research at Columbia \nUniversity.\n  I would like to note that Dr. Axel's prize is the latest in a series \nof distinguished scientific honors earned by residents of New York. The \n2003 Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded to Dr. Roderick MacKinnon of \nRockefeller University, and in 2000, Dr. Eric Kandel of Columbia \nUniversity was one of the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Physiology \nor Medicine.\n  Next month, Dr. Axel will travel to Stockholm to accept the 2004 \nNobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. I ask that all of my colleagues \njoin me in congratulating Dr. Axel for receiving this tremendous honor. \nI look forward to learning of the future discoveries that will result \nfrom Dr. Axel's groundbreaking research.\n  I ask that an article about Dr. Axel from In Vivo, the Columbia \nUniversity Medical Center campus newspaper, be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n\n                       A Life in Science Rewarded\n\n                           (By Susan Conova)\n\n       Discoveries made at CUMC about the sense of smell go beyond \n     providing a description of what most people think is merely \n     an aesthetic sense. Instead, understanding how the brain \n     distinguishes among a bewildering array of different odors \n     gives scientists a much greater understanding of how the \n     brain works.\n       ``Odors generate specific behaviors and specific thoughts \n     and how that happens is still an unsolved and fascinating \n     mystery in brain science,'' says Richard Axel, M.D., \n     University Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics \n     and Pathology and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology \n     or Medicine on Oct. 4. ``Knowing how our perceptions of the \n     external world, including smell, impact our emotions and our \n     behavior will be extremely important in thinking about \n     diseases like schizophrenia to understand how the brain \n     works.''\n       When Dr. Axel and his former postdoctoral researcher Linda \n     Buck, Ph.D., of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center \n     and a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, \n     began their work in the late 1980s, very little was known \n     about the sense of smell.\n       In 1985, Dr. Buck came across a paper describing the \n     unsolved question of how odors are detected in the nose and \n     was immediately hooked by ``the monumental problem and a \n     wonderful puzzle.''\n       ``This paper opened up a fascinating new world for me,'' \n     she wrote earlier this year in the journal Cell. ``It was \n     estimated that humans could perceive 10,000 or more chemicals \n     as having distinct odors. How could the olfactory system \n     detect such an enormous diversity of chemicals? And how could \n     the nervous system translate this complexity of chemical \n     structures into a multitude of different odor perceptions?''\n       The questions would remain unanswered unless the receptors \n     responsible for picking up odorants in the air were \n     identified. In 1988, Dr. Buck, working in Dr. Axel's lab at \n     P, started tracking them down.\n       Several initial attempts failed. ``Linda was an extremely \n     creative and tenacious Fellow,'' Dr. Axel says. ``The \n     solution to this problem took quite a long time, but the \n     thoughtfulness of her approach made me think she would \n     eventually succeed.''\n       In 1991 Drs. Axel and Buck broke the field open when they \n     published a paper describing an enormous family of genes in \n     mice that coded for 1,000 different receptors. The study was \n     reported in newspapers and other news media worldwide. Later \n     work revealed about 350 functional receptor genes in humans.\n       ``We were quite surprised that up to 5 percent of the \n     genome was taken up by odor receptors,'' says Dr. Axel, also \n     a member of Columbia's Center for Neurobiology and Behavior. \n     ``That's a sharp distinction to the three genes that the \n     visual system uses to discriminate several hundred different \n     hues. It shows that a system like the visual system would be \n     inadequate to distinguish among the rich variety of odors in \n     the environment.''\n       Gerald Fischbach, M.D., executive vice president and dean, \n     says the finding ranks among the most important discoveries \n     of the past 50 years: ``The discovery of the genes opened up \n     a field of sensory biology that didn't exist before.''\n       Once the receptor genes were identified, both researchers \n     independently moved to the more complex question of how the \n     brain knows what the nose smells, with the support of the NIH \n     and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, where the two are \n     investigators. Their labs and others have revealed that part \n     of the answer is that each odor produces a unique spatial \n     pattern, or map, of neuronal activity in the brain's \n     olfactory center. If the olfactory center was laid out like a \n     map of the United States, it would be as if the aroma from a \n     rose would light up Boston, New York, and San Francisco, \n     while rotting food would light up Los Angeles and Denver.\n       The question now, Dr. Axel says, is figuring out how an \n     organism uses these odor maps. We can look down at the maps \n     of activity in an organism's brain and see what it's \n     smelling, but how does the process actually work within an \n     organism? ``To know that the world is interested in our work \n     will, I think, intensify our efforts toward reaching an \n     answer,'' Dr. Axel says.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11628-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11628-S11629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONGRATULATING DR. RHONA CAMPBELL FREE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, congratulate Dr. Rhona \nCampbell Free,\n\n[[Page S11629]]\n\nan economics professor at Eastern Connecticut State University. \nYesterday, Dr. Free was honored by the Council for Advancement and \nSupport of Education and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of \nTeaching as one of four recipients of the U.S. Professors of the Year \nAward. I would like to congratulate Dr. Free, as well as Dr. Douglas \nCooper, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of \nConnecticut, the winner of the Professor of the Year award for the \nState of Connecticut.\n  This award is the only national honor that specifically recognizes \nexcellence in teaching and mentoring at the undergraduate level. Over \n300 nominees for the award were evaluated on their impact and \ninvolvement with students, their scholarly approach to teaching, their \ncontributions to undergraduate education, and support from their \ncolleagues and students.\n  Dr. Free, who received her doctorate from the University of Notre \nDame, has taught economics at ECSU since 1983. During that time, she \nhas distinguished herself among her peers through her commitment to her \nstudents and to teaching. She helped found the Connecticut Consortium \nfor Learning and Teaching, a statewide organization devoted to \npromoting excellence in teaching. She is also a member of the \nConnecticut Campus Compact, which focuses on service learning.\n  Dr. Free's students know her as a professor who brings ideas from \ndifferent academic fields into her classroom, and who creates new and \ninnovative courses such as Economics of Professional Sports. She has \nalso devoted her time and energy to improve academic advising and \nfreshman orientation at ECSU. Her methods, techniques, and enthusiasm \nhave won praise from fellow professors and students alike. In 2001, she \nwas awarded the university's Distinguished Faculty Award.\n  Dr. Rhona Free is truly an inspiration, not only to students and \nteachers, but to all of us who strive to make this country a better \nplace for our children and grandchildren. In a demanding profession, \nshe has gone above and beyond her duties and responsibilities to truly \nmake a difference in the lives of not only her own students, but \nstudents and professors throughout the State of Connecticut. I \ncongratulate her on her accomplishments, and I wish her continued \nsuccess in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11629-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MS. JUDITH MAYNARD\n\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary Vermonter, Ms. Judith Maynard, who was recently named a \nNational Distinguished Principal. As one of 65 principals chosen \nnationwide, this award places Ms. Maynard in an elite class of \neducators.\n  Ms. Maynard has dedicated her life to the education and well-being of \nVermont children. After working her way through an undergraduate and \ntwo masters' degrees at the University of Vermont, she launched her \ncareer as an educator. For the past 26 years, Vermont students have \nbenefited from her extraordinary leadership. She has served as the \nprincipal of Chamberlin School in South Burlington, Vermont for the \nlast eleven years and headed the Folsom School in South Hero for 10 \nyears before that.\n  At Chamberlin, Ms. Maynard sought out grant money to hire the \ndistrict's first school social worker--helping prevent problems at home \nfrom damaging students' performance at school. She has reworked the \nschool's curriculum to provide focused, cohesive instruction across \ngrade levels. She has made a priority of spending as much time as \npossible with her students, personally tutoring them in math and never \nsaying no to those students who want to read a book with her or discuss \nlosing a tooth. And she has fought to ensure that her young students \nhave access to a nutritious breakfast at school, providing them with \nthe fuel they need to successfully get through the school day.\n  The impact of her efforts is clear. Standardized test results on \nmathematics problem solving for fourth-graders at her school have \njumped in the last 2 years from 48 percent achieving the benchmark of \nsuccess in 2002 to 70 percent in 2004. These are impressive gains by \nany measure.\n  Ms. Maynard's leadership demonstrates the importance of having \nstrong, dedicated principals in each of our schools. Providing vision, \ndirection and support to all who work under the schoolhouse roof \nensures that our children receive the best possible education. Together \nthey provide our children with the skills and confidence needed to \nachieve their goals and lead happy, meaningful lives. America's future \ndepends on the efforts of exceptional educational leaders like Judith \nMaynard. I congratulate her for her success and salute her for her \ntireless dedication to the children of Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11629-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO SPECIALIST JEREMY F. REGNIER, LITTLETON, NH\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor \nSP Jeremy F. Regnier of Littleton, NH for his service and supreme \nsacrifice in the service of his country.\n  Specialist Regnier demonstrated a willingness and dedication to serve \nand defend his country by joining the National Guard soon after this \ncountry was attacked in September 2001. Just as many of America's \nheroes have taken up arms in the face of dire threats, Jeremy too, \ndedicated himself to the defense of our ideals, values, freedoms, and \nway of life. His valor and service cost him his life, but earned him a \nplace on the roll call of honor within the pantheon of heroes this \ncountry has produced.\n  Following basic training and a tour in the National Guard, Jeremy \njoined the regular Army as a Bradley Vehicle Crewman and was assigned \nto various units, eventually joining his comrades in 4th Battalion, 5th \nAir Defense Artillery Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division. From this unit's \nhome base in Fort Hood, TX, he would deploy in March 2004 to Iraq in \npursuit of those who would threaten our way of life.\n  Throughout his short career, Jeremy developed a long list of \naccolades and experiences which testify to the dedication and devotion \nhe held for the Army, his fellow soldiers, and his country. With tours \nin New Hampshire, Korea, Texas, and Iraq, Jeremy's expertise \ncontributed greatly to his unit's successes and cemented his place as a \nparticipant in the great endeavor known as America. Jeremy was \nrecognized for his service by the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart \nMedal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the National \nDefense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, \nthe Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service \nMedal, the Army Service Ribbon, and the Overseas Service Ribbon.\n  My condolences and prayers go out to Jeremy's family, and I offer \nthem my deepest sympathies and most heartfelt thanks for the service, \nsacrifice, and example of their soldier, SP Jeremy Regnier. Jeremy \nexemplified the words of Daniel Webster who said, ``God grants liberty \nonly to those who love it, and are always ready to guard and defend \nit.'' Because of his efforts, the liberty of this country is made more \nsecure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11629-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11629-S11630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JIMMY RAY LOYLESS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJimmy Loyless, who has worked as a congressional fellow in my office \nsince January of 2004. On behalf of my staff and the people of South \nDakota, I would like to thank Jimmy for his hard work, his dedication, \nand his considerable contributions to my State and to this great \nNation.\n  Jimmy chose a Presidential election year to join our staff to work on \nbanking and tax issues, and he has spent the past year learning about \nwhat can and can't happen in the United States Senate in a politically \ncharged atmosphere. Jimmy left the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, his home for the past 24 years, to spend a year learning \nabout the legislative process. And what a year it has been.\n  Jimmy came on board around the time that a series of scandals rocked \nthe mutual fund industry, and almost immediately Jimmy was called upon \nto sit through a long series of hearings and witnesses. While learning \nthe nitty-gritty of an industry may not be the most glamorous of \nduties, I am hopeful that at the very least, Jimmy learned a thing or \ntwo that may help\n\n[[Page S11630]]\n\nhim manage his own finances as well. In the end, Congress chose to let \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission work through a series of \nregulatory changes to clean up the industry, but I am confident that \nthe Committee's thorough investigation played a key role in forcing \nboth the SEC and the industry itself to adopt critical changes to \nprotect small investors.\n  Jimmy also got a close-up view of how Congress crafts tax \nlegislation. For the better part of a year, the Senate crafted and \ndebated the Jumpstart our Business Strength Act, S. 1637. Jimmy played \na key role for our office, and helped to ensure that key provisions \nregarding tribal bonding authority were drafted and inserted into the \nbill. Unfortunately, those provisions, which would have provided \ncritical economic development tools to Native Americans, were stripped \nout by the Republican majority in the House of Representatives as part \nof election year politics. This was a particularly demoralizing moment \nfor those of us who care so deeply about South Dakota and Native \nAmerican communities throughout the United States, yet Jimmy managed to \nremain optimistic and cheerful about what we can accomplish in the next \nround.\n  Having a financial services expert on board was indispensable when a \nlarge foreign conglomerate, Rabobank, announced its proposed takeover \nof South Dakota's local Farm Credit Service lender. Jimmy took the lead \non analyzing the possible impact on South Dakota farmers, ranchers and \nlenders, and displayed a deep understanding of the needs of rural \nAmerica.\n  Jimmy got a bit more than he bargained for when our lead banking \nstaffer went out on maternity leave. Jimmy rose to the occasion, \nhowever, and performed admirably on such issues as reauthorization of \nthe National Flood Insurance Program, tracking progress on the Basel II \ncapital accords, evaluating the merits of a controversial preemption \nruling by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and developing \nproposals to reduce, in a responsible manner, the regulatory burden on \nour nation's financial institutions. In addition, Jimmy has provided \nkey insights into the development of a South Dakota program to develop \ncybersecurity programs for financial institutions.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention Jimmy's role in our \ncontinued efforts to pass comprehensive deposit insurance reform. \nAlthough we were hopeful that Jimmy would be the Johnny Damon of \ndeposit insurance reform, the Boston Red Sox managed to win the World \nSeries while our reform bill will live to see yet another Congress.\n  It is my pleasure and honor to stand before the Senate today to thank \nJimmy Loyless publicly for his service to the United States Senate. I \nam pleased he will continue to serve our country by returning to the \nFDIC, which is lucky to have him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11630-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GRAND MA'S STORY\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I recently received a letter from \nIva D. Fesler Johnson. In it, she recalls what her grandmother, whom \nshe called ``Grand Ma,'' told her about slavery. I would like to thank \nher for sharing this with me. Grand Ma's story is one of strength and \nperseverance--a story that took place during one of the darkest points \nin our Nation's history. The following is the story contained in the \nletter:\n\n       On January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln signed the \n     Emancipation Proclamation declaring ``All Slaves Free.''\n       I, Iva D. Jones, was born the daughter of Richard and \n     Lottie Foster Jones. My father's mother was Cicly Belle \n     Graham, the daughter of Henry and Fanny Graham. She was my \n     grandmother. She was a slave.\n       ``Grand Ma,'' as we called her, was brought to this country \n     from Africa by ship. Grand Ma was sold three times by auction \n     on the auction block at Washington, Kentucky. She was sold to \n     the highest bidder. She was given the name of her slave \n     master. So, she was Cicly Marshall at one time, another time, \n     Cicly Smith.\n       Grand Ma plowed the fields with oxen. She was the mother of \n     nine children. She birthed some of the children in the field \n     that she was plowing. Her slave master did not allow her to \n     return to the cabin in which she lived until the day's work \n     was done. She worked from sun up to dark. She was not paid \n     any money for this work.\n       She was married three times by jumping across a broomstick.\n       The slaves would sometimes try to escape from the ``Life of \n     Slavery'' to Canada. Grand Ma tried to escape. She was caught \n     by ``Blood Hounds'' and ``Slave Catchers.'' She was punished \n     by being whipped, and salt and pepper was put on the cuts \n     made by the whip to help healing.\n       Grand Ma developed the gift of mid-wife. She delivered two \n     sets of twins for her daughter, Margaret O'Banion, and her \n     husband, Lucian O'Banion.\n       The slaves could not read or write. No one in the slave \n     owner's family was allowed to teach the slaves because it was \n     against the law. Some taught the slaves to read and write in \n     secret. There were no schools for the slaves until after they \n     were free.\n       Grand Ma said she saw President George Washington and \n     President Abraham Lincoln.\n       Grand Ma lived through the Civil War. She said she prayed \n     we would one day have a place to worship God under our own \n     vine and fig tree and the slave master's whip would no longer \n     be stained with African blood. God has answered her prayers. \n     God has given us places to worship.\n       One writer states, slavery lasted 250 years in the United \n     States. Millions of people were sold into bondage so that \n     their owners could grow rich, selling sugar, tobacco, rice, \n     and cotton grown by their slave laborers. The slaves loved to \n     sing as they worked--such songs as ``Steal Away to Jesus,'' \n     ``Go Down Moses,'' and ``Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.''\n       At dawn, the slaves would awake every morning except Sunday \n     to the sound of the overseer's horn. Men, women, and children \n     would scramble out of a pile of straw, piled high on the mud \n     floor of their hut, with hoe in hand to the field. Mid-\n     morning, they were told to fix their breakfast, which was \n     cornmeal put in a pot of boiling water to make hoe-cakes. The \n     hoe-cakes were cooked on the blade of their hoe over the \n     fire. Once a week, they were given a little piece of salt \n     pork and fish.\n       Sometimes the slaves would drop little pieces of grains in \n     the boiling water.\n       The slaves did not have shoes to wear and their clothes \n     were ragged.\n       The slave master would ride a horse to the slave auction. \n     The slaves were chained together, barefoot and raggedy. They \n     were taken to the auction block.\n       As they worked in the field, the overseer would ride a \n     horse to watch the slaves work. If he thought the slaves were \n     not working hard enough, he would flog them with a cowhide \n     whip.\n       After slavery, Grand Ma worked for pay because she had to \n     find a home. The master's wife told Grand Ma to leave Grand \n     Ma's daughter, whose name was Ellen, with her while she \n     looked for a home. Grad Ma said on Sunday morning a man \n     riding a horse told Grand Ma, Ellen is dead and buried. \n     Little Ellen was nine years of age. The man told Grand Ma \n     that the missus said Ellen wasn't washing the hearth right. \n     So the missus hit Ellen in the head with a sick of wood and \n     Ellen died.\n       Other slaves were sold at auction, and members of a family \n     were separated. Husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, and \n     children did not know the whereabouts of others.\n       Grand Ma was finally able to get a home of three rooms on a \n     one acre lot in Lewisburg, Kentucky.

You may be familiar with this corporation's \namusing advertisements featuring Gert Boyle, the matriarch and \nchairwoman of the company, testing her products under various extreme \nconditions.\n  This is a $40 million dollar facility occupying 428,000 square feet. \nIt could add up 400 new jobs to the area, not including any other \nindirect employment. This site will enable Columbia to have better \naccess to its markets in the Midwest and on the East Coast. The \nindustrial park that the center is built on was the result of \ncooperation between Henderson, McLean, Union, and Webster Counties. I \nwas very impressed by how the region pulled together to make this \nproject happen.\n  I believe that this distribution plant will bring jobs and other \neconomic benefits to this area. Columbia Sportswear is good company and \nI am excited to welcome them to Western Kentucky. I look forward to the \npositive impact they will have on the community.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11631-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11631]]\n          AMERICAN LEGION SENIOR BASEBALL TEAM PADUCAH POST 31\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

In December 19, 2004 this team \nwill be gathering to award each team member the World Series Ring to \nCommemorate their accomplishments. I congratulate the Paducah post 31 \nAmerican Legion Senior Baseball Team on their accomplishments and look \nforward to seeing their continued success in the future.\n  This band of gifted athletes and team players has consistently \nfielded team after team in their region. Their competition was intense \nand they have distinguished themselves just as much by their own skill, \nas by the skill of those they defeated. They began their season as just \none team among 5,400 others from all over the United States and Puerto \nRico competing to be in the American Legion World Series. They ended it \nas one of eight teams from all over the United States and Puerto Rico, \nthat actually did compete in the American Legion World Series.\n  As a baseball player I am especially proud of the accomplishments of \nthis team from my own State of Kentucky. I know what it means to have \nplayed the good game, fought the good fight and won. The feeling that \nyou have done the right thing by trying your hardest is payback enough. \nBut Post 31's baseball team did that and much more, they not only tried \ntheir hardest, they also made it to the American Legion World Series.\n  I am proud of a team that when it does its best, makes it all the way \nto the World Series Eight.

Mr. President, in January the National Renewable \nEnergy Laboratory in Golden, CO, will have to say goodbye to the man \nwho has been their director since 1997. Admiral Richard Truly has \nbrought a great deal to NREL and I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize him for his many impressive achievements, and to thank him \nfor his service to NREL, to Colorado, and to the Nation.\n  Admiral Truly has a biography that is as diverse as it is \ninteresting. For many being the director of a national lab, and \nmanaging an annual research budget of about $200 million, would be the \ncrowning highlight of a career. And such may be the case for Admiral \nTruly. But with all of the other experiences he has had, there would be \ntough competition.\n  If you ask the Admiral how he first became interested in the issue of \nenergy and technology development the story would probably start \nsomething like, ``when I was orbiting Earth in the space shuttle . . \n.'' Few people have had the experience of orbiting the Earth, and that \nexperience has obviously widened the field of how he views problems. \nOne often hears him relate the fact that seeing the Earth from space \nhelped him to see that issues that may seem isolated to a distinct \nregion, are really the results of a larger global challenge.\n  Admiral Truly piloted the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1981 and \ncommanded the Challenger in August and September, 1983. He left to \nbecome the first commander of Naval Space Command in 1983, and served \nas the Administrator of NASA from 1989 to 1992, under the first \nPresident Bush. After the tragic Challenger accident, he led the \naccident investigation and was vital in rebuilding the Space Shuttle \nprogram. He also won the approval of President Reagan and Congress to \nbuild Endeavor, which replaced the Challenger. Under his direction NASA \nfinalized plans for building the Space Station and implemented a number \nof streamlining reforms.\n  During Admiral Truly's tenure at NREL there have been many strides \nand innovations in the research done there. In the last 7 years the \nscientists at NREL have been able to improve wind technology, the \nfastest growing source of electric energy; increase the efficiency, and \ndecrease the cost of solar energy; and advance the technology of bio-\nenergy, which converts plant and animal waste to energy. These \ntechnological advancements provide great benefits to our economy, while \nalso benefiting the environment.\n  However, the economy and the environment are not the only \nbeneficiaries of Truly's work. Because he has helped NREL to become one \nof the premier research laboratories in the world, Colorado is the home \nto world-class scientists and researchers. Coloradans have a direct \nexposure to the newest, most up-to-date technology in the renewable \nindustry. Numerous individuals, businesses and communities have \nbenefited from partnerships with NREL which have produced new \ntechnological processes. Admiral Truly was instrumental in leading the \nlab down the path of success.\n  He has been the recipient of numerous awards, including the \nPresidential Citizen's Medal which was awarded by President Reagan in \n1989. But one can see the personal side of Admiral Truly when he is \naround his staff, and others in the community. He is an unassuming and \nsincere person, with a ready smile for everyone he sees. He has a real \ninstinct for what is best for the institution, but seems to balance \nthat with what is best for the individuals. He also gives much of his \ntime to community activities. In Colorado he has been an active \nadvocate for the scientific and academic communities, and is a member \nof the Colorado Governor's Commission on Science and Technology, The \nRegis University Board of Trustees, and the Advisory Board to the \nColorado School of Mines Board of Trustees. He has also served on the \nPrinceton Plasma Physics Laboratory Advisory Council, the Board of \nVisitors to the U.S. Naval Academy, the Defense Policy Board and the \nArmy Science Board.\n  As I close, I wish to extend my thanks, but also the thanks of the \npeople of Colorado and the Nation. Admiral Truly has given a large part \nof his life to public service and helping to better the world around \nhim. I congratulate him on his retirement after a long and prosperous \ncareer, and wish him luck and happiness as he embarks on the next phase \nof his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11631-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11631-S11632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING THE LIFE OF MILTON D. STEWART\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to a champion of this Nation's small businesses and to honor \nthe work, dedication and life of Milton D. Stewart, the first Chief \nCounsel for the Office of Advocacy at the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration. Mr. Stewart passed away at the age of 82, following an \nextensive and diverse career that included entrepreneurship, \ngovernment, service to small businesses, law, journalism, and academia.\n  One of the most highly successful innovations of the House and Senate \nSmall Business Committees came with the creation of the Office of \nAdvocacy within the Small Business Administration. This office was \nestablished to represent and advance small business interests before \nother Federal agencies and the Congress. Congress recognized the \nimportance of small business to the competitiveness of the American \neconomy and understood that government sometimes can get in the way of \nsmall businesses doing what they do best--creating jobs.\n  Over the years, the Office of Advocacy has had a great deal of \nsuccess and its hand has been strengthened by further congressional \naction, such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act in 1980 and the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act in 1996. The actions of \nthe office have resulted in billions of dollars in regulatory cost \nsavings for small entities, reducing barriers to market entry and \npromoting entrepreneurship.\n  This success is due in no small part to the solid beginnings of the \nOffice of Advocacy under the leadership and through the vision of the \nvery first Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Milton D. Stewart. Milt, in his \ntenure as Chief Counsel from 1978 to 1981, laid the groundwork for the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, the first White House Conference on Small \nBusiness, the Small Business Innovation Development Act, and many other \ninitiatives that are now considered part of the core small business \npolicies within this country.\n  Formerly a small business owner and financier, Milt brought a level \nof commitment and passion for fostering the\n\n[[Page S11632]]\n\nentrepreneurial spirit. Early in his life, in a family-owned small \nbusiness begun and managed by his parents, he acquired great respect \nfor the skill and courage of small business entrepreneurs. During his \ntenure in service to small businesses, Milt served as President of the \nNational Small Business Association, the National Association of Small \nBusiness Investment Companies and the Small Business High Technology \nInstitute.\n  Milt also had significant government service beginning with the \nOffice of War Information during World War II. He also served as \nspecial counsel to Governor Harriman of New York and to the New York \nState Thruway Authority, a Presidential delegate to the second White \nHouse Conference in 1986 and Special Counsel to the third White House \nConference Commission in 1995. While he was Chief Counsel, his charisma \nand vision inspired many of those who worked with him and helped \ndevelop sound small business policy for our Nation.\n  His involvement in and dedication to the small business community has \nmade a difference in the lives of millions of entrepreneurs. Thanks to \nhim, small firms now have a greater voice in the creation and \nimplementation of the regulations that govern the way they do business. \nHis family and friends can take pride in that legacy and in Milt's \ntremendous public service.\n  My condolences go out to his wife, Joan, and to his children, \ngrandchildren and great grandchildren on their loss. Together, we mourn \nthe departure of a great man who embodied the American entrepreneurial \nspirit. He will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11632-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to recognize National \nAdoption Day which is this Saturday, November 20. National Adoption Day \nis a collaborative effort to raise awareness about the thousands of \nchildren in foster care waiting to be adopted. There are an estimated \n542,000 children in foster care in the United States, and over 126,000 \nof them are waiting to be adopted.\n  This day is meant to celebrate and honor all those loving parents who \nadopt children and to bring attention to the children in foster care \nwaiting to be adopted. On Saturday, an unprecedented number of courts \nthroughout the nation will finalize the adoption of thousands of \nchildren from foster care. For the last 4 years, local adoption \nagencies, courts, and advocacy organizations have come together on \nNational Adoption Day to help children in need of a permanent home.\n  The number of children in foster care has nearly doubled since 1987, \nand the average time a child remains in foster care is 3 years. Sadly, \nalmost 20,000 children in foster care age out of the system each year \nwithout ever being placed with a permanent family. If only one out of \nevery 500 Americans adopted, all foster children would be placed in \nhomes.\n  As a father of two adopted children, I know the love and joy that \ncomes from adoption. I commend the National Adoption Day partners for \ntheir efforts and their dedication in working toward a day when all \nchildren will have a permanent, loving family to call their \nown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11632-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WHRI-AM AND WRHM-FM\n\n Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I would like to \ntake this opportunity to recognize WHRI-AM and WRHM-FM for their \ncombined 100 years of service to Rock Hill, York County, and the State \nof South Carolina.\n  WHRI first signed on the air in the Rock Hill community in December \n1944. During its 60-year history, the station has remained dedicated to \nproviding quality programming and has been a committed partner in \ncommunity development.\n  WHRI operates under a principle established by its founder, Jim \nBeaty: ``Never underestimate the audience.'' In doing so, the station \nprovides coverage of local and national news, sports, and events.\n  WHRI remains an active participant in the community, the station and \nits staff contribute time and talent to numerous service projects. One \nof WHRI's greatest success stories has been their involvement with the \nShrine Bowl. When this all-star football game featuring high school \nathletes from North and South Carolina came to Rock Hill in 2001 there \nwere only a handful of stations that carried the game. Three years \nlater the network has been expanded to 50 stations. This increased \nexposure has also helped bring greater awareness to the cause of the \nShriners and helped them raise additional funds for their hospitals.\n  WHRI has remained dedicated to serving the community in which they \nlive. In keeping with their commitment to service, WHRI purchased WRHM \nin 1987. WRHM signed on the air in Lancaster more than 40 years ago in \nJuly 1964. After a 3-year station upgrade in the late 1980's, WRHM grew \nto serve a large region of South Carolina. Today, WRHM is broadcast to \nmore than 15 counties in North and South Carolina, and continues the \nsame tradition of excellence and regional service inspired by the \nsuccess of their sister station.\n  I wish WHRI and WRHM continued success for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11632-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11632-S11633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO BOB AND BETH KENNETT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to commend the work of \nBob and Beth Kennett. The Kennett's own the Liberty Hill Farm in \nRochester, VT, where Beth runs a bed and breakfast on the farm, and Bob \noversees the dairy operation of 70 cows. The Kennett's demonstrate to \ntheir guests that dairy farming in Vermont is more than a job or an \nindustry; it's a way of life. Vermont's landscape is defined by the \ngreen pastures and silos that dot the hills. Our agricultural economy \ndepends on the hundreds of millions of dollars dairy farmers bring to \nthe State every year. Through the Kennett's combination of agri-tourism \nand dairying they are helping to ensure farming is not only a part of \nVermont's past, but a vital part of Vermont's future.\n  I ask that a recent article about the Kennett's be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n                    [From the Burlington Free Press]\n\n                         Just Asking To Survive\n\n                            (By Erin Kelly)\n\n       Twenty-five years after they bought their small dairy farm \n     in Vermont's picturesque White River valley, Bob and Beth \n     Kennett find themselves alone.\n       ``When we moved here, there were 11 farms shipping milk,'' \n     said Beth Kennett, who helps her husband run a farm of 70 \n     milk cows in Rochester, VT. ``We are now the last dairy farm \n     in our valley.''\n       Small dairy farms like the Kennetts' are disappearing \n     throughout America. In the last half-century, the percentage \n     of U.S. farms with milk cows has plunged from nearly 62 \n     percent in 1954 to 4 percent in 2002, according to the \n     Department of Agriculture.\n       Farmers say that number will keep dropping if a federal \n     dairy subsidy expires as scheduled in October 2005.\n       At stake for the farmers is a way of life that in many \n     cases dates back generations. Suburbanites and urban dwellers \n     also have something to lose, farmers warn.\n       If the farms go, their green pastures will be replaced with \n     shopping malls and housing tracts. Fresh milk produced \n     locally could be replaced by milk shipped by tanker truck \n     thousands of miles from mega-dairy farms in the West.\n       ``The consumer is not going to benefit if all the milk is \n     produced in just a few places,'' Beth Kennett said. ``Why not \n     have local milk for local markets?''\n       Small dairy farmers won a victory last month when the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee approved a plan to extend the \n     federal dairy subsidy to at least 2007, when it could \n     be renewed again as part of a new farm bill. The plan, \n     pushed by Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Herb Kohl, D-Wis.; \n     and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., still must be approved by the \n     full Congress.\n       An effort to attach the subsidy to a Homeland Security bill \n     failed this past weekend, but lawmakers vowed to try again \n     this year.\n       The subsidy, which has cost taxpayers about $2 billion \n     since its passage in 2002, sends payments to dairy farmers \n     whenever the price of milk drops below a certain level, \n     basically guaranteeing farmers a minimum price. Small \n     farmers, those with about 130 cows or fewer, benefit most.\n       While some are pushing for the short-term extension of a \n     tax subsidy for dairy farmers, other dairy state lawmakers \n     want a different, long-term solution one that could raise the \n     price of a gallon of milk for consumers.\n       Instead of a taxpayer subsidy, the National Dairy Equity \n     Act would require milk processors to pay farmers a minimum \n     price for their milk.\n       If the proposal becomes law, consumers could pay as much as \n     20 cents more per gallon of whole milk, warns the \n     International Dairy Foods Association, which represents\n\n[[Page S11633]]\n\n     processors. Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., says the group is \n     grossly exaggerating the cost as a scare tactic.\n       Ken Bailey, associate professor of dairy markets at \n     Pennsylvania State University, said even an increase of a few \n     cents could hurt sales of milk, which has dropped in \n     popularity. The percentage of raw milk being turned into milk \n     to drink declined from 40 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in \n     2000, with the rest used to make cheese or other dairy \n     products.\n       When the retail price of milk went up in May and June, \n     sales fell 3 percent, Bailey said.\n       ``It doesn't make sense to design a whole federal policy \n     around a small and declining segment of the dairy market,'' \n     Bailey said. ``What the federal government should be doing is \n     getting out the way and encouraging innovation and the \n     creation of new dairy products. In Europe, liquid yogurt \n     beverages are very popular. Our thinking is still stuck back \n     in the 1950s when everybody had a glass of milk with \n     dinner.''\n       Carl Greene, a sixth generation dairy farmer in Berlin, \n     N.Y., said that with a little help from Washington, he is \n     optimistic that the farm he works with his brother and father \n     will survive for a long time to come.\n       ``Any help we get will make us more competitive,'' he said. \n     ``We'll reinvest it back into the farm.''\n       Beth Kennett, who runs a bed and breakfast out of her \n     Rochester farmhouse to help make ends meet, said the city \n     folks who visit seem willing to help once they see what's at \n     stake. People need to realize that retail milk prices which \n     have stayed fairly steady at $2.62 to $2.76 a gallon over the \n     last eight years are a bargain and don't reflect the farmers' \n     true cost, Kennett said.\n       ``Our guests, once they see the hard work that goes into \n     it, say they'd be more than happy to pay an extra nickel for \n     milk to keep Farmer Bob going,'' Kennett said. ``We're not \n     asking to make huge profits. We're just asking to \n     survive.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11633-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DAVID DIETZ\n\n Mr. BIDEN.

David is a stellar \nexample of an individual whose remarkable success in business has not \ndiminished his commitment to the betterment of his community and those \nin need.\n  If you traveled around Delaware asking folks about David Dietz, you \nwould quickly learn the extent of his impact. In the business world, \nDavid has served on numerous committees, won an abundance of awards, \nand his restaurant, the Brandywine Brewing Company, in Greenville, has \nbeen named the Best of Delaware several times over. Yet I believe that \nit is when David steps out of his role as businessman and entrepreneur \nhe truly shines.\n  David is a man with many causes--juvenile diabetes, child abuse \nprevention--but it is his involvement with women's health that moves me \nto recognize him today.\n  In 1993, as a response to Delaware's high breast cancer mortality \nrate, my wife Jill was driven to form the Biden Breast Health \nInitiative. BBHI is a nonprofit organization devoted to educating young \nwomen on breast health and the importance of early detection in \nfighting breast cancer. Two years ago, BBHI introduced the Educate For \nLife scholarship program, which offers three grants to Delaware high \nschool seniors--one student from each of Delaware's counties--who will \npursue educational opportunities in the fields of health care or \neducation. This year, as well as the year of its inception, the Educate \nfor Life benefit has been sponsored by David's restaurant, and it has \nbeen a resounding success.\n  David not only generously donates his time and expertise to the \nplanning and implementation of the event, but also a portion of the \nevening's proceeds.

A bill to establish a Division of Food and Agricultural \nScience within the National Science Foundation and to authorize funding \nfor the support of fundamental agricultural research of the highest \nquality, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BOND. I rise today to introduce legislation with Senator \nMikulski, Senator Bennett, and Senator Harkin to establish a division \nof food and agricultural science within the National Science Foundation \nto support fundamental agricultural research of the highest quality. I \npresent this to begin a critical discussion that I believe we must have \nover the next several months and perhaps over the next year or so about \nhow we are going to ensure we capitalize on the technology to maximize \nthe benefits and minimize the costs of our agricultural production.\n\n  We remain the world leader in food and fiber production. We do it \nsafely and through technology and the hard work of the American farmer. \nIn the past half century, the number of people fed by a single U.S. \nfarm has grown from 19 to 129. We have a tremendously innovative \nagricultural research program. Our farmers, our farm leaders are on the \ncutting edge of developing new technology. And we have seen the \ninnovations continue to come down the pike. This has made it possible \nfor one farmer to feed 129 people.\n  In addition, we export $60 billion worth of agricultural products, \nand we do so at less cost and at less harm to the environment than any \nof our competitors around the world, again, because of new practices, \ndiligence on the part of farmers, and new technology.\n  In a world that has a decreasing amount of soil available for \ncultivation, we have a growing population and we still have 800 million \nchildren who are hungry or malnourished throughout the world. As some \nhave said: A person who is well fed can have many problems. A person \nwho is hungry has but one problem. Unless we maximize technology and \nnew practices, production will continue to overtax the world's natural \nresources.\n  Many people legitimately have raised concerns regarding new diseases \nand pests and related food safety issues. And they are growing. The \nleading competitiveness of our U.S. producers is only as solid as our \nwillingness to invest in forward-looking investments and build upon our \nhistoric successes.\n  Now, we also know from past experience that with new technology the \ndoors are being opened to novel new uses of renewable agricultural \nproducts in the fields of energy, medicine, and industrial products. In \nthe future, we can make our farm fields and farm animals factories for \neveryday products, fuels, and medicines in a way that is efficient and \nbetter preserves our natural resources. Advances in the life sciences \nhave come about, such as genetics, proteomics, and cell and molecular \nbiology. They are providing the base for new and continuing \nagricultural innovations.\n  It was only about a dozen years ago that farmers in Missouri came to \nme to tell me about the potential that genetic engineering and plant \nbiotechnology had for improving the production of food, and doing so \nwith less impact on the environment, providing more nutritious food. \nSince that time, I have had a wonderful, continuing education, not in \nhow it works but what it can do.\n  We know now, for example, that in hungry areas of the world as many \nas half a million children go blind from vitamin A deficiency, and \nmaybe a million die from vitamin A deficiency. Well, through plant \nbiotechnology, the International Rice Research Institute in the \nPhilippines has developed Golden Rice, taking a gene from the \nsunflower, a beta-carotene gene, and they enrich the rice. The Golden \nRice now has that vitamin A, and that is going to make a significant \ndifference in dealing with malnutrition.\n  We also know that in many areas of the world, where agricultural \nproduction has overtaxed the land, where drought has cut the \nproduction, where virus has plagued production, the way we can make \nfarmers self-sufficient, where we can restore the farm economy in many \nof these countries, is through plant biotechnology.\n\n  But this is just the beginning. This legislation I am introducing \ntoday is a discussion draft which I hope is going to lay the foundation \nfor tremendous advances in the future.\n\n[[Page S11642]]\n\n  This legislation stems from findings and recommendations produced by \na distinguished group of scientists working on the Agricultural \nResearch, Economics and Education Task Force, which I was honored to be \nable to include in the 2002 farm bill. The distinguished task force was \nled by Dr. William H. Danforth, of St. Louis, the brother of our former \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Jack Danforth. Dr. Bill Danforth has a \ntremendous reputation in science and in education, with a commitment to \nhuman welfare and is known worldwide. He was joined by Dr. Nancy Betts, \nthe University of Nebraska; Mr. Michael Bryan, president of BBI \nInternational; Dr. Richard Coombe, the Watershed Agricultural Council; \nDr. Victor Lechtenbert, Purdue University; Dr. Luis Sequeira, the \nUniversity of Wisconsin; Dr. Robert Wideman, the University of \nArkansas; and Dr. H. Alan Wood, Mississippi State University.\n  I extend my congratulations and my sincere gratitude to Dr. Danforth \nand his team for providing the basis and the roadmap to ensure we have \nthe mechanisms in place to solve the problems and capitalize on the \nopportunities in agricultural research. The full report of the task \nforce can be found at www.ars.usda.gov/research.htm.\n  In summary, that study concludes that it is absolutely necessary we \nreinvigorate and forward focus our technology to meet the \nresponsibilities of our time. New investment is critical for the \nworld's consumers, the protection of our natural resources, the \nstandard of living for Americans who labor in rural America, and for \nthe well-being of the hungry people and the needy people throughout the \nworld.\n  I look forward to pursuing this vision in the 109th Congress. I \ninvite my colleagues who are interested in science and research to \nreview this report, to look at this measure, to join with me and my \ncosponsors in the next session of Congress to talk about moving forward \non what I think will be a tremendous opportunity to improve agriculture \nand its benefits to all our populations.\n  Now, I cannot speak for all agricultural groups, but I talked to \nagricultural leaders of the various commodities, the farm organizations \nin my State of Missouri. They are very excited about it because these \nare the people who have been on the leading edge, who have pushed for \nthe new technology, who have pushed for the new research that has \nenabled them to go from feeding 19 people per farmer a half century ago \nto feeding 129 people per farmer.\n  Madam President, this, I hope, will be the start of something really \nbig. So, with that, I send the draft of the legislation to the desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3009\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Food and \n     Agricultural Science Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Council.--The term ``Council'' means the Standing \n     Council of Advisors established under section 4(c).\n       (2) Director.--Except as otherwise provided in this Act, \n     the term ``Director'' means the Director of Food and \n     Agricultural Science.\n       (3) Division.--The term ``Division'' means the Division of \n     Food and Agricultural Science established under section 4(a).\n       (4) Foundation.--The term ``Foundation'' means the National \n     Science Foundation.\n       (5) Fundamental agricultural research; fundamental \n     science.--The terms ``fundamental agricultural research'' and \n     ``fundamental science'' mean fundamental research or science \n     that--\n       (A) advances the frontiers of knowledge so as to lead to \n     practical results or to further scientific discovery; and\n       (B) has an effect on agriculture, food, human health, or \n     another purpose of this Act, as described in section 3(b).\n       (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Agriculture.\n       (7) United States.--The term ``United States'' when used in \n     a geographical sense means the States, the District of \n     Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and all \n     territories and possessions of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Agricultural Research, Economics, and \n     Education Task Force established under section 7404 of the \n     Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 3101 \n     note) conducted an exhaustive review of agricultural research \n     in the United States and evaluated the merits of establishing \n     1 or more national institutes focused on disciplines \n     important to the progress of food and agricultural science. \n     Consistent with the findings and recommendations of the \n     Agricultural Research, Economics, and Education Task Force, \n     Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Agriculture in the United States faces critical \n     challenges, including an impending crisis in the food, \n     agricultural, and natural resource systems of the United \n     States. Exotic diseases and pests threaten crops and \n     livestock, obesity has reached epidemic proportions, \n     agriculturally-related environmental degradation is a serious \n     problem for the United States and other parts of the world, \n     certain animal diseases threaten human health, and United \n     States producers of some major crops are no longer the \n     world's lowest cost producers.\n       (2) In order to meet these critical challenges, it is \n     essential that the Nation ensure that the agricultural \n     innovation that has been so successful in the past continues \n     in the future. Agricultural innovation has resulted in hybrid \n     and higher yielding varieties of basic crops and enhanced the \n     world's food supply by increasing yields on existing acres. \n     Since 1960, the world's population has tripled with no net \n     increase in the amount of land under cultivation. Currently, \n     only 1.5 percent of the population of the United States \n     provides the food and fiber to supply the Nation's needs. \n     Agriculture and agriculture sciences play a major role in \n     maintaining the health and welfare of all people of the \n     United States and in husbanding our land and water, and that \n     role must be expanded.\n       (3) Fundamental scientific research that leads to \n     understandings of how cells and organisms work is critical to \n     continued innovation in agriculture in the United States. \n     Such future innovations are dependent on fundamental \n     scientific research, and will be enhanced by ideas and \n     technologies from other fields of science and research.\n       (4) Opportunities to advance fundamental knowledge of \n     benefit to agriculture in the United States have never been \n     greater. Many of these new opportunities are the result of \n     amazing progress in the life sciences over recent decades, \n     attributable in large part to the provision made by the \n     Federal Government through the National Institutes of Health \n     and the National Science Foundation. New technologies and new \n     concepts have speeded advances in the fields of genetics, \n     cell and molecular biology, and proteomics. Much of this \n     scientific knowledge is ready to be mined for agriculture and \n     food sciences, through a sustained, disciplined research \n     effort at an institute dedicated to this research.\n       (5) Publicly sponsored research is essential to continued \n     agricultural innovation to mitigate or harmonize the long-\n     term effects of agriculture on the environment, to enhance \n     the long-term sustainability of agriculture, and to improve \n     the public health and welfare.\n       (6) Competitive, peer-reviewed fundamental agricultural \n     research is best suited to promoting the fundamental research \n     from which breakthrough innovations that agriculture and \n     society require will come.\n       (7) It is in the national interest to dedicate additional \n     funds on a long-term, ongoing basis to an institute dedicated \n     to funding competitive peer-reviewed grant programs that \n     support and promote the highest caliber of fundamental \n     agricultural research.\n       (8) The Nation's capacity to be internationally competitive \n     in agriculture is threatened by inadequate investment in \n     research.\n       (9) To be successful over the long term, grant-receiving \n     institutions must be adequately reimbursed for their costs if \n     they are to pursue the necessary agricultural research.\n       (10) To meet these challenges, address these needs, and \n     provide for vitally needed agricultural innovation, it is in \n     the national interest to provide sufficient Federal funds \n     over the long term to fund a significant program of \n     fundamental agricultural research through an independent \n     institute.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the Division established \n     under section 4(a) shall be to ensure that the technological \n     superiority of agriculture in the United States effectively \n     serves the people of the United States in the coming decades, \n     and to support and promote fundamental agricultural research \n     of the highest caliber in order to achieve goals, including \n     the following goals:\n       (1) Increase the international competitiveness of United \n     States agriculture.\n       (2) Develop foods that improve health and combat obesity.\n       (3) Create new and more useful food, fiber, health, \n     medicinal, energy, environmental, and industrial products \n     from plants and animals.\n       (4) Improve food safety and food security by protecting \n     plants and animals in the United States from insects, \n     diseases, and the threat of bioterrorism.\n       (5) Enhance agricultural sustainability and improve the \n     environment.\n       (6) Strengthen the economies of the Nation's rural \n     communities.\n       (7) Decrease United States dependence on foreign sources of \n     petroleum by developing bio-based fuels and materials from \n     plants.\n       (8) Strengthen national security by improving the \n     agricultural productivity of subsistence farmers in \n     developing countries to\n\n[[Page S11643]]\n\n     combat hunger and the political instability that it produces.\n       (9) Assist in modernizing and revitalizing the Nation's \n     agricultural research facilities at institutions of higher \n     education, independent non-profit research institutions, and \n     consortia of such institutions, through capital investment.\n       (10) Achieve such other goals and meet such other needs as \n     determined appropriate by the Foundation, the Director, or \n     the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to provide for the establishment of a controlled \nsubstance monitoring program in each State; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n  Introduction of the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic \n                         Reporting Act of 2004\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nSessions, Senator Durbin and Senator Dodd in introducing the ``National \nAll Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act.'' Our goal is to \nassist States in establishing in electronic databases to monitor the \nadministration of prescription drugs and deal more effectively with the \ngrowing national problem of prescription drug abuse.\n  Our Health Committee listened carefully to the thoughtful concerns \nand comments of the expert witnesses who testified at our recent \nhearing on this issue, and we have sought to meet these concerns in our \nbill.\n  Over 6 million Americans currently use prescription drugs for non-\nmedical purposes. 31 million adults and adolescents have reported \nabusing prescription drugs at least once. Since 1992, the number of \nyoung adults who abuse prescription pain relievers and other \npotentially addictive drugs has more than tripled. Prescription drug \nabuse among youths of age 12 to 17 has increased tenfold.\n  State efforts to monitor the prescribing of potentially addictive \nmedications can help curb this abuse. Currently, 19 States have such \nmonitoring programs in place, including Massachusetts, and they vary \nwidely in the collection and storage of data and the methods used for \nprotecting privacy, while using the information in the databases to \nencourage the non-medical use of prescription drugs and reduce their \ndiversion for illegal purposes.\n  This bill authorizes the Secretary of HHS to award grants to states \nto establish prescription drug monitoring programs. For States with \nexisting programs, the Secretary can award grants to upgrade their \nsystems, standardize the data collected, and allow its sharing among \nStates. The legislation includes an important provision allowing States \nwith existing programs to receive funding, even if it is not feasible \nfor the States to meet all the conditions required for new programs. \nThe legislation recognizes that existing programs have been designed \nwith the specific needs of each state in mind, and we should not block \nfunding, even if particular programs do not match exactly the template \nin the bill.\n  Any such program, however, must include strong safeguards for medical \nprivacy, and must make certain that the database cannot be used to \nbring improper pressure on physicians to avoid prescribing essential \nmedication for patients in need. The proper treatment of patients in \npain, for example, is an enormous medical challenge, and this essential \nmedical mission will be more difficult if patients fear that the \nprivacy of their prescription histories will not be protected, or if \nphysicians begin to look over their shoulders whenever they prescribe \nneeded pain medication. The legislation permits state programs to \nrelease data under controlled and limited conditions. It is important \nto note, however, that States are free to impose even more stringent \nrestrictions on the release of data than those required under our \nlegislation.\n  We all share the goal of reaching the right balance between the \ninterests of patients, physicians, and law enforcement. Our bill \nrequires that in their grant applications, each State must propose \nsecurity standards for the electronic databases, including appropriate \nencryption or other information technology. In their applications, \nStates must also set standards for use of the database, including a \ndescription of a process to certify that requests for information are \nlegitimate. The bill also requires the Secretary to provide an analysis \nof the privacy protections within two years after enactment.\n  Prescription drug abuse has been increasing every year. Physicians \nwant to treat pain, and law enforcement officials want to stop the flow \nof prescription drugs from the pharmacies to the streets. A national \nprescription drug monitoring program will be a valuable resource to \nachieve both goals. I commend Senator Sessions for his leadership on \nthis important health issue, and I look forward to early action by \nCongress to deal with this serious national problem.\n\n[[Page S11644]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 3016. A bill to promote freedom, economic growth, and security in \nAsia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with my good \nfriend from Indiana, the ``Asia Freedom Act of 2004''.\n  We offer this bill with the full knowledge that it will neither be \nconsidered nor voted upon by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations \nbefore the 108th Congress ends. Rather, we intend today's introduction \nto mark what we hope is the start of broader discussion between our \nrespective offices and the Administration on America's foreign policy \ntoward Asia.\n  The Act is based on the Freedom Support Act for the Former Soviet \nUnion and provides an integrated and coherent framework for U.S. policy \ntoward North and Southeast Asia. It creates 10 broad development \nactivities for the region--ranging from democracy to security and the \nenvironment--and endorses the establishment of a coordinator of \nassistance to the region at the State Department, and a deputy \ncoordinator at USAID.\n  The Act defines eligibility requirements for U.S. foreign assistance \nfor central governments in the region based on their respective \ncommitments to, among other things, the advancement of freedom and \njustice and efforts to crack down on international terrorism. It \nrequires the State Department to judge central governments of countries \nin the region not by what they say, but rather by the concrete actions \nthey undertake to further democracy, security and stability in the \nregion.\n  The Act requires a number of annual reports, including a description \nof democracy building activities conducted by the United States, the \nEuropean Union, the United Nations and other countries and \ninstitutions, and a listing on a country-by-country basis of known \npolitical prisoners.\n  Taking a cue from President Bush's January 12, 2004 proclamation \ndenying current and former corrupt public officials entry into the \nUnited States, the Act provides authority for the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to deny visas to those officials in the region whose actions \nhave had an adverse impact on the advancement of democracy, human \nrights, the rule of law and economic freedom in the region.\n  The Act is necessary to ensure that appropriate and continuous \nattention is paid by the U.S. Congress and the Administration to the \nmarch of political and economic freedom across Asia. Much ground has \nbeen gained over the past year, particularly with successful \npresidential and parliamentary elections in Indonesia, but more must be \ndone, whether in Burma, Cambodia or Thailand.\n  In short, the Asia Freedom Act guarantees America's focus, foreign \npolicy and foreign assistance are targeted toward an increasingly \nimportant region of the world.\n  Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3016\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Asia Freedom Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       Liberty is a universal and inalienable right, and, in light \n     of the progress of the people of North and South East Asia in \n     achieving political, economic, and legal reforms, the \n     advancement of democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and \n     economic freedom in North and South East Asia is and will \n     remain a central objective of United States foreign policy.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF NORTH AND SOUTH EAST ASIA.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``North and South East Asia'' means \n     Burma, Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, Hong \n     Kong, Indonesia, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, Mongolia, the \n     People's Republic of China, the Philippines, the Republic of \n     Korea, Singapore, Brunei, Papua New Guinea, the Socialist \n     Republic of Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, the Republic of the \n     Fiji Islands, the Independent State of Samoa, the Solomon \n     Islands, the Kingdom of Tonga, Tuvalu, the Republic of Nauru, \n     the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of \n     Micronesia, the Republic of Vanuatu, and Tibet.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to direct the Inspector General of the Department of \nJustice to submit semi-annual reports regarding settlements relating to \nfalse claims and fraud against the Federal Government; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill directing \nthe Inspector General of the Department of Justice to submit semi-\nannual reports regarding settlements relating to false claims and fraud \nagainst the United States.\n  The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729 et seq., is the Government's \nsingle most effective program for recouping money improperly obtained \nfrom the United States by false claims and fraud. Initially passed \nduring the Civil War at President Abraham Lincoln's request to suppress \nfraud against the Union Army, the FCA was modernized and updated in \n1986. Since President Ronald Reagan signed the 1986 amendments into \nlaw, settlements and judgments in FCA cases have exceeded $13 billion. \nNo other antifraud program of the federal government can match this \nresult.\n  Despite the significance of these results, the Congress does not have \na way to evaluate the performance of the FCA program. While the \nprogram, which is overseen by the Civil Division of the Department of \nJustice, appears to be doing well, it is not known at this time how the \nprogram is performing as compared to its potential. What percentage of \nthe various frauds perpetrated against the United States is recouped in \nFalse Claims Act cases? How effectively does DoJ capture the multiple \ndamages and penalties provided for by the act? How quickly does DoJ \nmove FCA cases? How effectively does DoJ use the tools provided to it \nby the FCA, such as civil investigative demands? How effectively does \nDoJ use relators and how well does it reward them?\n  The purpose of this bill is to require the submission of the \ninformation that will allow Congress to evaluate of DoJ's performance \nin managing FCA cases. Thus, under this bill the Department of Justice \nwill be required to describe its settlements of FCA cases. The report \nto Congress shall include a description of the estimated damages \nsuffered by the United States, the amount recouped, the multiplier used \nto calculate the settlement amount, the criminal fines collected and \nwhether the defendants were held liable in previous cases. The report \nwill also inform Congress as to whether the defendants have been \nrequired to enter into corporate integrity agreements.\n  In addition, in order to understand how the program is working, the \nDepartment of Justice will be required to inform Congress as to whether \ncivil investigative demands were issued. The Department will also be \nrequired to provide certain information about the conduct of qui tam \ncases initiated by whistleblowers. For example, Congress will receive \ninformation about the length of time cases are under seal, whether \nwhistleblowers (technically termed ``relators'') sought a fairness \nhearing regarding a settlement and what share of the settlement they \nreceived. The Congress would also receive information about whether the \nagency that suffered from the fraud involved participated in the \nsettlement.\n  In regard to cases involving Medicaid Fraud, the report will provide \nCongress with the details of how much money was returned to each state \nparticipating in the settlement. In a time when many States are \nstruggling with their Medicaid budgets, the Congress needs to know how \neffectively DoJ is in suppressing Medicaid fraud and returning money to \nthe States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 3020. A bill to establish protections against compelled disclosure \nof sources, and news or information, by persons providing services for \nthe news media; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to send a copy of this bill to \nthe desk to be printed in the Record. It is not going to be referred to \nany committees in the waning minutes of this 108th Congress, but I will \nsubmit it for the Record. My plans are to reintroduce this legislation \nin January when we reconvene for the 109th Congress.\n  I thought it might be helpful to have this legislation in the Record \nfor my colleagues to review. It is called the Free Speech Protection \nAct of 2004.\n\n[[Page S11647]]\n\n  This bill is designed to ensure that the free speech guarantees \nenshrined in the First to the Constitution will be strong and effective \nfor many generations to come. After all, it is the free flow of news \nand information to the public on a wide variety of concerns which makes \nour democracy vibrant and alive.\n  Indeed, the very design of our democratic institutions is premised in \nlarge part upon an informed citizenry that could exercise informed \njudgments.\n  As James Madison once observed:\n\n       Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And apeople who \n     mean to be their own Governor, must arm themselves with the \n     power that knowledge gives.\n\n  Madison and the other Founders of our great Republic understood full \nwell that the best guarantee of a knowledgeable citizenry is a free \npress and a public free to speak to the press. The press must be free \nto report on the human condition, the conduct of public officials, \nmatters of business and corporate governance, as well as the strengths \nand weaknesses of our society and its institutions.\n  A free press must also be able to access a broad spectrum of views \nfrom a wide variety of sources. Once individuals deliberate over such \ninformation, they are able to make more educated decisions. In \naddition, they can also more effectively and intelligently participate \nin matters of public concern. To quote Madison once again:\n\n       Popular government without popular information or the means \n     of acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce, or a tragedy, \n     or perhaps both.\n\n  In fact, one of the hallmarks of a totalitarian government is that \nthe state controls the press and similar sources of public information. \nSuch regimes are characterized by extreme levels of secrecy and a total \nlack of transparency. The free flow of information to the public is \ngreatly restricted. Criticism of the government could result in \nimprisonment or even death.\n  In recent memory, such regimes existed in Nazi Germany, the Soviet \nUnion, and Saddam Hussein's Iraq, where the press was often used as a \ntool for propaganda. Unfortunately, there are still a number of \ngovernments around the globe today that greatly restrict the flow of \nnews and information to their citizens.\n  The United States, in its formative years, never chose that path. The \nFounding Fathers of this great Nation of ours knew the value of a free \npress because they had often been denied it by their colonial rulers. \nRepressive measures had long been part of English history in this \nregard, such as the censorship of published materials and a licensing \nsystem whereby nothing could get published without the government's \nconsent.\n  Our Founding Fathers recognized then that for a society to remain \nfree, it must also allow for divergent views and opinions to be \nexpressed, and for ideas to be openly exchanged. In many respects, the \nrights of free speech and a free press protect the government from \ntrampling on the other political and personal liberties all Americans \nhold so dear.\n  Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are like the government \nwatchdog that shines a spotlight when other rights are being \nthreatened. Without this, the press becomes an extension of the \ngovernment and the people know only what the government wants them to \nknow. As Jefferson once commented:\n\n       When the press is free and everyone is able to read, all is \n     safe.\n\n  Congress cannot afford to stand idly by and allow our sacred First \nAmendment freedoms to be threatened. Let me be clear. The legislation I \nsubmitted to the desk, the Free Speech Protection Act of 2004, is not \nmerely about protecting the press. Instead, this legislation is about \nconsumer protection. It is about openness, debate, the free flow of \ninformation and deliberation--the very ideals that the Senate holds so \ndear.\n  It is also about ensuring that our constituents, the American \ncitizenry, have access to the knowledge and information they need to \nmake educated decisions and fully participate in our democracy.\n  Yet these freedoms which we hold so dear are not as safe as they have \nbeen in other times in the life of our Nation. They have come under \nattack by the heavy hand of Government in a manner not seen since the \nheight of the Watergate scandal 30 years ago.\n  The press today is frequently being subpoenaed to appear in Federal \ncourt and threatened with fines and/or imprisonment if they refuse to \nreveal a confidential source to the prosecutor or attorneys involved in \nthe lawsuit. In some instances, the prosecutor or attorneys might also \nrequest the reporter's notes, video outtakes, or other unpublished \ninformation.\n  In recent months, the press has come under intense pressure to reveal \nthe identity of their confidential sources, threatening the public's \nright to know.\n  In Providence, RI, WJAR-TV reporter Jim Taricani aired an FBI \nsurveillance tape in 2001 that showed an aide to Mayor Vincent \n``Buddy'' Cianci accepting a bribe from a local businessman. Taricani \nbroke no law in airing the tape, but a special prosecutor was \nsubsequently brought in to investigate who leaked the information. He \nrefused to identify the source and was convicted of criminal contempt \nyesterday in Federal court. Taricani now faces 6 months in prison when \nhe is sentenced in December.\n  Perhaps the most alarming instance in recent months of the growing \nthreat to the sacred right to freedom of speech in America is the case \nof Judith Miller of the New York Times. Last month, a Federal judge \nheld Miller in contempt of court for refusing to name her sources to \nprosecutors investigating the disclosure to syndicated columnist Robert \nNovak and to other journalists of Valerie Plame's identity as a covert \nCIA agent. Plame's husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, IV, had in \na New York Times editorial criticized the Bush administration for \nclaiming that Iraq had tried to buy uranium from Niger.\n  Unidentified senior administration officials revealed Plame's \nidentity to Robert Novak and other Washington area journalists, \nallegedly as an act of revenge for Wilson speaking out against \nPresident Bush's rationale for invading Iraq.\n  Mr. Novak then published Plame's identity in a July 2003 column, \nwhich prompted an investigation by the Justice Department and the \nsubpoenaing of several journalists before a Federal grand jury, \nincluding Judith Miller, Tim Russert of NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' \nWalter Pincus and Glen Kessler of the Washington Post, and Time \nmagazine reporter Matthew Cooper.\n  Some of these reporters have talked to the prosecutors after the \nalleged Government sources signed waivers releasing the journalists \nfrom any pledge of confidentiality. New York Times reporter Judith \nMiller, however, has refused to testify, even under the limited terms \nof the waiver. As a result, she is being held in contempt of court and \ncould face up to 18 months in jail unless she agrees to testify.\n  What is so surprising about this case is that Judith Miller never \neven published an article in the New York Times, or any other newspaper \nor magazine for that matter, about Valerie Plame. The mere fact that \nMiller contemplated writing such an article and had conducted \ninterviews for it was enough for the judge to hold her in contempt of \ncourt for refusing to name sources.\n  Currently, 31 States and the District of Columbia have enacted \nprotections for gatherers and disseminators of news and information. \nThey include red States, blue States, Alabama, North Carolina, and \nMontana, for example.\n  Why then is there a need for a Federal statute in this area? A strong \nand uniformed Federal law on shielding would provide uniformity and \nconsistency to the patchwork of inconsistent court decisions and State \nstatutes currently in place.\n  In many instances, whether the disclosure will be compelled and how \nmuch information will be disclosed depends upon the particular State in \nwhich the journalist is pursuing a story when he or she is subpoenaed. \nThe different potential outcomes affect reporters' practices, the flow \nof information, the articles written or not written, in various news \nmedia. It ultimately impacts the public's ability to learn about \nmatters of interest and importance as well.\n  The protections that these laws and court rulings provide vary widely \nin detail and in scope. For example, some States grant nearly complete \nprotection for sources and information, while\n\n[[Page S11648]]\n\nothers provide little or none. In addition, the protections may differ \nin their applicability to criminal and/or civil proceedings.\n  In the Federal court system, for instance, most have interpreted \nBranzburg, a 1972 United States Supreme Court decision, to provide at \nleast qualified news gathering protection--that is, a protection that \ncan be overcome in certain circumstances. A few Federal courts, \nhowever, such as the Seventh Circuit, have rejected such protection, or \nhave limited it only to when the subpoenas are being used to harass the \npress.\n  For those reasons, I think it is quite clear that a national standard \nwould protect gatherers and disseminators of information from the \nvarying State statutes and their interpretations by State courts. This \ngoal is exactly what the Free Speech Protection Act of 2004 would \nachieve.\n  Under the legislation, the protection against compelled disclosure \nfor sources would be absolute. The protection against compelled \ndisclosure of news and information, however, is qualified. That is, an \nindividual involved in gathering news would be required to reveal their \nunpublished material only under certain circumstances. The legislation \nrequires three criteria to be met before such news or information can \nbe disclosed.\n  First, the person seeking the news or information must prove by clear \nand convincing evidence that the news or information is critical or \nnecessary to significant legal issues before a judicial, legislative, \nor administrative body that has the power to issue a subpoena.\n  Secondly, the news or information could not be obtained by \nalternative means. Finally, there is an overriding public interest in \nthe disclosure that must exist.\n  The legislation I am introducing this evening is a work in progress. \nObviously, in the coming weeks I intend to further refine it, and in \nthe 109th Congress to seek out my colleagues' advice and counsel on how \nwe might proceed. I am nevertheless introducing this bill in the \nclosing hours of this Congress because I believe the Senate discussion \nof this matter is urgent. The public's right to know is under attack. \nWhen that happens, all Americans suffer since they are deprived of \nknowledge and information which affects their lives.\n  There are countless examples of information that we have received \nbecause there have been confidential sources who have come forward. \nCertainly, we can go back to Watergate, Whitewater, or Iran-Contra, Abu \nGhirab--the prison scandal in Iraq--Enron, WorldCom, corporate \ngovernance issues, the list is almost endless. Had it not been for \nconfidential sources coming forward and sharing information with a free \npress that would then share that with the public, if we had to rely \nexclusively on government press releases or press conferences, then we \nmight never have learned anything about some of these issues which have \nbeen so vitally important to make our Government and our Nation \nstronger.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at this proposal and urge them to \nconsider it when we return in January. I will reintroduce it again and \nurge them to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 3020\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 475\n\n       Whereas the Lao People's Democratic Republic is an \n     authoritarian, Communist, one-party state;\n       Whereas the Government of Laos has a poor human rights \n     record, particularly with regard to its treatment of \n     minorities.\n       Whereas the United States Central Intelligence Agency \n     trained and armed tens of thousands of Hmong guerrillas to \n     disrupt Viet Cong supply lines and rescue downed pilots \n     during the Vietnam war;\n       Whereas in 1975, the Kingdom of Laos was overthrown by the \n     Communist Pathet Lao regime, and tens of thousands of \n     Laotians, including the Hmong, were killed or died at the \n     hands of Communist forces while attempting to flee the Lao \n     Communist regime, and many others perished in reeducation and \n     labor camps;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of Hmong became refugees, \n     eventually resettling in the United States, where they now \n     reside as American citizens and lead constructive lives as \n     members of our communities;\n       Whereas remnants of former Hmong insurgent groups and their \n     families who once fought with the United States and the Royal \n     Lao Government still remain in remote areas of Laos, \n     including Xaisomboun Special Zone and the Luang Prabang \n     Province;\n       Whereas in August 2003 the United Nations Committee to \n     Eliminate Racial Discrimination strongly criticized the Lao \n     People's Democratic Republic for failing to honor its \n     obligations, expressed its grave concerns regarding reports \n     of human rights violations, including brutalities inflicted \n     on the Hmong, and deplored the measures taken by the Lao \n     authorities to prevent any reporting of the situation of the \n     Hmong;\n       Whereas in October 2003, Amnesty International issued a \n     statement detailing its concern about the use of starvation \n     by the Lao Government as a ``weapon of war against \n     civilians'' in Laos and the deteriorating situation facing \n     thousands of family members of ethnic minority groups;\n       Whereas the Department of State reported in its most recent \n     Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Laos that the \n     ``Government's human rights record remained poor,'' and \n     highlighted press reports that one group of Hmong in \n     Xaisomboun Special Zone, mostly women and children, was being \n     systematically hunted down and attacked by government air and \n     ground forces and that it was at the point of starvation;\n       Whereas international organizations, the Department of \n     State, and Members of Congress have received reports of \n     mistreatment over the past 6 months of Hmong in Laos emerging \n     from remote areas of Laos, including the Xaisomboun Special \n     Zone, the Luang Prabang-Xieng Khouang border area;\n       Whereas the Lao Government has not allowed independent \n     organizations to monitor the treatment of the Hmong emerging \n     from remote areas of Laos;\n       Whereas in September 2004, Amnesty International issued a \n     statement condemning recent reports that Lao soldiers \n     murdered 5 Hmong children, raping 4 girls, who were foraging \n     for food close to their camp, and called it a war crime; and\n       Whereas the Lao People's Democratic Republic has failed to \n     substantially improve the status of human rights for its \n     citizens: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, that the Senate--\n       (1) Condems the consistent pattern of serious human rights \n     abuses in the Lao People's Democratic Republic;\n       (2) Urges the Government of Laos to increase international \n     access to vulnerable populations and to respect the basic \n     human rights of all Laotians, including ethnic and religious \n     minorities; and\n       (3) Hopes that the Lao government intensifies its efforts \n     to make its economy and society move open and transparent in \n     light of the congressional grant of normal tragic relations \n     to the Lao People's Democratic Republic.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 476--SUPPORTING THE GOALS, ACTIVITIES, AND IDEALS OF \n                  NATIONAL PREMATURITY AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (5) recognize that these steps lay the basis for more rapid \n     progress on the road map as a reliable guide leading to final \n     status negotiations;\n       Whereas the United States will join with others in the \n     international community to foster the development of \n     Palestinian democratic political institutions, support the \n     new leadership of the Palestinians that is committed to those \n     institutions, assist in the reconstruction of civic \n     institutions, promote the growth of a free and prosperous \n     economy, and endorse the building of capable security \n     institutions dedicated to maintaining law and order and \n     dismantling terrorist organizations; and\n       Whereas in order to promote a lasting peace, all States in \n     the region must oppose violence and terrorism, foster the \n     development of democratic political and civic institutions, \n     support the emergence of a peaceful and democratic Palestine, \n     and state clearly that they will live in peace with Israel: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved that the Senate--\n       (1) endorses the Joint Statement made by President Bush and \n     Prime Minister Blair on November 12, 2004, expressing a \n     shared vision of freedom, peace, and democracy in the broader \n     Middle East and supports a reinvigorated and concerted United \n     States-led international effort to achieve that vision;\n       (2) supports explicitly the steps presented by President \n     Bush and Prime Minister Blair in that Joint Statement as the \n     basis for more rapid progress on the road map as a reliable \n     guide leading to final status negotiations;\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment to a vision of 2 democratic \n     States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace \n     and security as the key to peace; and\n       (4) expresses its commitment to the road map, which was \n     endorsed by the United States, Israel, the Palestinian \n     Authority, the European Union, Russia, and the United \n     Nations, as a realistic and widely recognized plan for making \n     progress toward peace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 478--RELATING TO DISPLACED STAFF MEMBERS OF SENATORS \n                           AND SENATE LEADERS\n\n  Mr. FRIST submitted the following resolution;

Con. Res. 150\n\n       Whereas Emmett Till was born in Chicago, Illinois, at Cook \n     County Hospital, on July 25, 1941, to Mamie and Louis Till;\n       Whereas Emmett Till traveled to Money, Mississippi, to \n     spend the summer with his uncle, Moses Wright, and his \n     relatives;\n       Whereas in August 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till--with \n     adolescent flamboyance, but unfamiliarity of the racial \n     customs of the South--allegedly whistled at Carolyn Bryant, a \n     White woman;\n       Whereas on August 28, at about 2:30 a.m., Roy Bryant, \n     Carolyn Bryant's husband, and his half brother, J.W. Milam, \n     kidnaped Emmett Till from his uncle Moses Wright's home;\n       Whereas Bryant and Milam brutally beat Emmett Till, took \n     him to the edge of the Tallahatchie River, shot him in the \n     head, fastened a large metal fan used for ginning cotton to \n     his neck with barbed wire, and pushed the body into the \n     river;\n       Whereas 3 days later, Emmett Till's decomposed corpse was \n     pulled from the Tallahatchie River;\n       Whereas Emmett's mother, Mamie Till, made the extraordinary \n     decision to leave the casket open at her son's funeral in \n     Chicago, in order to allow the world to see the brutality of \n     the crime perpetrated against her son;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of people viewed Emmett Till's \n     body in a Chicago church for 4 days; and press from around \n     the world published photographs of Emmett's maimed face; and \n     the sheer brutality of his murder became international news \n     that highlighted the violent racism of the Jim Crow South;\n       Whereas Jet Magazine and the Chicago Defender published \n     photographs of Emmett Till's body outraging African-Americans \n     around the United States;\n       Whereas the trial of J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant began in \n     September of that year with an all-male, all-White jury, \n     because African-Americans and women were banned from serving;\n       Whereas the trial of Milam and Bryant was a microcosm of \n     the Jim Crow South: African-Americans were packed in a \n     specific section of the courtroom balcony; the defendants' \n     families were seen laughing and joking with the prosecution \n     and the jury; and food and snacks were passed out to White \n     observers;\n       Whereas Moses Wright did the unthinkable as an African-\n     American and openly accused the White defendants in public \n     court of murdering his nephew;\n       Whereas Moses Wright was run out of town for his actions in \n     court;\n       Whereas J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant were acquitted of the \n     murder of Emmett Till, and Bryant celebrated his acquittal \n     with his wife in front of the cameras;\n       Whereas protected from further prosecution, Milam and \n     Bryant candidly confessed their torture and murder of Emmett \n     Till; Milam did so on the record to Look Magazine for $4,000;\n       Whereas Mamie Till and thousands of others pleaded with the \n     Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     to reopen and investigate the case;\n       Whereas the Federal Government did absolutely nothing, and \n     President Eisenhower and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover refused \n     to reopen the case and did not even answer Mamie Till's \n     urgent telegraph;\n       Whereas 100 days later, Rosa Parks refused to give up her \n     bus seat to a White patron and the modern civil rights \n     revolution began;\n       Whereas many historians regard the murder of Emmett Till as \n     the true spark of the civil rights movement;\n       Whereas Mamie Till, who died on January 6, 2003, moved back \n     to Chicago, taught, and continued to talk about her son \n     Emmett's murder; and expressed her wishes for a full Federal \n     investigation;\n       Whereas more than 48 years have passed since the murder of \n     Emmett Till;\n       Whereas the remaining witnesses to this gruesome crime are \n     elderly;\n       Whereas House Concurrent Resolution 360 entitled \n     ``Expressing the sense of Congress with respect to the murder \n     of Emmett Till'', was introduced on February 10, 2004, by \n     Representative Bobby Rush;\n       Whereas the Department of Justice reopened the \n     investigation into the murder of Emmett Till on May 11, 2004; \n     and\n       Whereas Congress supports the decision to reopen the \n     investigation of the murder of Emmett Till: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) calls on all authorities with jurisdiction, including \n     the Department of Justice and the State of Mississippi, to--\n       (A) expeditiously bring those responsible for the murder of \n     Emmett Till to justice, due\n\n[[Page S11651]]\n\n     to the amount of time that has passed since the murder and \n     the age of the witnesses; and\n       (B) provide all the resources necessary to ensure a timely \n     and thorough investigation; and\n       (2) calls on the Department of Justice to fully report the \n     findings of their investigation to Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 151--RECOGNIZING THE ESSENTIAL ROLE THAT \n  THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954 HAS PLAYED IN DEVELOPMENT OF PEACEFUL \n                         USES OF ATOMIC ENERGY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                            S. Con Res. 151\n\n       Whereas the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et \n     seq.) followed and sought to implement the Atoms for Peace \n     speech of President Dwight David Eisenhower in December 1953, \n     which provided the United States and the world with a \n     blueprint for commercial development of atomic energy to the \n     benefit of humanity;\n       Whereas the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 defined mechanisms \n     for the production, control, and use of nuclear materials;\n       Whereas the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 provided the initial \n     framework for regulation of nuclear material and facilities \n     and provided recognition that such control is necessary in \n     the national interest to ensure the common defense and \n     security and to protect the health and safety of the public;\n       Whereas the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 recognized the need \n     for development and use of atomic energy under conditions to \n     promote the general welfare;\n       Whereas the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 recognized that it \n     was in the national interest to conduct a comprehensive \n     program of research and development to optimize the benefits \n     of nuclear technologies for humanity;\n       Whereas the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 set forth the \n     necessity to control certain types of information, material, \n     and facilities for security purposes, while ensuring \n     unclassified dissemination of appropriate scientific and \n     technical information;\n       Whereas the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 provided the initial \n     framework for international cooperation in nuclear \n     technologies, under suitable controls to ensure common \n     defense and security, to provide cooperating nations with the \n     benefits of peaceful uses of atomic energy; and\n       Whereas the legacy of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, with \n     103 operating nuclear power plants in the United States \n     providing 20 percent of the electricity supply of the United \n     States, is invaluable in providing clean, emission-free, \n     reliable power to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes that the enactment of the Atomic Energy Act \n     of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) was an essential step in the \n     development and use of a range of civilian nuclear \n     technologies to the benefit of humanity;\n       (2) commends and remembers the authors of the original \n     Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for their foresight and leadership; \n     and\n       (3) commemorates the role played by President Dwight David \n     Eisenhower in his historic Atoms for Peace speech and the \n     leadership he demonstrated in recognizing 50 years ago that \n     the benefits of nuclear technologies would be realized only \n     through a careful national and international system of \n     control, regulation, and use.\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4068.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 476, introduced earlier today by \nSenator Alexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 476) supporting the goals, activities \n     and ideals of National Prematurity Awareness Month.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n\n\n                      prematurity awareness month\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the increasing \nnumber of babies born too early. The March of Dimes has designated \nNovember as Prematurity Awareness Month to draw attention to the \ngrowing, costly and serious public health problem of preterm birth. My \ncolleague, Senator Dodd, and I have introduced a resolution supporting \nthis effort and look forward to swift approval in the Senate.\n  Nationwide, over 480,0000 babies were born prematurely in 2002. In my \nown State of Tennessee, one of every seven babies born in 2002 was born \npreterm, and the rate of preterm births in Tennessee has risen more \nthan 9 percent since 1992.\n  Earlier this year, the Subcommittee on Children and Families, which I \nchair, held a hearing to learn about the devastating effects of preterm \nbirth and what our government agencies and private organizations are \ndoing to combat this crisis. We heard the inspirational story of Kelley \nBolton Jordan and her daughter, Whitney, from Memphis, Tennessee. \nWhitney was born 3\\1/2\\ months early and weighed just 1 lb. 10 oz. \nImagine a leg so small it could fit through a wedding ring.\n  Whitney spent 3 grueling months in intensive care. She is now a \nhealthy, happy 3 year-old and has no repercussions from her early \nbirth--other babies are not as lucky. Preterm birth takes a severe toll \non America's families and strains our health care system. Each year, \n100,000 children develop health problems because of their early births, \nincluding cerebral palsy and vision and hearing loss. And preterm birth \nis the leading cause of death in the first month of life.\n  With over half the causes of preterm birth unknown, more research is \ndesperately needed. That's why I plan to re-introduce ``the PREEMIE \nAct'' and hope that the Senate can pass this legislation in the 109th \nCongress.\n  I commend the March of Dimes for its dedication in working toward a \nday when babies and their families no longer have to face the \ndevastating consequences of premature birth. If we work together to \nfocus public and private resources on this problem, we can decrease the \nnumber of premature births in every state.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I draw attention to the growing problem of \npremature birth. As a sponsor of the PREEMIE Act, with my colleague \nSenator Alexander, I have heard the stories about the strain a \npremature birth places on families, as well as the lifelong health \nproblems many preterm children face.\n  Nationwide, 1 out of every 8 babies is born too early. In my own \nState of Connecticut, 1 of every 10 babies born in 2002 was preterm and \nthe rate of preterm births in Connecticut has risen more than 11% since \n1992.\n  Senator Alexander and I are introducing a resolution to raise \nawareness of this public health crisis. As part of their 5-year \ncampaign designed to use the combined power of awareness, education, \nand research to significantly decrease the number of premature births \nin the United States, the March of Dimes has designated November as \nPrematurity Awareness Month. I am pleased to be supporting this \ncampaign.\n  I urge my colleagues to find out about the toll of premature births \nin their states and to work together to solve this problem. I hope we \ncan move the PREEMIE Act quickly in the 109th Congress in order to \nexpand the Government's efforts to reduce the rates of preterm birth.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table and any statements relating to this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 476) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 476\n\n       Whereas preterm birth is a serious and growing problem;\n       Whereas, between 1982 and 2002, the rate of preterm birth \n     increased 27 percent;\n       Whereas, in 2002, more than 480,000 babies were born \n     prematurely in the United States;\n       Whereas 25 percent of all babies that die in the first \n     month of life were born preterm;\n       Whereas premature infants are 14 times more likely to die \n     in the first year of life;\n       Whereas premature babies who survive may suffer lifelong \n     consequences, including cerebral palsy, mental retardation, \n     chronic lung disease, and vision and hearing loss;\n       Whereas preterm birth and low birthweight are a significant \n     financial burden in health care;\n       Whereas, in 2002, the estimated charges for hospital stays \n     for infants with a diagnosis of preterm birth or low \n     birthweight were $15,500,000,000, a 12 percent increase since \n     2001;\n       Whereas the average lifetime medical costs of a premature \n     baby are conservatively estimated at $500,000;\n       Whereas the cause of approximately half of all preterm \n     births is unknown;\n       Whereas women who smoke during pregnancy are twice as \n     likely as women who do not smoke during pregnancy to give \n     birth to a low birthweight baby, and babies born to women who \n     smoke during pregnancy weigh, on average, 200 grams less than \n     babies born to women who do not smoke during pregnancy; and\n       Whereas to reduce the rates of preterm labor and delivery \n     more research is needed on the underlying causes of preterm \n     delivery, prevention of preterm birth so that babies are born \n     full-term, and treatments improving outcomes for infants born \n     prematurely: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes during the month of \n     November, 2004, activities and programs that promote \n     awareness of and solutions to the dangers of preterm birth \n     across the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11653-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11653-S11660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IMPROVING EDUCATION RESULTS FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF \n                        2004--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 1350, the IDEA bill, that the \nconference report be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are now considering \nthe conference report on the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nImprovement Act. This bill reauthorizes IDEA, our Federal law governing \nspecial education services for children with disabilities.\n  As we close in on the 30-year anniversary of the Federal role in \nspecial education, I think it important to highlight where we were, \nwhere we are and\n\n[[Page S11654]]\n\nwhere we are going to ensure that children with disabilities are \nprovided a high-quality education that prepares them for life outside \nthe classroom.\n  Almost 30 years ago, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act \nopened schoolhouse doors for children with disabilities. Prior to that \nlandmark legislation, most students with disabilities did not attend \npublic school. Indeed, many States had laws excluding certain children \nwith disabilities from their schools, including the blind, deaf, \nemotionally disturbed or children with mental retardation.\n  Today, special education programs have been established in virtually \nevery school district in America. The overwhelming majority of children \nwith disabilities--about 96 percent--learn in regular schools with \nother children, not in state institutions or separate facilities. In \nfact, half of students with disabilities spend 80 percent or more of \ntheir day in regular classrooms. Those students are increasingly \ngaining access to higher education, too. College enrollment rates among \nstudents with disabilities have more than tripled.\n  Clearly, we have come a long way from the time when our students with \ndisabilities were excluded from public schools. Still, we know that \nthere is much to be done to ensure that children with disabilities get \na better education and that we make it easier for schools to provide \nthat education to these students.\n  With this understanding, we have worked for more than two years to \nimprove IDEA, keeping the needs of children with disabilities, whom we \nhave a duty to serve, foremost in our thoughts, while balancing \nconcerns of equity and fairness.\n  With significant input from parents, educators and disability groups, \nas well as the recommendations of the President's Commission on \nExcellence in Special Education, both the House and Senate passed bills \nthat would have done much to improve IDEA and to ensure that children \nwith disabilities receive a quality results-based education. But \nimportant differences remained.\n  After weeks of sometimes intense negotiations, our conference \ncommittee ironed out those differences and reached agreement yesterday \non a final report, bringing us one step closer to enacting important \nreforms that will benefit the more than 6.5 million children served by \nIDEA, as well as their parents, teachers, and schools.\n  The conference report before us focuses on improved academic results \nfor children with disabilities; frees special education teachers from \nbureaucratic requirements, and offers them important flexibility; helps \nparents and schools work together better; creates the safest possible \nclassroom environment for all students; and strikes an appropriate \nbalance between protecting the educational rights of children with \ndisabilities, while making IDEA less litigious.\n  This report does five very important things.\n  First, it reinforces the most basic goal under IDEA: making sure \nstudents are learning. The report shifts focus away from compliance \nwith burdensome and confusing rules, and places a renewed emphasis on \nour most fundamental concern making sure that children with \ndisabilities receive a quality education.\n  Specifically, the report: ensures States focus on improved academic \nresults and functional performance for students with disabilities; \nclarifies methods for measuring student progress by replacing arbitrary \nbenchmarks and short-term objectives with academic assessments under \nNCLB, including alternate assessments; provides for a national study of \nvalid and reliable alternate assessment systems and how alternate \nassessments align with State content standards; and allows for the \ndevelopment of new approaches to determine whether students have \nspecific learning disabilities by clarifying that schools are not \nlimited to using the IQ-achievement discrepancy model that relies on a \n``wait to fail'' approach.\n  Second, it enables teachers to better serve their students by: \nclarifying what it means to be a highly qualified special education \nteacher, and offering flexibility to new teachers who teach multiple \nsubjects, and to teachers teaching children with severe cognitive \ndisabilities; making it easier for special education teachers to both \nenter into and remain in the field of special education; focusing more \nresources and attention on professional development for both general \nand special education teachers serving children with disabilities; \ncreating a paperwork reduction demonstration program to increase the \ntime teachers spend on instruction and decrease the time they spend \ncomplying with cumbersome, bureaucratic requirements; and eliminating \npaperwork by eliminating short-term objectives for most students and \nreducing the number of times per year that procedural safeguards \nnotices must be sent to parents.\n  Third, it facilitates a better relationship between parents and \nschools, and improves parental involvement and options by: providing \nparents with increased information and access to resources to support \nthem though dispute resolution and due process; encouraging early \nmediation and prompt resolution of disputes; providing new \nopportunities for parents and schools to meet in order to resolve \nproblems before going to a due process hearing; allowing parents and \nschools to agree to make changes to an IEP during the year without \nhaving to convene a formal IEP meeting; and increasing parental \ninvolvement in IEP meetings by allowing use of teleconferencing, video \nconferencing, and other means of participation.\n  Fourth, this report ensures safety and improves discipline for all \nchildren by: making the discipline provisions in current law easier to \nunderstand and implement and more fair and equitable; ensuring that \npositive behavioral interventions and supports remain an option on the \nIEP; and empowering schools to discipline children whose behavior is \nnot the direct result of their disability.\n  Fifth, it provides fiscal relief to school districts by: including a \n7-year discretionary glide path to full funding through the \ndiscretionary appropriations process; providing new resources to assist \nschool districts in delivering a free appropriate public education to \nhigh-need children who may require expensive services; simplifying \nfunding for grants, making future years' funding levels and amounts \nmore predictable; and giving districts flexibility to shift some local \nfunding for certain programs to other ESEA priorities as federal IDEA \nfunding increases.\n  I thank all members of the conference committee and their dedicated \nstaff for their hard work on this report and their cooperative spirit \nin working toward this day. It is certainly an endeavor of which we can \nall be proud.\n  I can think of no finer way to bring my tenure as chairman of the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to a close than \nby completing action on this legislation.\n  In particular, I would like to thank: Senator Kennedy, and his staff, \nConnie Garner and Roberto Rodriguez; Senator Bingaman and his staff, \nMichael Yudin; Senator Sessions and his staff, John Little and Prim \nFormby; Senator Alexander and his staff, Kristin Bannerman; Congressman \nBoehner, and his staff, David Cleary, Melanie Looney, Krisann Pearce, \nand Sally Lovejoy; Congressman Miller, and his staff, Alex Nock; \nLegislative Counsel attorneys Mark Foster and Mark Synnes, without \nwhose assistance we could not have conferenced this bill in 6 weeks; \nand Department of Education staff Karen Quarles, Christy Wolfe, Suzanne \nSheridan, Paul Riddle, Carol Cichowski, Bill Knudsen and Michele Rovins \nfor their superb technical assistance.\n  Finally, I thank members of my own staff. Both Annie White and Denzel \nMcGuire spent countless hours shepherding this legislation, and meeting \nwith parents, educators, school groups and disability groups, while \nworking to improve policy and reach compromises on the many difficult \nissues herein. Without their tireless efforts and passion for helping \nstudents with disabilities to achieve their fullest potential, we most \ncertainly would not be here today. I would also like to recognize the \nefforts of Bill Lucia, Courtney Brown, and Kelly Scott.\n  I am hopeful that we will quickly approve this conference report, so \nthat the President can sign this important legislation into law.\n\n\n                            Attorney's Fees\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to clarify\n\n[[Page S11655]]\n\nan oversight with Senator Gregg that is important for the record.\n  Senator Gregg, a sentence in the Statement of Managers' language of \nthe conference report that provided the explanation for the attorney's \nfees language was inadvertently left out. By adding at Note 231 \nsections detailing the limited circumstances in which local educational \nagencies and State educational agencies can recover attorney's fees, \nspecifically Sections 615(i)(3)(B)(i)(II) and (III), the conferees \nintend to codify the standards set forth in Christiansburg Garment Co. \nv. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978). According to Christiansburg, attorney's \nfees may only be awarded to defendants in civil rights cases where the \nplaintiffs claims are frivolous, without foundation or brought in bad \nfaith. Is that your understanding as well?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is correct \nand that is my understanding as well.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass H.R. 1350, the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, \nlegislation which has my support.\n  This important legislation, which reauthorizes the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, is a compromise that protects the civil \nrights of children with disabilities, while ensuring that teachers, \nprincipals, and administrators have the essential tools to improve \nthese children's academic or functional skills and knowledge. It is the \nculmination of months of hard-fought bipartisan and bicameral \nnegotiations in an attempt to strike the balance between these \ncompeting interests and overall. This bill improves upon current law.\n  As an original cosponsor of the Senate version of this bill and the \nsponsor of an earlier bill on personnel preparation and development, I \nam pleased that most of the provisions I authored on the recruitment, \npreparation, support, and professional development of special education \nteachers, general education teachers, principals, administrators, \nrelated services personnel, and others working with children with \ndisabilities have been included in the final version of the bill before \nus today. First, the bill requires states, through the renamed State \nPersonnel Development Grants, to target 100% of the funding under this \ncompetitive grant for professional development activities--an increase \nof 25% from current law. These grants will help achieve our goal of \nensuring that there is a highly qualified teacher in every classroom in \nAmerica. Furthermore, the bill sends funding to states via a formula \nonce funding reaches $100 million, ensuring that teachers in every \nstate benefit. Additionally, as a condition of receiving a State \nPersonnel Development Grant, a state educational agency must submit a \ncomprehensive plan that identifies and addresses the state's personnel \nneeds. This and other new requirements will ensure that the state \neducational agency has the necessary expertise and strategies in place \nto boost the skills of teachers and in turn improve the education of \nchildren with disabilities.\n  Retaining special education teachers new to the profession is a \nparticular area of concern in our States. According to data from the \nNational Clearinghouse for Professions in Special Education, the \nturnover rate of special education teachers in their first 3 years of \nteaching is exceptionally high--much higher than the comparative rate \nfor general education teachers. Annual attrition rates for special \neducation teachers are 6 percent for those who leave the field entirely \nand an additional 7.4 percent who transfer to general education. High \nturnover is costly both for school districts, which must repeatedly \nfill the same positions, and for students, who lose the advantage of \nbeing taught by experienced special education teachers. As such, I am \npleased that the bill establishes a new grant program for institutions \nof higher education to help beginning special educators. Funding is \nauthorized for incorporating an extended, such as a fifth year, \nclinical learning opportunity to existing special education preparation \nprograms or for the creation or support of teacher-faculty \npartnerships, such as professional development schools, that provide \nhigh-quality and ongoing mentoring to new special education teachers so \nthat they will remain in the field.\n  The legislation also enhances existing IDEA personnel preparation \nprograms to ensure that all teachers and other personnel have the \nskills, knowledge, and leadership training to improve results for \nstudents with disabilities, including working collaboratively in \nregular classroom settings, addressing the needs of limited English \nproficient students with disabilities, preventing the misidentification \nof children with disabilities, working with parents to improve the \neducation of their children, and utilizing positive behavioral \ninterventions to address the conduct of children with disabilities that \nimpedes their learning or that of others in the classroom.\n  There are other highlights as well. This bill aligns the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act with the No Child Left Behind Act by \nrequiring states to ensure that all special education teachers are \nhighly qualified by the 2005-2006 school year, including allowing \nteachers to meet the standard through the high objective uniform state \nstandard of evaluation or HOUSSE; requires the uniformity of electronic \nversions of instructional materials and provides for the establishment \nof a National Instructional Materials Access Center to give schools a \none-stop shop for textbooks and other educational materials for \nstudents who are blind or possess another disability which necessitates \nalternate formats; expands the current definition of related services \nto include school nurse services; strengthens early intervention and \npreschool programs for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with \ndisabilities, including permitting states to create a system that gives \nparents the choice to have their child continue early intervention \nservices until the age of five; establishes a new program aimed at \ndeveloping and enhancing behavioral supports in schools while improving \nthe quality of interim educational settings; enhances planning and \ntransition services for children with disabilities; advances the \nmonitoring and enforcement of IDEA; and improves services for homeless \nand foster care students with disabilities.\n  Teachers, principals, and administrators are also given flexibility \nto more effectively provide an education to all students. There are new \napproaches to resolving complaints to head off litigation and to \nreducing paperwork, along with a clearer framework for the discipline \nof children with disabilities.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Gregg, and their staffs, \nfor their excellent work on this important bipartisan legislation. One \nstaff member, Connie Garner, deserves special recognition for her \ntireless efforts to make this law work for students, parents, teachers, \nand schools.\n  This is significant legislation for the people of Rhode Island and \nacross the nation, and I am pleased to support it. I will also continue \nto press for full funding of IDEA to provide 40% of the excess cost of \nproviding special education services--a promise Congress made in 1975 \nwhen IDEA was first enacted. Funding for IDEA services has only \nrecently reached nearly 19 percent--just under halfway to fulfilling \nthat promise. While we have taken a number of positive steps with this \nbill to ensure a high quality, free appropriate public education for \nchildren with disabilities, we must bridge the funding gap so these \nchildren receive the educational assistance and support they need and \ndeserve.\n\n\n                                teachers\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that our bill now requires special \neducation teachers to be fully certified by the state. Prohibiting \ntemporary or emergency certification is an important step forward and \none that brings IDEA in line with NCLB. It is important that teachers \nwho are fully certified in special education have the unique knowledge \nand skills needed to effectively teach students with disabilities. \nParents should know that the label of ``fully certified special \neducation teacher'' means that the teacher has demonstrated both \nknowledge and skill in special education practices. Senator Kennedy, is \nit your understanding that full state certification in special \neducation includes a demonstration of such knowledge and skill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, Senator Reed, that is my understanding. Well-\nprepared special education teachers are\n\n[[Page S11656]]\n\ncritical to our goal of providing a quality education for all children \nwith disabilities. Such teachers need to be prepared with the skills \nand expertise needed to teach children with disabilities. Those skills \nmay include the teaching of a standards-based reform curriculum to \nstudents with disabilities, helping students access technology-based \nlearning tools, or adapting materials and learning environments for \nstudents with disabilities.\n  In addition to traditional special education preparation programs at \nour colleges and universities, some alternative routes to certification \noffer important and useful options to addressing the special education \nteacher shortage--especially in rural and urban school systems with \nhard-to-staff schools. Some of our alternative routes have produced \nspecial education teachers with great skill and knowledge.\n  Mr. REED. I thank Senator Kennedy for that clarification.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I support a bipartisan, bicameral \nreauthorization of the Individual with Disabilities Education Act, \nIDEA. I want to start by thanking my fellow conferees and their staff \nfor all of their hard work in putting together the bipartisan, \nbicameral legislation we are considering today. While we may still have \nsome disagreements about the substance of the bill, getting to this \npoint in a bipartisan way is no small achievement, and I know we are \nall better for it.\n  Nothing pleases me more than to move forward with a reauthorization \nthat the education, the disability, and the parent and student \ncommunity have been eagerly waiting for: a bill that will ensure that \nstudents with disabilities get the services they are entitled to while \nproviding school systems with a greater degree of flexibility in \nimplementing the law.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 \nemphasizes accountability and improved results, improves monitoring and \nenforcement of the law, and works to reduce litigation by providing new \nopportunities for parents and schools to address concerns and disputes.\n  The bill reduces paperwork by streamlining State and local paperwork \nrequirements, provides earlier access to services and supports for \ninfants, toddlers and preschoolers with disabilities, and properly puts \nadded emphasis on transition services so that special education \nstudents leave the system ready to be full productive citizens, whether \nthey choose to go on to college or a job. Like No Child Left Behind, \nthis bill also increases and improves opportunities for parental \ninvolvement and supports special education teachers in becoming \n``highly qualified'' to do their jobs.\n  I am particularly pleased that the IDEA conference agreement contains \nprovisions that I, along with Senators Cochran, Harkin and Bunning, \noriginally introduced as the Instructional Materials Accessibility Act, \nIMAA. These important provisions will greatly aid blind and print-\ndisabled students by ensuring that they receive their textbooks and \nother instructional materials in the formats that they require, such as \nBraille, at the same time as their sighted peers.\n  Far too often, blind, visually-impaired and print-disabled students \nwait months for their State or local school districts to convert their \ntextbooks into Braille or another alternative format. At the same time, \nschool districts face exorbitant costs for these conversions. The \nInstructional Material Accessibility Act provisions included in this \nreauthorization will mandate the adoption of one uniform electronic \nfile format that will greatly ease the process of converting learning \nmaterials into alternative formats, such as Braille.\n  Secondly, the IMAA provisions will create a repository for these \nformats so that they can be disseminated to local school districts \nquickly and cost effectively.\n  We often hear today the pledge that we will leave no child behind. \nMay I suggest that we also make every effort to ensure that we leave no \nblind child behind. The adoption of these important provisions will go \na long way toward ensuring that blind, visually-impaired and print-\ndisabled students are not left behind in the classroom.\n  And while I am disappointed that the bill does not contain a \nprovision to provide mandatory full-funding of IDEA, I believe that the \nmonetary targets that have been provided, are at least pointing us in \nthe right direction. Still, I think it is important to remind everyone, \nyet again, that thirty years ago when we passed IDEA, we made a \ncommitment to, over time, cover 40 percent of the State cost of \nservicing students with special needs.\n  We have yet to make good on this commitment. Today the Federal \nGovernment supports less than 20 percent of the cost of the program. \nThat is not even half of the 40 percent we promised 29 years ago. \nStates and municipalities are bearing more than their share of \nresponsibility for meeting disabled students' needs. States and \nmunicipalities need our help. As I have said before, I cannot accept \nthe argument that because our economy is faltering, or we are a Nation \nat war, we cannot provide our children and their families with the \ncritical educational resources they need. Investment in education is no \nless important in a weak economy or while our Nation is at war.\n  Almost 30 years ago, Congress passed the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act to help States provide all children with \ndisabilities with a free, appropriate public education in the least \nrestrictive environment possible. Since that time, this law has made an \nincredible difference in the lives of millions of American children and \ntheir families.\n  Fundamentally, this is a good bill--one that will help guarantee the \nfull potential of all our children while assisting school districts in \ntheir efforts to deliver special education services in an efficient \nmanner. That is why I will support it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as the 108th Congress comes to a close, \nthe House and the Senate are considering a significant legislative \ninitiative, the Individuals with Disabilities Education, UDEA, \nImprovement Act. The purpose of the IDEA Improvement Act is to \nreauthorize the law that was enacted 29 years ago, the Education for \nAll Handicapped Children Act. That law, now known as IDEA, was based \nupon a series of court decisions in the early 1970s that found that \nchildren with disabilities were no different than other children and \nwere, and still are, entitled to a free and appropriate education.\n  I was one of the original authors of the 1975 law. A key provision of \nthat law was the inclusion of language that committed the federal \ngovernment to pay 40 percent of the national average per pupil \nexpenditure for each disabled child's education. Unfortunately, this is \na commitment that has yet to be met. This year, my own state of Vermont \nhad to spend $22 million in state funds to make up the shortfall from \nthe Federal Government.\n  I do not believe the bill before us, the IDEA Improvement Act of \n2004, will provide the Federal funding to sufficiently accommodate all \nchildren with disabilities. As we approach the 30th anniversary of the \noriginal IDEA law, it is unconscionable that we, the Congress, will \nhave once again failed to fulfill our commitment to pay the 40 percent \nshare we promised almost three decades ago. In fact, as of today, we \nare not even halfway there.\n  I voted against the Senate version of this bill earlier this year, \nprimarily because of the funding issue, and I am opposed to the passage \nof the House-Senate IDEA Improvement Act conference report.\n  In addition to the funding problem, I have serious concerns about two \nother provisions. The IDEA Improvement Act aligns itself with the No \nChild Left Behind standard for teacher quality. Unfortunately, the \ndefinition here is as flawed as it is in the NCLB Act. I had hoped the \nbill would recognize the balance between providing children with \nquality instruction and the difficulties in recruiting and retaining \nquality teachers. In Vermont today, more than one-fifth of special \neducator positions are not filled by qualified personnel. I believe \nthat this bill will make that statistic worse, not better.\n  Another issue that is troubling to me is the diversion of IDEA funds \nto other education programs. This bill allows school districts to \nreduce local spending equal to 50 percent of all new federal IDEA \nfunds, from fiscal year 2005 forward, and use them for other \neducational purposes. This flexibility is available if school districts \nare in compliance with IDEA. This means that in\n\n[[Page S11657]]\n\na few years, the vast majority of school districts in the country will \nbe able to shift billions of dollars that had been spent on special \neducation to other areas. I have been fighting for years to increase \nthe amount of money available for special education, and this provision \nrisks derailing the progress that we have made. I am gravely concerned \nabout this provision and its impact. School districts that are \nunderfunded by No Child Left Behind will be tempted to fix that problem \nby cutting corners in IDEA and using that money for other programs. \nThis sets a terrible example for future education legislation.\n  Although I oppose the final passage of this bill, several provisions \nimprove upon current law. Most importantly, the bill maintains the \nconstitutionally guaranteed rights of children with disabilities.\n  The bill greatly improves the monitoring and enforcement procedures \nfor compliance with the law. Previously, states not in compliance were \nnot necessarily sanctioned. In fact, in many situations, the only \nmechanism for enforcing the law was moving forward with a lawsuit. This \nnew legislation calls for increased federal oversight and provides more \nenforcement tools at the state level.\n  Although I am opposing the passage of the IDEA Improvement Act, I \nwould like to especially thank Senator Kennedy and his staff for their \nefforts during this process, especially Connie Garner, whose hard work \nis greatly appreciated.\n  It is my hope that we will not wait until the next authorization to \ncontinue to work together to improve the IDEA program and the funding \nthat is so desperately needed for all children with disabilities. Next \nyear will mark 30 years of federal underfunding. When will we recognize \nthat our children have waited long enough?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Gregg and Senator Kennedy, \nChairman Boehner and Representative Miller for their leadership on this \nimportant issue. I also thank my colleagues and fellow conferees from \nboth the House and Senate for their hard work on an issue that is vital \nto our children's education and their future, as well as ours.\n  When Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \ninto law 30 years ago, it represented the strength of the Federal \ncommitment to ensuring that all students would receive the support they \nneed to reach their full potential. Congress made its position clear: \nall disabled students would be guaranteed a free and appropriate public \neducation.\n  This legislation advances that concept that has been preserved in \nspirit and refined to make it more effective over time. It does so \nwhile staying true to the original intent of Congress. I am pleased to \nbe able to support this legislation, and I would like to speak briefly \non a few issues that are of great concern to me and the people of \nWyoming that I represent.\n  As a rural State, Wyoming has many small schools where teachers are \nresponsible for multiple subjects. Our special education teachers are \nin this position more often than other teachers in our State, simply \nbecause we do not have a lot of students and our special education \nclassrooms are often very small and include several grade levels. My \nhome county, Campbell County, currently has around 7,000 students. That \nis an entire county. I am aware that some States have more students \nenrolled in a single high school than we have in that entire county, \nwhich at 5,000 square miles, is bigger than the State of Delaware.\n  This legislation makes an important clarification to the Highly \nQualified Teacher standard established by the No Child Left Behind Act. \nIt defines highly qualified in a way that is consistent with No Child \nLeft Behind, but it also provides flexibility for States, like Wyoming, \nthat have a large number of special education teachers responsible for \nmore than one subject. This change will ensure that disabled children \nwill be taught by a highly qualified teacher and it also recognizes the \nreality of rural States and the challenges we have in recruiting and \nretaining teachers.\n  This bill also provides flexibility for States and school districts \nwho are responsible for the largest portion of special education \nfunding. An important change is the flexibility for States to use the \nsame flexibility provided to districts if they provide 100 percent of \nthe State's non-Federal education spending. Many of our districts in \nWyoming and the State as a whole will benefit from this flexibility. \nThey will be better able to support education programs serving our \nstudents' best interests, rather than having their hands tied by \nFederal law.\n  I am also pleased that we were able to reach consensus on the need to \nimprove the due process and discipline sections under the current IDEA \nlegislation. The amount of unnecessary litigation surrounding the \nprovision of services for students with disabilities has become a \nburden for many districts, and it has been a problem that \ndisproportionately affects small, rural districts. By adding mediation \nand other forms of alternative dispute resolution, we have given \nparents and schools the tools they need to resolve complaints outside \nof the courtroom. These changes represent a common sense approach to \nwhat has become a serious problem. I believe the revised due process \nand discipline sections address concerns we've heard from parents of \nstudents with disabilities and teachers, principals and administrators. \nThey encourage parents and school leaders to work cooperatively to meet \nthe needs of disabled children, which is in everyone's best interest.\n  I am pleased that we have been able to finish work on this important \nlegislation before the close of the 108th Congress so these important \nimprovements can be enacted.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will applaud passage of the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act. IDEA is based on the American \nprinciple of equal opportunity. IDEA recognizes that students have a \ncivil right to a free, appropriate public education, even if they have \nspecial needs that require additional resources.\n  We still have a long way to go to meet the Federal Government's \npromise to fund 40 percent of special education, and we are working on \nthat challenge. However, this bill that meets my highest priority--\nprotecting the right of children with disabilities to a free, \nappropriate public education. In addition, this bill takes critical \nsteps towards improving monitoring, enforcement, and public reporting. \nOur laws are only meaningful if we are willing to enforce them, and the \nprovisions in this bill will help us do just that. I am pleased that \nthis bill contains provisions that I fought for to provide the \nadditional funding that school districts--especially small, rural \ndistricts or districts with major medical facilities--really need to \nprovide FAPE for children whose disabilities result in extremely high \ncosts. The bill also contains important improvements to early \nintervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities.\n  I am particularly pleased that we were able to improve services for \nhomeless and foster children with disabilities and children with \ndisabilities in military families in this bill. I would like to thank \nmy colleague, Senator DeWine, and his staff, Mary Beth Luna, for \nworking with me on these important provisions. These provisions are a \nmajor victory for America's most vulnerable disabled students. The bill \nensures that a high quality education will follow them whenever they \nhave to move to another school. The bill improves special education \nservices and coordination of services for children with disabilities \nwho transfer school districts; clarifies which appropriate adults can \nadvocate for children with regard to their special education services, \nincluding when the parents cannot be located or are uninvolved with the \nchild; improves coordination between McKinney-Vento and IDEA and \noverall representation of homeless and foster children in IDEA, and \nstrengthens and expands early intervention services for infants and \ntoddlers with disabilities who are homeless, in foster care, or in \nmilitary families.\n  While I do believe that this bill takes critical steps to improve \nspecial education in this country, I am disappointed that the Federal \nGovernment continues to fail to meet the funding promises under IDEA. \nNearly 30 years ago, the Federal Government made a commitment of equal \nopportunity to the Nation's children with disabilities. With that \ncommitment, we promised that the Federal Government would uphold its \nend of the bargain and pay 40 percent of the average per student cost \nfor every special education\n\n[[Page S11658]]\n\nstudent. Today, however, the Federal Government is paying about half of \nthat cost.\n  Over the past few years, IDEA has received significant increases. \nHowever, according to the Congressional Research Service, at increases \nof $1 billion each year, the Federal Government will never fulfill the \npromise of funding at 40 percent. Further, even if annual increases \nwere $1 billion plus inflation, we will not reach the promised level of \n40 percent until 2035--more than 30 years from now.\n  Local schools are already struggling with the requirements of the No \nChild Left Behind Act, the lack of promised federal funding, and the \ndismal fiscal picture facing our state and local governments. I know we \ncan do better for America's disabled students. Let's not make them wait \nanother 30 years to fully-fund this law. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to ensure that the Federal Government fulfills the \npromises of IDEA next year.\n  I want to thank Senator Kennedy, Chairman Gregg, Chairman Boehner, \nand Congressman Miller for their leadership on this bill. I also want \nto thank their staffs, Connie Garner, Denzel McGuire, Bill Lucia, Sally \nLovejoy, David Cleary, Melanie Looney, Alex Nock, and Alice Cain for \nall of their hard work on this bill. The time and effort that they and \ntheir staff have put into this bill really show in the quality of the \nfinal product, which I am pleased to support.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are finally \nreauthorizing this important legislation, the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. I thank Senator Kennedy, Senator Gregg, \nCongressman Boehner, and Congressman Miller. I know how hard you worked \non this bill. You tackled complicated issues and found common ground. I \nappreciate your efforts.\n  Overall, I think this is a good bill. It's not perfect. I know there \nare Marylanders who will be disappointed. I've heard from parents who \nare concerned that this bill rolls back the guarantee of a quality \neducation for their children. And I've heard from teachers, principals, \nand school superintendents who want to know where the resources will \ncome from, because this bill doesn't fully fund IDEA. But I'm going to \nvote for it because we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n  This bill takes important steps towards improving special education \nfor students, families, and schools. It sets a clear path for fully \nfunding IDEA. It protects the rights of students. It simplifies \ncomplicated rules and makes it easier for schools and parents to \nnavigate--not litigate. And it allows schools to help students who need \nspecial attention, but not necessarily special education.\n  I've talked to Marylanders about this, like the women of Delta Sigma \nTheta Sorority. They see their children being racially sidelined--\npushed into special education when what they really need is special \nattention. I'm so pleased that we are doing something in this bill to \nstop racial sidelining.\n  My top priority in this reauthorization was full funding. I think \nit's a shame that the bill doesn't fully fund IDEA. But I'm pleased it \ntakes the first step towards full funding by authorizing specific \nfunding levels for each year, until we get to full funding in 2008.\n  Why is this important? The Federal Government is supposed to pay 40 \npercent of the cost of educating children with disabilities, yet it has \nnever paid more than 18 percent. That means local districts must make \nup the difference by skimping on special ed, cutting from other \neducation programs, or raising taxes. I don't want to force States and \nlocal school districts to forage for funds, cut back on teacher \ntraining, or delay school repairs because the Federal Government has \nfailed to live up to its commitment to special education. As a member \nof the Appropriations Committee I will fight to put this money in the \nFederal checkbook so special education is not a hollow promise.\n  Parents today are under a lot of stress, sometimes working two jobs \njust to make ends meet. They're trying to find day care for their kids \nand elder care for their own parents. The Federal Government shouldn't \nadd to their worries by not living up to its obligations. With the \nFederal Government not paying its share of special ed these parents \nhave a real question in their minds: Will my child will have a good \nteacher? Will the classes have up-to-date textbooks? Will they be \nlearning what they need to know?\n  Parents of disabled children face such a tough burden already. Caring \nfor a disabled child can be exhausting. School should not be one of the \nmany things they worry about, particularly when the laws are already on \nthe books to guarantee their child a public school education.\n  Special education has made such a huge difference in the lives of \nstudents with disabilities. It gives disabled children a chance to \nsucceed in school and in life. I want to do what's best for families \nand schools. Parents and students need to be able to count on a quality \neducation. That's why I'm voting for this legislation. But know that I \nwill continue to fight for full funding of IDEA, because I don't want \nspecial education to be a hollow promise.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am so pleased to be here today to talk \nabout the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of \n2004. This legislation represents a significant step forward in \nadvancing the academic achievement of millions of children with \ndisabilities. The purpose of this bill is to improve the educational \nand functional outcomes for students with disabilities.\n  I believe this legislation accomplishes this goal by: aligning IDEA \nto the requirements of No Child Left Behind; protecting the civil \nrights of children with disabilities; providing new opportunities for \nschools and parents to resolve disputes equitably; simplifying the \ndiscipline provisions and makes it easier for schools to administer the \nlaw; reducing unnecessary paperwork burdens; providing quality services \nand instruction for children from early childhood through graduation; \nproviding resources to support teachers, principals, and other school \npersonnel; providing local school districts with significant \nflexibility in the use of Federal IDEA dollars; and holding States and \nlocal school districts accountable for implementation of the law.\n  This legislation represents a truly bipartisan effort. This process \ndid not happen overnight, however. The Senate began working on this \nbill in the fall of 2002, and after years of work and negotiation, \npassed it earlier this spring by an overwhelming vote of 95 to 3. The \nHouse passed its own version of the bill in 2003, but it passed largely \nalong partisan lines. The House-passed bill and the Senate version were \nvery different bills. But in the end, I am pleased to say, both parties \nin both Houses of Congress worked diligently, and in good faith, to \npass the best bill possible. Earlier this week, Senate and House \nConferees approved the legislation by a decided vote of 29 to 1. I \nwould like to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the HELP \nCommittee for their commitment to passing this legislation. Their \nstaffs, Denzel McGuire and Connie Garner, have worked tirelessly on \nbehalf of our Nation's students with disabilities, and deserve \nrecognition.\n  IDEA is sometimes seen as a controversial piece of legislation. It is \na unique blend of civil rights law and state grant program, and as a \nresult, often pits the constitutional rights of children with \ndisabilities to a free appropriate public education against the \nflexibility teachers need to teach. While this bill is certainly not \nperfect, I believe it strikes a good, fair balance.\n  Earlier this year, this country celebrated 50 years of public school \ndesegregation. In the landmark decision of Brown v. Board of Education, \nChief Justice Warren wrote that ``in the field of public education, the \ndoctrine of `separate but equal' has no place.'' This decision \nliterally opened the doors of our public schools to all children, \nregardless of race.\n  But, the doors to a public education did not open quite so quickly \nfor children with disabilities. Prior to enactment of IDEA in 1975, \nchildren with disabilities were still being segregated. More than one \nmillion students were excluded from public schools, and another 3.5 \nmillion did not receive appropriate services. Many States had laws \nexcluding certain students, including those who were blind, deaf, or \nlabeled ``emotionally disturbed'' or ``mentally retarded.'' The \nlikelihood of exclusion was significantly greater for children\n\n[[Page S11659]]\n\nwith disabilities living in low-income, ethnic and racial minority, or \nrural communities.\n  Parents, however, began asserting their children's rights to attend \npublic schools, using the same equal protection arguments used on \nbehalf of the African American children in Brown; the 14th Amendment of \nthe U.S. Constitution guarantees their children equal protection under \nthe law. Recognizing the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection \nunder the law, Congress enacted the law now known as IDEA, creating the \nstatutory right to a free appropriate public education in the least \nrestrictive environment.\n  We have come a long way since that law was first enacted. In 2001, we \npassed the No Child Left Behind Act. In that legislation, we recognized \nthat every child has the capacity to learn, and we required our States \nto improve the academic achievement of all children. For the first \ntime, we held schools accountable for the academic achievement of \nstudents with disabilities.\n  By all accounts, this challenge is great. States and schools try \ntheir best with both inadequate resources and inadequate technical \nassistance from the Department of Education. But, we cannot allow ``a \npass'' for these children. We cannot turn our back on the six million \nchildren with disabilities and their families. It is our obligation to \nensure that students with disabilities count too.\n  This legislation ensures that local school districts measure the \nperformance of students with disabilities on State or district-wide \nassessments, including alternate assessments aligned to the State's \nacademic content standards or alternative standards. The legislation \nalso ensures that students with disabilities are taught by highly \nqualified teachers, and sets forth rigorous yet flexible criteria for \nStates to meet. The legislation requires special education teachers to \nbe certified in special education, have at least a bachelor degree, and \ndemonstrate appropriate subject knowledge. The bill, however, gives \nstates significant flexibility in determining how a teacher meets those \nstandards.\n  It is essential that children with disabilities have access to, and \nsucceed in, the general education curriculum. The due process and \nprocedural safeguard provisions are the most important means of \nprotecting the constitutional rights of children with disabilities to a \nfree appropriate public education. This legislation maintains these \nvital civil rights protections.\n  Yet, we also recognize that IDEA is sometimes seen as too litigious \nand confrontational. Accordingly, we have created new opportunities for \nparents and schools to address concerns before the need for a due \nprocess hearing, and encourage parents and schools to resolve \ndifferences by clarifying that mediation is available at any time.\n  Further, this bill addresses the problems associated with discipline, \nwhich is often viewed as complex and difficult to administer. The bill \nsimplifies the framework for schools to administer the law, while \nensuring the rights and the safety of all children. It requires schools \nto determine if a child's behavior was the result of his or her \ndisability or poor implementation of their Individualized Education \nProgram, IEP, when considering a disciplinary action. It requires that \nschools conduct functional behavioral assessments and give behavioral \ninterventions to students who are disciplined beyond 10 days, in order \nto prevent future behavior problems. And, the bill provides resources \nto help develop and enhance behavioral supports in schools while \nimproving the quality of interim alternative education settings.\n\n  We also recognize that too many teachers get bogged down in \nburdensome paperwork chores. According to the Department of Education, \n53 percent of special education teachers reported that paperwork and \nother routine duties interfered with their job of teaching students to \na great extent. Clearly, the amount of paperwork involved in a special \neducation teacher's job is a problem. I am pleased that this bill takes \nsignificant steps to reduce the paperwork burden.\n  For example, under this legislation: teachers will have increased \naccess to technology; teachers and other staff will conduct fewer \nevaluations; IEPs and IEP meetings will be simplified; procedural \nsafeguards notices will not be provided multiple times in a year, \nunless there are special circumstances; the Department of Education \nwill create model forms to show States and districts how to meet the \nrequirements of IDEA while reducing paperwork; and up to 15 States will \nbe allowed to participate in a ``Paperwork Reduction Demonstration.'' \nThis demo would allow states to waive burdensome statutory and \nregulatory requirements that interfere with a teacher's ability to \nteach, while at the same time ensuring that a State does not impinge \nupon the constitutional rights of children with disabilities to a free \nappropriate public education.\n  The bill also expands services to students with disabilities in many \nways. The legislation ensures educational services for homeless and \nfoster students with disabilities, as well as for other students who \nfrequently transfer from one school to another. The bill improves \naccess to instructional materials for students who are blind or for \nstudents with other visual disabilities. It also provides extensive \nearly intervention services for children ages zero through 5, \nincreasing the focus on school readiness activities. The bill improves \nthe IEP process, making it easier for parents and teachers to more \nmeaningfully develop a student's education plan. And, the bill \nsignificantly improves transition services to ensure that students with \ndisabilities are prepared for postsecondary education or employment.\n  This legislation recognizes that approximately \\2/3\\ of the students \nwith disabilities in this country spend a majority of the school day in \ngeneral education classrooms, and accordingly provides local school \ndistricts with significant flexibility in the use of its Federal IDEA \ndollars. For example, a local school district may use up to 15 percent \nof its IDEA funds to develop an educational support system to help \nstudents who have not been identified as needing special education, but \nwho require additional academic and behavioral supports to succeed in \nthe general education curriculum. Or, a school district may reduce its \nmaintenance of effort by up to 50 percent of its increases in Federal \nfunds to support other educational activities.\n  One of the most critical features of this bill is the level of \nsupport provided to teachers, principals, and other school personnel. \nWe all know the difference a well-prepared, highly qualified teacher \ncan make in the life of a student. This legislation provides personnel \ndevelopment grants to States to help recruit, prepare, and retain \nhighly qualified special educators. It also provides grants to \ninstitutions of higher education to focus exclusively on training for \nbeginning special educators through extended clinical experience or \nteacher-faculty partnerships.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this legislation holds States \nand school districts accountable for the academic and functional \nachievement of students with disabilities. It provides the Secretary of \nEducation and the States with the authority and the tools to implement, \nmonitor, and enforce the law.\n  We recognize the potential burden these provisions might place on \nState departments of education, and accordingly have increased the \namount of funds States may reserve for statewide activities to carry \nout these provisions. In addition, we have authorized the Secretary to \nset-aside a portion of its funds to provide technical assistance to \nStates to help implement these provisions.\n  In order to ensure the constitutional right to a free appropriate \npublic education for children with disabilities, the Department of \nEducation must have the tools necessary to enforce compliance with \nIDEA. The Department of Education has found widespread noncompliance \nwith the law and regulations, with more than half of the violations \ndirectly related to the provision of student services.\n  In 2003, New Mexico served nearly 64,000 students under IDEA. I \nstrongly believe these provisions are absolutely necessary to ensuring \nthat these students receive the special education and related services \nthey are entitled to.\n  This legislation takes a significant step forward in providing the \nmillions of students with disabilities the accountability, tools, and \nresources necessary to access, and succeed in, the general education \ncurriculum. While I\n\n[[Page S11660]]\n\nam certainly disappointed that we have not provided full funding, and \nwe have not addressed all of the issues to the complete satisfaction of \nparents, teachers, and schools, I am confident that this bill will help \nstudents with disabilities achieve to their highest potential.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am pleased that Congress is in the \nfinal stage of reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA. While I am glad that the bill emerged in a \nbipartisan way, I am still frustrated that Congress has yet again \nfailed to fulfill its promise to fully fund IDEA. With IDEA still \ndrastically underfunded, schools are left without the necessary \nresources to provide the best services to children with disabilities, \nand our communities are burdened with an unfulfilled federal promise.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, school budgets are capped by law at 3 \npercent annual growth. Therefore, districts often have to cut other \nprograms to accommodate mandated and rising special-education costs. \nOr--local property taxpayers, who already are overburdened--have to pay \nincreased taxes to cover expenses that the Federal Government should be \nsharing.\n  I have received many letters, phone calls, and emails from concerned \nconstituents urging Congress to fulfill the promise of full funding for \nthe services mandated under IDEA. I have supported efforts to require \nfull funding of IDEA and intend to continue the fight so that every \nchild receives the free and appropriate public education the law \nguarantees and we can ease the burden on our local communities.\n  In addition, I would like to highlight one specific issue related to \nIDEA that has not only affected the children of New Jersey, but \nchildren across this nation. That is the staggering increase in the \nnumber of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, ASD. Recent \nepidemiology studies have shown that autism spectrum disorders are ten \ntimes more prevalent than they were just 10 years ago, making ASD the \nsecond most common developmental disability. While there is currently \nmuch debate and still no conclusive evidence as to the cause of this \nalarming trend, it is clear that this trend will continue. Equally \nclear is the critical need for Congress to address the issue of early \nintervention and effective treatment for children diagnosed with ASD.\n  Scientific evidence has proven that early intervention is a key to \nsuccess when treating ASD. Over the last 20 years, experts have \ndeveloped effective strategies for the correction of autism disorder, \nand research shows that with the early application of an effective \ntherapy, substantial gains can be accomplished toward the remediation \nof autistic disorder in many children. With autism diagnoses \nescalating, expanding access to treatment, especially at an early age, \nis vital to improving the outcomes for children affected by ASD. That \nis why I introduced the Teacher Education for Autistic Children Act or \nTEACH Act. I worked closely with New Jersey Center for Outreach and \nCommunity Services for the Autism Community, NJCOSAC, Autism Coalition \nfor Research and Education, and Parents of Autistic Children to create \nthis legislation that addresses the needs of autistic children by \nbringing more qualified teachers into the classroom, helping families \nreceive the support and services they need for their children, and \nensuring quality vocational programs to assist people with autism \ntransition from school to work.\n  I am happy to report that some critical provisions of the TEACH Act \nhave been included in the IDEA conference report currently being \nconsidered by the Senate. These provisions will make Federal funds \navailable to develop and improve programs for children with autism, \nusing research grounded in science. The grants will help ensure quality \nprofessional development for special education teachers by providing \nin-service training to schools and personnel who teach children with \nASD. With the demand for services grossly outpacing the supply of \nqualified teachers and therapists, these provisions are critical to \nincreasing the number of special education teachers trained to teach \nchildren diagnosed with ASD and help them reach their full potential.\n  I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire HELP \nCommittee for their tireless efforts in working with me to get this \nessential language included in the bill. In particular, I would like to \nsingle out Connie Garner for her dedication and diligent work on behalf \nof children with special needs. I look forward to continuing to work on \nthis important issue with my colleagues in Congress and with the autism \ncommunity to ensure that all children with ASD have access to quality \nteachers trained in providing cutting-edge treatments.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will note that is a significant piece \nof legislation that just passed. I serve on that committee. We spent \nseveral years working on it. We have improved some of the discipline \nproblems. We have reduced some of the paperwork. I believe maybe there \nis more we can still do, but that is a big deal for hundreds of \nthousands of teachers and students all over our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/19/senate-section/article/S11660-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MAKING CERTAIN CORRECTIONS TO THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 1350\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

and\n       (5) recognize that these steps lay the basis for more rapid \n     progress on the road map as a reliable guide leading to final \n     status negotiations;\n       Whereas the United States will join with others in the \n     international community to foster the development of \n     Palestinian democratic political institutions, support the \n     new leadership of the Palestinians that is committed to those \n     institutions, assist in the reconstruction of civic \n     institutions, promote the growth of a free and prosperous \n     economy, and endorse the building of capable security \n     institutions dedicated to maintaining law and order and \n     dismantling terrorist organizations;
