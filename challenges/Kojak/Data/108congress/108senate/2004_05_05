Mr. President, I intend to use my leader time this \nmorning and comment, if I may, on gasoline prices. They continue to hit \nrecord highs.\n  According to the Department of Energy, the average retail price of a \ngallon of gasoline in America is more than $1.84, up 23 cents in the \nlast two months, 33 cents in the last year, and 37 cents in the past 36 \nmonths.\n  In my State of South Dakota, the average price of gasoline is $1.80 \nper gallon, with many communities seeing much higher prices than that. \nEven more troubling, the Department of Energy expects prices to remain \nhigh through the summer. This is of particular concern for rural States \nsuch as South Dakota, where many people have no choice but to drive \nlong distances daily to get to their jobs, to receive health care, or \njust to shop for essentials. Americans are increasingly frustrated with \nskyrocketing gas prices and want to know what the Federal Government is \ngoing to do about it. And they want action now.\n  In March, I sent a letter to the President recommending that he take \nseveral initiatives that could curb gasoline prices at home. First, I \nsuggested that he use the prestige of his office and his relationships \nwith foreign leaders to press the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries--OPEC--to increase production, thereby relieving some of the \npressure on gas prices in the United States in the long term. This is \nnot a radical idea. In fact, on more than one occasion in the fall of \n2000, then-candidate Bush put the challenge directly to the President. \nHis message was clear:\n\n       What I think the President ought to do is he ought to get \n     on the phone with the OPEC cartel and say, ``We expect you to \n     open the spigots.''\n\n  If that was good advice then, it is certainly sound counsel now. \nUnfortunately, President Bush has not followed his own advice.\n  Secretary of Energy Abraham announced earlier this year that the Bush\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\nadministration would not call on OPEC to roll back their scheduled \nproduction cuts. Secretary Abraham said, ``The United States is not \ngoing to go around the world begging for oil.'' On April 1, OPEC went \nahead with the production cuts.\n  In my March letter, I also asked the President to follow the Senate's \nadvice and stop diverting oil from the marketplace to fill the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. On March 11, the Senate voted 52 to 43 for \nan amendment that would stop the diversions of oil. Simply put, it is \nillogical to be taking oil out of the marketplace when gasoline prices \nare so high. If anything, we should be doing just the opposite. The \nPresident has ignored the Senate's advice, and gasoline prices continue \nto rise.\n  To add insult to injury, we now know that the large oil companies are \nreaping record profits as a result of the volatility in the gasoline \nmarket, while consumers are struggling with higher prices at the pump. \nOver the past year, the ``Big Four'' oil companies have seen an average \nincrease in their U.S. profits of 157 percent. Chevron-Texaco has seen \na 294 percent increase in its U.S. refining and marketing profits. BP \nhas seen a 165 percent increase. ExxonMobil has seen a 125 percent \nincrease. And Conoco-Phillips has seen a 44 percent increase.\n  Consumers have reason to be upset. While the big oil companies are \nraking in record profits, President Bush remains reluctant to take \nsteps that could reduce the costs consumers face. It is time to \nreconsider this posture.\n  In the short term, I hope that President Bush will take another look \nat the value of encouraging OPEC to increase production now.\n  Senator Wyden, who is on the floor this morning, has introduced a \nresolution calling on the President to do just that. I hope the Senate \nwould ratify it and would encourage, on a bipartisan basis, the \nPresident to take this action with the passage of the resolution. This \nresolution contains the same language as the resolution the Senate \npassed unanimously in 2000, when then-Senators Ashcroft and Abraham \njoined others in offering it. I hope that the Senate will act on the \nWyden resolution soon.\n  I also encourage the President to reconsider his decision to continue \nfilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But short-term fixes are not \nthe answer to our longer-term energy supply problem. The Nation needs a \nbalanced, national energy policy. This Congress has considered \ncomprehensive energy legislation. I have voted for the conference \nversion of this legislation twice--once in November when it contained \nthe controversial MTBE liability relief provision, and again last week \nwhen Senator Domenici offered a slimmed down version with the MTBE \nrider as an amendment to the Internet tax bill. It was defeated both \ntimes by bipartisan votes.\n  It is no secret that I strongly support the renewable fuels standard \nprovision of the comprehensive energy bill. That section would double \nthe amount of ethanol produced in the United States over the next 10 \nyears. In the process, it would boost rural income, improve air \nquality, and extend domestic gasoline supply.\n  The use of domestically produced, renewable ethanol has effectively \nlowered gasoline prices to motorists whenever it has been made \navailable during its 25-year history. This is because high-octane, \nclean-burning renewable fuels, especially ethanol, increase available \nvolume of finished gasoline by more than 10 percent today and give \ngasoline markets more supply options.\n\n  In addition, the reduced tax that is imposed on renewable fuel also \nsaved consumers millions of dollars each year as ethanol blends are \nnearly always priced lower than conventional gasoline.\n  Reenactment of the renewable fuel standard would result in more than \n500,000 barrels per day of high-octane, refined ethanol for blending \nwith gasoline, saving the United States $4 billion in imported oil each \nyear because we would double the use of renewable fuels.\n  Unlike the comprehensive Energy bill which remains stalled by \nbipartisan opposition to specific provisions, the renewable fuel \nstandard enjoys strong bipartisan support. It has been reported out of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee twice and passed by the \nSenate twice, both times by more than a two-thirds vote. It is still \npending in the Senate today. Last June, 68 Senators voted in favor of \nRFS when then-Majority Leader Frist and I offered it as an amendment to \nthe Energy bill. The renewable fuel standard will help blunt rising \ngasoline prices. If Congress is not able to pass the RFS as part of a \ncomprehensive energy bill, it should pass it on its own. It is the \nright thing to do for consumers.\n  Beyond that, we have to recognize this country cannot sustain its \ncurrent consumption of gasoline and of transportation fuels. We have to \nfind ways in a comprehensive energy policy to deal with an issue that \nmany on the other side are unwilling to deal with, and that is \nconservation. We have the capacity to improve conservation, to reduce \nper capita demand. We have a capacity now to use the technological \ninnovation, the extraordinary research that has been offered in the \nlast 20 years to bring down consumption in both comprehensive as well \nas in individual and specific ways. I have absolutely every confidence \nthat if our Members would continue to work on comprehensive energy \nlegislation with an understanding of the importance of conservation, of \nreduction of our insatiable appetite for more and more energy, we could \ndo it. It must be a part of any long-term energy policy if, indeed, we \nare going to bring this country to a balanced and a pragmatic \nappreciation of the extraordinary implications of current energy policy \nand demand in this country today.\n  Again, I hope we all recognize the volatility and the extraordinary \ndanger economically and financially we put our country and all \nAmericans in if we are not prepared to address energy prices, gasoline \nprices, more effectively than we have so far at the Federal level.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. We worked yesterday at great length on the FSC bill and \nwere able to get the amendment we have been trying to get a vote on for \nseveral months dealing with overtime. The amendment, of course, passed. \nThat is out of the way.\n  The Democrats are offering lots of amendments. We have amendments \nthat are pending that have been offered by a number of Democratic \nSenators, amendments we have in the queue, and other Democrats have \nindicated they are willing to offer their amendments.\n  I say to my friend, the distinguished Democratic leader, on our side \nwe feel this bill is doable and we can do it quite quickly. I want the \nrecord to be spread with a statement from the Democratic leader that we \nwant the bill to pass. If it does not pass, it is not going to be \nanything that has been done by the minority. The FSC bill is important. \nWe realize it has been important for some time and have done everything \nwe can to get it passed.\n  Would the Democratic leader indicate his feelings about this most \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I respond to the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader by first thanking him for again clarifying our \ncircumstances with regard to the FSC bill. I said in the Senate \nyesterday, and I know he has reiterated our commitment, that we will \npass the bill this week if we can get the cooperation of Senators on \nboth sides.\n  Working with the distinguished assistant Democratic leader, we have \nwinnowed down the number of amendments on our side to a handful. We are \nvery confident we can finish the consideration of the pending \nDemocratic amendments, certainly within the next couple of days. I have \nyet to hear from our Republican colleagues as to the status of the 55 \namendments that were offered on their side. I have no information that \nwould lead me to believe they have had similar success. I hope that is \nnot the case. I hope they have been able to convince Republican \nSenators that 55 amendments, as prolific as that sounds, would make it \nimpossible to finish the bill this week.\n  We are prepared to continue to work to see we bring our debate on \nthis bill to closure. I am confident we can do that, at least on our \nside, and I appreciate very much the Senator from Nevada working so \ndiligently with the managers of the bill to accommodate our optimism \nabout our success in completing the bill this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\n                      STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, at a time when there are record gasoline \nprices for the American consumer and record oil company profits, the \nBush administration is filling our Strategic Petroleum Reserve at 2\\1/\n2\\ times the average fill rate. Over the last 2 years, the average fill \nrate has been about 120,000 barrels a day. Recently, it has been \nhovering around 300,000 barrels a day. Using the figures provided by \nthe administration's Energy Information Administration Office, these \npolicies would raise the price of oil per barrel about $1.50.\n  I come to the Senate today to say I believe the Bush administration's \npolicies with respect to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve are hitting \nthe American people with a double whammy. For the American people, more \nof their tax dollars are now being spent for filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve and more of their take-home dollars are being spent \non gasoline at the pump.\n  I come today to say if the Bush administration is not willing to at \nleast reduce the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, I ask \nthe Bush administration to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nwith a firehose. It is that simple.\n  Over the course of the year, the administration may say, we reach an \naverage fill rate of 120,000 barrels a day. There is a great amount of \noil in some months and no oil in other months.\n  To that, I say the months before the peak driving season, when \ngasoline is already at record prices, are not the months to go whole \nhog in filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This is not the time to \npour in the maximum amount of oil. One reason is because oil prices are \nalready so high that American taxpayers are spending top dollar for the \noil being put into the reserve. Anyone who has ever had to run their \nown family finances knows when prices are high, sometimes you wait \nuntil the price comes down to buy what you want.\n  There is another, more compelling reason to slow the rate of fill in \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is because this administration's \npolicy is actually contributing to the high gas prices shellacking \nworking Americans' pocketbooks every day from coast to coast.\n  I am of the view the American consumer is about to get hit by a \nperfect storm with respect to these gasoline prices. The combination of \nOPEC cutbacks, the fact the Federal Trade Commission--the agency that \nis supposed to protect our consumers--is sitting on its hands, the fact \nyou actually get a tax break for closing a profitable oil refinery, \nthese Strategic Petroleum Reserve policies, is going to create a \nperfect storm that is going to be devastating for American consumers \nacross our country.\n  I know my colleagues are here and want to talk about this issue, as \nwell, so I will abbreviate my statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from the great State of \nNew Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield in order for me to \nmake a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. CORZINE.

Mr. President, first of all, let me go back and \ncompliment my colleague from Oregon, who I think has analyzed a problem \nthat fits into a pattern of economic pressure that we see building on \nthe middle class in America.\n  There is nothing more fundamental today in life than filling the car \nwith gasoline and using it for commuting and taking the kids to school \nand doing all the normal tasks that we have going on. We see the same \nproblem, by the way, with health care costs, tuition costs, and with \nproperty taxes across this country.\n  While there may be some good economic statistics out there, middle-\nclass Americans are being hit unbelievably hard on the fundamentals \nthat drive their basic budgets. Nothing--nothing--more clearly \ndemonstrates this than these rising gasoline prices we have been \nexperiencing this year. There has been a 23-cent increase in the price \nof gasoline. Nationally, the average price for gasoline is $1.84 a \ngallon. Many places in the country it is over $2 a gallon.\n  This comes from flawed simple economics 101, supply and demand. This \nadministration is doing everything that you can imagine to hold back \nsupply by filling the petroleum reserve at accelerated rates, when it \nis already about 95 percent full. It does not need to be in this \nposition.\n  As we go into the summer season, the ``perfect storm'' the Senator \nfrom Oregon talks about is also being implemented with regard to other \npolicies. It is counter to any basic economic analysis that you would \nwant, to be taking supply off the market that would run down prices. I \ndon't know what people are thinking when they implement policies that \nare going to restrict supply, and when they are unwilling to confront \nOPEC as they are cutting back supply. What we are getting is the \nnatural result of rising prices, which is coming right out of the \npocketbook of middle-class Americans. It is just absolutely wrong.\n  If you are cynical, you can also say, well, maybe it is because some \npeople benefit from these higher prices. Being someone who worked in \nthe private sector for 25 years of my life, I don't think profits are a \nbad thing. But when the American people are suffering from this erosion \nof their quality of life--because of the rise in property taxes, health \ncare costs, tuition costs, and now gas prices--you wonder why it is so \nappropriate that Exxon-Mobil's profits were up 125 percent in the first \nquarter of this year; BP's profits were up 165 percent; and Chevron-\nTexaco's profits were up 294 percent. Is that economic fairness, in any \ncontext, particularly when you put it into the perspective that what \nthe Bush administration is doing is restricting supply?\n\n  This is just wrong. It is out of the context of what is best for the \nAmerican economy and for growth and the quality of life of Americans. \nIt needs to be addressed. We are creating a windfall for American \nbusiness at the expense of middle-class Americans. And it is happening \nday after day after day.\n  I do not begrudge profits, but I don't think it ought to be done on \nthe backs of the American middle class because of the general \nmacroeconomic policies of the President. And that is exactly what we \nhave right now. It is wrong and needs to be pushed back, just as we \nneed to confront Saudi Arabia with regard to its leadership in OPEC. If \nthey are our ally, as they claim to be, then we ought to be speaking to \nthem about increasing the production of oil out of OPEC as opposed to \nthe restrictions we have seen.\n  From what we understand from all news reports and actually the Saudi \nForeign Minister has said, there has not been one word of contact from \nthis administration to the Saudis about OPEC production.\n  So now we have two of those very large ingredients into the supply \nand demand equation. That is why we are getting high prices. That is \nwhy gas is $1.84 a gallon, on average, in the country. And that is why \nit is $2 a gallon on the coast and most of the places where our larger \npopulation segments work.\n  It is really troubling we cannot put together a response to something \nthat is eroding the quality of life in the aftertax base of middle-\nclass Americans to actually operate in a sound way. So I hope we will \nall follow Senator Wyden's lead. He has done a terrific job of bringing \nfocus to it, as has the Senator from New York, talking about pushing \nback against OPEC on production cutbacks. We really need to take a \nstand for the American people, not for the oil companies and the \nprofitability we are seeing brought forth.\n  At a time when we still have not recovered those 2.6 million private \nsector\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\njob losses, when 8.5 million Americans are unemployed, why we are \nputting more pressure on middle-class Americans and their quality of \nlife is just hard to believe. It is time for a change. Supporting the \nproposition of the Senator from Oregon is one that I think we all ought \nto get out and get to work on.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there is not an American today who woke up \nand did not hear the lead news story, a story which has, frankly, \nbrought us to a position of embarrassment with the abuses that have \nbeen sadly documented and have been spread across the world relating to \nthe treatment of Iraqi prisoners.\n  The word is that the President of the United States is going to \naddress the Arab nations through their own television network to talk \nabout his disappointment, and I hope with an apology for what has \noccurred.\n  But we have a responsibility on Capitol Hill. We have a \nresponsibility in the Senate. I believe we should move, and move \ndecisively, No. 1, to entertain and pass a resolution on this floor \nthat makes it clear that what happened in that Iraqi prison is not what \nAmerica is all about, and that those responsible for it--from those \nwhose photographs were taken, all the way up the chain of command--need \nto be held accountable for their actions. Nothing less than that should \nbe tolerated.\n  Secondly, the Secretary of Defense, Don Rumsfeld, should be appearing \nbefore a committee on Capitol Hill, on a timely basis, as quickly as \npossible, to explain exactly what happened. It is absolutely incredible \nthat the Secretary of Defense had no knowledge of this event, nor of \nthe investigation that followed.\n  Finally, let me say this. Many of us believe what happened last week \nwith the appearance of the Secretary of Defense on Capitol Hill was \nextremely troubling. Last Thursday, Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld \nappeared in a classified briefing on Capitol Hill, telling the Senate \nmembership the state of affairs in Iraq. It was the same day that this \nstory was to be aired on ``60 Minutes II,'' the story relating to Iraqi \nprisoners.\n\n  The fact is, the Secretary testified without even indicating to the \nMembers of the Senate that this story existed or was about to be \ndisclosed to the American people. That is unacceptable.\n  The Secretary of Defense needs to return to Capitol Hill tomorrow to \ngive another classified briefing to the Members of the Senate, to tell \nus exactly what transpired, why he did not disclose this to Members of \nthe Senate, and why there is this veil of secrecy in this \nadministration when it comes to one of the most troubling stories that \nhas emerged since our invasion of Iraq.\n  I have spoken to our Democratic leader, Tom Daschle. He has been in \nconversation and dialogue with Senator Frist, the Republican leader, \nand has an agreement that all three things that I have just outlined \nwill occur: a resolution on the floor relative to the Iraqi prison \nscandal; secondly, an appearance by Secretary Rumsfeld in open hearing \nbefore a committee as soon as possible; and, third, a request that the \nSecretary come to Congress, on a classified basis, and meet with us \ntomorrow, before this week ends, before this Senate leaves, to explain \nto us what has happened in this terrible episode.\n  Those who are responsible for this need to be held accountable--\nwhether they are the soldiers involved in it and right up the chain of \ncommand to the leadership that failed. If we do not do this, frankly, \nwe are jeopardizing the security of this country and the safety of our \nmen and women in uniform, who still continue to struggle in Iraq to \nfind peace and stability in that country.\n  We need to move now. We need to move decisively. We need to show the \nleadership on Capitol Hill which has failed to this point. The way to \ndo it is through these three approaches.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to my friend from \nIllinois, I appreciate very much his statement. I am hopeful and \nconfident that agreement on those strategies will be reached today. I \nam terribly disappointed, and not only in what we did not hear from the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I think I have 6\\1/2\\ minutes. I yield a \nminute of my time to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there was more brass in 407 last Thursday \nthan would make up a band, four stars all over the place, including the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Not a single one of those people \nin the chain of command even breathed a word of the impending scandal \nthat they knew about as they briefed us. It is a terrible situation \nwhen we meet in secret up in room 407 and something as scandalous as \nAmerican troops killing--we now have confirmed two homicides--prisoners \nof war in addition to humiliating them through sexual pictures and \ndoing other things that speak so poorly of our military that I am \nsickened to my stomach.\n  Mr. President, we will take 1 minute from Senator Breaux.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute through \nSenator Breaux's time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree completely with the Senator from Nevada. I have a \nfeeling of embarrassment and also sadness, sadness for the thousands of \nmen and women in uniform risking their lives today, serving us so nobly \nin Iraq, who are going to be swept into this vortex. We have to make \ncertain the soldiers who are responsible for this as well as their \nleaders in command are brought out and held accountable so that our \nfine men and women who are fighting in the military in Iraq do not have \nto bear this burden. They are our best and brightest. We owe them the \ngreatest respect. But let us be honest; what happened here is not \ntypical of America, certainly not typical of our military. Unless we \nare forthright and open in accountability, it is going to sweep all of \nthem into this veil of blame. That would be unfortunate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleagues from Nevada and Illinois for what \nthey have said. The bottom line is, of course, very little could be \nmore counterproductive to this war effort than what has happened. The \nbest way to deal with it is to come clean and come clean quickly, to \nfind out how often it happened, where it happened, how high up the \nchain of command, and exorcise it. Because to the overwhelming majority \nof our troops and our military leadership this is abhorrent. The sooner \nwe can exorcise this cancer, the better off we will all be. Keeping \nthis secret is not going to work. It is going to come out. It has come \nout. I join my colleagues. I hope we can get Secretary Rumsfeld to come \nback before us very quickly and give us a full and complete briefing on \nwhat has happened. That should happen this week, because last week he \ngave a briefing in room 407 and didn't even mention this, even though \nit was going to appear on TV that night.\n  All of us who care so much about our troops, who are risking their \nlives with bravery, hate to see any stain upon them. The quicker we \ndeal with this, the better it will be for everybody. Don't hide it. \nDon't underplay it. Just get it out, exorcise it, and go forward. That \nis what we have to do. I hope Mr. Rumsfeld will come before us quickly.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4857-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n                               OIL PRICES\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss oil prices, another \nproblem vexing America. Everywhere I go in my State, people are just \namazed that gasoline prices are through the roof. It is hurting \neverybody. There was a report last week that people were buying a \nlittle less food. You know you are getting down to the bare bones. \nCosts of everything could go up. Inflation, thankfully, has stayed low, \nbut if energy prices stay this high for this long, they are going to \nget higher. What is so troubling is that we have the tools to bring the \nprices back down. The administration is fiddling while high-priced \ngasoline burns, if you will.\n  The No. 1 culprit is not the lack of refineries. Let me make clear: \nWe do have a shortage of refineries. We have had a shortage for 15 \nyears. The price has not been this high for 15 years. The price was a \nlot lower a year ago with the same number of refineries.\n  The problem is OPEC. OPEC has gotten together, led by the Saudis, and \ndecided that the old ceiling of $28 a barrel is no longer the ceiling. \nIt is approaching $40 a barrel. That is danger for our people, our \neconomy. Senator Corzine mentioned before, you see the great economic \nnumbers and then you talk to average folks and they are having as much \ntrouble paying the bills and making ends meet as they ever did before. \nMy view of my role as Senator is to help those folks with their daily \nlives, not to just look at numbers in the newspaper and say, the \nnumbers are good but, rather, to talk to average people and say: How \nare you doing? When I ask that, they say: Well, I would be doing a lot \nbetter if gasoline prices were lower.\n  We have a weapon. We have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve's first and foremost purpose is to be there \nin an emergency. But we changed the law. I helped change it. It can be \nused when gasoline prices are too high as a temporary way of bringing \nthem down. That is what we should be doing.\n  The bottom line is, instead of actually putting more oil on the \nmarket to lower the price, we are increasing the reserve as we speak, \nraising the price even further, even though the reserve is over 90 \npercent full.\n  I have a resolution I hope to introduce on some bill soon enough that \nasks the President to confront OPEC, not to play footsie with them, not \nto just tell the Saudis we understand.\n  I understand there has been a close relationship between many in this \nadministration and the Saudis and the oil companies. It is sort of a \nBermuda Triangle into which oil prices just go. But enough is enough. \nWe should be putting a million barrels of oil out into the market for \n30 or 60 days and watch, the price will come down.\n  I don't regard this as a partisan activity. I pushed President \nClinton to do this for 8 months. He did it in October of 2002. The \nprice went down and stayed down. Do you know why it stayed down? Not \njust the new oil on the market, although oil prices are decided at the \nmargin, but because OPEC knew they couldn't play around with us. When \nSpence Abraham, the Secretary of Energy, says we are not using the SPR, \nit gives a green light to OPEC that says: Raise prices as high as you \nwant.\n  Is that leadership? Is that what the average American needs? Again, \nthe average American is not looking at the newspaper and saying: Gee, \nthe economy is great. They are sitting down at the dinner table Friday \nnight and tearing out their hair about how they are going to pay their \nbills. The high price of gasoline makes it much worse. We have a way to \ncombat it, to tell the Saudis and OPEC, the heck with you. And we are \nsitting there. This administration just sits and twiddles its thumbs as \nthe price goes up and up and up. In fact, we send them little signals \nthat it is perfectly OK.\n  The resolution I will be drafting--and I know my colleagues from \nCalifornia and Oregon are interested because we have talked about \nthis--asks that we immediately, for 30 days, and then with the option \nfor another 30 days, put a million barrels of oil out there. The price \nwill come down.\n  I ask my fellow New Yorkers and Americans, don't think there is \nnothing we can do about high oil prices. As my good colleague from \nOregon who led this debate said and as my colleague from New Jersey \nsaid, if we would simply use the SPR to reduce prices instead of now \nhaving it raise prices, the price would come down.\n  Again, our job as Senator is not to just look at these \nmacrostatistics--that is part of the job--it is to figure out what the \naverage family needs. And they need lower prices.\n  We can do it. I urge the administration, I urge this body to stop \nignoring this problem, to get working on this problem, and bring those \nprices down in a variety of ways. What I have been pushing is the SPR, \nrelease some oil from the SPR. Prices will come down. It happened when \nPresident Clinton did it.\n  I hope this body will act quickly. Just because there is big oil, \nbecause there are Saudis, does not mean we should have to roll over. \nThe President should be standing up for the average American, not \nstanding up for the oil companies and not patting the Saudis on the \nback.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had hoped to come to the floor when \nSenator Durbin spoke with regard to the need for a Senate response on \nthe matter of prisoner abuse. Senator Durbin related, as I understand \nit, some conversations I have had with the distinguished majority \nleader, and I confirm I have had some very good conversations with the \nmajority leader about some of the actions Senator Durbin outlined.\n  The majority leader shares my view, and I know he will want to speak \nto the matter himself, that the Senate needs to address this matter, \nasking Secretary Rumsfeld to come to room S-407 this week so we can ask \nquestions directly and clarify why it was when they met with us last \nweek we were not told of this information, and share with us as much as \nhe and the Pentagon know about the degree of abuse, what other \ncircumstances may be involved, and whatever has been learned so far \nthrough the investigation, and a full airing of the report.\n  He also indicated his view that the Secretary ought to come before \nthe appropriate committees and testify with regard to these actions so \nthe American people have a better understanding of what we know and \nwhat actions are being taken to address this circumstance so we can say \nwithout equivocation it will not happen again, and that we can \nreiterate to the world community this is not the practice, not the \npolicy, and certainly not in keeping with the character of the American \npeople.\n  Finally, Senator Frist and I have talked extensively about the \nimportance of passing a resolution this week denouncing this abuse and \nexpressing our abhorrence on a bipartisan basis and sending as clear a \nmessage as we can to all the world community that this is unacceptable \nbehavior, it is not in keeping with our practice, with our philosophy, \nwith our character, and we want as much as possible to rectify what \ndamage has been done and to assure those who would in some way make any \neffort to use this for their own purposes as an anti-American \npropaganda tool that that will not be tolerated.\n\n  This is not America. This is not the practice of our country. This is \nnot the practice of 99.9 percent of the military serving so admirably \nin Iraq today. They deserve better than that. And to tarnish their \nreputation and the contributions they have made is abhorrent as well.\n  We need to make sure those points are made, but, first and foremost, \nwe need to have a better understanding. We are shooting in the dark. We \nhave no information other than what we have read in the newspaper, and \nthat is not acceptable. Secretary Rumsfeld ought to be here, he ought \nto explain himself and the Pentagon, and we ought to say, after having \nacquired that information, as unequivocally and\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\nwith whatever authority we have, this will not happen again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the distinguished minority leader \ndeparts, I join, as does the majority leader, in his request. As he may \nknow, yesterday the Armed Services Committee had a 2-hour briefing with \nthe top military leaders from the Department of the Army. Senator Levin \nand I felt it important to proceed very quickly. Following that, we had \na press conference in which both Senator Levin and I spoke of the need \nfor the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Rumsfeld, to come up.\n  I have been working on that steadily, and I can assure the leader, \nhaving talked to my leader last night, Senator Frist--presumably \nshortly after the two leaders had discussed it--that Senator Frist has \njoined with Senator Daschle and others to get that done.\n  I anticipate, however--and I think it is probably wise--that the \nPresident of the United States is going to address this issue, and I \nthink immediately following that, I will presume, say, Thursday \nmorning, tomorrow morning, that we could hope to have the Secretary \nbefore the Armed Services Committee. And then subject to the \nleadership, perhaps he could work with other Senators in another forum \nlater sometime tomorrow. That would be my advice.\n  I commend the leader, my good friend, for his incorporation in his \nremarks the need for every Senator as they address this issue to \nreflect on the, as he said, 99.99 percent of extraordinary \nprofessionalism and courage rendered by the men and women in the Armed \nForces, not just in Iraq, not just in Afghanistan, but all over the \nworld. No one should have their wonderful works and sacrifices and \nthose of their families in any way tarnished by these serious \nallegations.\n  I thank my good friend and leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I can respond, I thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee for his comments \nand for the work he has already undertaken to ensure many of these \nissues can be addressed. He has shown real leadership. I applaud that \nand look forward to working with him in the days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague of \nmany years.\n  I should now like to proceed, if the Chair will kindly advise this \nSenator the amount of time under the control of this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes in morning business under \nthe control of the majority leader or his designee.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, in my colloquy with the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, I reviewed my great concern that as Senators--\nindeed, as people all over the United States and, indeed, the world--\nwish to address the extraordinary, tragic information flowing about \nalleged atrocities perpetrated by U.S. forces and perhaps others that \nthey incorporate in every statement a reference to the courage, the \nsacrifice, of the men and women in the Armed Forces of our Nation, of \nthe coalition forces who are fighting with us in Iraq, as well as \nAfghanistan and elsewhere around the world, and, indeed, the impact of \nthis tragic series of revelations on their families back here at home, \nand to be ever mindful that in the United States and in the homes of \nthe coalition forces in other nations are the wives, the children, \nmothers, fathers, and others who are in strong support of their loved \none beyond the shores, and how ever so hard this story hits home with \nthem.\n  I do hope my colleagues and others, as they address this issue, take \nthe time to include reference to the valiant work being done by \nuniformed people of the armed forces of many nations and their \nfamilies.\n  The allegations of mistreatment of the prisoners by some members of \nthe Armed Forces, if proven, represent an appalling and totally \nunacceptable breach of military regulations and conduct that could--and \nI repeat--could undermine much of the greatest works and sacrifices of \nour forces in Iraq and around the world in the war on terror.\n  The vast majority of our men and women--as the Democratic leader \nsaid, 99.99 percent--fully understand their obligations to conduct \nthemselves in accordance with military, national, and international \nstandards, most particularly the standards of professional conduct that \nare taught each soldier, sailor, airman, and marine of our forces.\n  The mistreatment of prisoners, no matter what their reason for \nincarceration, is not what the uniform of the United States stands for. \nIt is not what the United States stands for as a Nation. It is not the \nway for anyone who wears that uniform to conduct themselves.\n  The Armed Services Committee received a briefing from senior Army \nofficials yesterday. We did receive a considerable amount of \ninformation that is not freely in the press today. I think in due \ncourse that information will be and should be shared publicly. \nNevertheless, we have begun our probe of this particular case. I \ncommend the committee for its actions so far. We had three-quarters of \nthe members of the committee in attendance yesterday. There was a very \nvigorous questioning of the Army witness. While informative, the \nbriefing revealed the need for more extensive public hearings from \ncivilian and military officials. I made a request for such hearings \nimmediately following our hearing yesterday. I was joined by Senator \nLevin, the ranking member.\n  We must always remember that under our Constitution, it is very clear \nin the long traditions of this country that civilians control the U.S. \nmilitary. They have the ultimate responsibility of the actions of the \nmen and women in uniform. They are the ones who promulgate the orders \nfrom the Commander in Chief, the President, to the unit commanders. \nConsequently, the civilians must accept that responsibility.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld, in a press conference yesterday, addressed the \nNation. As I said, I have been in consultation with him and his office \nabout an appearance, which I anticipate will take place very shortly \nfollowing the public statements to be issued, I believe, today by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I fully believe the most constructive course of action at this point \nis to fully understand the extent of this problem, no matter how much \ntime it requires to gather all of the facts, no matter how difficult it \nis to get all of those facts, no matter how embarrassing those facts \nmay be--get the facts out and the story, so that not only the Congress \nof the United States can reach its judgment but, indeed, the American \npublic and others around the world, because this is an around-the-world \nstory at this point in time.\n  Our great Nation has had a symbol of freedom and hope for its entire \nexistence. The world looks to us as the standard bearer of how best to \nbring about freedom for others, how best to protect those values which \nwe hold so dearly and for which men and women have gone forth for \ngenerations from these shores not to conquer or take land, but they \nhave gone forth in the cause of freedom.\n  I believe in due course, once this story is fully understood, we will \nhave the ability as a Nation to apologize to our Chief Executive, the \nPresident, through others, through this humble Senator, for the actions \ntaken and, most importantly, give the assurances to the world that we \nwill not ever again see a repeat.\n  I have had the privilege to have had association with the men and \nwomen of uniform for over 50 years. When I was a young sailor in the \nclosing year of World War II, I began my career in the training \ncommands of the U.S. Navy. I have had many opportunities in the ensuing \nyears to work with the men and women of the U.S. military. During the \nwar in Korea, I served as a marine. During the Vietnam war, I was \nprivileged to serve over 5 years as the Navy Secretary. We had our \nproblems during that conflict, but I doubt if any of those problems \nparallel the seriousness and consequences of this framework of \nallegations today.\n\n  Therefore, it is a duty upon us to leave no stone unturned, to reveal \nall\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\nof the facts, to give the assurance that it will not happen again, and \nto place into the military such authorities as they need. I doubt if \nthere is anything under statute law that needs to be added, but the \nauthorities need to uphold those laws and regulations, and training \nshould follow so that this will never be repeated.\n  Again, as we proceed over the next days and weeks, we must be mindful \nof the millions of men and women in uniform, past and present, who have \nhonorably, with great sacrifice, defended the laws, rules, traditions, \nand values enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and in the American way \nof life. The actions of a few must not be allowed to tarnish that \nimage.\n  Of course, I am very mindful of the fact that Memorial Day is in a \nfew weeks, and we will dedicate a magnificent set of structures on our \nMall to the men and women who served during World War II--some 16 \nmillion. I had the privilege of going down the other day with Senator \nDole, a former colleague, whose wisdom and energies have contributed \ngreatly to this magnificent memorial. As we walked there together with \nother Senators from this Chamber--totaling 7, who served in World War \nII--Senator Dole said that, yes, the monument stands as a symbol for \nthe sacrifices of those in uniform, some 16 million, but he said it \nalso stands as a monument and testimony of the homefront. Those of us \nwho have memories of that period remember how well this country was \nunified. We had rationing; we had war production; we worked around the \nclock not only to supply and equip our troops but to provide equipment \nfor our Allied forces. It was a magnificent chapter in American \nhistory. That cannot be tarnished by the actions of a few here.\n  There is clearly room for a constructive debate on how best to \nproceed in Iraq, but we must not allow recent events to obscure the \noverall stakes for our Nation and the world in this region. We must be \nunified in overall purpose that success in Iraq is essential and that \nwe, the Congress, stand squarely behind our men and women in uniform.\n  Our troops in Iraq deserve this. They deserve the best support we can \ngive them. To appear divided while our sons and daughters are in harm's \nway runs counter to the traditions of this Chamber. There should be \ndebate, but let it be reasoned and measured, and focused on the way \nforward in this war on terrorism.\n  The brave young men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces have answered \ntheir Nation's call to service. They deserve nothing less than our \nabsolute, unwavering commitment to their success. Nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nhelping to explain to the world how sad all of us are about the \ndevelopments in Iraq with the prisoners. I appreciate the distinguished \nSenator, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, moving forward \nand asking Secretary Rumsfeld to come and testify in public. It is our \nhope that Secretary Rumsfeld will also brief the entire Senate, along \nwith the distinguished committee. I appreciate the leadership of the \nSenator from Virginia very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Texas. Let me \nassure all that I have been in contact with Secretary Rumsfeld. There \nis no reluctance whatsoever on his part to come forward. He desires to \ndo so, but I believe it should be following the Commander in Chief, the \nPresident, when he addresses indeed the Nation and the world in a short \ntime.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Virginia and also agree that \nwould be proper. The President should have the ability to represent the \nAmerican people and the world. I know that he is going to do that in a \nvery effective way. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Iowa to take the next 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to address issues about the \nMedicare discount card, and I particularly want to respond to criticism \nthat we heard yesterday from the other side.\n  Listening yesterday, as I did, and then listening today to the \ncriticism about the high price of gasoline, I have come to the \nconclusion that over the last several days members of the other party \nhave a guilt complex about some of the votes they have cast in recent \nmonths. For instance, only 13 out of 49 Democrats voted to break the \nfilibuster on the national energy policy. If we had a national energy \npolicy, they would not have any worry about high gasoline prices.\n  Then, of course, all but about 12 of them voted against the drug \ndiscount card to give seniors reasonably priced prescription drugs. So \nthey come in and trash the bill we passed in a bipartisan way. I hope \nthey realize they made big mistakes on some of their votes last year \nand suck it up and move on.\n  In regard to what was said yesterday about Medicare, first, yesterday \nwas a very historic day for Medicare beneficiaries in my home State of \nIowa and all the other 49 States. Before then, many beneficiaries paid \nsome of the highest prices for drugs. Now they can begin shopping for a \nMedicare-approved discount card that will help them pay less, a lot \nless.\n  With discounts taking effect June 1, this program will provide \nMedicare beneficiaries with immediate savings on their medicines until \nthe comprehensive Medicare drug benefit begins in 2006. According to \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, beneficiaries will save \n$4 billion to $5 billion over the next year and a half on drugs. That \nis not chickenfeed. That is saving a lot of money for our seniors.\n  Older Americans and individuals with disabilities can choose a card \nthat gets them the lowest prices on drugs they need.\n  Finding the best card could not be simpler. Contrary to what one of \nthe Senators told us yesterday about how complicated this process is, \nthey are hoping the seniors, whom they consider their political \nproperty, will believe them that it is complicated and they will not \nbother to look at it because it is too complicated. Do the seniors of \nAmerica need to have Democrats scare them more?\n  This is how simple it is: Call 1-800-MEDICARE any time, 24 hours a \nday. They can call their State Health Insurance Information Program, \nSHIP as it is called, and get counselors at the local level. Most of \nthem are very well-trained volunteers to help seniors decide. They can \ngo online themselves if they want to, or with a family member, to \ncompare prices offered by different cards.\n  They can find low or no-cost cards that include their neighborhood \npharmacies, all by making one telephone call any time in a 24-hour day \nto a 1-800-MEDICARE number.\n  Using their Medicare-approved drug discount card, beneficiaries will \nsave at least 10 to 25 percent on the cost of their drugs.\n  Like the drug benefit itself, the Medicare-approved drug discount \ncard targets assistance to those most in need. Beneficiaries with low \nincomes, that is less than $12,600 for an individual and $16,900 for a \nmarried couple, will qualify for a $600 credit this year, another new \n$600 credit next year. If there are two in the family, that is $1,200 \nthis year and $1,200 next year. If they do not carry it all this year, \nit can carry over to next year. If they do not use it all up before the \nnew insurance program for prescription drugs is put in place, they can \ncarry it over into 2006 until it is used up.\n\n  Some people have said these cards will not offer good discounts. That \nis what we heard yesterday. So I did some checking. To give an example, \nlet us take a woman enrolled in Medicare in the largest city close to \nmy farm, in Iowa, with an income of $12,000 a year. Let us call her \nHelen, to be short. Helen needs to fill prescriptions for Celebrex, \nNorvasc, and Zocor. With no discounts, she would pay $7,297 at her \nlocal pharmacies for these drugs from June of this year until the end \nof 2005. Helen goes to this pharmacy because she knows and trusts this \npharmacy. She does not want to order her drugs through the mail.\n  With a basic discount card offered by this legislation, she would \nsave $1,213--that is 17 percent--off of her drugs. Now the $1,200 by \nitself is a pretty big savings, but that is like giving her the \ndrugstore.com price at her local pharmacy.\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\n  Helen has a fixed income of $1,000 a month. This means she also \nqualifies for the transitional assistance and does not have to pay an \nenrollment fee. By applying for the card and qualifying for the $600 \ncredit, she also learns she is eligible for other assistance programs, \nsuch as those offered by drug manufacturers. With the $600 on her card \nin both 2004 and 2005, combined with these additional discounts, she \nwill save $6,894.\n  I will repeat that because that is very significant. She will be \nsaving almost $6,900 off of her drug bill. That is a 95-percent savings \nfor her.\n  I ask the people who were criticizing this program yesterday if they \nconsider that chickenfeed. For someone living on a fixed income, what a \nrelief that is going to be. About a third of her income will be freed \nup for other priorities.\n  Since enrollment began Monday, May 3, we have heard some Members come \nto this Chamber to criticize the drug discount card. That is a shame. \nThe discount card program will mean real savings for beneficiaries, \nespecially with low incomes. Seniors have been waiting a long time to \nget relief from high prescription drug costs. This legislation delivers \nthat relief.\n  I know this is an election year, but this is not the time or the \nissue to play politics at their expense and to scare the seniors of \nAmerica. More than 300 organizations--I wish these people on the other \nside of the aisle would put this in their pipe and smoke it--endorse \nthis legislation. They will say this drug discount card is a first step \ntoward making drugs more affordable for all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The president of the National Council on Aging described the new \nMedicare law as the single most important opportunity to help low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries to have emerged in the past 35 years.\n  This is what the president, Robert Hayes, said:\n\n       (Low-income) people should run--not walk to sign up.\n\n  This is especially true for the estimated 4.3 million low-income \nbeneficiaries who will see immediate relief with a combined $1,200 this \nyear and the next which they can use to buy their lifesaving \nprescription drugs.\n  What I find alarming is that some would try to score political points \nrather than help low-income beneficiaries get some much needed help \nwith their drugs. So my colleagues voted against this bill last year. \nSuck it up and move on.\n  I was personally involved in the negotiations last year. I can tell \nmy colleagues that during the Medicare conference, both Republicans and \nDemocrats--that is bipartisan--strongly supported the creation of a \ndrug discount card.\n  While some would like people to believe otherwise, this Medicare-\napproved drug discount card is a good deal. Since January of this year, \nI have held 39 town meetings throughout Iowa to tell my constituents \nabout this drug discount card program and what it does. As Members of \nCongress, we should use this opportunity to educate beneficiaries and \nto tell them about the $600 credit. I am concerned about a political \nenvironment that confuses and misleads Medicare beneficiaries and that \nin the end causes more harm than good. They deserve better than that.\n  I want to address a couple of criticisms that people have been \nmaking. First, some have said that prices are going to change every \nweek. Drug card sponsors can only increase the price if there is a \nchange in the sponsor's cost. Card sponsors can lower prices at any \ntime, which will have a positive impact.\n  I have been assured that CMS will aggressively monitor the prices \ncharged by card sponsors to make sure that they treat beneficiaries \nfairly.\n  CMS will track any changes made in drug prices and complaints \nreceived by 1-800-MEDICARE and other sources. They also will ``mystery \nshop'' to make sure that sponsors are not falsely advertising.\n  If CMS finds that a card sponsor is taking advantage of seniors, they \ncan freeze enrollment, impose fines or kick the sponsor out of the \nprogram entirely.\n  Lastly, some have been saying that prices on the Medicare Web site \nare inaccurate. CMS has assured me that the prices are the right ones. \nPrices on the Web site are the best prices that the cards can \nguarantee. So they cannot be higher, but they could be lower.\n  I said this last week and I will say it again: We should move on and \nnot lose sight of what really matters. And that is helping \nbeneficiaries like Helen from Waterloo and the millions like her get \ndrugs at lower prices. The bottom line is that the discount card \nprogram is a really good deal for our Nation's Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to be notified when I \nhave used 2 minutes and 40 seconds, after which I am going to yield the \nfinal 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Iowa for talking about the \nMedicare discount drug card. I think it is so important that seniors \nknow they can easily compare prices; they can determine which is the \nbest card for them. This is going to help anyone who does not have \nother coverage.\n  I hope our seniors know they can call 1-800-MEDICARE and get further \ninformation. If they call their local Medicare office, the Medicare \npeople are going to be very accommodating. I am appreciative that the \nSenator from Iowa clarified that because all the rhetoric we are \nhearing could scare our seniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4860-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PASSING THE ENERGY BILL\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to address the energy issue. I heard Senators \non the floor earlier today talking about the high price of gasoline, as \nif it is the President's fault. I would remind everyone we have an \nenergy bill we are two votes short of having cloture to pass. We passed \nit in the Senate. We passed it in the House. We have 58 votes to move \nit forward and we can't get the 60 votes it takes to break a \nfilibuster. I ask the Senators who are concerned about high energy \nprices if they would consider voting to get the energy conference \nreport agreed to so the President can sign it because it is a bill that \nwill provide incentives for exploring, incentives for creating new \nenergy resources, incentives for bringing Alaska gas down--which will \nbe a huge help toward self-sufficiency in our country. It has \nincentives for renewable fuel, for the kind of fuel that will be \nburning clean, such as nuclear powerplants, and to have clean coal-\nburning and other new technologies.\n  There is so much in the Energy bill that would bring our country into \nself-sufficiency and we can't get the Energy bill passed. I think \nCongress should take the responsibility to see this bill goes through. \nWe have tried to pass an energy bill for 10 years and we need to do it. \nWe need to take control ourselves. It is time for us to do this for the \nAmerican people. The high price of gasoline is set at our feet, and we \ncan do something about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the world has witnessed something in the \nlast few weeks about the treatment of prisoners in Iraq that does not \nrepresent what America is all about. It doesn't represent our cause. It \ndoesn't represent our mission. It doesn't represent our hopes and \ndreams for the Iraqi people and for all of us--ultimately for democracy \nin Iraq.\n  I applaud the President of the United States for his speaking out, \ncondemning without qualification what has occurred. He, as I understand \nit, went forth to speak to the Arab world, face to face, the leader of \nthe free world speaking to the Arab world to let them know this is not \nwhat America is all about. I think that is important. We all, at every \nlevel, have to reject it. Those who are responsible at every level have \nto be held to account. I know the Commander in Chief will do that.\n  As we deal with this terrible situation, I hope we do not lose focus \non our\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\nmission. Our men and women are in harm's way and our mission is freedom \nand security in Iraq. The critics of this war, do they want us to cut \nand run? Do they want to create a place of instability, a haven for \nterrorism? I can't believe that.\n  Someone once said a critic is someone who thinks he knows the way but \ndoesn't know how to drive the car. It is not a time for critics. Let us \ndeal with this terrible incident. Let us show America has standards and \nAmerica is there for a reason. The reason is one of hope. The reason is \none of freedom. What occurred is something that will never occur again. \nI am confident our President will make sure of that.\n  At the same time, we have to stand with our President, stand with our \ntroops. Teddy Roosevelt once said it is not the critic who counts, but \nit is the person in the arena. It is a tough arena right now. But the \ncause is just. We have lost life and it is a sacrifice, but the cause \nis just. We have seen that with Qadhafi giving up his nuclear weapons \nprograms, Iran understanding the serious consequences of their action.\n  Let us be true to the cause. Let us ferret out those who committed \nthese reprehensible acts. Let us support the President going forth to \nthe world, to the Arab community, to say this is wrong. Let us continue \nto stay true to the course, to understand that the lives that have been \nsacrificed have not been sacrificed in vain, that the world is safer \ntoday. It is safer with Saddam gone. It will be safer with peace and \nstability and democracy in the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4861-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the amount of deferred foreign income that can be \n                      repatriated at a lower rate)\n\n       On page 88, between lines 17 and 18, insert:\n       ``(4) Dollar limitation.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the \n     excess qualified foreign distribution amount shall not exceed \n     the lesser of--\n       ``(i) the amount shown on the applicable financial \n     statement as earnings permanently reinvested outside the \n     United States, or\n       ``(ii) the excess (if any) of--\n\n       ``(I) the estimated aggregate qualified expenditures of the \n     corporation for taxable years ending in 2005, 2006, and 2007, \n     over\n       ``(II) the aggregate qualified expenditures of the \n     corporation for taxable years ending in 2001, 2002, and 2003.\n\n       ``(B) Earnings permanently reinvested outside the united \n     states.--\n       ``(i) In general.--If an amount on an applicable financial \n     statement is shown as Federal income taxes not required to be \n     reserved by reason of the permanent reinvestment of earnings \n     outside the United States, subparagraph (A)(i) shall be \n     applied by reference to the earnings to which such taxes \n     relate.\n       ``(ii) No statement or stated amount.--If there is no \n     applicable financial statement or such a statement fails to \n     show a specific amount described in subparagraph (A)(i) or \n     clause (i), such amount shall be treated as being zero.\n       ``(iii) Applicable financial statement.--For purposes of \n     this paragraph, the term `applicable financial statement' \n     means the most recently audited financial statement \n     (including notes and other documents which accompany such \n     statement)--\n\n       ``(I) which is certified on or before March 31, 2004, as \n     being prepared in accordance with generally accepted \n     accounting principles, and\n       ``(II) which is used for the purposes of a statement or \n     report to creditors, to shareholders, or for any other \n     substantial nontax purpose.\n\n     In the case of a corporation required to file a financial \n     statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such \n     term means the most recent such statement filed on or before \n     March 31, 2004.\n       ``(C) Qualified expenditures.--For purposes of this \n     paragraph, the term `qualified expenditures' means--\n       ``(i) wages (as defined in section 3121(a)),\n       ``(ii) additions to capital accounts for property located \n     within the United States (including any amount which would be \n     so added but for a provision of this title providing for the \n     expensing of such amount),\n       ``(iii) qualified research expenses (as defined in section \n     41(b)) and basic research payments (as defined in section \n     41(e)(2)), and\n       ``(iv) irrevocable contributions to a qualified employer \n     plan (as defined in section 72(p)(4)) but only if no \n     deduction is allowed under this chapter with respect to such \n     contributions.\n       ``(D) Recapture.--If the taxpayer's estimate of qualified \n     expenditures under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) is greater than \n     the actual expenditures, then the tax imposed by this chapter \n     for the taxpayer's last taxable year ending in 2007 shall be \n     increased by the sum of--\n       ``(i) the increase (if any) in tax which would have \n     resulted in the taxable year for which the deduction under \n     this section was allowed if the actual expenditures were used \n     in lieu of the estimated expenditures, plus\n       ``(ii) interest at the underpayment rate, determined as if \n     the increase in tax described in clause (i) were an \n     underpayment for the taxable year of the deduction.\n       ``(5) Limitation on controlled foreign corporations in \n     possessions.--In computing the excess qualified foreign \n     distribution amount under paragraph (1) and the base dividend \n     amount under paragraph (2), there shall not be taken into \n     account dividends received from any controlled foreign \n     corporation created or organized under the laws of any \n     possession of the United States.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, this is a jobs bill. That is the title of \nthe bill. Presumably a jobs bill is intended to create jobs and \nhopefully is created to create jobs in America. That is the legislation \nthat is before us. It is absolutely essential that this legislation be \nadopted.\n  But one of the provisions in the legislation gives me great concern. \nI offered an amendment in the Finance Committee. It was unanimously \nsupported by every single Democrat in the Finance Committee and it lost \nby a partisan vote because our Republican colleagues at that time did \nnot feel they could support the amendment I offered. It was unanimously \nsupported by every single Democrat member of the Finance Committee.\n  The question deals with how we treat companies that have earnings \nthey have stashed away in foreign countries. These amounts of money, \nmany of them, are in fact earned overseas. Companies know if they bring \nthose earnings back to the United States, the United States, on a \nworldwide tax basis, will tax those earnings with a deduction for the \namount of tax they have paid in the country in which they earned those \nrevenues. They pay the regular corporate rate minus the tax credit they \nget for having paid taxes on those earnings in the foreign country. \nHowever, there is no tax consequence to those companies if the money in \nfact stays in the foreign country. That is called deferral. We defer \nany U.S. tax on foreign earnings as long as the earnings stay in the \nforeign country in which they are earned.\n  The legislation before this body now says we are going to give a very \nspecial break to U.S. companies that have money overseas, in many cases \nin tax havens. We are going to let you bring that money back, not as \nother companies in the past have brought it back,\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\npaying U.S. tax minus what they paid overseas, but we are going to cut \nyou a special sweetheart deal. We are going to give you a sweetheart \ndeal of an 85-percent tax credit by reducing the amount of taxes you \nwould pay if you bring it back to the United States--not to pay what \nevery other corporation pays, 35 percent--we are going to ask you to \npay 5 percent, 5.25 percent. That is an 85-percent tax reward to \ncompanies that have stashed money in tax havens, in many cases \noverseas, for the sole purpose of avoiding U.S. taxation.\n  The IRS has recently cited a number of companies that have these \ntypes of tax shelters and overseas tax havens, such as in The \nNetherlands, Barbados, the Cayman Islands and Bermuda--you name the tax \nhavens. Companies that earn money in one country will bring it over to \na tax haven and keep it there, avoiding U.S. taxes. But some now say \nthat is such a great idea, we are going to give them a real tax break \nand ask them to please bring it back over to the United States. If you \ndo so, we are only going to tax you at about a 5-percent rate.\n  That is what the legislation says. The legislation says bring it \nback, you get a huge tax reward for keeping money overseas and now \nbringing it back to the United States, unlike what other companies have \nhad to do.\n  Every person we have talked to says we are going to bring it back to \ncreate jobs. I say, All right, if that is what you are going to do, \nbring it back to create jobs in the United States of America, we will \nlet you do the 5-percent tax break. We will allow you to do it.\n\n  My amendment simply says two things are different from the bill \nbefore the Senate. No. 1, it says you can bring it back for job \ncreation, for hiring more people. If you want to use it for that \npurpose, OK. If you want to use it for research and development--\npharmaceutical industry or other electronic types of industry--OK, we \nwill let you use it for that. If you want to use it for capital \nexpending, you want to build another plant, OK, we will let you use it \nfor that. If you want to use it for your underfunded pension funds, OK, \nwe will let you use it for that.\n  But we will not let you use it for something as nebulous as financial \nstabilization of the company, which is in the bill but not defined. \nWhat does that mean? Buy another Gulfstream? Yes, that might \nfinancially stabilize the company. Stock buybacks? Yes, that might be a \ngood idea for a few people, but it does not create a lot of jobs, if \nany.\n  Second, there has to be an enforcement mechanism, more than filing a \nplan; and there is no responsibility if you do not follow it.\n  My amendment says: All right, companies, if you bring it back for \nthose purposes, we want proof you actually use it for those purposes. \nYou can use the next 3 years to take these billions of dollars and use \nit for legitimate purposes, but we would like some proof. We know it by \nseeing you have actually spent more in the next 3 years in these areas \nthan in the previous 3 years. That is very important.\n  Here is an interesting statistic from the Joint Committee on Tax. \nWhere is the money like this coming from? From tax havens: Bermuda, \nCayman Islands, Hong Kong, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland. How much \nmoney are we going to let flow into the United States at a 5-percent \nrate when it should come in at the regular corporate rate minus what \nthey pay in the foreign country?\n  Our legislation, the Breaux-Feinstein amendment, is about \nresponsibility and accountability, about creating jobs in this country, \nnot stock buybacks that enrich a few at the expense of jobs in this \ncountry.\n  There is a legitimate argument we ought to look at the whole tax \nsystem and see whether we should go to a territorial system or not, but \nthat is not before the Senate at this time.\n  This legislation is absolutely essential if we are going to maintain \nany credibility on creating jobs instead of enforcing or creating tax \nhavens. We have enough tax havens. We should not encourage more. This \namendment helps stop that.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 23 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. We have an hour equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Exactly.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator, the \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will try and be brief. I thank the \nSenator from Louisiana for his leadership on this, particularly since \nthis is the last year that he will be in the Senate. I have had the \ngreat privilege of working with him now for 12 years on the centrist \ncoalition and in other endeavors. He has always strived to bring \nparties together and to work across the aisle. Frankly, it is something \nthat I admire and I want him to know that.\n  The underlying bill, as I understand it, allows companies to bring \nforeign-earned profits back at a greatly reduced rate. The Senator from \nLouisiana spelled that out. That is a rate of 5.25 percent. Remember, \nthe minimum income tax bracket for individuals in this country is 10 \npercent. So it is at a rate half of what the poorest Americans pay in \nFederal income taxes.\n  Under this amendment, companies could bring foreign-earned profits \nback to the U.S. at this reduced rate provided these repatriated \nprofits promote job growth and benefit employees.\n  Our amendment is specific. It allows for spending on R, acquiring \nplants and equipment, deducting increases in wages or the cost of \ncreating a new job--capped at the Social Security wage limit of \n$87,900--and fully funding employee retirement plans.\n  Why is it necessary to be so specific? It is necessary because J.P. \nMorgan, which has conducted a survey of companies that would repatriate \nmoney, determined that most corporations will reuse the repatriated \nprofits for buying back debt, for increasing levels of liquid assets, \nor even retiring equity. This is what a study of the very companies \nthat are involved have shown. None of these items necessarily produces \nnew jobs.\n  One of the things the Senate, as well as Americans, should understand \nis that there are a large number of American companies that take \nadvantage of loopholes in U.S. tax law and pay no taxes. I recently \ntook a look at a GAO study entitled ``Comparison of the Reported Tax \nLiabilities of Foreign and United States Controlled Corporations.'' It \ncovers the period from 1996 to 2000. Let me give you an idea of what \nthey find: 61 percent of U.S.-controlled corporations pay no taxes; 71 \npercent of foreign-owned corporations operating in the United States \nreported no tax liability from 1996 to 2000.\n  This is stunning. I had no idea. So I began to look a little bit at \nthe history. Let me tell you a little bit about what it was like in \n1945. In 1945, income taxes from corporations accounted for 35 percent \nof Federal receipts. In 1970, these income taxes accounted for only 17 \npercent of Federal revenue. So between 1945 and 1970 there was a \ndramatic decline. Today, corporate income taxes account for only 7.8 \npercent of Federal revenues.\n  We are giving companies that have sequestered profits abroad the \nability to bring those profits back at one-half the tax rate the \npoorest American pays, and we have a specific study that shows that for \nthe most part, these corporations will not use these moneys for areas \nthat produce jobs.\n  What Senator Breaux and I have tried to do is to narrow the language \nthat describes what companies may spend repatriated profits on. We have \nnarrowed the language to specific spending categories--categories which \nproduce jobs. I don't think that is too much to ask.\n  How much will be repatriated? There are various estimates. J.P. \nMorgan estimates $300 billion be repatriated. The U.S. Treasury \nestimates it will be between $200 and $300 billion. The Homeland \nInvestment Act Coalition, a coalition of major corporations, estimates \n$500 billion will come back to the United States.\n  Without this amendment, it is likely that corporations will take \nadvantage of the reduced corporation tax rate and use the repatriated \nprofits to shore up their finances. The items I have read from the J.P. \nMorgan study indicate just that. I will summarize the section of this \nJ.P. Morgan study.\n  These were 28 firms in the study. They indicated that 46 percent of \nthem would pay down outstanding debt with\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\nthe money, 39 percent would finance capital spending, 39 percent would \nfund R venture capital or acquisition, 18 percent would buy back \nstock, 11 percent would use cash for working capital, 11 percent might \npay dividends if double taxation ends, and 4 percent would fund \nunderfunded pension funds.\n\n  I have been told many of these companies would like to use the money \nfor mergers and acquisitions, which very clearly could result in a \nreduction in jobs. I would not like to see this Senate have egg on its \nface by giving some of the largest and most profitable corporations in \nAmerica the ability to repatriate funds at one-half the tax rate the \npoorest Americans pay and have those funds used for mergers and \nacquisitions which would result in employees being fired for so-called \nefficiency reasons. I think without this language that narrows the use \nof this money, that is exactly what could happen.\n  So I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his leadership. I want to \nindicate my strong support for this amendment. I hope Members will vote \nfor this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I believe on our side we have 30 minutes; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am going to speak for hopefully less than \n5 minutes and then allow my colleague from California to speak. Senator \nEnsign and, I believe, Senator Allen may wish to speak to this as well.\n  Mr. President, this is ultimately about whether we want the dollars \nof these American multinational corporations to be brought back to \nAmerica or left in places like this. We can either put these dollars to \nwork here or we can leave them over there.\n  If you are interested in creating jobs, I think it is important to \nremind folks what we are talking about is a minimum of $400 billion \ncoming back into this country within the 1-year window that is allowed \nby this legislation. It has been estimated, on a conservative basis, \nthat it will create 660,000 jobs. It will reduce the Federal deficit, \nover the next 5 years, by $75 billion. If ever there were a win-win, \nthis amendment on the JOBS bill is a win-win.\n  As I listen to my colleagues, both of whom I esteem as friends, I am \nastounded so much emphasis is put into the dislike of business and what \nthey might do with this money. I, frankly, have to wonder what is wrong \nwith companies bringing money back here and being allowed to shore up \nthe strength of their business. What is wrong with that? That is \nexactly what we want them to do. I do not believe, as a former \nbusinessman myself, that it is in this country's interest to \nmicromanage how they will reinvest it in this country.\n  Specifically excluded by this legislation is executive compensation. \nExecutive compensation cannot be the target; but plant and equipment, \nshoring up pension plans, buying back stock, these kinds of things that \nimprove the values of corporations and their competitiveness are \nexactly what we ought to be doing if we are actually interested in \ncreating jobs.\n  I think it is also very important to point out that our American \ncompanies that compete overseas are competing against German and French \nand other companies in those countries that also have foreign earnings. \nIn these countries--competitor countries--they allow their earnings \nabroad to have what they call a free walk back. We are not allowing \nthem a free walk back. We are saying, for 1 year, the corporate tax \nrate will fall from 35 percent to 5.25 percent. The effect will be \nimmediate. It will be beneficial. It will help our economy. It will \ncreate jobs. But, moreover, it will, for 1 year, create a level playing \nfield for American corporations as against German or French or Japanese \ncorporations whose countries have tax codes that allow them to take \ntheir foreign earnings back to their native lands to be put into their \nlocal economies, to strengthen them when they need the strength.\n  Right now, our economy could use $400 billion. If our deficit could \nbe reduced by $75 billion, that would be wonderful. If we could create \n660,000 jobs on a short-term basis--we hope that money then stays \nhere--then we have done a tremendous thing for the American worker and \nthe American economy, and we have done it in a way that does not try to \nmicromanage every business decision made in the corporate boardrooms of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator from Oregon yield for a question?\n  Mr. SMITH. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, would the Senator point out anything in \nthe legislation before this body now that would take any action against \nany companies if they did not abide by what they said they were going \nto use it for? Do they lose their tax deduction? Is there anything in \nthe legislation, without my amendment, that would say what would happen \nto companies if they use it for something totally different from what \ntheir plans say they are going to use it for?\n  Suppose they decided to use it for something totally unrelated to job \ncreation. Is there anything, without my amendment, that says what would \nhappen to those companies?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator, I guess, does not trust they will use it for \nwhat they say they will use it for.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Trust but verify.\n  Mr. SMITH. I believe when they establish a plan and get the approval \nfor their plan they will follow through on that.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Suppose you have somebody who may not do that. Is there \nany provision in the bill that says what will happen to the company \nthat does not abide by the plan? I believe in trust but verify. If you \ndon't do what you say you are going to do, you should have \nconsequences. Is there anything in the bill that says they would lose \ntheir deduction?\n  Mr. SMITH. I don't think there is a penalty, I say to the Senator. I \nam happy to admit that because, frankly, I believe what companies are \ntrying to do is get their money back here on a basis that allows them \nto be competitive with other multinational companies from other \ncountries. I think what they are interested in doing is a return on \ninvestment to their investors. When they give a return on investment to \ntheir investors, what they are also doing is creating jobs. They are \ninvesting in plant and equipment. And I, for one, do not think it is in \nthe interest of this country to micromanage the Tax Code any more than \nwe already do.\n\n  So, Mr. President, with that, I will turn the time to my colleague \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, may I have 10 minutes?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes, you may.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let's get matters straight from the get-\ngo. Senator Breaux never liked this in the first place. And I have \ntremendous respect for him. We just do not agree on this tax provision. \nAs a matter of fact, he voted to strip it out completely when actually \nwe tried--Senator Ensign and I--to get this in before. We won this 75-\n25. Only 25 colleagues voted against us. Senator Breaux was leading the \ncharge.\n  Now he says he is just making a correction. Well, I have read his \ncorrection. It is a poison pill for many reasons, which I will go into. \nBut I think we ought to get it straight. We are being offered an \namendment and told it is enhancing our bill, but it is offered by \nSenator Breaux, who never liked it in the first place. I think he would \nbe the first one to admit it because he was quite open on the point \nbefore.\n  Now, I am proud to stand with my colleagues today to stop this \namendment. I think it is very important. I am going to call on the 75 \nSenators from both sides of the aisle who supported us the last time. I \nparticularly thank Senator Smith because he took the Ensign-Boxer bill \ninto the committee and he got it into this bill, which was most \nimportant for us. Now we are here to protect that work.\n  I will say this from the get-go. You could say all you want that we \nare building trust into this. Well, there is a little more than trust. \nWe are not saying in this bill anywhere that I have seen that the IRS \ncannot prosecute someone who is not telling the truth. This is not some \nplan that is done in the dead of night at the accountant's office. \nThere is a committee that has\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\nto put together the plan and they have to show how they plan to use the \nfunds. If they lie in that, under an audit, as any of us might have, \nthey have to show that in fact they deserve the deduction. If the IRS \nsays, no, they did not follow the plan, then they will not get those \ndeductions, just like all of us. There is nothing in our bill that \nabsolves these corporations of the usual procedure when you pay your \ntaxes. So I would like to get that out of the way.\n  I want to talk about jobs, because, God knows, in my State we have \nlost a lot. I want to put up what the various experts are saying, from \nliberal to conservative, about this Invest in the USA Act that I am so \nproud to coauthor with my friend, Senator Ensign.\n  What is the potential impact on the U.S. economy? J.P. Morgan says, \nas a result of enacting the Invest in the USA Act, U.S. companies will \nincrease investment profits earned abroad in the United States by $300 \nbillion. Bank of America forecasts the increase will be $400 billion. \nDr. Allen Sinai of Decision Economics estimates that this additional \ninvestment in the U.S. economy will generate 660,000 jobs.\n  Finally, we are doing something. The highway bill is stalled. A lot \nof us are upset about that on both sides of the aisle. That will create \n800,000 jobs.\n  Here we will create 660,000 jobs, and Allen Sinai says that is a \nconservative estimate of how many jobs would be created. And guess \nwhat. The Treasury is getting money because these profits are sitting \nabroad. They are not coming home. They are not being taxed. And we are \ngoing to tax them at a 5-percent rate, and that is going to bring funds \ninto the Treasury. There are some estimates that we will receive as \nmuch as $4 billion into the Treasury because of this Invest in the USA \nAct.\n  So how could we take such a good idea and mess it up? That is what we \nwould do if this amendment passes. We know those funds are not going to \nbe brought back.\n  Under the Breaux amendment, let me read to you examples of spending \nthat is not permitted, and you tell me if you agree with this.\n  You cannot use the money that you bring back for job training for \nworkers. You cannot use it for many unemployment benefits. You cannot \nuse it for worker health, dental and hospital expenses. You cannot use \nit for most employee childcare. You cannot use it to reimburse \nemployees for injuries and accidents. You cannot use it for workers \ncompensation and black lung benefits. You cannot use it for most \nemployee meals and lodging. You cannot use it for worker relocation \nreimbursement. You cannot use it for employee tuition assistance. You \ncannot use it for an environmental cleanup and impact analysis. You \ncannot use it for employee travel reimbursement.\n  You can buy jets with it under the Breaux amendment, but you can't \nuse it for employee travel reimbursements. You can buy limousines with \nit, but you can't reimburse for the rental of parking spaces for your \nemployees.\n  Here we have an amendment that we have crafted that is actually a \nbill that is incorporated into the underlying bill, which gives the \nbusiness community a chance for 1 year to bring these funds home that \nare parked outside our shores, funds that are sitting out there and not \nbeing brought back. We are going to see what happens. We are told by \neconomists from the left to the right it is going to mean job creation. \nWe want to make sure it is used for the things that these corporations \nneed.\n  Instead, you have the Breaux amendment which is micromanaging this \ndeal in such a way that it will affect things as important as job \ntraining for workers. Let's just say a business is changing its work \nproduct and they have a new way to deal with their workers. They have \nto teach them how to use new computers and new programming, \nmachinery. They cannot use the money they bring back to job train.\n\n  Senator Feinstein called this a perfecting amendment. It is not \nperfecting. It is a poison pill.\n  I am very proud to be part of this group in the Senate that has been \npushing for this for all this time. Any statement that we are not going \nto go after cheaters is ridiculous because we have highlighted in our \nbill the fact that the company has to set up a committee. They have to \nprint a plan. They have to say how they are spending their money. And \nif they undergo an audit, they are going to have to stand behind it.\n  The question is whether you want accumulated foreign earnings \ninvested here or abroad. The answer that we get from our colleagues is \ngoing to be very important. We can send a wonderful message today if we \nstand with this underlying language that we are serious about job \ncreation. We are serious about getting this capital back. I believe we \nare doing a very wise thing.\n  I yield the rest of my time to the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I emphasize the point that Senator Boxer \nmade in answering Senator Breaux. We did not include special penalties \nin this bill, but the truth is, when you file your tax returns, you \nhave to own up to what the plan is. You have to live up to that. If you \ndon't, you lose the deduction.\n  Can the IRS impose other penalties? Of course it can. But it then has \nto make the case against the person. When people file their tax \nreturns, they know they are shooting with real bullets on this stuff.\n  I have every confidence that people will be honest about this and \nutilize the revenues for the purposes intended in creating jobs.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. I would like to yield 9 minutes to Senator Ensign and 4 or \n5 minutes to Senator Allen and, if I could, have 30 seconds to wrap up.\n  Mr. BREAUX. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes 44 seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Are we going to rotate? Are we just going to hear one \nside?\n  Mr. SMITH. It would be fine with us to let the Senator speak.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes off the time.\n  I wonder if anybody in this body remembers Enron. Let's trust that \nthey are going to do right. They are a U.S. corporation that created \nmore tax shelters than the IRS could count. It took a group of \nPhiladelphia lawyers 2 months to even add up the number of tax shelters \nthey had around the world. They had so many the IRS couldn't even \nfollow it.\n  If you are going to give people who have tax shelters and a stash in \nincome in foreign tax havens a huge benefit to bring the money back \ninto this country, we ought to make sure they are going to use it for \njob creation. Without my amendment, they have to file a plan that says \nthis is what they are going to spend it on. Suppose they don't spend \none nickel more than they did last year on job creation. Suppose they \ndon't spend one nickel more on capital expenditures than they did last \nyear. Suppose they don't spend one more nickel on pensions for the \nworkers than they did last year, but they comply with what they said \nthey were going to do in their little plan. They are fine. They don't \nhave to spend one nickel more under the committee bill, with all this \nmoney they are going to bring back at a 5-percent tax rate, in terms of \ncreating jobs than they did before.\n  The Breaux-Feinstein amendment says: If you want to bring it back for \nthat purpose, you have to show us that is what you are using it for. \nThat, in fact, you have spent more money in the next 3 years than you \nwould have the previous year on job creation. That is not too much to \nask.\n  When we are giving a multinational corporation an enormous tax gift \nof having to pay not 35 percent but only 5 percent, at least get a \nrequirement that they are using it for something to do with job \ncreation and that they spend at least something more than they did the \nyear before. Without the Breaux-Feinstein amendment, there is no \nrequirement that they spend one nickel more on job creation than they \ndid previously after bringing this money back.\n  Guess what. You talk about an incentive to locate overseas. There \nwill be a whole group of people saying: We did it for 1 year. Let's do \nit next year, a third year; let's continue this. How about making this \n5 percent permanent so we can put all the jobs overseas, knowing \nCongress is going to take care of us every time there is a downturn in \nthe economy and there is another amendment to extend the 5-percent tax \nbreak\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\n1 more year. We will just move everything over to the Caymen Islands. \nWe will move everything ever over to a Third World country. Because, \nguess what, Congress is going to let us bring it back at 5 percent \nbecause the pressure will be there, because the economy is not doing \nwell, and all the jobs go overseas. The only thing the Breaux-Feinstein \namendment says is, if you are going to bring it back for job creation, \nprove it, tell us you spent a little bit more than you would have \nordinarily. Without Breaux-Feinstein, there is no requirement that they \nspend one nickel more than they did before. That is a big difference in \nwhat we are trying to accomplish.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senators Smith, \nEnsign, and Boxer in opposition to the Breaux-Feinstein amendment. In \nthe midst of this JOBS bill, we are trying to make sure manufacturers \nin this country can compete internationally. I am one who is always \narguing, whether it is tax policy, regulatory policy, our laws in the \nUnited States ought to make America more desirable and conducive toward \ninvestment and job creation.\n  The underlying provision--the idea of repatriation or reinvesting in \nthe United States helps make the United States more conducive and more \nattractive for investment and jobs. Let's use some common sense. If you \nare a company that does business overseas, and you have profits \noverseas, whatever country you are in you are going to have to pay \ntaxes. If you bring that money back into this country, you are going to \nbe paying 35 percent in taxes. You are going to pay one way or another, \nwhether to that country or to the United States.\n  However, if you take those profits and keep investing them in China, \nin South Korea, in Malaysia, or in the Philippines, or wherever else it \nmay be, you are going to continue investing them over there if you are \ngoing to be subjected to this 35-percent tax.\n  The idea is, for 1 year, reduce that tax burden to 5.25 percent, \nbring those profits back into this country, invest them in the United \nStates in a variety of ways that actually helps your business; thus, it \ncreates more jobs. This is a law that I certainly think ought to be \npassed, not diminished or micromanaged or pestered with this amendment.\n  Studies, for example, by the Joint Committee on Taxation have \ndetermined that the provision we are supporting in the bill would \ninject approximately $135 billion into our economy for jobs, capital, \ninvestment, and economic growth. The Joint Committee on Taxation also \nsaid it would bring in an additional $4 billion in tax revenues to the \nU.S. Treasury. Of course, the profits are coming back; therefore, they \nare going to be taxed. Whereas, if you do not change this law, that \nmoney will stay overseas.\n  J.P. Morgan economists talked about job creation--660,000 new jobs \ncreated, $75 billion in debt reduction, and an increase in capital \nspending of up to $78 billion, by bringing approximately $300 billion \nin foreign earnings back into this country.\n  The Breaux amendment has several problems. One, it is a poison pill--\nas was said by other speakers--limiting benefits in such a way that it \nmakes it impracticable. Two, it requires that money be spent for narrow \npurposes only; third, it requires companies to spend it in 3 years; \nfourth, it excludes amounts brought back from Puerto Rico and other \npossessions. That last one would treat Puerto Rico and our possessions \nworse than investments made in the rest of the world.\n  Senator Boxer brought up examples of what would not be permitted with \nthe Breaux amendment. In addition to the job training, they could not \nspend it on job training to upgrade the skills and capabilities and \nproductivity of their workers in the United States. They could not fund \nstartup businesses. Why would we not want them to fund startup \nbusinesses? Why would we want to prohibit the injection of new capital \ninto cash-starved projects?\n  Mr. President, the point is that the amendment would limit the job \ncreation incentive and, unfortunately, not have the full potential to \nmake this country more desirable for jobs and investment. I \nrespectfully urge my colleagues to defeat the Breaux amendment, support \nSenator Smith in his efforts, and those of Senator Ensign and others, \nwho have fought gallantly and wisely for more jobs and investment in \nthe United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 11 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair. I will take 2 additional minutes.\n  Again, I don't have any basic argument with those who say we ought to \nlet the money come back that has been sitting in tax savings into this \ncountry. I will even go along with saying you can bring it back at 5 \npercent, if you are going to use it for job creation or research and \ndevelopment, for capital expenditures. And If you are going to use it \nto rebuild your pension fund for workers, OK, let's do it for 1 year at \n5 percent. But, by gosh, can't we at least have some standards to be \nable to enforce it?\n  Under the committee bill, without the Breaux-Feinstein amendment, \nthere is no obligation that they spend one nickel more on job creation \nthan they did last year or the year before. The only thing they have to \ndo is say, if last year we spent $10 billion on capital expenditures, \nguess what. We will spend $10 billion this year. They don't have to \nspend one nickel, one penny more on capital expenditures or job \ncreation or research and development in order to get this huge break. \nThey can spend exactly what they spent last year--no requirement, zip, \nzero. Yet we are going to give them one of the biggest tax breaks.\n  We already passed tax cuts of $3 trillion for job creation. Are we \nmuch better off today after all of that, some of which I supported? \nThat is a debatable issue. Let's not make the same mistake and say we \nare going to give them an 85-percent tax cut if they are doing business \noverseas and if they bring some of that money back and spend it on job \ncreation. And by the way, there is no requirement that you do anything \nmore than you did last year. What kind of nonsense is that, as far as \ntrying to create more jobs in this country, instead of providing a huge \nincentive to locate overseas, bring workers overseas, and we are going \nto have Congress let us bring it all back at 5 percent? How unfair is \nthat to the people who play by the rules, to other companies who do \nbusiness and hire people in this country.\n  There is no requirement, without the Breaux-Feinstein amendment, that \ncompanies that bring this money back at a 5-percent rate spend one dime \nmore than they have in the past on the creation of jobs. They can spend \nwhat they spent last year. In fact, they can spend less than they spent \nlast year. The only thing they have to show is they have a plan--no \nenforcement, nothing.\n  The Senator from Nevada has a sign up that says 660,000 jobs. Suppose \nthey decide not to create one more job than they did last year. They \nwill still get the 5-percent tax break. There is no requirement that \nthey create six jobs. If they created six last year, they can do that \nthis year. They only have to show that the money is used for job \ncreation. They can take all the money they spent on capital \nexpenditures last year and not spend any of it next year. They can just \nuse this overseas money and not do one thing more than they did the \nyear before. There is no enforcement that they do what the plan says. \nThere is no penalty if they don't. They don't lose their tax deduction. \nThey still get it and they do not have to spend one nickel more in any \ncategory without the Breaux-Feinstein amendment.\n  We say: Look what you did in the last 3 years, and what you are going \nto do in the future 3 years, and see if you did more than you did in \nthe past. If you did, you get the 5-percent break. But, by golly, if \nyou don't, you don't get it. I think that is fair. I withhold the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to first talk about the underlying \nlegislation and then talk about the Breaux-Feinstein amendment.\n  Allen Sinai is one of the most respected economists in the United\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\nStates--not a Republican or a Democratic economist--a bipartisan \neconomist. These 660,000 jobs he said this underlying bill will create \nis based on our language. He is not saying what Senator Breaux just \nsaid, that they are not guaranteed to bring the jobs back. He is doing \nan independent analysis based on the money coming back into the United \nStates and based on that determining how many jobs it will create, and \nthis is a very conservative number.\n  What else will this underlying bill do? It will reduce the deficit, \naccording to his study, also by $75 billion over 5 years because of the \neconomic stimulus that will occur in the United States. The money that \nwill come back--there have been studies--the first J.P. Morgan study \nwas around $300 billion. They have updated their numbers. It is \nexpected to be around $500 billion. Allen Sinai's numbers, once again, \nan independent economist, was based on the $300 billion figure. We \nheard $300 billion all the way up to $600 billion will come back to the \nUnited States. That is more money than all of the IPOs, initial public \nofferings, on the stock market from 1996 to 2002. That is a lot of \neconomic activity.\n  We hear a lot today about outsourcing. Lou Dobbs talks about it \nalmost every night--outsourcing, outsourcing, outsourcing. This bill is \ninsourcing. This insources jobs to the United States. Mr. President, \n$500 billion will create a lot of jobs in the United States.\n  Here is the language, by the way, Senator Breaux is talking about in \nour bill when he says there really is not any kind of enforcement \nmechanism:\n\n     . . . described in domestic reinvestment plan approved by the \n     taxpayers, president, CEO or comparable official before the \n     payment of such dividends and subsequently approved by the \n     taxpayers board of directors, management committee, executive \n     committee, or similar body, which plan shall provide for the \n     reinvestment of such dividends in the United States, \n     including as a source of funding of worker hiring and \n     training, infrastructure, research and development, capital \n     investments or for the financial stabilization of the \n     corporation for purposes of job retention or creation.\n\n  Why is that language important in our bill and how is that enforced \ntoday? We are in a post-Enron environment. The markets look at the \ngovernance of corporations. The IRS certainly looks at it. With \nSarbanes-Oxley on the books, CEOs are very sensitive to complying with \nfederal laws such as this. Companies are required to develop a plan, \nand they have to stick with the plan, otherwise the stock markets will \npunish their stocks if they are not doing this. That is one of the ways \nthe markets actually enforce what is going on.\n  I want to point out some of the other items that other countries do \non a comparative basis. These are just corporate tax rate comparisons. \nThe United States has the highest of all of these countries, and these \nare countries with which we deal and compete. The United States has the \nhighest corporate tax rate of any of the countries--Korea, Indonesia, \nJapan, EU, average, Ireland, 12.5 percent. That makes a little more \nsense in terms of why they are competing a little better than we are.\n  In fact, in Ireland, they call it the Celtic Tiger because their \nsuccess has been so incredible as a result of lowering their tax rates \nto attract capital.\n  The money right stranded overseas now will not come back in the \nUnited States without our bill. That is the bottom line. People say it \nis not fair to allow the money to come back in at lower tax rates than \nAmerican companies are paying today in the United States. The bottom \nline is, fine, if it is not fair, then do we just want to leave this \nmoney overseas? The money is not going to come back to the United \nStates to create jobs without our bill.\n\n  How do other countries treat this money that comes back into their \ncountries compared to what the United States does currently? The United \nStates is up to a 35-percent tax. France, Germany, Canada, Australia, \nthe United Kingdom--zero, and they have no restrictions on how the \nmoney can be spent. It just comes back and gets reinvested in their \ncountries. That is why we are saying let's bring it back within that 1-\nyear period of time, and we will charge you 5.25 percent, which is \nstill higher than all of these countries. The companies want to bring \nthat money back to invest in the United States.\n  By the way, paying down debt is not allowed under the Breaux-\nFeinstein amendment. If you are a company and you are burdened with \ndebt and now you have to lay off people, doesn't it make sense to allow \nthem to pay the debt down instead of laying off people? That just makes \ncommon sense to anybody who has ever been in business. If you are in \ntough financial times, having money from overseas come back and \nreducing your balance sheet debt for the companies located in the \nUnited States makes sense. It makes them more financially solvent.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, we talk about 660,000 jobs for the whole \ncountry. Isn't it also true that California stands to gain 75,000 new \njobs, and Louisiana stands to gain nearly 10,000 new jobs; Nevada, over \n5,000 new jobs; Oregon, nearly 30,000 jobs; and Virginia, nearly 14,000 \nnew jobs that can be created in a very short period of time. Doesn't it \nreally go to our individual States to show just how dramatic a benefit \nthis brings to America and our States?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I think those are \nvery conservative estimates at a time when we are talking about jobs. \nThe rest of the economy is doing well, and the job numbers are picking \nup. This can be the extra boost the U.S. job market needs.\n  These are the items not allowed under the Breaux amendment when it \ncomes back: debt reduction I just talked about, job training, and \ntuition reimbursement, better health care benefits for workers, \nchildcare for employees getting back to work, and materials for new \nmanufacturing.\n  There are a lot of items the money would not be allowed to be used \nfor under the Breaux amendment. This really is a poison pill. The \ncompanies are telling us if the Breaux-Feinstein amendment is adopted, \nit basically kills their incentive to bring the money back.\n  Let's have some common sense here. If money is overseas and it is \nbeing invested over there because tax rates are too high to bring it \nback to the U.S., let's lower the tax rates so the capital comes back \nto the United States to create jobs. That is the bottom line; it will \ncreate jobs in the United States. It will make American business more \ncompetitive in this global marketplace.\n  If my colleagues are worried about outsourcing, defeat the Breaux \namendment and keep the provision in the bill. The Invest in the USA Act \nis a great piece of legislation. That is why on the floor of the Senate \nlast year it received 75 votes to 25 votes against it. With 75 votes, \nin a bipartisan manner, we adopted our bill last year. We need to keep \nthis provision intact in the underlying bill.\n  I encourage all Senators who voted last year with us to stay with us \non this point and defeat the poison pill of the Breaux-Feinstein \namendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes four seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  It is interesting that they said Louisiana would gain 10,000 jobs if \nthis passed. We probably lost 50,000 jobs with people moving overseas. \nSo with this legislation, we are still 40,000 jobs short.\n  What we are doing in this legislation is rewarding companies that \noperate overseas. We say, if you operate overseas and you hire foreign \nworkers in foreign countries and put your money in a tax haven, somehow \nthat is good policy, and we are going to let you take those earnings \nand only pay 5-percent tax on that. What kind of logic is that? That is \na huge incentive to continue to hire workers overseas knowing Congress \nis going to let you bring earnings back, not at 35 percent, which every \nother company that hires U.S. workers in my State or any other State \nhas to pay. No, if you do it overseas, you are only going to have to \npay 5 percent if you give us a plan that tells us you will use the \nmoney for the financial stabilization of the corporation, whatever the \nheck that means.\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\n  If we are going to create so many jobs and if we are going to reduce \nthe deficit, when you look at this and score it impartially, why does \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation say this is going to cost the Treasury \n$3.7 billion? If we are going to create so many more jobs and so many \nmore people are going to pay taxes, why does this provision in the \ncurrent bill cost the U.S. taxpayers $3.7 billion? That is the score \nfrom the Joint Committee on Taxation when they looked at this \nprovision. It is not going to reduce the deficit. It is going to cost \nthe taxpayers almost $4 billion.\n  When someone makes the point that the IRS will audit these companies, \naudits are down on corporate America by over 60 percent. They are doing \n60 percent fewer corporate audits. One wonders why Enron got away with \neverything? Because the Treasury does not have the wherewithal to do \nthe audits they need.\n  The principal argument I have with the Breaux-Feinstein amendment is \nsimply this: If people say they are going to bring it back at a 5-\npercent rate and they are going to use it to create more jobs, I say, \nOK, let them do it, but let's have some mechanism to ensure they really \ndo create more jobs than they created in the past. That is all the \nBreaux-Feinstein amendment really says. It says: Show us, Mr. Corporate \nAmerica, that, in fact, you are creating more jobs than you did before. \nAnd if you did, fine, you are off the hook; you get a 5-percent tax \nrate, but if you do not create any more than you did in previous years \nor you create less, then something is wrong with this proposition, and \nwe are not going to let you pay only 5-percent taxes.\n  It is an enforcement mechanism. I agree, use it for pensions, use it \nfor research and development, use it for capital expenditures, use it \nfor job creation, but please show us that it was used for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH. The time remaining on our side is 1 minute 40 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute forty-eight seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from California, and I \nwill use the remainder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As we wind down this debate, I thank Senators Smith, \nEnsign, and Allen. I think we have had a good debate. I want to thank \nSenator Breaux for his passion. My colleague, Senator Feinstein, and I \ndo not see this eye to eye.\n  Here is how I would sum it up: On May 15, 2003, the Senate voted 75 \nto 25 for the Ensign-Boxer-Smith Invest in the USA Act. It was a very \nclear statement that we want to see job creation. What we are proposing \nis a 1-year only chance for corporations that have parked their foreign \nearnings abroad, and that have no intention of bringing them back, to \nbring it back at a lower tax rate. It would infuse our Treasury with \nabout $4 billion in revenue, and Allen Sinai, a respected economist, \nsays it will create 660,000 jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hope we will vote against the Breaux-Feinstein \namendment and once and for all make this important bill the law of the \nland.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Parliamentary inquiry: What is the status on remaining \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-nine seconds for Senator Smith and four \nminutes fifty-four seconds for Senator Breaux.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will close on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I close on this amendment with the \nfollowing comments: In this legislation, we are giving U.S. companies \nthat hire foreign workers in foreign countries and putting their money \nthat they earned in tax savings the opportunity, the gift, to bring \nback to this country those earnings and not pay what every other U.S. \ncorporation pays in taxes but to give them an 85-percent tax cut \nbecause they operated overseas and hired foreign workers and made \nproducts in foreign countries. We are going to give them an 85-percent \ntax cut over current law if they bring the money back over here.\n  The argument is that somehow that is going to create more jobs over \nhere. But there is no requirement that a single additional job be \ncreated. They do not have to create one more job or spend one more \ndollar on research and development than they did last year under the \ncurrent bill without the Breaux-Feinstein amendment.\n  The Breaux-Feinstein amendment seeks to install responsibility that \nsays: All right, if corporations want to bring it back for those \npurposes, even though it is going to cost the taxpayer $3.7 billion--\nsome people outside of Washington may think that is a lot of money; I \nthink it is a lot of money--$3.7 billion is the cost of this \nlegislation without the Breaux-Feinstein amendment. The bottom line is \nthere is no guarantee that they will spend one dollar more on creating \na job, capital expenditures, or research and development than they did \nlast year. The Breaux-Feinstein amendment says, yes, corporations can \ndo this and we will give them this huge tax break if they spend more on \njob creation and create more jobs than they did in the past. That is \nour only requirement, and that is not too much of a requirement.\n\n  They already say that is what they are going to do. The only thing \nour amendment says is, yes, they have to do that, and if they do not \nthey are not going to get the break.\n  Without the Breaux-Feinstein amendment, they do not have to create \none single additional job more than they did in previous years. We have \nan enforcement mechanism that says: Look, if they do not spend it for \nwhat they say they are going to spend it, then they are not going to \nget the tax break. They are going to have to give it back. They are \ngoing to have to be treated as any other company that does business in \nthis country.\n  They call this a poison pill. I think it is more a vitamin pill to a \ndeficient bill to try and help improve it to give it some strength, to \ngive it some credibility, to say, yes, we agree, let's do it for this \npurpose, but please have a requirement that it is actually used for \nthat purpose.\n  The legislation does not have that. The only thing they have to do is \ncome up with a description, a domestic reinvestment plan that does not \nrequire it be spent. It certainly does not require that they spend more \nin the future than they did in the past. But if the corporations put \nwhat they are thinking about doing in a domestic investment plan, then \nthey are OK, but there is no requirement that they spend a nickel more \nthan they did in the past. That is the real principle that we are \ntrying to address with the Breaux-Feinstein amendment. I think it makes \nsense.\n  It still allows money to come back, but it only requires that they, \nin fact, use those dollars for what they said they were going to use \nthem. If they do that, if they create more jobs, do research and \ndevelopment, make capital expenditures, do things that they say they \nare going to do with it, let's please have some mechanism in the \nlegislation that really requires them to do what they say they are \ngoing to do.\n  The history of this country with regard to recent scandals in \ncorporate America show that we have to be vigilant and diligent, and we \nhave to have some pretty clear parameters about what people can and \ncannot do. This legislation, without the Breaux-Feinstein amendment, \nfalls short in that particular provision.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, if Senator Breaux were offering a \nperfecting amendment, I would take it. But he is offering a poisonous \namendment. What his amendment would effectively do is limit the ways \nthat these dollars can be used in America to create American jobs.\n  The more it is limited, the more jobs will be limited. So if my \ncolleagues vote for his amendment, they are voting against job creation \nin their State.\n  The Senator says he wants a guarantee. My mother used to say the only \nguarantees in life are death and taxes. What is in this bill are \npenalties to the Tax Code. If my colleagues want to make sure these \nthings are spent the way they are described, then these\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\ncompanies have to follow the plan they lay out before the IRS. If they \ndo not, they lose the deduction and the penalties attached in the Tax \nCode will attach to them as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Breaux-Feinstein amendment. \nThis bill is important to create American jobs.\n  Mr. BREAUX. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, we are saying if corporate America wants \nto get this huge tax gift, OK, let's do it. But let's make sure they \nuse it for the right purpose. Let's make sure they actually use it for \njob creation. Breaux-Feinstein simply says they have to show that they \nspend more in future years, the next year, and the next year than they \ndid in the previous years in terms of job creation and doing what they \nsaid they were going to do.\n  Without the Breaux-Feinstein amendment, the only thing a company has \nto do is file a plan. If they do not follow the plan, well, too bad; \nthey do not get audited, too bad. There is no requirement that more \nmoney is spent to create jobs, and we are talking about a jobs bill \nthat creates jobs in this country, I thought, not in a foreign country.\n  I do not think we can go back home to our constituents and say we are \ngoing to give corporate America an 85-percent break for money they \nearned overseas. If they want to bring it back for job creation, OK, \nbut let's make sure that is what it is used for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired. The amendment is set aside.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from New Mexico wishes to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes, and certainly we would have no \nobjection to that. I just want to lay out for Members what is going to \ntranspire in the next few hours. The two managers are necessarily \nabsent this morning but they have instructed us what should be done on \nthis legislation. We have completed debate on the Breaux amendment. We \nare next going to move to the amendment that has been filed by the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n\n  Following that, unless the majority decides they want to offer an \namendment, we are going to finish debate on the Graham amendment, which \nis also laid down.\n  We had an agreed-upon time on the Dorgan amendment, but as a result \nof the fact that we have been told a Senator may offer a second-degree \namendment to his amendment, it would be difficult for us to agree to a \nlimit on that. So debate will go forward on the Dorgan amendment, and \nthose who are trying to determine whether they are going to offer an \namendment can do so and at that time perhaps we can work out a time \nagreement. If they don't offer a second-degree amendment, that will be \neasier.\n  On the amendment of the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, he needs a \nhalf hour himself on that amendment, which we understand. There may be \na few others who wish to take some time. We could agree to 45 minutes, \nmaybe, to an hour, on our side. I doubt if the full hour will be used.\n  So it is my understanding that the leadership, when debate is \ncompleted on those amendments, would set a time for voting on all three \namendments or maybe even four would be pending.\n  That is where we are. I think it indicates we are moving on this bill \nfairly rapidly. As Senator Daschle and I indicated this morning, on our \nside we are winding down our amendments. We have a few others that will \nbe offered, not many. We hope the majority will also make a decision in \nthe near future as to whether they want to finish this bill. We want to \nfinish this bill. We hope the majority does also.\n  Mr. SMITH. Point of clarification?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. SMITH. It was my understanding that it was 70 minutes on the \nDorgan amendment and my request is that that include the debate, \nequally divided, on the Republican substitute?\n  Mr. REID. It would include debate on the substitute?\n  Mr. SMITH. On what will be offered on this side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, first, didn't ask unanimous consent that \nthat would be the case. During the time Senator Domenici is speaking, \nwe will take a look at that. I just wanted to notify Senators what we \nwere trying to accomplish. Senator Dorgan is on the floor and we will \nmake a decision.\n  Mr. SMITH. That is fine.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Domenici be recognized \nfor 5 minutes as in morning business and sometime during the day the \nDemocrats be allotted the same privilege, 5 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish I could have come to the floor \nearlier but sometimes you are surprised to hear arguments that you \nnever expected. All Senators on that side of the aisle who have come \ndown here to rail against President Bush about high gasoline prices \nneed to take a look in the mirror and blame themselves. I have been \ndown here for months trying to get a comprehensive energy bill passed \nthat will promote a policy of greater energy security and independence. \nSome of these very Senators are blocking these efforts.\n  The Energy bill is not a silver bullet to lower prices for gasoline \nor for natural gas. No such thing exists. There is no silver bullet. It \nis disingenuous for Democrats to imply that one exists. They know \nbetter.\n  Our bill is long term, to deal with our supply and manage our demand. \nThat is the only responsible strategy. We need more domestic oil and \nmore natural gas production. The Energy bill provides the open door for \nthat to occur. We need alternative fuel sources. The Energy bill \npromotes for sources such as wind and solar. It promotes clean coal \ntechnology, and, yes, eventually, nuclear power. We need this broader \nportfolio to reduce risks of overdependence on one source. The occupant \nof the chair knows that as well as anyone. One source of energy is \ndisaster for this great country. Natural gas, as the sole energy to \nproduce electricity, is a disaster.\n  Senator Schumer said: ``Don't think there is nothing we can do about \nhigh oil prices.''\n  He is right. He suggests remedies--stop filling the SPR. That is \nwrong. But I do agree we can do something about oil, natural gas, and \ngasoline prices. Changes to our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the SPR, \nare short term, shortsighted, and bad policy.\n  The SPR is a national security asset. It is there to serve for an \nemergency, in an emergency situation, when there is a severe energy \ndisruption. It is not a price control mechanism. If we alter the SPR \npractices, then we can assume that OPEC will alter their production \noutput. This leads to more volatility in the market and a disastrous \nresult.\n  President Clinton tried to use SPR to deal with high oil prices. He \nfailed. Gasoline prices--believe this--dropped by one penny. That is \nall, a single penny. Risking our national security by depleting or \nplaying around with the SPR got us a total impact of one penny.\n  I know we are all concerned about high gasoline prices. On average, \ngasoline demand in the United States is about 9 million barrels a day. \nThat is roughly 378 million gallons of gasoline a day. Some parts of \nthe country are experiencing $2-a-gallon price, and others have prices \nin the $1.70 range.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, the national \nmonthly average regular gasoline pump prices are expected to peak at \nabout $1.87. One of the reported reasons that we hear for high gasoline \nprices is the high oil price demanded by OPEC. In 2003, we imported 42 \npercent of our total petroleum imports from OPEC countries. Supplies \nfrom OPEC provides about 26 percent of our domestic crude oil.\n  Senator Wyden introduced a resolution about OPEC. I agree with some \npoints of his resolution. The resolution says the President should \ncommunicate with members of OPEC and maintain strong relations. Of \ncourse, that is a given. We need to work together in a cohesive fashion \nin our relations with exporting countries and send a strong message \nthat we want reliable supplies at fair prices.\n\n  Senator Wyden's resolution also says that Congress should take short-\nterm and long-term approaches to reducing\n\n[[Page S4869]]\n\nand stabilizing oil prices. If we pass the Energy bill now, in the \nshort term, then in the long term we will see the benefits of lower oil \nprices.\n  The last part of Senator Wyden's resolution lists some things that \ncan be done to lower oil prices. I particularly agree that we consider \nlifting regulations that interfere with the ability of the U.S. \ndomestic oil and coal, hydroelectric, biomass, and other alternative \nfuels to supply a greater percentage of the energy needs of the United \nStates. That is an excellent description of the Energy bill pending \nbefore the Senate. Isn't it interesting, instead of passing the bill, \nwe recommend resolutions that do the same thing but the resolution will \nnot accomplish the same thing. We all know that.\n  If Senator Wyden is serious that he wants these things, he should be \nvoting to pass the Energy bill that includes the very list contained in \nhis resolution.\n  I thank the Senate for listening. I am ready at any time to come down \nand debate the Energy bill and its content, because it is time we quit \ntalking and start doing. It is time those on the other side look in the \nmirror. In the mirror, they will see they are responsible for what is \nhappening because they will not help us pass an energy bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, after consideration during the speech of \nSenator Domenici, we believe the action of the Senate will be as \nfollows: Senator Dorgan will speak on behalf of his amendment. Senator \nMikulski will speak on behalf of that amendment. It will take probably \na half hour for them to do it, but that is not in the form of a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Following that debate, we will move off that amendment because the \nmajority is finding what vehicle they are going to use for a second-\ndegree amendment. When they finish, when Senators Dorgan and Mikulski \nfinish, we will move immediately to the Graham amendment. At that time, \nwe will lock in a 2-hour time agreement. It is probably likely that \neach side will not use its full hour.\n  Following that, it will be the desire of the majority to have a vote \non the Breaux amendment and then on the amendment of the Senator from \nFlorida. We will have two amendments and then go back to the amendment \nby the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I ask that we go to the Dorgan amendment. The Senator is on the \nfloor. Following debate on that, I ask unanimous consent that we go to \nthe Graham amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. And that there be 2 hours equally divided on the Graham \namendment, with no second-degree amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, tempted as I am to respond to the last \ncomments just offered by the Senator from New Mexico, I will refrain \nand do that at a later time. Suffice it to say it provides little \nbenefit to come to the Senate and say, they are responsible for us not \nhaving an energy bill. We all understand why we do not have an energy \nbill. I was one who signed the conference report, worked on the bill, \nvoted for the bill in the Senate. We do not have an energy bill because \nit failed by two votes. It failed by two votes because the majority \nleader of the other body insisted on a retroactive waiver for liability \nof MTBE. He was told it would kill the bill, and it killed the bill.\n  I don't have much patience with Members who point to one side or the \nother and say they killed the Energy bill. The Energy bill should be in \nthe Senate right now and should have been in the Senate last week. We \nought to do an energy bill. I said I would refrain from commenting. I \njust commented.\n  There is no Republican or Democrat way to pay inflated gas prices. \nThe way you pay inflated gas prices is stick the hose in the tank and \nyou have to fork over a bunch of bills when you are done filling the \ntank. We ought to get a bill through here. My colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle believe that. In my judgment, it ought to be a priority.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3110\n\n  Having said that, I have come to the Senate floor to speak to an \namendment I offered yesterday on behalf of myself and Senator Mikulski. \nThe amendment is supported and cosponsored by other Members of the \nSenate.\n  Senator Mikulski and I offer an amendment that deals with the issue \nof the embedded tax incentive in our Tax Code that actually \nincentivizes companies to shut down their U.S. operation, move jobs \noverseas, and then send the product from those jobs back into the \nUnited States. Let me describe the amendment and let me describe why I \nbelieve it is important. The amendment offered by myself and Senator \nMikulski is also cosponsored by Senator Harkin, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Kennedy, and Senator Edwards.\n  This amendment partially repeals a tax subsidy called deferral. This \nsubsidy is only partially repealed because it is repealed for those \nU.S. companies that move their operation to a foreign subsidiary, \nproduce the same product, and ship the product back into this country. \nThey lose deferral on that kind of economic activity.\n  The amendment has several other provisions that require notification \nof communities, agencies, and workers when jobs are going to be lost \nand jobs are going to be offshored. It requires the Department of Labor \nto supply statistics on jobs sent overseas.\n  The key part is to shut down the perverse provision in tax law that \nincentivizes the movement of jobs overseas. If you look at this Tax \nCode, which itself is a Byzantine set of complexities, there is not a \nsection that says: In this part of the Tax Code, this chapter is \nentitled ``Incentive for Sending U.S. Jobs Overseas.'' There is no such \npart of the Tax Code. There is no chapter, title or provision that says \nthis is the benefit you get from sending jobs overseas. But that \nbenefit does exist in the Tax Code, and I intend to describe how and \nwhy it exists.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. We now have agreement that we can have those two votes. I \nhave already indicated that following the remarks of Senator Dorgan and \nSenator Mikulski, we would move to the Graham amendment No. 3112 and \nthe time would be equally divided, 2 hours equally divided. Following \nthe debate on that, I ask we move to vote in relation to the Graham \namendment No. 3112. Prior to that, we vote on the Breaux amendment No. \n3117. There will be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each of the \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this is a picture of a little red wagon. \nOn the side of this little red wagon it says ``Radio Flyer.'' Most of \nus understand what this little red wagon is because we have actually \nhad one of these red wagons. I had one. My guess is the person now \noccupying the Chair has had a little red wagon. Even in Nevada they \nhave little red wagons. Senator Reid, no doubt, has ridden in one of \nthese. I didn't know until recently much about the red wagons, but that \nthey were wonderful and fun, and if you turn the front wheels too \nsharp, sometimes they tip over.\n  This little red wagon is enjoyed by these two young children as it \nhas been enjoyed for decades and decades. This wagon is called the \nRadio Flyer. It comes from a company created in 1917 by an Italian \nimmigrant woodworker named Antonio Pasin. He had a one-room workshop in \nNew York City where he made wooden wagons by hand. He called them \nLiberty Coasters, after the Statue of Liberty. He later renamed them \n``Radio Flyers'' because he always had an admiration for airplanes. \nThat is how Radio Flyers came on the side of little red wagons sold all \nover the country.\n  The company was inherited by Antonio's children and then inherited by \nhis grandchildren located in Chicago, IL. For almost a century, they \nturned out these marvelous little red metal wagons made here in this \ncountry by working men and women who are proud to make them--that is, \nuntil earlier last month. They announced these little red wagons would \nnow be made in China. These American Flyers, these red wagons, will now \nbe sent to our country to be enjoyed by our children, but they will no \nlonger be made in America;\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\nthey will be made in the country of China. That is an American icon, \nmoving to China.\n  Huffy bicycles. Huffy bicycles have 20 percent of the American \nmarketplace. Everybody knows about Huffy bicycles. Buy them at Sears, \nKmart, Wal-Mart. In fact, for many years, Huffy bicycles had a little \ndecal between the handle bars and the front fender. That decal was of \nthe American flag, made by proud men and women working in a \nmanufacturing plant in Ohio. Those men and women made $11 an hour, but \nthey don't work there anymore. They lost their jobs. They came to work \none day to find out they were fired. Why? Because Huffy bicycles were \nmoving to China. Why were they moving to China? Because $11 an hour was \ntoo much to pay an American worker when you could hire a worker in \nChina for 33 cents an hour.\n  By the way, when you move the little red wagon to China and you move \nHuffy bicycles to China, you also get a tax break. By the way, if you \njust close your manufacturing plant in the United States and move it to \nChina, you get a tax break.\n  Huffy bicycles are not here anymore. They are in China. They are made \nby people who make 33 cents an hour. They work 7 days a week, 12 to 14 \nhours a day. Both of these companies get a tax cut for going to China. \nHow does that work? How do they get a tax cut for doing that? We have \nsomething in our Tax Code called deferral. It is a foreign language to \nmost people unless you are an accountant who works in all these areas. \nDeferral. It says: Tell you what, if you have two bicycle manufacturers \nside by side in the same town competing for the same marketplace, they \npay the same wage; they hire the same number of workers; they produce \nthe same number of bicycles, one of them decides to move to China or \njust move overseas, the bicycle manufacturer that stays in your \nhometown in this country will pay higher taxes than the bicycle \nmanufacturer that leaves because the bicycle manufacturer that leaves \nto go produce in China is not going to have to pay U.S. income taxes on \nits income until and unless it is repatriated into this country. That \nis called deferral. So it will earn income that is untaxed under \nsomething called deferral.\n\n  We are told from the latest estimates we received recently that this \ndeferral benefit for companies that move overseas to produce the same \nproduct and ship it back into our marketplace in the U.S. is over $6 \nbillion in 10 years.\n  Now I am not talking about an American company, for example, that is \nin the suburbs of Toledo, OH, and it decides: I am going to move a \nmanufacturing operation to Sri Lanka or Indonesia so I can, less \nexpensively, produce a product to market in Japan or South Korea. That \nis not what I am talking about. That is not what this amendment Senator \nMikulski and I are offering is talking about. We are talking about an \nAmerican company that decides it should be benefited with rewards from \nour tax system for producing a product overseas that is going to come \nback into our marketplace to be sold in this country.\n  It is unfair to U.S. domestic companies to compete against another \ncompany that decides to send its production overseas, get rid of its \nAmerican workers, and then end up competing against its former \ncompetitors that stayed in this country, but compete in a way that \nprovides this company that left this tremendous advantage because they \nnow pay lower taxes. They got a tax incentive for leaving.\n  We are going to hear, I think, a lot of obfuscation about this issue \nand huffing and puffing and blue smoke in the air over all this. But I \nthink there is a simple proposition to understand. If two companies \nthat make bicycles exist in the same city, and one goes to China to \nmake bicycles to ship back to the United States, the one that left gets \na tax break. That is in current law. You can either vote to support \ncurrent law and say, ``I support continuing to give this insidious tax \nbreak to those who want to move offshore to ship back into this \nmarketplace,'' or you can decide this is wrong.\n  Those companies that stay here, those companies that produce here, \nought not to have to compete against others that now have a lower tax \nrate because they left. That is a simple proposition. There is a lot \nmore we should do, but we don't do it in this bill. I will give you \nsome examples.\n  Companies that want to run subsidiaries through tax havens, what we \nought to do is decide if you don't have a business operation, you just \nwant to run your business accounting through a tax-haven country, we \nare going to treat you as if you never left this country. That is what \nwe ought to do.\n  And this last goofy provision that is in the underlying bill says to \ncompanies, Oh, by the way, you left, and you now have deferred income, \nfor which you have never paid a tax; why don't you bring it back here \nand pay a 5-percent tax on it. What an incredibly goofy idea. You think \nthere would be some embarrassment about putting that in the bill, but \nthere is not. There is no embarrassment, apparently. But Tom Paxon, \nmany years ago, wrote this song ``I'm Changing My Name to Poland.'' \nThat is when Poland got some sort of bailout loan from the United \nStates. ``I'm Changing My Name to Poland.'' Maybe the American people \nought to get the same benefit that is being proposed in this bill of a \n5-percent income tax rate. If it is good enough for people who have $10 \nbillion in deferred income overseas, to repatriate it and pay a 5-\npercent rate, why shouldn't every single American working family pay \nthe same 5-percent rate? Are they unworthy? Are they less worthy? Why \nnot give them the same opportunity?\n\n  There are a dozen things we ought to do to this Tax Code to make it \nfair. With respect to this issue of international provisions in the Tax \nCode, we do one, narrow thing. It is very simple. In my judgment, no \none here will be able to say I did not understand it. It is very \nsimple. If you are an American corporation and you decide to produce \noverseas for the purpose of selling into our country, we are not going \nto give you a tax break any longer for continuing to do it. We are not \ngoing to give you a tax break.\n  Now let me just go through a couple of things that describe the \ncircumstances that exist in this country. Imports from foreign \naffiliates of U.S. corporations have doubled since 1993. Is a lot of \nthis happening? You bet. Is it happening in a much more accelerated \nway? Of course. And the perverse thing is, we have a Tax Code that \nincentivizes this to happen.\n  Here is employment in U.S. manufacturing. It has fallen by 2.7 \nmillion jobs since the year 2000. You see what is happening to the \nmanufacturing sector in this country. No country is going to long \nremain a world economic power without a robust, healthy manufacturing \nsector.\n  I used Radio Flyer wagons--and Huffy bicycles. I could have used any \nnumber of products to describe what is happening to the manufacturing \nbase of the country. And our Tax Code subsidizes it. It says: If you \nhave a plant, shut it down and move. We will give you a tax cut.\n  Employment in foreign affiliates as a percent of U.S. manufacturing \nhas gone from 23 percent to 34 percent. I do not need to make the case \nany more than this, except to say when we do this--and I often come to \nthe floor to talk about trade issues--it relates to a whole myriad of \nissues. I mentioned Radio Flyers and Huffy bicycles going to China. I \nhave not visited the plants where they are made.\n  I regret, and am enormously disappointed, after a century of making \nlittle red wagons in our country, the company that makes them has \ndecided to make them elsewhere. I regret bicycles that were made here \nare made in China. But let me describe the circumstance of all of these \nissues. And I have talked about this before. This is a Washington Post \narticle. It is about labor provisions in China. This gets to the issue \nof fair trade. But this is not just fair trade. It is also the perverse \ntax incentive that says: Oh, by the way, ship your jobs overseas.\n  It says:\n\n       On the night she died, Li Chunmei must have been exhausted.\n       Co-workers said she had been on her feet for nearly 16 \n     hours, running back and forth inside the Banain Toy Factory, \n     carrying toy parts from machine to machine.\n\n  This was the busy season, before Christmas. They worked 7 days a \nweek. The exact cause of her death remains unknown. They found her \nafter the lights went out:\n\n       Her roommates had already fallen asleep when she started \n     coughing up blood. They\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\n     found her in the bathroom a few hours later, curled up on the \n     floor, moaning softly in the dark, bleeding from her nose and \n     mouth. Someone called an ambulance, but she died before it \n     arrived.\n       The exact cause of [her] death remains unknown. But what \n     happened in this industrial town in southeastern Guangdong \n     province is described by family, friends and co-workers as an \n     example of what [Chinese] newspapers call ``guolaosi.'' The \n     phrase means ``over-work death''. . . .\n\n  They actually have a term for it in China.\n  So these people, who used to make Radio Flyers, the people who used \nto make Huffy bicycles are supposed to compete with that? We are \nsupposed to believe this is the way competition works in the world? I \ndo not think so.\n  But aside from that, aside from the perversity of setting up a \ncompetition in circumstances where kids are worked to death, and paid \npennies, and live 12 to a room, work 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, \naside from that, we, in this Tax Code, have an incentive that says: If \nyou do this, you pay less in taxes. If you do this, move your jobs \nelsewhere, you actually get a tax break. My colleague Senator Mikulski \nand I think that is perverse, as I have said.\n  This proposal is very carefully targeted. It ends tax deferral only \nwhere U.S. multinationals produce goods abroad and ship those goods \nback into the U.S. marketplace. For others who might be surprised by \nthis amendment, let me say to them, it is not new. President John F. \nKennedy tried to shut down deferral--a much larger proposition than \nours in this amendment. Richard Nixon supported shutting down deferral. \nThe House of Representatives actually voted in the 1980s to shut this \ndown. This is not new.\n  I might also say, the Senate has previously voted on an amendment \nvery similar to this about 8 years ago. But if we are dealing with \ninternational taxation--and we certainly are with respect to the \nunderlying bill brought to the floor by the Finance Committee; and we \nare doing it in some ways that are quite disappointing, some ways that \nare fine--if we are dealing with that subject, we cannot fail to deal \nwith the subject of incentives that now exist for companies to \neliminate U.S. jobs and shipping those U.S. jobs overseas.\n  I am not someone who believes our country ought to put up walls. We \nhave a global economy; I understand that. I don't think the rules for \nglobalization have nearly kept pace with globalization. That is why you \ncan't hold discussions on trade anywhere where there is a population \ncenter these days, so they take them to Qatar, someplace where there \nare no hotel rooms.\n  The fact is, we are now increasingly a global economy. But as we \nglobalize, the rules must keep pace. As we globalize this country, this \nworld economic power needs to be concerned about its future, its job \nbase, and its manufacturing base. Precious little attention is paid to \nit. We will have Members come to the floor this afternoon aggressively \nsupporting the proposition that deferral is good for our country, good \nfor our taxpayers, good for our job base. Nonsense. Sheer nonsense. It \nis not good under any set of circumstances for us to say if you have \ntwo companies, one that stays in America, and one that leaves our \ncountry, both to produce products to sell in our marketplace, that we \nwill advantage the company that left. We will give an advantage to the \ncompany that fired its workers and left to take its jobs to Sri Lanka \nor to Indonesia or Taiwan or China or Bangladesh. It makes no sense. It \nnever has. And it makes no sense today to decide that we will provide \nsignificant financial incentives to those who make the decision to shut \ndown American jobs, shut down manufacturing plants, move them overseas, \nand reward them for doing so.\n  This country ought to stand up for its economic interests, not to the \ndetriment of others but for its economic interests. That is what this \namendment does. It is about jobs. It is about economic strength. It is \nabout a manufacturing base that needs to be strong and vibrant and \ngrowing. And it is about fairness. Finally and most importantly, it is \nabout common sense.\n  I come to this Chamber from a very small town, 300 people in \nsouthwestern North Dakota, a sparsely populated State. One heavy dose \nof common sense here would be that we would pass this amendment and say \nthat this defies logic. Go to the cafe in my hometown and ask folks: Do \nyou think it makes sense for us to have an embedded provision in the \nAmerican Tax Code that rewards a company that leaves and puts the \ncompany that stays at a competitive disadvantage? Try defending that. \nIf you will defend that in any cafe, any city in this country, let me \nbe there while you do it so I can tell the other side of this story.\n  There will come a point when this Congress--perhaps it is today when \nwe start down this road--has to decide to stand up for the economic \ninterests at home, take care of matters at home. This is a first step.\n  Let me end where I began, with bicycles and wagons, just as a symbol. \nBoth have now decided that they will not produce in the United States. \nThey will produce instead in China. Those jobs, these wheels, these \npedals, those handlebars, and this red paint used to be applied by \nAmerican workers. They are not any longer. I am not saying we ought to \nkeep every job here. I am not saying it is not a global economy. But I \nam saying we can take the first commonsense step to say we will no \nlonger have an embedded perverse incentive to reward companies to move \ntheir jobs overseas. If we can't take that step, this is going to be a \nmighty short journey for this country's economy.\n  At a time when we worry about jobs, people worry about security; they \nsit around the supper table at night and talk about their lives ``What \nkind of job do I have? Do I have job security? Does it pay well?'' At a \ntime when we discuss these things and know we have lost 2.7 million \nmanufacturing jobs in a few recent years, the question for this \nCongress is: Will you decide to end the perverse incentive in the Tax \nCode that actually ships jobs elsewhere? Yes or no. There is not \n``maybe'' as a potential answer. It is yes or no. That is what we will \nvote on this afternoon.\n  My colleague, Senator Mikulski, comes from a wonderful State, a \ndifferent State than mine. She comes from more of an industrial State, \nthe State of Maryland. But she has worked with me tirelessly in \ncreating this amendment. I know she has a lot to say as well on behalf \nof American workers. Let me yield the floor to my colleague from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in \nthe Record letters in support of the Dorgan-Mikulski amendment from the \nboilermakers and the shipbuilders, from the electrical workers, from \nthe U.A.W., and from the AFL-CIO.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship \n           Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers & Helpers,\n                                         Fairfax, VA, May 4, 2004.\n       Dear Senator: Today, the Senate is expected to vote on the \n     Dorgan-Mikulski amendments to S. 1637, which would end tax \n     deferral for U.S. companies that outsource manufacturing \n     facilities and jobs to foreign countries, only to ship \n     foreign made goods back to the United States. On behalf of \n     the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship \n     Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers, I strongly urge \n     you to support the Dorgan-Mikulski amendment and end the \n     ``Runaway Plant/U.S. Job Export'' subsidy.\n       The Dorgan-Mikulski amendment will help stop the flow of \n     good-paying manufacturing jobs out of the United States. In \n     the last 3 years, 2.7 million jobs that could support the \n     typical American family have disappeared. Part of this \n     decline is due to tax incentives that encourage companies to \n     shift their operations abroad. Under current law, a U.S. \n     company that shifts a manufacturing operation to a foreign \n     based subsidiary can indefinitely defer paying U.S. taxes on \n     its profits until it sends those profits back to the U.S. as \n     dividends.\n       U.S. taxpayers should not subsidize manufacturing \n     expatriates. This unfair and arcane tax provision rewards \n     U.S. companies that move American jobs offshore and puts \n     taxpaying domestic companies at a severe disadvantage, while \n     costing American taxpayers $6.5 billion over 10 years. \n     Multinational companies should not be encouraged to move jobs \n     abroad and avoid paying their fair share of taxes on income \n     gained from the U.S. market.\n       Repealing the jobs exports tax subsidy will allow American \n     manufacturers to compete fairly. This amendment not only \n     repeals this ill-advised job export subsidy, but it uses \n     those savings to accelerate the tax cuts provided in S. 1637 \n     for domestic manufacturing.\n       Corporations will be held accountable to the communities \n     they leave behind. Workers\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\n     and their families deserve to know when their jobs are being \n     sent abroad. This amendment will shed new light on corporate \n     practices by requiring companies to disclose to workers and \n     the public whenever they lay off more than 15 workers to send \n     jobs overseas.\n       Once again, I urge you to remedy the unfair tax incentive \n     that sends American jobs overseas by supporting the Dorgan-\n     Mikulski amendment to S. 1637. Thank you for your attention \n     to this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Bridget P.

Hill,\n\n     International President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2004.\n       Dear Senator. The AFL-CIO urges to support the Dorgan-\n     Mikulski amendment to S. 1637. The amendment would eliminate \n     foreign tax deferral for companies that export jobs.\n       Under current tax law, companies that manufacture in the \n     United States must pay corporate taxes, but American \n     companies that manufacture abroad can indefinitely defer \n     their taxes on that income. The Dorgan-Mikulski amendment \n     would eliminate deferral so companies are taxed the same \n     whether they produce and invest in the United States, or \n     invest abroad and export back to the United States. This \n     change would save taxpayers nearly $7 billion and eliminate a \n     major incentive in the tax code to ship jobs overseas.\n       The amendment comes at a critical time for American \n     workers. More than 2.8 million manufacturing jobs have been \n     destroyed since President Bush took office. According to a \n     recent survey of American CEOs, 47 percent of them plan to \n     ship more manufacturing jobs overseas this year. The US tax \n     code should not encourage companies to export jobs, which is \n     why the Senate should adopt the Dorgan-Mikulski amendment.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William Samuel,\n     Director, Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America-UAW\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2004.\n       Dear Senator: This week the Senate will be considering \n     amendments to the FSC/ETI tax replacement legislation. The \n     UAW wishes to share with you our views on this important \n     measure.\n       The UAW strongly supports the Specter-Bayh manufacturer's \n     tax equity amendment. As currently structured, the FSC/ETI \n     bill provides a deduction that only certain U.S. \n     manufacturers are able to utilize. Unfortunately, this \n     deduction does not provide any benefit to many capital-\n     intensive industries--including major auto and steel \n     companies--because they do not have sufficient \n     ``manufacturing'' income due to their extremely high \n     ``legacy'' health care and pension costs. The net result is \n     that domestic portion of the FSC/ETI bill fails to provide \n     any assistance to a major portion of our manufacturing base \n     that is crucial to maintaining thousands of good paying jobs.\n       To correct this deficiency, the Specter-Bayh amendment \n     would allow manufacturers to elect either to take the \n     deduction currently in the bill, or in lieu of that to \n     receive a tax credit equal to 10 percent of their health care \n     expenditures for active and retired workers aged 55-64. This \n     election would effectively allow auto and steel companies to \n     receive a tax benefit equivalent to that received by other \n     domestic manufacturers. In addition, it would provide \n     significant relief for their ``legacy'' costs, and enable \n     them to increase investments and create additional jobs for \n     American workers. The UAW urges you vote for the Specter-Bayh \n     amendment and to insist that it be incorporated into the FSC/\n     ETI bill.\n       The UAW also urges you to support amendments to reduce or \n     eliminate tax breaks for the overseas operations of \n     multinational corporations. This includes the Dorgan-Mikulski \n     amendment on runaway shops, the Harkin amendment disallowing \n     deductions for outsourcing, and the Hollings amendment \n     striking the international provisions in the bill. These \n     amendments would eliminate tax breaks that are exacerbating \n     the loss of manufacturing jobs in this country. Instead of \n     subsidizing companies that ship jobs overseas, the UAW \n     believes Congress should target assistance to domestic \n     manufacturers who create jobs for American workers.\n       Thank you for considering our views on these important \n     issues.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Alan Reuther,\n\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from North \nDakota for his passion and vigor in presenting this amendment. I also \nthank him for his story about the Red Ryder, a good old wagon. I had a \nRed Ryder wagon. Growing up in a blue-collar neighborhood in Baltimore \nduring World War II, my father had a little neighborhood grocery store. \nAnd one of the ways the groceries got delivered was in this good old \nred wagon we had. I could use the wagon for a couple things.\n  Dad would sometimes say: Barb, take the wagon down to Mrs. Smith or \nYankowski or Coalino. It was a very ethnic neighborhood. They called in \nand ordered late. Run down those oranges and take the wagon.\n  I loved that red wagon. I was also a Girl Scout during World War II. \nDad would let me use the wagon to go around the neighborhood to collect \nnewspapers because we were recycling a variety of things for the war \neffort. I felt like a little soldier on the move with my red wagon and \nmy little Girl Scout uniform, along with other kids from the troop. I \nwas the kid with the wagon. I loved that wagon. I loved that \nneighborhood so much because in that neighborhood there were men sent \noff to World War II, saving Western civilization, saving the world.\n  We were the neighborhood of factories. We made liberty ships. We \nturned out a liberty ship, one ship every 3 weeks. We put out turbo \nsteel to make the tanks. Glenn L. Martin made the seaplanes that helped \nwin the battle of the Pacific. We were in the manufacturing business. \nWe were in the war effort business. And this little girl in her Girl \nScout uniform with the little red wagon made in the USA felt she was \ndoing her bit.\n  Guess what. Those jobs now are leaving. Our shipyard jobs have left. \nOur steel mills have shrunk to miniscule levels. We don't make ships. \nWe don't make steel. We don't make clothing. We are really down. The \nblue-collar Baltimore of World War II and Korea and Vietnam just isn't \nwhat it used to be.\n  Where did those jobs go? Those jobs are on a slow boat to China. They \nare on a fast track to Mexico. And other jobs are in a dial 1-800 \nanywhere. And why did they go? They went because there were tax breaks \nthat rewarded those corporations to move not only the red wagons but so \nmuch of this manufacturing overseas.\n  Today, as we know, if you are in business and in the good old United \nStates of America, you get a tax break if you move those jobs overseas. \nI think it is wrong to give companies incentives to send millions of \njobs to other countries when millions of Americans are losing their \njobs. It is wrong to put companies\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\nwho stay in America at a competitive disadvantage because they have \ntheir business and hire their workers at home, pay their share of \ntaxes, and provide health care to their employees.\n  We should be rewarding these companies with good guy tax breaks for \nhiring and building their businesses right here in the United States. \nWe should be giving good guy bonuses to American corporations who are \nproviding health care to their workers and to their retirees. But, no, \nwe give tax breaks to those people who want to take their jobs and \nevacuate to another country.\n  It is time we look at our Tax Code and call for a patriotic Tax Code. \nI want a patriotic Tax Code. We walk around the floor of the Senate, we \ngo to rallies. We love to be in parades. We wear our flags because we \nwant to stand up for our troops--and stand up for our troops we \nshould--but we have to stand up for America.\n  We have to stand up for America by having a strong economy. That is \nwhy I want a patriotic Tax Code. This amendment we are proposing is \nabout patriotism. It is about economic patriotism. We have to start \nputting our might and our muscle and our votes behind this in the \nSenate.\n  What does a patriotic Tax Code do? I think it would focus on bringing \nour jobs back home and bringing our money back home. That is what a \npatriotic Tax Code would do. The Dorgan-Mikulski amendment is step one. \nIt ends these huge tax breaks for manufacturing companies that send \njobs overseas, only to sell the products they make right here in the \nUnited States of America. The current Tax Code lets these companies \nmove the jobs and not pay taxes on the profits, even though they earn \nthe profits by their sales of those products in the United States.\n  Our amendment tells these companies if you want to export jobs out of \nAmerica, you need to pay the taxes on your profits. Our amendment says \nthe Tax Code can no longer be used to boost corporate rewards at the \nexpense of American workers. I have watched those jobs I have talked \nabout leave. A couple months ago, we were hard hit on the eastern \nshore. There is a company headquartered in Maryland called Black and \nDecker. It makes many of the wonderful tools you use in your home. It \nwas started by a Maryland family. The jobs were in America. Now the \nheadquarters is in America, but the jobs are not here. The eastern \nshore jobs at that major manufacturing facility have left. Over a \nthousand people were laid off; 1,000 people in a little community like \nTalbot County. That is a tremendous impact. The impact has been felt by \nthe whole community. People lost their jobs, and people had to cut back \nin terms of their homes, the way they shop at their grocery store; and \nthere is great shrinkage in the United Fund. I could go on about that. \nThose jobs left this country.\n  At the same time, there are other examples. Take Maytag. Oh, gosh, \nevery woman in America loves Maytag and that friendly guy who comes to \nservice them. Well, I hope he speaks a foreign language to try to read \nthe manual, because those Maytags are made somewhere else. By the way, \nthey used to be made in Illinois. So those 1,500 jobs left. They were \nwashed out, if you will, in this country.\n  Then there is Levi Strauss, which closed six U.S. plants, cutting \nover 5,000 jobs. So the jeans that made America famous are now being \nmade in other countries.\n  We could go on to furniture that used to be made in our Southern \nStates, like Virginia and North Carolina. Many of you might have read \nin the paper over the weekend what is happening in Roanoke, VA, where \nmany people have lost their jobs in manufacturing, in metal working, in \nfurniture, and in other materials. Their divorce rate is so high that \nalmost 50 percent of the people in Roanoke, VA, are now divorced. It is \nbecoming the divorce capital, with the highest divorce rate in the \nNation. Why did that happen? You can look at the divorce rate and chart \nit along with the decline in those manufacturing jobs. We have seen it \nin manufacturing. There is the exit of the service jobs now. A lot of \npeople in manufacturing who lost their jobs busted their backs and \ntheir butts to send their kids to higher education, community college, \nor college. They said go to college, kids, learn technology; it is the \nnew field. You are not going to be laid off like me. You are going to \nhave a future. America will be the tech country of the world. Well, \nguess what happened. Now the tech jobs are going. In the next few \nyears, the IT sector will move over 500,000 jobs overseas. People are \nsaying train--you have to be kidding. Even our State governments are \noutsourcing jobs by hiring companies to do call centers overseas. I \njoined with Senator Dodd to stop the outsourcing of Federal jobs \noverseas to call centers.\n\n  That is why I stand here today with my colleague from North Dakota to \ncall on us to think about economic patriotism, think about a patriotic \nTax Code that, first of all, gives rewards to American companies that \nkeep jobs here, and also a tax code that gives good bonuses to those \ncompanies that provide health insurance to their workers and also look \nout for their retirees.\n  Then the other thing is to end the despicable process and breaks and \nrewarding those companies who move not only the little red wagons, but \nvery big manufacturing items overseas. That is why I want to stand up \ntoday for what I believe is the right thing to do. I call upon my \ncolleagues to think about where America is going in the 21st century. \nWhere are we going to be? Are we going to create more opportunity? Are \nwe going to create more jobs that pay living wages, that have a benefit \nstructure you can reward? Or are we going to resemble the economy of a \nthird world country?\n  I really want to have a tax code that brings our jobs back home, \nbrings our money back home, stands up for America. So pass the Dorgan-\nMikulski amendment and take your first step toward economic patriotism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, thanks to the Senator from Maryland for \nher comments and her hard work on this amendment. I hope we will be \nable to pass this amendment. I expect we will vote on it later today. I \nwanted to make a couple of additional points.\n  First of all, on this broader issue of deferring tax, Presidents \nKennedy, Nixon, and Carter all tried in vain to actually end deferral. \nIn 1975, the Senate voted to end it. In 1987, the House voted to end \nit. But in each case, of course, it never got to the President's desk \nfor signature. So we have this thing called deferral. That sounds less \nominous than it really is.\n  With respect to the products manufactured abroad to be sold in our \nmarketplace by U.S. corporations, this deferral is a title that says \nthere is a tax break for U.S. companies to move jobs overseas in order \nto sell back into our marketplace. There is now $640 billion in foreign \nearnings that have not been repatriated. Many of them, of course, are \nparked in tax havens indefinitely--$640 billion.\n  My colleague also talked about some products. What is more American \nthan Levis? Well, Levis are gone. Before, when you put on a pair of \npants, you were putting on an American pair of pants. Not anymore. You \nare putting on Mexican or Chinese pants.\n  Then there is Fruit of the Loom. It is one thing to lose your shirt, \nbut Fruit of the Loom is gone. They used to be manufactured here. They \nare manufacturing them in Mexico and, I believe, some in China. By the \nway, if you want to order up Mexican food, order Fig Newtons. We all \ngrew up with them. Fig Newton cookies used to be American. Now this \ncookie is made in Mexico. Next time you order Mexican food, ask whether \nthey will bring you some Fig Newtons.\n  The point is, we are not only shifting these jobs out of our country \nfor the purpose of manufacturing to sell back into our country, our Tax \nCode says please do this and we will give you a $6.5 billion benefit \nover the coming 10 years.\n  If the Congress cannot take this baby step in addressing this \nperversion, then the Congress cannot find its way through public policy \nin a way that reflects any modicum of common sense.\n  I wanted to mention that while I think there is much to criticize in \nthe underlying bill, there is a provision in the underlying bill that \naddresses so-called ``inversion.'' I commend the committee, Senator \nGrassley, and Senator Baucus for that position. The inversion is a \ncircumstance where a U.S. corporation says I want to renounce my \nAmerican citizenship for\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\nthe purpose of saving tax money. Well, we have seen some of that. My \ncolleague from Maryland asks, where is the economic patriotism? The \ncommittee, in my judgment, did the right thing with respect to this \nissue of inversions in the underlying bill. I congratulate them for \nthat.\n  My hope is we will this afternoon have some additional debate on this \namendment. I don't know what is going to be offered as a substitute, \nbut, hopefully, we will have votes on both, and we will be able to \ncontinue and complete this debate this afternoon. I hope when the dust \nsettles Congress will have done something that meets some basic \ncommonsense test.\n  My understanding is Senator Graham of Florida is going to be involved \nin the coming 2 hours. He is in the Chamber. Let me at this point yield \nthe floor with the understanding I will continue this discussion this \nafternoon when we return to this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3112\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 hours of debate equally divided on the Graham amendment \nNo. 3112.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I first thank my colleagues, \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Mikulski, who have raised the issue of will \nit be American jobs the JOBS bill will create. That is a core question \nwhich is raised by the amendment I have brought to the Senate. We are \nabout to spend $170 billion over the next 10 years with the stated \nobjective being to create jobs for American men and women. The question \nis: How effective will this legislation be in achieving that goal? Is \nit worth $170 billion under these conditions to be spent or is there \nnot a better way to allocate that same amount of money that will have a \ngreater likelihood of actually creating jobs in the United States?\n  I would like to put this into some context. The context is where have \nwe been in the recent past and where are we today in terms of jobs for \nAmerican men and women.\n  The manufacturing sector of the American economy has lost 2.8 million \njobs since January of 2001. It may well be this administration will end \nup as the first administration in 70 years, since the administration of \nPresident Herbert Hoover, to preside over a net decline in private \nsector employment in the United States.\n  The unemployment rate has increased 36 percent since January of 2001. \nThe number of long-term unemployed has increased 175 percent. There \nhave been policies and expectations advanced to reverse that situation. \nThe President said, for instance, in his 2003 Economic Report that \nbased on the steps Congress had taken since his administration \ncommenced, in the year 2003 there would be 1.9 million new jobs created \nin America. The actual increase in jobs in America was 100,000.\n\n  The administration has stated the weak employment situation is the \nresult of a dramatic increase in productivity. They argue this \nincreased productivity has raised our standard of living. There are a \nlot of Americans out there who have not seen this rising tide of \nstandard of living.\n  Since this administration took office, real earnings growth has \nslowed dramatically, particularly for those at the lower income scale. \nReal earnings at the middle of the income distribution rose only two-\ntenths of 1 percent per year in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003.\n  To put this in comparison, this is a marked deterioration from the \nsuccesses of the 1990s. Between 1996 and 2000, real earnings growth for \nthose in the middle income was 1.7 percent per year.\n  We also find ourselves with another growing deficit, and that is a \ngrowing trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit, the excess of goods and \nservices we buy from others over the amount of goods and services we \nsell to others, has varied over the years, generally in tandem with the \neconomy. For example, in 1981, we had a slight trade surplus. In 1986, \nthe trade deficit had risen to a then record of 2.8 percent of gross \ndomestic product. Remember that number, in 1986, a record historic \ntrade deficit in the United States of 2.8 percent of gross domestic \nproduct.\n  In 1991, our trade deficit had fallen back to a mere two-tenths of 1 \npercent of our gross domestic product. We see in the last several \nyears, as there has been deterioration in jobs within America, there \nhas also been a deterioration in our international trade balance. For \n2003, our trade deficit reached a new record of 5.5 percent of GDP. \nCompare that with the record of 1986 of 2.8 percent of gross domestic \nproduct.\n  I present this information as the context within which to consider \nthe legislation which is before us and the amendment I have offered--\nthe need for strategic, energetic, and efficient stimulation to our \neconomy, particularly our manufacturing economy and particularly to \nthat part of the manufacturing economy which has been so damaged by the \ndeterioration of our international trade.\n  The current impasse on this JOBS bill which has caused several weeks \ndelay may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. The delay has provided \nthe Senate with an opportunity to reassess the fundamental merits of \nthis legislation and then to consider what might be better alternatives \nfor working men and women in this country.\n  I see this bill, the JOBS Act, as having five goals.\n  The first goal is to meet our obligation under the World Trade \nOrganization by repealing the existing laws, rules, and regulations \nand, therefore, reverse the retaliatory sanctions which are being \nimposed by European countries on products of the United States, many of \nwhich have nothing to do with the underlying current international tax \nincentives for American manufacturers. That is goal No. 1.\n  Goal No. 2 is to avoid enacting a provision that makes it more \nadvantageous than it is today for U.S. companies to move jobs abroad.\n  Goal No. 3 is to enact provisions that encourage job creation in the \nUnited States of America.\n  Goal No. 4 is to simplify the Tax Code.\n  Goal No. 5 is to minimize extraneous tax matters that detract from \nthe purpose of this legislation--jobs in America.\n  Let me review the degree to which this legislation achieves these \nfive very important goals.\n  Goal No. 1, comply with the adverse WTO ruling. The World Trade \nOrganization, of which the United States is a charter member, has ruled \nthe extraterritorial income tax incentive enacted in 2000 violates the \nWTO prohibition against export subsidies. The extraterritorial income \ntax incentive, acronymed ETI, was enacted to replace a similar export-\nrelated tax benefit, the foreign sales corporation regime, which also \ncame under fire by the WTO.\n  Under the ETI regime, a taxpayer can exclude a portion of its income \nrelated to goods sold, leased, or rented for direct use or consumption \nor disposition outside the United States. The amount excluded under the \nETI law is 15 percent of the net income derived from the transaction.\n  The WTO's ruling is unfortunate because it perpetuates an unfair \nadvantage which the European businesses have in relation to the United \nStates firms selling into that market.\n  Nevertheless, because we rely on the WTO to make sure other countries \nadhere to international trade rules, we must abide by its decision. It \nis the rule of trade law.\n  In addition to meeting our trade obligations, we need to enact this \nbill to rescue those companies and their employees from the punitive \ntariffs which are currently being imposed on U.S. exports into the \nEuropean Union. Currently, those tariffs equal 7 percent of the price \nof a product being exported to Europe. That tariff will increase 1 \npercent per month for each month we delay in repealing these offending \nprovisions.\n  What is most unfortunate is the companies that had benefited from the \nETI provisions which have now been ruled illegal often do not make the \nproducts which are now the subject of European sanction and \nretaliation. Innocent businesses and their employees are caught in this \ncrossfire. The JOBS Act meets this first goal by repealing the ETI \nprovisions in our Tax Code. Repealing these provisions will increase \nFederal income tax receipts by $45 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Goal No. 2: Avoid exacerbating the current tax incentives for further \noutsourcing of jobs by U.S. corporations. The JOBS Act does a poor job \nin\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\nmeeting this objective. The provisions in title II of the bill, by \ndefinition, are designed to lower the tax burden on U.S. companies' \nforeign operations. The effect of that: To make it even more attractive \nto move operations and jobs outside the United States to a foreign base \nof operation.\n  The total cost of the changes we are making in this underlying law, \nwhich will have the effect of increasing the incentives to leave the \nUnited States, is $37 billion over the next 10 years. As stunning as it \nis, we are about to spend $37 billion to give additional incentives for \nfirms to move jobs out of the United States.\n  I will provide a couple of examples of how specific provisions will \naffect U.S. multinational investment decisions. First I will say to \nanyone who is listening that if they would like to take a nap, this \nwould be a good time to do it because it gets real tough going at this \npoint.\n  Example one, there is a provision in this bill that changes the tax \ntreatment of payments between affiliated foreign companies. The law \ntoday is that the U.S. tax on income earned by a foreign subsidiary of \na U.S. multinational is deferred until that income is paid to the U.S. \nparent in the form of a dividend. Dividends paid by one foreign \nsubsidiary to another foreign subsidiary are treated as though they \nwere paid to the U.S. parent and are therefore subject to U.S. tax.\n  The JOBS Act changes this treatment by continuing the deferral of \nU.S. tax on dividends paid by one foreign subsidiary to another located \nin a different country. The effect of this legislation will be to make \nit more attractive for a U.S. multinational to invest excess cash in a \nforeign subsidiary in any country except the United States of America. \nPayment to the U.S. parent would trigger the tax, but payment to an \naffiliated foreign subsidiary would remain tax deferred.\n  An example: If an American firm operating businesses in several \nforeign countries--let's say one of those was India and another was \nChina--if the Indian subsidiary earned substantial profits and the \ncompany was making the decision will I use those profits to reinvest in \nIndia, will I use those profits by bringing them back to the United \nStates in the form of a dividend to invest in the United States, or \nwill I move those profits to China, today the last two choices have the \nsame tax implications. U.S. tax will be paid if the money was brought \nback home or if the money was sent to China. Under this legislation, \nthe only time the tax will be paid is when it comes back to the United \nStates. If the exact same dollars go in the form of a dividend from \nIndia to China, there is no tax.\n\n  We are creating a very substantial new incentive for American \ncompanies to use their income earned outside the United States \nfrequently, as Senators Dorgan and Mikulski have just said, to create a \nplatform to export back into the United States. We are increasing the \nincentive to do so.\n  This bill includes a ``temporary period'' during which dividend \npayments from foreign affiliates to a U.S. parent receive a substantial \nreduction in their tax rate. The regular corporate tax rate is 35 \npercent. It would be reduced for an American corporation which has set \nup a subsidiary in a foreign country, has earned a profit in that \nforeign country, is going to send that profit back to the United \nStates. Instead of being subject to the normal tax of 35 percent, they \nwould only be subject to a tax of 5.75 percent.\n  This provision reduces Federal revenues by $3.8 billion over the next \n10 years. What are American working men and women going to get for \ntheir $3.8 billion? The rationale for this proposal is that reducing \nthe tax rate will encourage U.S. multinational companies to expatriate \nincome held offshore in order to make investments in the United States \nthat will create jobs.\n  Let me just point out one little practical fact. In order to take \nadvantage of this; that is, for a U.S. firm operating outside the \nUnited States to be able to repatriate a substantial amount of funds \nduring a narrow window of opportunity, it has to be a firm that has a \nsubstantial amount of cash on hand in order to be able to take \nadvantage of that. If they have been investing the profits they have \nearned offshore to expand their offshore operations, they will have \nlimited means by which to avail themselves of this opportunity.\n  My concern is that what we are really creating is a tax incentive for \ntax shelters because it is those tax shelters, as opposed to companies \nthat are actively engaged in the production of goods and services, that \nare the most likely firms to take advantage of this window. They are \nthe least likely firms to create jobs in the United States.\n  Another concern about this temporary window proposal is it will not \nbe very temporary. How many times have we heard in the Senate, when a \ntax cut has been passed but might not go into effect for several years \nin the future, and then today someone says, let's reconsider: was that \nreally a wise thing to do, to cut the tax rates beginning in the year \n2009? Should we not reevaluate that in the context of our current \ndeficit situation and the war and the other challenges America faces?\n  What is the response to that reasonable question? The response is, of \ncourse we should not consider it because if a tax is precluded that is \nalready on the books from staying on the books or going into effect at \na future date, do my colleagues know what has just happened? They have \nraised taxes, and that is the ultimate charge that can be made against \nan American politician.\n  Imagine what it is going to be like when this temporary window is \nready to expire and the same argument is made; if one does not vote for \nextending this window, preferably if they do not vote for making this \nwindow permanent, as the President is urging that we do, taxes have \nbeen raised.\n  Now, this is not a fanciful suggestion. In fact, this very bill \nincludes 21 tax provisions which when they were enacted were for a \nspecific time period, which has long since passed. Every year, as we \nget close to these tax provisions that are about to expire, we pass \nlegislation to extend them for yet a few more years.\n  For instance, in this bill we have a number of items that were \nintended to be for a specific duration that we are now going to extend \nsubstantially into the future. These include items such as the \ndeduction for electric vehicles, deduction for teachers' school \nexpenses--other items which may in and of themselves be worthy. But \nthey are illustrative of the difficulty of ever saying that something \nwhich was supposed to be temporary is, in fact, temporary.\n  If extended, the effect of this repatriation proposal will be to \ncreate a permanent reduced tax rate for U.S. multinationals' foreign \ninvestment, a tax rate which is 85-percent less than the tax rate that \nsame corporation would pay on income earned inside the United States. \nSo we have a dismal failure on goal No. 2, which is to avoid giving any \nfurther incentives to U.S. multinationals outsourcing jobs.\n  Goal No. 3 is to encourage the creation of jobs in the United States. \nThe primary provision for this encouragement is the creation of a U.S. \njob provision in the form of a manufacturers' deduction. As currently \nconstituted, this manufacturers' deduction, which is in this \nlegislation, will reduce Federal revenues by $65 billion over the next \n10 years. What are we getting for our $65 billion? The deduction is \ncomputed as a percentage of the employer's income from production \nactivities located within the United States.\n  The fact the deduction is based on income, however, creates the \nperverse effect of rewarding manufacturers that locate at least a \nportion of their operations in a low-cost jurisdiction outside the \nUnited States. When fully phased in, the deduction equals 9 percent of \nthe profit earned from production activities conducted in the United \nStates. To qualify for the deduction, the item must be produced, in \nwhole or a significant part, within the United States. The deduction \nhas some limitations. It is limited to an amount that equals 50 percent \nof the wages paid by the employer. To the extent that the taxpayer has \nmanufacturing operations outside the United States, the deduction is \nfurther reduced by the fraction representing the ratio of the firm's \nU.S. activity to its worldwide activities. These limitations, which are \nfrequently referred to as haircuts, are supposed to assure that the \nincentive is targeted at U.S. production.\n  However, they do not always work in that manner. Let me show a couple \nof charts as to how this provision, the 9-percent manufacturers' \ndeduction, is likely to work in real life.\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\n  The first chart is a simple explanation of how the deduction is \ncomputed. In this example, the firm has all of its production \noperations located inside the United States. It earns $100 in sales for \nits products. It incurs costs totaling $70 to produce them. The costs, \n$70, are distributed as follows: materials cost $40, wages inside the \nUnited States cost $27, other wages, $3. That is a total of $70.\n  The company's profit is $30. Its manufacturers' deduction is computed \nas a percentage of that income. At the fully phased-in rate of 9 \npercent, the deduction would equal $2.70 to that firm.\n  Let's look at how the manufacturers' deduction is computed if the \ntaxpayer outsources a share of its manufacturing in order to reduce \nlabor costs. Chart No. 2 illustrates the effect of this change.\n  In this example, 80 percent of the firm's manufacturing occurs \noffshore, which results in a 90-percent reduction in its manufacturing \nwages. The firm still earns the $100 that it did in the first example; \nthat is $100 on the sale of its product, but its costs are \nsubstantially lower than the $70 in the first example. In this case, \nthe materials continue to cost $40, manufacturing wages in the United \nStates have dropped to $5 since a substantial amount of the cost of \nproduction, not including materials, has now moved outside the United \nStates to a low-wage area. Foreign manufacturing wages are $7. So what \nthis firm used to pay $27 to get--the manufacturing labor to assemble \nits products--is now getting it for $12. The other wages in the United \nStates continue at $3.\n  The firm's profit, therefore, is dramatically improved by moving its \noperation or a substantial portion of its operation outside the United \nStates. It now earns a profit, instead of $30, of $45.\n  Under the general rule, the manufacturers' deduction would be 9 \npercent of $45, which would be $4.05. However, there is this separate \nlimitation that you cannot have a deduction that is more than half your \nU.S. wages. In this instance, U.S. wages for manufacturing are $5, \nother wages paid in the United States are $3, for a total of $8; 50 \npercent of $8 is $4. So the firm would get a $4 tax deduction as a \nresult of this procedure.\n  The result is this: As a result of moving significant parts of its \noperation outside the United States, this firm was able to qualify for \na greater tax incentive under this bill than they would if they had \nkept their operation in the United States. They get a $2.70 deduction \nby keeping the operation in the United States; they get a $4 deduction \nby moving it offshore.\n  Some of the sponsors of this legislation may argue there is another \nhaircut in these limitations and that is because a firm cannot qualify \nfor the deduction unless the goods are produced ``in whole or in \nsignificant part by the taxpayer within the United States.'' They will \nargue that a firm that utilizes foreign sources to provide 80 percent \nof the production activity will not meet that standard.\n  We cannot be assured of that because nowhere in this legislation is \nthe term ``in significant part'' defined for most products. In fact, a \nfirm doesn't have to move anything near 80 percent of its production \noffshore to get the benefit of this deduction. In my example, using the \nsame numbers but modified to reflect one-quarter of production being \nmoved offshore, this would still yield a greater tax incentive than \nkeeping 100 percent of the production in the United States.\n  Let me repeat that. If a firm keeps 75 percent of its production in \nthe United States, moves 25 percent abroad, under this calculation it \nwill get a $3.15 deduction against its U.S. income tax versus if it \nkeeps 100 percent in the United States it will get a $2.70 deduction.\n  Does that make common sense? It was certainly contemplated that some \nportion of the final product's production could occur outside the \nUnited States. Otherwise, the statute would have been drafted without \nthe reference to ``significant part.'' It would have required that all \nthe production be in the United States in order to qualify. It would \nhave been drafted so it applies only to goods solely produced in the \nUnited States.\n\n  My concern is the new deduction created by this legislation will \nprovide U.S. employers with a positive incentive to move a larger \namount of their production offshore. The sponsors will also argue the \nextent of offshore production activity is conducted by a subsidiary of \nthe U.S. taxpayer. The deduction will be reduced proportionately as a \nresult of the haircut. My example, however, does not assume an \naffiliate of the taxpayer is conducting the offshore activity. In fact, \nit assumes what is the predominant reality, that manufacturing \nbusinesses inside the United States contract with manufacturers outside \nthe United States to provide component parts. So there is no affiliated \nrelationship other than a contract between the U.S. manufacturer and \nthe foreign producer of the products. The haircut--although it is \nwidely cited as a means by which these kinds of abuses will be \nrestrained--does nothing to protect the job of unaffiliated U.S. \nsuppliers.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this new incentive will reduce the revenues \nof the Federal Government by $65 billion over the next 10 years and \nwill have the perverse effect of actually creating yet another \nincentive to move jobs out of the United States.\n  As my examples indicate, I don't think this is a piece of legislation \nthat can be defended as spending American taxpayers' dollars in the \nmost efficient manner possible to create jobs in America. There is a \nbetter approach. To provide the most effective tax incentive for job \ncreation, we should link the benefits more specifically to the title of \nthis bill, JOBS. Our proposal is to exchange the bill's incentive based \non profits with an incentive based on jobs. Our proposal would redirect \nthe $60 billion raised by repealing the ETI and the $37 billion \ncurrently directed to the international tax changes and use those funds \nto create an income tax credit. That credit would be used to partially \noffset the payroll taxes paid by U.S. manufacturing employers.\n  One of the true disincentives imposed by the Federal Government on \njob maintenance and creation in the United States is the fact we impose \na 7.6 percent tax on the employer for his employees which then becomes \nthe payroll tax that then supports Social Security and Medicare. I am \nnot proposing we do anything to the payments that are made into the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust fund. Rather, what I am suggesting \nis we take the now almost $100 billion we will have over 10 years, and \nuse it in the form of a credit whereby it incorporates for all of its \nemployees the first $35,000 of earnings, and will be able to deduct a \ncredit which would amount to approximately 20 percent of the payroll \ntaxes paid by the employer, or a 1.66 percentage point against their \ncorporate income tax.\n  The employers who qualify for this new incentive are the same ones \nwho would have benefited under the manufacturers' deduction. The \ndifference is our proposal bases the incentive on American jobs, not on \nprofits. The difference is our proposal does not create the incentive. \nAs this chart indicates, we are creating additional outsourcing of \nAmerican jobs if we use the almost $100 billion in the manner the \nunderlying legislation directs.\n  It seems to me to be a much better approach to link the benefit to \njobs rather than to link the benefit to profits, and one which has a \nmuch greater likelihood of achieving the goal of creating jobs in the \nUnited States.\n\n  A fourth goal of this legislation, and one I have been very \ninterested in, is the simplification of the Tax Code. Several years ago \nI suggested to the Finance Committee attempting to simplify the United \nStates Tax Code, all 17,000 pages of it, at one time is a task no one \nhas the life expectancy, nor do their children nor probably their \ngrandchildren, to see through to accomplishment. Therefore, we ought to \nbreak down the Tax Code into its constituent parts and try to simplify \neach part at a time, in a rational, sequenced basis. I further \nsuggested these international tax rules would be a good place to start.\n  I am pleased to say under the leadership of Chairman Grassley and \nRanking Member Baucus, we started on that path. The Finance Committee \nhas established a working group to study our international tax rules \nwith the goal of simplifying. This product is one of the results of \nthat effort at simplification. However, I suggest this legislation\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\nmisses the mark by a wide range in terms of simplifying the income tax \nlaw. In fact, it would add another 378 pages to the income tax law. We \nare starting with the goal of simplification and we are substantially \nincreasing the quantity and the complexity of the income tax code.\n  Goal No. 5 is to minimize extraneous tax matters that detract from \nthe purpose of this legislation. We are going to spend $170 billion \nover 10 years to create jobs in America. We ought to be concerned we \nare spending that $170 billion for that purpose and spending it as \neffectively as possible.\n  In an effort to conclude action on this legislation and secure the \nmaximum number of votes, there has been an open encouragement to \nSenators to file amendments to this bill on smaller tax changes they \nwould like to see adopted. I am confident many of these are worthy and \ncould be supported on their merits. But we are never going to have a \ndiscussion of their merits because now they are buried in two so-called \nmanagers' amendments inside this legislation. Many of them have \nrelatively little or zero relationship to creating jobs in the United \nStates.\n  Let me mention a few of those. There is a tax break for Oldsmobile \ndealers. I am certain they are facing some distress as General Motors \ncanceled that line of Oldsmobiles. Does it deserve to be in a JOBS bill \nand carry a cost of $189 million over 10 years?\n  There is capital gains relief for owners of horses. I assume that is \ngood for the owners, and may be good for the horses. It costs $64 \nmillion over 10 years.\n  There is a tax break for the makers of distilled spirits. That might \nmake some of our people happier, but whether it will get them a job is \nless certain. That costs us $484 million over 10 years.\n  There is a tax-exempt bond proposal for purchase of forest land. I \nhappen to think purchase of forest land is probably a good idea, but is \nit the place to spend $252 million over 10 years to create jobs in \nAmerica?\n  There are tax credits for costs incurred for railroad track \nmaintenance. Again, it may be a good idea, but it is questionable as to \nwhether $492 million we will spend over the next 10 years will create a \nrequisite number of American jobs.\n  Then there are tax breaks for amounts received under the Student Loan \nRepayment Program for the National Health Service Corps. That is $54 \nmillion over 10 years.\n  In the spirit of full disclosure, the bill includes proposals which \nmyself and my staff have worked with the Finance Committee to include \nin this legislation. One such proposal delays the implementation of \nregulations governing the exclusion of income from the international \noperation of ships and aircraft. That has an $8 million cost over 10 \nyears.\n  Another provision is the extension of the credit for producing \nelectricity from biomass. That lowers Federal tax revenues by $4.2 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  These additional provisions have obviously expanded the cost of the \nbill and the purpose of the bill. So the amendment I have offered would \ndo essentially the following:\n  One, it would repeal ETI. That is the issue that brought us here in \nthe first place. Second, it would repeal the changes in international \ntax law, many of which will give further incentives to moving jobs \noffshore. Third, it will repeal most of the targeted tax cuts. It will \nthen take the money that has been saved from the ETI, from not adopting \nthe 9-percent corporate tax deduction, and from the individual items, \nand use it to finance a serious effort at reducing the payroll tax cost \nto the employer and, thereby, reducing a significant disincentive to \nmaintaining and hiring people in jobs in America.\n  I close by describing the choices we are making in this legislation. \nWe are going to spend $170 billion over 10 years, or rounded to $17 \nbillion per year. What could we do with $17 billion if we did not use \nit in a targeted and effective means to create jobs for U.S. men and \nwomen?\n  Well, $17 billion would reduce this year's projected Federal deficit \nby about 4 percent, not an insignificant amount. The $17 billion would \nfully fund No Child Left Behind, plus it would fund veterans health \ncare and the FIRE and SAFER grant programs that provide critical \nassistance to our Nation's first responders. All of those could be \npurchased for $17 billion.\n  Mr. President, $17 billion would be more than we spend annually on \nPell grants, to assure access to higher education for our young people.\n  Now more than ever, we need to make sure the money we spend will \nachieve the results we seek. I have set forth the reasons why I do not \nbelieve the incentives in the underlying bill will protect or will \npromote U.S. jobs. The proposals in the underlying bill target profits \nin the hopes that profits will trickle down and create jobs.\n  The amendment Senator Dayton and I have offered is a better approach \nbecause it specifically targets U.S. jobs. Firms will get a bigger tax \nbreak to the extent they employ more U.S. workers. Since U.S. jobs are \nthe goal of this legislation--U.S. JOBS is the title of this \nlegislation--our approach should be adopted. The working men and women \nof America will appreciate this action by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time is left under Senator Graham's \namendment on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On your side, 16 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will claim the 5 minutes we have under \nmorning business. It is all part of the order of the Senate already. \nThen I will yield to my friend from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                            Chain of Command\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Presiding Officer stands for many \nthings, but, in my mind, one of the things you stand for is what is \ngood about the United States military: A person who put himself in \nharm's way, with his brother, and has created a story that is \nintriguing and interesting and shows the bravery of the Presiding \nOfficer in a time of crisis.\n  Mr. President, you are the role model for the troops we have in Iraq \ntoday. Our men and women there are fighting valiantly, and each day \nfind themselves in harm's way, in many different avenues.\n  I came to the Senate floor this morning and talked about how I felt--\nthis Senator--on last Thursday I had been misled and not treated \nfairly. We had a briefing up in 407, and we had the Secretary of \nDefense there. As I indicated this morning, we had enough brass to fill \na brass band. We had four-star generals. We had the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. I do not want all the blame focused on Secretary \nRumsfeld. I feel those military officers should have told Democratic \nand Republican Senators last Thursday what was going to break on ``60 \nMinutes'' that night. I feel terribly misled and disappointed in their \nnot doing that.\n  I say that because by their not telling us what was going to come \nout--certainly all or most of them knew something was going to come \nout; and if they did not know, they should have known--each Senator was \nblindsided.\n  Now, Mr. President, the reason I mentioned you as a role model for \nthe troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the rest of the world is \nvirtually every man and woman serving in the military does the right \nthing. Obviously, from the photographs and information we have, some of \nthem did not. But I do not want just the enlisted men, so to speak, to \nbe the scapegoats for what has obviously transpired. There is a chain \nof command, and there is responsibility in that chain of command.\n  I am terribly disappointed what went on in 407 with the chain of \ncommand, and so I do not want my remarks at all to reflect adversely on \nthe fighting men and women of this country--the Pat Tillmans of our \ncountry. There are lots of Pat Tillmans. We admire and respect him so \nmuch because he gave up a multimillion-dollar contract to go fight in \nthe war. But lots of other people gave up lots of things to go fight in \nthese wars, and there are lots of Pat Tillmans. I admire him and his \nfamily and his brother, who went in with him, as your brother went in \nwith you.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope the chain of command understands their \nresponsibility and does not try to pass the buck off on these people \nwho needed, obviously, supervision and control.\n\n  I think also we have to take a look at what is going on in Iraq today \nwith the so-called security guards who are being hired, because it is \nobvious some wrong\n\n[[Page S4878]]\n\ntook place there as a result of what they did.\n  I appreciate my friend from Minnesota allowing me to speak prior to \nhim. The Senator now has 16 minutes under the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I certainly support the statement of the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3112\n\n  Mr. President, we are referring to the JOBS Act, and to Senator \nGraham's excellent amendment. I am very proud to be a cosponsor and to \nhave this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Graham-Dayton \namendment. As Senator Graham pointed out to our colleagues, this bill \nis called the JOBS Act. In fact, in the House, they call it the \nAmerican JOBS Act because, as we all know, we are missing a lot of jobs \nin America today. Over 8 million Americans are out of work. Many have \nexhausted their unemployment benefits because they cannot find work \nanywhere.\n  This amendment offered by Senator Graham would make the bill live up \nto its name. You could call it the ``Put the Jobs Into the JOBS Act'' \namendment. It also would put the truth into that title. Because the \ntruth now is most of this bill has nothing to do with providing jobs--\nat least not American jobs. It provides additional tax cuts to already \nprofitable corporations, whether they provide jobs or not.\n  According to a recent Washington Post article on the bill, it is:\n\n       One of the most complex, special-interest riddled corporate \n     tax bills in years, lawmakers, Senate aides, and tax \n     lobbyists say. The 930 page epic is packed with $170 billion \n     in tax cuts aimed at cruise ship operators, foreign dog-race \n     gamblers, NASCAR track owners, bow-and-arrow makers, and \n     Oldsmobile dealers, to name a few.\n\n  Continuing on to quote the article:\n\n       Even one of the tax lobbyists involved in drafting it \n     conceded that the bill ``has risen to a new level of \n     sleaze.''\n\n  I think that is quite instructive in its statement: ``even one of the \ntax lobbyists involved in drafting it.'' I am not on the Senate Finance \nCommittee. I am told that committee, as the Appropriations Committee, \nrequires many years of seniority before someone can gain access to it, \nso I don't know what goes on in the drafting of legislation. But when \nthe article says tax lobbyists were involved in drafting the bill that \nis before us or, as my colleague Senator Graham said, drafting the \nadditions to this bill that are not before us, that are in the so-\ncalled managers' amendments which are not disclosed to those of us \nvoting, which are not disclosed to the American people, then there is \nsomething pretty putrid in that process.\n  In fact, the provisions the article mentions, questionable as they \nare, are not even the worst provisions in the legislation. This bill \ncontains over $39 billion worth of tax advantages to American \nbusinesses and investors for their foreign operations. At a time when \nwe say we are concerned about losing American jobs to foreign \nbusinesses,--and we should be concerned; we should be alarmed--this \nbill would make it more profitable and thus more appealing to expand \nforeign businesses instead of ones in the United States. Why in the \nworld would we want to do that? Most of these provisions are rich man's \ntax avoidance games and gimmicks.\n  For example, U.S. businesses or individuals can claim a tax credit \nunder U.S. taxes equal to any foreign taxes they have paid. A tax \ncredit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of the tax that \nis owed. So this arrangement means the U.S. Treasury gets paid last. If \nsome company here owes the French Government $100 in taxes and the U.S. \nGovernment $150 in taxes, the company pays the French Government the \n$100 it owes and it only pays the U.S. Government $50. If foreign taxes \nwere treated as a business expense, like any other cost of doing \nbusiness, the loss to the U.S. Treasury would be far less severe. But \nthis bill goes even further in the other direction. This would allow \nthe company or business or the individual to be able to use those \nforeign tax credits for 20 years into the future in order to reduce \ntheir future U.S. taxes owed.\n  Most U.S. citizens can't do that. A farmer with additional revenues, \nprofits in a good year, a salesman with high sales and, therefore, high \ncommissions has to pay higher taxes on his or her income for that year. \nThey can't finagle their incomes and expenses over the next 20 years to \nlower their tax liabilities. As I said, these are rich man's games and \ngimmicks.\n  The other foreign tax breaks are pretty much the same. They are just \nmore ways to avoid paying U.S. taxes owed on U.S. profits or income, \nmore special treatment for businesses in other countries, employing \nworkers in those other countries, jobs, many of which used to be here \nin this country for American workers. We are going to reward those \nactions even more than we have already, at a cost of $39 billion to the \nU.S. Treasury over the next 10 years, at a time when the Federal \nGovernment is running annual deficits of over $500 billion.\n  This bill purports to be revenue neutral. In other words, the tax \nincreases equal or offset the tax reductions. Well, yes and no. As \nusual around here, with all the smart Members and staffs, and I guess \nthe tax lobbyists who write their special interest tax cuts into the \nbill, some curious revenue increases are cited. Some are actually good \npublic policy--the elimination of tax shelters, offshore and domestic--\nsome are questionable. Some of the so-called revenue gains are simply \ndownright curious.\n\n  For example, over $17 billion of revenue gains is cited from \nextending customs user fees over the next 10 years. That is something \nwe obviously should do and will do. There are existing fees now, and we \nwill extend them over the life of the 10 years that this is scored for \nbudget purposes. We haven't done it yet. But that is a continuation of \nthe status quo; yet that is being counted as if it were new tax revenue \nfor the purposes of this bill to offset some of these new tax breaks \nfor foreign subsidiaries and operations.\n  We are adding vaccines for hepatitis A to the list of taxable \nvaccines, $87 million over 10 years. I don't myself understand the \nreason for that.\n  We are limiting charitable contributions of ``patents or similar \nproperty'' to their cost basis to the donor. ``Similar property'' is \nopen to interpretation, but it requires some kind of fairly broad \ninterpretation because the revenue gains expected over the decade are \n$4 billion. These are charitable contributions. So if an artist, for \nexample, paints a painting, a well-known artist, the cost basis of that \nactual picture--the materials, the canvas and the paints and the like--\nthe actual cost of it is quite low. The value of it might be worth tens \nof thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars. The cost \nbasis, if it is just the materials, is going to be a huge disincentive \nfor people who are in that situation to donate their creations, patents \nto nonprofit charitable organizations. We are going to gain $4 billion \nfrom doing that.\n  Another of the revenue gains repeals the 10 percent rehabilitation \ncredit for nonhistoric buildings. That is going to generate $1 billion \nin revenues. In Minnesota, there aren't many buildings old enough to be \n``historic,'' but rehabilitation of other buildings that are \ndilapidated is certainly a worthwhile public purpose. Yet we are \nincorporating these kinds of tax increases to offset tax breaks we are \nproviding for foreign business operations. That doesn't make any sense \nto me at all.\n  Senator Graham has discussed very well--and I won't repeat his \ncomments--the advantages of this amendment over the existing bill for \ncreating American jobs, jobs in the United States for American workers. \nThat is what we need. That is what the bill purports to be. That is \nwhat we ought to be doing.\n  This bill, as it relates to domestic manufacturers, is a general tax \nreduction. It requires them to do nothing in return. That is a lot \nbetter than providing tax breaks to foreign operations and subsidiaries \nand the investors in them, but it is not good enough. American \nbusinesses reported record profits in the fourth quarter of last year, \n$76 billion in the quarter, above the previous record profits of $70 \nbillion in the third quarter of last year. Overall corporate profits \nwere up 20 percent last year from the year before. Now we are coming \nout of a recession.\n  That is great news for America. That is not uniform across the board, \nbut that shows a very healthy profit picture for most American \nbusinesses and\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\none that, unfortunately, has not translated into the job increases we \nwould expect to see, given that kind of profitability and coming out of \na recession and employment contraction. That is what this bill should \nbe focused on.\n  That is what the Graham amendment does, which is why I am glad to be \na cosponsor. It provides incentive and a reward for providing American \njobs. If do you that, you get the benefit. If you don't do that, you \ndon't get the benefit because you don't need it right now.\n  Between 1996 and 2000, 71 percent of the foreign companies doing \nbusiness in the United States reported no U.S. tax liability at all. \nSixty-one percent of U.S.-controlled corporations during that time, \nthose 5 years from 1996 to 2000, also reported no U.S. tax liability.\n  In the year 2000, 82 percent of large U.S. corporations reported a \nU.S. tax liability of less than 5 percent of their income; 76 percent \nof large foreign-controlled companies reported U.S. tax liability of \nless than 5 percent of their income. These large corporations are not \novertaxed. Some of them are not taxed at all. Now, with these foreign \ncredits that extend forward for 20 years, not only will they not pay \ntaxes, they will be owed rebates.\n  This has to be the theater of the absurd. We are giving away tax \nrevenues for outyears--especially from 2008 to 2013, which is where \nthis bill is backloaded--that we don't have, that we are going to be \nshort of to do the things we have committed to do, that will add up and \nextend beyond that to a point in time that it will add to the crisis we \nare going to face in the following decade fiscally. We are doing all \nthat for no reason whatsoever, except that someone said the tax \nlobbyists have had their field day and they got this riddled into the \nbill.\n  We are trying to get it out so it can be put to use for the American \nworkers, and especially those who want to be American workers, who \ndon't have jobs and have paid taxes on what they have earned, whatever \namount that may be, and are looking for a job and will pay taxes on \nthat. We should not be getting into more tax avoidance schemes to send \njobs overseas. That is what the Graham amendment would prevent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator has 3 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. First, I want to clarify a statement I made at \nthe conclusion of my remarks. The individual tax items I referred to \nare included in a managers' amendment. They are not part of the \namendment that I have offered as a replacement essentially for the \nlegislation. They are not dealt with.\n  Mr. President, we have a very serious issue. I see that we have been \njoined by the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley. I \ngot to know a lot about highways last year. I visited on two or three \noccasions Ottumwa, IA, which is in the southeast corner of the State. \nSenator Grassley knows the statistics a lot better than I do. If I \nmisstate them, he can correct me.\n  By the end of World War II, Ottumwa had a population of more than \n30,000 people, which was a combination of a strong agricultural economy \nand a growing number of industrial plants, many of which provided parts \nfor other industries, such as a company that provides parts for Deere \nTractor, another Iowa firm. In 2003, the population had slipped to \nbelow 25,000, and much of that job loss was due to the fact those \nplants of 150 to 500 people had picked up and left. Maybe they left for \nMexico or for China, but they were not in Ottumwa, IA, anymore.\n  When you talked to people in that town, whether it was the clerk \nregistering you into the motel or the person who was bringing you your \ndinner, you heard a lot about the pain that was coming from that loss \nof a job base, the loss of the future, and the loss of the children of \nOttumwa, as they began to question whether they had a future there.\n  I don't believe it is the role of the Government to stand up and hold \nback the tide of normal economic flows. The fact is, capitalism is a \nvery aggressive form of economy. Companies go out of business; \ncompanies come into business; companies make decisions as to where they \ncan be the most successful. I don't believe we should socialize our \neconomy in an attempt to avoid that. We are not talking about \naffirmative socialization. We are talking about, through the Tax Code, \nwhat I would call incentivized socialization. We are trying to affect \nthe decision that company in Ottumwa makes by saying it will be more \nprofitable for them to take these 250 jobs and move them out of the \nUnited States.\n  This legislation, I am sad to say, adds to those incentives. I don't \nthink that is what we should do in a bill that has as its title \n``JOBS.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I respond in a specific way to \nthe amendment before us, everything Senator Graham said about Ottumwa, \nIA, is accurate, I believe. Obviously, when anyone in America loses a \njob, it is a very personal hurt to that individual, particularly if \nthey liked their job and if they had been in that job for a long period \nof time, and particularly if they were older people and not looking to \nretrain or even spend the time and investment in retraining.\n  So considering those personal hurts, and not without proper regard \nfor the economic consequences of people hurt by being laid off, it is a \nsimple matter, not only in the United States but all over the world, \nthat there are less jobs in manufacturing than previously. It is mostly \nbecause of the enhanced productivity in manufacturing. When people can \nget machines to do work that individuals do, obviously, that enhances \nproductivity and it is done for the sole purpose of being more accurate \nand cutting down on the number of jobs--also, not to denigrate \nproductivity, because productivity being enhanced is the only way in \nAmerica or anyplace else in the world you are going to increase the \nstandard of living of Americans.\n  When you increase productivity, people become more productive, they \nearn more money, and their standard of living goes up. We want that for \neverybody. So enhancing productivity is very basic to the increasing of \nthe standard of living.\n  Now, there are fewer jobs in manufacturing today than there have ever \nbeen. But manufacturing is still a very major component of our economy. \nIt is still around 15, 16 percent of our economy, I believe. If you go \nback 40 or 50 years, it was probably 20 or 21 percent of the economy. \nBut there was a period of time when we lost 2 million jobs in \nmanufacturing during the 1980s, and we still had manufacturing as 20 \npercent of the economy. So manufacturing is very important, but it is \nmaintaining its importance with less jobs doing the work that needs to \nbe done to manufacture whatever we want in America.\n  Now, several times on this issue I have quoted former Secretary of \nLabor Reich from the Clinton administration. He is now a professor at \nHarvard, I believe. He wrote on December 26 of last year in the Wall \nStreet Journal about the problems of manufacturing and declining \nemployment in manufacturing. Secretary Reich pointed out that, yes, \nAmerica has 10-percent fewer jobs in manufacturing now than they did in \nthe previous benchmark. But he also pointed out during that same period \nof time, whereas the United States lost 10 percent of their \nmanufacturing jobs, China had lost 15 percent of their jobs in \nmanufacturing. So you see, even though we are legitimately concerned \nabout outsourcing of manufacturing going to China, we are also seeing \nChina finding ways to be more efficient in their manufacturing.\n  It is quite obvious, if you look at this historically, that this is \nprogress: enhancing productivity to raise wages to raise the standard \nof living.\n  This is not the era of Luddites, when people are going to go into \nfactories and smash machinery because they think it is taking jobs away \nfrom people. If the Luddite philosophy were legitimate, we would still \nbe making the common pin by hand.\n  We are producing by machine so we can enhance productivity to enhance \nwages to enhance the standard of living. The American people would not \nbe satisfied today with 96 percent of the American population being on \nfarms, as it was in 1790 when this country was a brand new country. \nToday about 2 percent of the people in the United States are producing \nthe food for the\n\n[[Page S4880]]\n\nother 98 percent, and each farmer produces for 145 people. The United \nStates exports about 40 percent of its food and farm products, because \nwe cannot consume it domestically.\n  Whether it is in manufacturing or whether it is in farming, if 5 \npercent of the market is the American people, then we are not going to \nhave a very high standard of living. The other 95 percent of the market \nare the people outside the United States of America. If we still had 96 \npercent of the people in America involved in farming, we would have a \nsubsistence level of livelihood.\n  We have to accept the fact that every month in America, 7 million \njobs go out of existence and 7 million new jobs come into existence. In \nthat process, people are more productive, make higher wages, and have a \nhigher standard of living, and not just for some of our people but for \nall of our people.\n  The only people in America who might not have a higher standard of \nliving are those we have kept down, and this Congress is responsible \nfor keeping welfare recipients down, keeping them out of mind, out of \nsight to the edge of society. But we established a principle of welfare \nreform in 1996 to move people from the edge of society in welfare to \nthe world of work, to the mainstream of American society, because it is \nin the world of work where they have opportunities for enhanced \nproductivity, for enhanced wages that will raise their standard of \nliving. Except for welfare recipients, people in the world of work are \nproducing more now than before to enhance their standard of living.\n  It seems to me that when we have 7 million jobs going out of \nexistence 1 month and 7 million new jobs coming into existence in the \nsame month, it says better than anything I can say about how rapidly \nour economy is changing, much more rapidly today than ever in the \nhistory of our country. It might even change more rapidly in the \nfuture.\n  For people who abhor the fact that we are losing manufacturing jobs, \nthen you have to ask, what do we do to maintain those manufacturing \njobs? The basic bill we are dealing with, the jobs and manufacturing \nbill, tries to do it two ways: one, to staunch the bleeding in jobs \nleaving manufacturing. It is enhanced now because we have a European \ntax on our exports to Europe so that our manufacturers cannot be \ncompetitive in Europe and, hence, people are being laid off.\n  That European tax on our exports is legal and started in March. We \nstarted debating this bill in March. We could have had this bill passed \nin March. We could have had the European tax behind us because once we \npass this legislation, there is no legal basis for their putting the \ntax on our exports to their country.\n\n  In the same vein, the jobs a manufacturing bill will reduce the level \nof taxation on corporations from 35 percent down to 32 percent. One of \nthe reasons we lose jobs in manufacturing to the global competition is \nthat our cost to capital is very high in relationship to our global \ncompetition. So in reducing the corporate tax by 3 percent and doing it \nin a revenue-neutral way so it does not worsen the deficit, we have an \nopportunity to create jobs in manufacturing, make what jobs we have \nmore secure, and continue to enhance the productivity of workers in \nAmerica.\n  I hope we remember that we do have a rapidly changing society. Our \npeople welcome an enhanced standard of living that comes from increased \nwages, which comes from increased productivity. And they want that to \ncontinue. That is why I am concerned about the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Florida that is before us. That is why I am going to ask my \ncolleagues to consider my views on this amendment and, hopefully, \ndisagree with Senator Graham and defeat the amendment and move on and \nget this bill passed. That 5-percent tax put on in March, increased to \n6 percent in April, and it is 7 percent now in May. It is going to be \n12 percent by election time. Are we going to continue to have an \nenvironment where people can be laid off?\n  Senator Graham may have an idea that is legitimate to discuss, but \nright now in the environment we are in, in which there is an increasing \nburden put on our exports to Europe, it seems to me we ought to forgo \nthis discussion, which ought to come at another time when Senator \nGraham's amendment could fit in. We need to get this legislation \npassed. This legislation is a bipartisan bill. Not often do we get this \nbipartisan cooperation in the Senate. We ought to take it and run with \nit.\n  His amendment proposes to enact a new wage tax credit and pay for it \nby striking the manufacturing rate cut--that cut from 35 percent down \nto 32 percent about which I just spoke--and he would also strike all of \nthe international provisions that are in this bill, international \nprovisions to which we try to bring a more rational approach to the \ntaxation of American business in international trade.\n  Evidently, the Senator from Florida believes a payroll tax credit \nthat reduces employer contributions to the Social Security trust fund \nwill create more jobs than a manufacturing rate cut. Payroll tax \ncredits have long been controversial. I always thought market demand \nand the ability to compete in that market is what created jobs. If an \nemployer sees an opportunity and goes after that opportunity, then they \nwill add employees to meet demand, but I do not see how a tax credit \ncreates market opportunity.\n  I thought that tax relief, tax reductions, and the lower burden \nimposed by having the Government as a silent business partner is what \nenhances a company's competitiveness, which then in turn would lead to \nmore opportunity.\n  This JOBS bill before us now contains a 3-point reduction in \ncorporate tax for manufacturing, not across the board. The chart behind \nme shows the corporate tax rates on manufacturing income for the \nEuropean Union and for the United States. I thought this chart would be \ninteresting for comparison since the United States and the European \nUnion are both highly developed wage and skilled countries.\n  This chart shows that on average the European Union tax rate on \nmanufacturing is 21 percent, while that in the United States is 24 \npercent. That is averages. So do not get that confused with the 35 down \nto the 32 I am talking about.\n  It is necessary to pass this 3-point reduction in corporate tax rates \nwhich is in this JOBS bill to keep the United States even with these \nEuropean countries. So being a believer that competitiveness breeds job \ngrowth, I fail to see how a wage credit in lieu of a tax cut can \nproduce more jobs if U.S. manufacturers remain burdened with a \nsignificantly higher rate of tax than their main competitors.\n  After arriving on the Senate floor, I received a copy of a ``dear \ncolleague'' letter from Senator Graham of Florida and Senator Dayton of \nMinnesota. That letter says production outsourced to a foreign country \nqualifies for manufacturing deduction.\n  That is not right. Our bill does not do that. The 3-point rate cut \nonly applies to income from U.S.-based manufacturing. It does not apply \nto foreign manufacturing of any type. So the fundamental premise of the \nGraham amendment is in error.\n  Senator Graham also implies contract manufacturing qualifies for the \nmanufacturing deduction. This is not correct. We specifically rejected \nallowing a company to take a deduction for manufacturing that someone \nelse does for them, regardless of whether the contract manufacturer is \nlocated in the United States or offshore.\n  If we allowed contract manufacturing to qualify, it would be a double \ndip. We were lobbied on this and we rejected that. So, again, a \nfundamental assumption of the amendment is in error.\n  The Senator from Florida also criticizes the wage limitation. This \nlimit is there to ensure manufacturing jobs are created. If they do not \ngrow jobs, then their manufacturing deduction is diminished. If their \nassembly lines are filled with robots instead of people, then the \ndeduction is limited. So if one wants more hiring, this is the way to \nget it done. That is what the wage limit accomplishes.\n  All of the fundamentals underlying his amendment are in error. I \nthink they are a mischaracterization of the underlying bill.\n  There is, however, an even more disturbing aspect of the amendment \nbefore us. Senators have heard me come to the floor many times to talk \nabout the bipartisan development of the JOBS bill. Its construction \nbegan when Senator Baucus was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. \nSenator\n\n[[Page S4881]]\n\nBaucus held hearings in July 2002 to address the FSC/ETI controversy \nwithin the World Trade Organization.\n  During this hearing, Senator Graham of Florida, now on the Senate \nfloor with us, and Senator Hatch as well, expressed concern about how \nour international tax laws were impairing the competitiveness of U.S. \ncompanies. After some discussion on forming a blue ribbon commission to \nstudy this problem, we all decided decisive action was more important \nthan setting up a commission.\n\n  During that hearing, Chairman Baucus formed an international tax \nworking group that was joined by Senator Graham, Senator Hatch, and \nthis Senator. This bipartisan Finance Committee working group formed \nthe basis for the bill that is now before us.\n  There is not one provision in this JOBS bill that was not agreed to \nby both Republicans and Democrats, not one. But today a member of that \nbipartisan working group offers an amendment that would destroy this \nbipartisan consensus on the provisions of the JOBS bill.\n  Why? The JOBS bill includes the international tax simplification \nmeasures that were recommended in the Joint Committee on Taxation April \n2001 report on tax simplification. There was no constituency for these \nsimplifications. No governmental affairs representative came to our \noffice to advocate for them.\n  No, the person who asked for them was the Senator from Florida. \nSenator Graham emphasized the desire to include these simplification \nmeasures in the bill, and we did that. The Senator from Florida \npreferred simplification over restructuring and wanted the emphasis of \nour bill to be on foreign tax credit reforms. We honored his views \nbecause that is what our bill does in the bipartisan spirit of this \nlegislation.\n  That Senator expressed concern about the 90-percent foreign tax \ncredit limit on AMT, the alternative minimum tax, and he wanted the 10-\n50 basket problems solved. We did both of these things in this bill.\n  The Senator from Florida even sought reductions on a number of \nforeign tax credit baskets, but the working group decided that was too \nsignificant of an international change to be accepted by the full \nSenate. I hope when we vote on this amendment the Senator will back up \nour decision on that because this bill was reported out of committee on \na bipartisan 19-to-2 vote. The Senator from Florida voted for this bill \nin the Finance Committee.\n  Today, these priorities are no longer important. To me, this is very \nconfusing and it is quite a difficult development for me to understand.\n  As I have said before, we acted in the best of faith to produce a \nbill that protects American manufacturing jobs and ensures our \ncompanies remain the global competitors we want them to be. We did this \nin a fully bipartisan manner. That is what the American people expect \nus to do on such an important issue as manufacturing jobs and our \nnational economic health.\n  As a practical matter, the only way to get a bill through this Senate \nis to do it in a bipartisan way. But these efforts are apparently not \nenough or we would not have this amendment before us.\n  I hope we can defeat this amendment and move on because Senator \nBaucus and I have a real sense of optimism that this week there is very \ndefinitely an optimistic point of view, particularly from the other \nside, that this legislation needs to be passed and that considering the \nfact we spent considerable time on it in March, and some time on it in \nApril, and we have had these European taxes going on our exports, \ngrowing 1 percent a month. It is a bad situation.\n  We hope the optimism we sensed yesterday will be repeated today, and \none way to help us along is to help us defeat this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Who yields time? Does the Senator \nfrom Iowa yield time to the Senator from Montana?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield to the Senator from Montana whatever time he \nmight consume. I have not asked other people on my side if they want \ntime.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will not consume it all.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield whatever time the Senator may consume.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I have a couple of points. I very much appreciate the \nefforts of the Senator from Florida in the amendment he has offered. He \nclearly is trying to address a problem that is very acute in this \ncountry, which is job loss. He is also attempting to address it in a \nway a good number of Senators and a good number of people think is a \nway to do it, and that is by making the cost of employment to an \nemployer less expensive.\n  In our country, it is regrettable, but we have come to the point \nwhere very often payroll taxes are the greatest expense an employee \nhas. They pay more in payroll taxes, because the employer's half is \nimputed to the employee, than income taxes.\n  We have to work hard to try to find ways so the cost of employment to \nemployers is a little less expensive than at present. The Senator from \nFlorida is trying to address that.\n  I might say, though, his amendment strikes over 60 percent of the \nbill. This is a large bill. We don't have many tax bills that come \naround.\n  I remember years ago we used to have a tax bill at the end of the \nyear. Senator Long was then chairman of the Finance Committee. He would \nwait until the end of the year. There would be a lot of provisions and \nthere would be a good tax bill. I don't think that is going to happen \nthis year. This is becoming the major bill, and the reason for that is \nvery clear.\n  There was no World Trade Organization back 20 years ago. Times have \nchanged so much. But the World Trade Organization has ruled that our \ntax regime, which gives our American companies that export a bit of a \nbreak, is illegal. Other countries have their tax regimes which give \ntheir companies breaks for their exports, and they are legal. But we \nset up ours in a way that, regrettably, does not pass muster with the \nWTO.\n  There are a lot of reasons that is the case. Frankly, I think we \nAmericans were a little naive. A number of years ago we agreed to a tax \nregime where companies in other countries could rebate their value-\nadded tax for exports; whereas because we have a different tax system, \nbecause we did not have a value-added tax system and we tried to set up \na different way to help our companies export, it turned out our way \nbecame illegal under the general rules of WTO. That happened a long \ntime ago. We cannot recreate history. But basically that is why we are \nhere today. Our tax regime which gives our companies a bit of a tax \nbreak has been declared illegal under WTO.\n  We have an obligation now. We can't wait until the end of the year. \nWe have an obligation now to replace that illegal regime with something \nthat is legal. We have an obligation now because, as has been stated, \nthe European Union, pursuant to rules under the WTO, has begun to tax \nAmerican exports to Europe. With each passing month that tax becomes \ngreater and greater. It gets up to 17 percent and that gets pretty \nsevere after a while. So that is why we are here.\n  The Finance Committee spent a lot of time trying to figure out what \nthe basic replacement legislation should be--what is the best way to do \nthis; what is the best way to help American companies produce jobs, \nmake products, and also produce jobs in a way that is legal under the \nWTO regime.\n  We worked hard at it, as I said. We talked to lots of different \npeople around the country. We had several meetings in the Finance \nCommittee about this issue. We had a big, long, open markup. We came up \nwith a way which we think, by and large, helps American companies quite \nwell. What is it? It is very simple. It is a 9-percent deduction for \nproduction by U.S. companies--in the United States, that is. If they \nproduce the product in the United States, they get a 9-percent cost of \nproduction benefit for that production. It not only applies to big \ncorporations, standard C corporations, it applies to smaller \ncorporations generally known as S corporations, partnerships, sole \nproprietorships, as well as to any organization that produces some \nproduct in the United States.\n\n  That is far better than the old regime we are going to displace \nbecause the old regime, which gave benefits for exports, was not \navailable to a lot of farmers and ranchers and small businesspeople.\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\n  So it is a good idea. Effectively, it lowers the top corporate rate--\nif you are paying 35 percent--by 3 percentage points, down to about 32 \npercent as your income taxes, corporate income taxes. But if you are a \npartnership or if you are some other organization, your taxes are also \nlowered because of the 9-percent deduction for domestic manufacturing. \nSo it does help provide jobs.\n  What else does it do? It gives the employer who gets the benefit of \nthis a choice. What is the best way for that company to meet \ncompetition? What is the best way for that company to do well? Whether \nit is a big company or small company, what is the best way? Generally, \nmost believe the management of that company should have the choice of \nwhat works best for them. That is why we said you don't have to use the \nmoney this way or have to use the money that way. But in order to \ncomply with the World Trade Organization rules, the only restriction, \nbasically, is it has to be produced in the United States, whether the \nproduct is sold in the United States or whether it is sold overseas. \nThat was the one restriction we had to apply to stay within the WTO \nrules.\n  We also took the opportunity to address a growing concern that many \nAmerican companies face, particularly the larger American companies, \nand that is international competition. Other countries do a pretty good \njob of taking care of their companies in the sense that they want to \nmake sure their companies are competitive in the world. They do a \npretty good job. So we have to ask ourselves: Americans, OK, what do we \ndo so as not to handicap our American companies in international \noperations and also in a way that is fair to small business, is fair to \nthe budget, is fair to lots of other interests in our country; that is, \nother considerations in addition to making sure our companies are as \ncompetitive as possible in the international arena.\n  I don't need to tell you how globalized our economy has become. It is \nincredible how, each passing year, we are so much more interconnected \nthan we were in previous years.\n  Let me give one small example, the entrance of a good number of \neastern countries into the European Union. Half of the world's \npopulation now is in a buying consumer market. That is a major change. \nThat is a profound change. Companies worldwide, certainly American \ncompanies, are going to have to compete in that market, as well as the \nAmerican market.\n  In addition, Mr. President, as you well know, various other \ncountries--whether it is the European Union or even China--are entering \ninto trade agreements with other countries which give a benefit to \ntheir companies and, by definition, to the detriment of American \ncompanies. It is an extremely competitive world and becoming even more \nso. It is more so because of the additional markets, as I mentioned, \nmore so because of increased advances in technology, particularly \ncommunications technology. With so much information now digitized, so \nmuch information now able to be sent over a broadband communications \nsystem, that is bringing us so much closer together.\n\n  We in the committee believed that in addition to helping domestic \nmanufacturers, as described, we should also simplify a lot of the \ninternational provisions, especially those where American companies are \ndouble taxed. The theory of our system, our worldwide system as opposed \nto--well, it is the same theory as other countries' territorial \nsystems. But the theory of our system is basically avoid double \ntaxation of American companies. If an American company does business \noverseas, clearly that other country--take Germany, for example--wants \nto tax the American company's production in Germany. But then that is \nan American company, so the American taxpayers have a right to think \nthat company should pay income taxes to Uncle Sam, too. But we also \nwant to avoid double taxation.\n  Basically, the idea in America is to give companies a tax credit on \nAmerican taxes for the amount of the taxes they paid in the other \ncountry. That is basically what we do. It is a complicated system, but \nit is one that by and large works pretty well.\n  Then there are some other provisions in this bill. There are energy \ntax provisions; also, a minority tax credit. What is my main point? My \nmain point is we have spent a lot of time in committee on this bill. It \npassed the committee 19 to 2. Frankly, the two dissenters were on the \nother side of the aisle. They had a different approach they thought \nmade much more sense to them.\n\n  I suggest upfront, even though the amendment has some frailties, this \nwas never debated in the committee. It was never brought up in \ncommittee. It was for very good reason, as the Senator from Florida was \nengaged in another endeavor. He probably still is engaged to some \ndegree. I very much appreciate that. He was not available and it was \nnot his fault this amendment was not brought up. He was unable to be \npresent. It was not brought up in the Finance Committee. It was \nundebated in the Finance Committee.\n  His amendment is a huge change to the bill. It dramatically changes \nthe bill. It changes the velocity of the bill. We have already \naddressed the issue generally but not all of the content of this \namendment, which is drastically changing the bill. That is not an \nexaggeration. It is drastic.\n  For that reason, respectfully I say to my good friend from Florida, \nthis is not the time for the Senate to proceed with this amendment. \nThere is a time and place, in the committee, that we should address his \napproach. That is, helping reduce the company payroll tax or helping \nemployers so they do not pay quite so much in wages. We want to help \npeople get wages but we do not want to burden the employers. Now is not \nthe time, nor the forum. He should bring that up at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa controls time. Only the \nSenator from Iowa controls time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask consent all pending amendments be \nset aside so the Senator from Colorado can be recognized for the \npurpose of offering an amendment, and I also ask consent that the \namendment of the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, also be the \nnext amendment to be in order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding Senator Hollings \nwould propose that amendment immediately following the votes on the two \npending amendments; is that right?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have no problem with that. That is my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3118\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for a brownfields demonstration program for \nqualified green building and sustainable design projects, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask consent to send an amendment to the desk, which \nwill take the slot reserved for the Miller-Schumer-Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask consent that the pending amendment be temporarily \nlaid aside, that I offer an amendment; following the reporting of my \namendment, it be laid aside, and the Senate resume debate under the \nprevious order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask that the clerk report amendment No. 3118.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard], for himself, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Miller, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Chambliss, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3118.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendment.'')\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3112\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the preceding amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield me an additional 5 minutes?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the Senator from Montana whatever time he might \nconsume.\n\n[[Page S4883]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a couple more points about the \nGraham amendment.\n  It is advisable the Senate not adopt the amendment. His amendment \nwould do two things. Basically, it strikes the deduction for domestic \nmanufacturing and also strikes most of the international tax reform \nprovisions. These are very important changes that will help Americans \ncompete internationally.\n  As I mentioned, the international provisions in the bill that would \nbe stricken by the Senator's amendment are designed to reduce double \ntaxation of American companies. We want to do as much as we can to \nreduce double taxation of American companies.\n  Let me give an example. Under current law, an American corporation \nwould have to pay more to borrow money to build a factory than foreign \ncorporations would have to pay, even if the factory is in the United \nStates. This is because of the way we treat interest expenses and so-\ncalled interest allocation. Essentially, we are changing the interest \nallocation provision so that a U.S. company with assets overseas is not \npenalized, so long as the borrowing is proportionate to the assets in \neach of the countries, which is now not the case. That is, right now, \nAmerican companies are penalized even if all their borrowing in the \nUnited States is proportionate to worldwide borrowing. That is just not \nfair. It is something other country's companies do not have to put up \nwith. That is one example of how our Tax Code currently puts American \ncompanies at a disadvantage compared to other countries.\n  The JOBS bill fixes a lot of these problems so Americans can compete \non a level playing field, and it brings the Tax Code in compliance for \nthe intent to avoid double taxation.\n  I say to my good friend from Florida and to my colleagues in the \nSenate, this is not the time, in my judgment, for that amendment. It \nhas not been explored, debated, or brought up in committee. It is a \nhuge change to a very thought through bill. It should not be approved \nat this time.\n  I take a couple of minutes while we have the time to talk about some \nof the international provisions generally in the JOBS bill. Let me \nstate again why I think these provisions are good policy and they help \nAmerican companies.\n  I will mention again the interest allocation provision. It is perhaps \nthe most significant provision in the international tax title, both in \nterms of cost and the number of companies it would help. The interest \nallocation provision is one of the many in the JOBS bill that deals \nwith foreign tax credits. Our foreign tax credit system is designed to \nprevent taxpayers from paying tax twice on the same income. When an \nAmerican company earns money in France, the French tax that income and \nthe United States also taxes that income. That is two levels of tax on \nthe same income. The total tax could be, say, 75 percent or more. \nWithout adjustments such as the foreign tax credit which is in current \nU.S. law, these two levels of taxation would make U.S. companies \ncompletely uncompetitive abroad. There is no question about that.\n  Foreign tax credits, however, get the company back to a single level \ntax and make competition possible. Our foreign tax credit rules are not \nperfect and double taxation still sometimes occurs.\n  A prime example is the interest allocation provisions in the foreign \ntax credit rules.\n  Let me give you an example. Take an American company that pays $100 \nin foreign taxes and $100 in U.S. taxes on that same income. That \nAmerican company would generally claim a $100 foreign tax credit to get \nback down to a single layer of tax. But if that American company \nhappened to take out a loan in the United States to finance a project \nhere in the United States, it might be limited to an $80 or $90 foreign \ntax credit--not because it paid any less in foreign taxes, but because \nwe treat it as if it were able to deduct some of the interest on that \nU.S. loan to reduce its taxable foreign income, even though it could \nnot do so. That is not right.\n  The rules are complicated, but the effect is plain. If an American \ncompany wants to borrow money and build a plant in the United States, \nit faces an uphill battle. It will pay higher interest expenses than a \ncomparable foreign company. Our interest allocation rules in current \nlaw are making it easier for its foreign competitors to build that \nplant. But our bill fixes that, and it fixes other problems with our \nforeign tax credit rules.\n  For example, companies that pay the alternative minimum tax--the so-\ncalled AMT--currently face limits on the use of the AMT with respect to \nforeign tax credits. Unlike non-alternative minimum tax taxpayers, they \nare subjected to an artificial, completely arbitrary cap on the use of \ntheir foreign tax credits. It is 90. Arbitrarily limiting their foreign \ntax credits just makes these AMT taxpayers pay double. The current AMT \nprovisions essentially, in many cases, result in double taxation. The \nJOBS bill fixes that, too.\n  The JOBS bill also makes it less likely that a company's foreign tax \ncredits will expire unused. It is another problem: The foreign tax \ncredits expire unused, and then the U.S. company could often be placed, \nin effect, in a position where it is subjected to double taxation.\n  Currently, unused foreign tax credits can be carried over for 5 \nyears. The original purpose of this carry-forward rule was to prevent \ntaxpayers from suffering double taxation because of timing differences \nbetween U.S. and foreign tax laws. That purpose is not being served by \nour current law. Any new tax laws in foreign countries have made the \nproblem worse for American companies. The JOBS bill extends the \ncarryforward to limit the double taxation that occurs upon the \nexpiration of foreign tax credits; that is, we are making it less \nlikely that a U.S. company will be subjected to double taxation.\n  Each of these provisions simply corrects features of our \ninternational tax laws that frustrate the original purpose of those \nlaws. Again, the original purpose was to avoid double taxation. The \nJOBS bill puts us back on track with the original intent of our \ninternational tax system.\n  So, as we all know, the international provisions are a lot more \ncomplicated than I have even begun to allude to, but, very briefly, \nthose are some of the provisions in the bill. They are corrections in \nthe bill. They reduce double taxation, or eliminate it in many \ninstances. It helps American companies compete with foreign companies. \nThat means it is much more likely they will be able to keep jobs in the \nUnited States if they are able to compete more effectively.\n  Mr. President, for that reason, I urge we do not adopt this \namendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, on behalf of the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3117\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes of my time to the \nSenator from Nevada and 2 minutes to the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, in a few minutes we are going to be voting \non the Breaux-Feinstein amendment. In the underlying bill is an \namendment that Senator Boxer and I worked on last year. It was voted on \nin the Senate and had 75 affirmative votes, 25 negative votes. Seventy-\nfive Senators said, last year, it is a good idea for money that is \nsitting outside the country in bank accounts--in businesses' bank \naccounts outside the United States--to come back to the United States \nto create jobs and help the American economy.\n  Right now, if companies bring that money back, they will have to pay \nthe difference between whatever that country charged and our 35-percent \ncorporate tax rate. At the top rate, it is 35 percent they are paying. \nTherefore, those companies are leaving that money overseas.\n  Well, with our piece of legislation, it is estimated that somewhere \nbetween $400 billion and $600 billion will come back to the United \nStates in the next\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\n12 months. That is a huge amount of money and will be a huge boost to \nthe American economy. Our economy is really starting to click on along, \nand we are really excited about that, but we can do more, and that is \nwhat we want to do. We can put more people to work with our bill.\n  Independent estimates by Allen Sinai, a well-respected economist, \nwell respected by Democrats and Republicans, said this bill will create \n660,000 jobs in the United States. Frankly, the amendment by Senator \nBreaux and Senator Feinstein will gut this amendment. It is a poison \npill. So we are encouraging all of our Senators to vote against it.\n  There are some important uses of funds for job creation that Senator \nBreaux's amendment would stop the money from being used for.\n  Those legitimate uses of funds include improving health insurance for \nemployees and preventing investing in new small businesses. They could \nbuy a new jet under the Breaux amendment, but they couldn't pay for \nemployees' travel expenses. This amendment makes no sense, and that is \nwhy we should vote it down.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is against the underlying bill. He is \nagainst the approach we took last year. He voted against it. This is \nhis effort to try to gut underlying legislation. That is why we are \nencouraging all Senators, the 75 who voted for our legislation last \nyear, to vote against this amendment to make sure that $400 to $600 \nbillion does come back to the United States and helps American workers \nget jobs.\n  Every night we hear on television about outsourcing. This underlying \nbill is about insourcing. We are bringing jobs back to the United \nStates, and we should do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada. He \nworked so hard and long on this underlying part of the JOBS bill, \ncalled the Invest in USA Act, because it is going to create, as my \ncolleague said, according to independent analysts, 660,000 new jobs. \nWhy would we want to ruin a provision people from all parts of the \neconomic spectrum have told us is going to work? We want to try this \nfor 1 year. We want to bring back monies that are parked overseas and \ntax them at 5.25 percent, because right now we are not getting any \nrevenues. It is going to mean $4 billion into the Treasury right away, \nsomething we desperately need. It is going to mean, as my colleague \nsays, insourcing, creating jobs here.\n  Last year the Senate voted 75 to 25 for the Ensign-Boxer bill. At \nthat time Senator Breaux was very honest about it. He didn't like it \nthen. He doesn't like it now. But instead of objecting to it flat out, \nhe is offering an amendment that in essence kills the whole idea.\n  I urge my colleagues, if you care about job creation--and I know you \nall do--please support us and defeat the Breaux amendment. In my State \nalone we are looking at 75,000 jobs.\n  Senator Breaux is a very effective debater. He says: You are creating \nanother Enron scandal. What is going to happen to this money? They are \ngoing to say they are using it for jobs, but there is no penalty in \nplace.\n  The same penalty is in place as in the IRS Code. The CEO is going to \nsign the plan. And if they don't do the plan, they are in for trouble. \nThat is clear. This is not some plan that is going to be hatched in \nsome accountant's office. It is right out there above the CEO's \nsignature.\n\n  I hope we defeat this and move on. It is a good underlying bill. \nLet's keep it as it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I understand there is 1 minute for the proponents of the \nBreaux-Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes of debate time on the \nGraham amendment. Under the previous order, at the conclusion of debate \non the Graham amendment, a vote will occur on the Breaux amendment, \npreceded by 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to yielding back the \nremaining balance of 1 minute on the Graham amendment?\n  Without objection, time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, a vote will now occur on the Breaux \namendment, preceded by 2 minutes of debate equally divided. The Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, it is interesting that the authors, the \nSenators who oppose the amendment, say the bill is going to create \n660,000 jobs. If it is going to create 660,000 jobs, there is no \nproblem. The people would be able to bring the money back and pay 5 \npercent. The Breaux-Feinstein amendment simply says if companies are \ngoing to get a huge, enormous tax break by bringing money out of tax \nshelters in foreign countries and saying they want to use it for job \ncreation, fine. Let's make sure that is what it is used for. Let's have \na standard by which if more jobs are created, they get 5 percent. But \nif they don't create more jobs, if they don't spend it for that \npurpose, they are not going to get the 5-percent tax break. That is all \nit says.\n  It says, if you spend the money to create more jobs, you can bring it \nback at a 5-percent tax rate, and we will allow that to happen. But if \nyou use it for something else, you will not get a 5-percent tax rate. \nYou will pay the regular corporate rate like any other American \ncorporation. Without my amendment, this costs $3.7 billion to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, this is a simple choice for our colleagues. \nIt is either vote for jobs or vote to limit the number of jobs we have \nthe potential to create. By independent studies, this inclusion, \nrepatriation in the JOBS bill, will create 660,000 jobs. It will reduce \nthe deficit by $75 billion over 5 years, and it will bring to each of \nour local economies new energy. The choice is to leave it offshore, \ndoing little good for the American people, or to bring it here, to give \ncompanies for 1 year the chance that a walk-back with their capital \nwill reemploy the American people and allow them to compete with other \nmultinational companies from other nations, which nations allow them \nthat kind of privilege. We are saying, let them do it for 1 year and we \nwill create 660,000 jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 3117.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be a \nvote on the Graham amendment preceded by 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I ask for a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, there are two basic issues \naddressed in this amendment.\n  First, there are substantial changes in the international tax \nprovisions in this legislation. They are going to cost American \ntaxpayers $37 billion, and the reason is because we are adding to the \nalready significant incentive for American firms to take their jobs \noverseas.\n  Second, we are going to spend $65 billion to give a blank check to \nAmerican manufacturing firms in the form of a tax deduction. The \namendment would substitute and add $35 billion so we would have $100 \nbillion to be given in the form of a credit against the payroll tax to \nreduce the form of tax, which is the greatest disincentive to the \ncreation and maintenance of jobs in the United States.\n  This is an amendment which truly justifies the title of this bill, \nJOBS, and would add the phrase ``in America.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition? Is there objection to time being \nyielded back?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. All time is yielded back. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3112.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe an hour equally divided between the two managers or their designees; \nprovided further that following the use or yielding back of time, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the Dorgan amendment No. 3110, to \nbe followed by a vote in relation to the Allard amendment No. 3118, \nwith no amendments in order to either amendment prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I have spoken to the managers--well, not actually the \nmanagers of the bill--but I have spoken to the majority side.

Mr. President, on the time we have, 20 minutes of that \nwould go to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time was \nrequired on the last recorded vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 30 minutes.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Vermont is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friends, the Senator from \nKentucky and the Senator from Nevada, for their courtesy.\n\n\n              ABUSE OF PRISONERS IN U.S. MILITARY CUSTODY\n\n  Mr. President, as an American, as a former prosecutor, as a U.S. \nSenator who has spoken out in defense of human rights wherever they are \nviolated, and as the ranking member of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee that has appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars to \npromote respect for the rule of law in countries around the world, I \nwas outraged and disgusted by the reports of abuse of Iraqi prisoners \nby United State military personnel and the civilian contractors working \nwith them.\n  Not only has this caused serious harm, both physical and \npsychological, to the individuals who were subjected to this \nmistreatment, it has tarnished the reputation of all Americans and our \nNation as a whole.\n  I have listened as top officials at the Department of Defense, the \nNational Security Advisor, the Secretary of State, and other \nadministration officials, have said they were ``shocked'' and \n``stunned'' by these reports. And I have heard them, in a coordinated \nattempt at damage control, say that these were isolated incidents \ninvolving only a handful of individuals whose conduct, while \nreprehensible, should not be seen as indicative of a larger failure.\n  I have no doubt that the vast majority of American men and women who \nare risking their lives in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere are as \ndisgusted by these abhorrent acts as the rest of us. But I could not \ndisagree more with those who would characterize these incidents as \naberrations.\n  While President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, General Myers, Secretary \nPowell and Condoleezza Rice, may have been shocked by the photographs \nthat have been on the front page of every newspaper in the world, they \nshould not have been surprised by the revelations themselves. These \ntypes of abuses have been going on at U.S. military detention \nfacilities for a long time, and the administration has known about the \nincidents in Iraq for 5 months. This fact signals a failure of \nleadership at several levels.\n  The mistreatment of prisoners by the U.S. military in Iraq was not \nlimited to the crimes that have come to light at the Abu Ghraib prison. \nRather, there was, in the words of the U.S. Army's own inquiry, a \n``systemic and illegal abuse of detainees.''\n  It is revealing, and particularly disturbing, that the U.S. personnel \ninvolved conducted themselves so openly, even posing with the victims \nof their sadistic acts.\n  They obviously felt they had no reason to believe that their \nsuperiors would be upset with their conduct.\n  The brazenness of these acts, the reported role of U.S. intelligence \nofficers in encouraging such treatment to ``soften up'' detainees for \ninterrogations, combined with earlier reports of\n\n[[Page S4886]]\n\nsimilar abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan, suggests a much larger failure.\n  And let us be clear. We are not talking only about the individuals \nwho engaged in these abusive acts.\n  We are talking about a failure of leadership by an administration \nthat, well before this latest scandal, had already severely damaged \nthis Nation's reputation and effectiveness in a war against terrorism \nthat is increasingly perceived by Muslims around the world as a war \nagainst Islam itself.\n  The growing anger and hostility toward our troops has been exploited \nby Saddam loyalists and extremists who want to take the country \nbackward. They have committed despicable acts of violence against \nAmericans, including the desecration of corpses.\n  The acts described in the investigative report by MG Antonio Taguba, \nincluding beatings, repeated sexual abuse and humiliation, and threats \nand simulation of rape and of torture by electric shock, violate the \nGeneva Conventions.\n  They clearly contradict President Bush's pledge on June 26, 2003, \nthat the United States will neither ``torture'' terrorist suspects, nor \nuse ``cruel and unusual'' treatment to interrogate them. They also \ncontradict the more detailed policy on interrogations outlined in a \nJune 25, 2003, letter to me by Defense Department General Counsel \nWilliam Haynes.\n  Frankly, I regret to say that I was not among those who were shocked \nby these revelations. Revolted, yes. Shocked, I was not. I have been \nconcerned, as have others, about ongoing reports of physical and \npsychological abuse and the denial of rights of detainees in U.S. \nmilitary custody since September 11, 2001, not only in Iraq but in \nAfghanistan and Guantanamo.\n  These abuses have been well documented by reputable human rights \norganizations, as well as by members of the press. Some of the cases \ninvolve allegations of torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading \ntreatment by U.S. military and intelligence personnel.\n  Other cases involve allegations of the denial of due process, \nincommunicado detention without charge, and the refusal of access to \nattorneys.\n  So when I hear the National Security Advisor, or the Secretary of \nDefense, say they are determined to get to the bottom of this, I, \nfrankly, have to wonder, especially as they have known about this for a \nlong time.\n  I first wrote to National Security Advisor Rice a year ago about \nreports of cruel and degrading treatment of Afghan detainees.\n  I have written several times to the general counsel of the Department \nof Defense and to the Director of the CIA. I have sought answers to \nquestions about policy, training, and accountability. Some of my \nquestions have been answered; many have been ignored despite repeated \nrequests.\n  Were Secretary Rumsfeld or Condoleezza Rice not aware of the press \nreports, the inquiries by Members of Congress, or the reports of human \nrights organizations?\n  Or was the abuse of nameless, non-White Muslims suspected of being \nterrorists, regardless of whether they were guilty or innocent, simply \na low priority until it became a public relations and foreign policy \ndisaster?\n  Let me cite just a few, of many, examples:\n  On December 25, 2002, the Washington Post reported:\n\n       ``If you don't violate someone's human rights some of the \n     time, you probably aren't doing your job,'' said one official \n     who has supervised the capture and transfer of accused \n     terrorists. ``I don't think we want to be promoting a view of \n     zero tolerance on this.''\n\n  Quote:\n\n       Bush Administration officials said the CIA, in practice, is \n     using a narrow definition of what counts as ``knowing'' that \n     a suspect has been tortured. ``If we're not there in the \n     room, who is to say?'' said one official conversant with \n     recent reports . . . .\n\n  One can only wonder if anyone would have been punished, or if we \nwould have even heard about it, if the photographs of the abuses at Abu \nGhraib had not been published.\n  On March 4, 2003, the New York Times described the treatment of \nAfghan prisoners at the Bagram Air Base after two young prisoners died \nin U.S. military custody.\n  Their deaths were ruled homicides, but the investigations of those \ndeaths have never been released. Other prisoners described being forced \nto stand naked in a cold room for 10 days without interruption, with \ntheir arms raised and chained to the ceiling and their swollen ankles \nshackled.\n  They also said they were denied sleep for days and forced to wear \nhoods that cut off the supply of oxygen.\n  That same day, the Wall Street Journal reported that a U.S. law \nenforcement official said:\n\n     because the [Convention Against Torture] has no enforcement \n     mechanism, as a practical matter, ``you're only limited by \n     your imagination.''\n\n  On March 9, 2003, the New York Times reported:\n\n       Intelligence officials . . . acknowledged that some \n     suspects had been turned over to security services in \n     countries known to employ torture.\n\n  On June 2, 2003, when allegations of possible breaches of the \nConvention Against Torture surfaced, I wrote to National Security \nAdvisor Rice, asking for assurance that the United States is complying \nwith its obligations under the convention. I received a response from \nGeneral Counsel Haynes. His letter contained a welcome commitment by \nthe administration that it is the policy of the United States to comply \nwith all of its legal obligations under the convention.\n  Similarly, Senator Specter wrote to Dr. Rice asking for \n``clarification about numerous stories concerning alleged mistreatment \nof enemy combatants in U.S. custody,'' and to explain how the \nadministration ensures that torture does not occur when it sends \ndetainees to countries that are known to practice torture.\n  On September 9, 2003, I wrote to Mr. Haynes again for clarification \non a number of points, such as how the administration reconciled his \nstatement of policy with reports that detainees were sent to countries \nwhere torture is practiced, and the reported use of interrogation \ntechniques rising to or near the level of torture.\n  After 2 months with no response, another letter, this one not from \nMr. Haynes himself but from a subordinate, was delivered late at night \non the eve of Mr. Haynes' November 19, 2003, confirmation hearing for a \nseat on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. That letter was totally \nunresponsive to my questions.\n  I also raised concerns when the case surfaced of a Canadian-Syrian \ncitizen, Maher Arar, who was sent by U.S. authorities to Syria, where \nArar says he was physically tortured. Syria has a well-documented \nhistory of torture. In fact, President Bush stated, on November 7, \n2003, that Syria has left ``a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, \nand ruin'' to its people.\n  I wrote to FBI Director Mueller on November 17, 2003, for more \ninformation on the case. Later that week, I wrote to Attorney General \nAshcroft with additional questions. Neither of these letters from last \nyear has been answered.\n  On January 6, 2004, Human Rights Watch wrote to Secretary Rumsfeld to \nexpress concern about the detention by U.S. forces in Iraq of innocent, \nclose relatives of a wanted person in order to compel the person to \nsurrender, which amounts to hostage-taking, classified as a war crime \nunder the Geneva Conventions.\n  On January 13, 2004, the Asian Wall Street Journal reported that a \nsuspect detained by U.S. forces in Iraq said that ``he was ordered to \nstand upright until he collapsed after 13 hours,'' and that \ninterrogators, ``burned his arm with a cigarette.''\n  On January 18, 2004, the Sunday Times of London reported that a \ndetainee held by coalition forces in Iraq said that during his 3 months \nin detention he was, ``beaten frequently, given shocks with an electric \ncattle prod and had one of his toenails [torn] off.''\n  Throughout this period there were not only continuous press reports \nof abuses of Afghan, Iraqi, and other detainees in U.S. military \ncustody. There were also repeated requests by human rights \norganizations, myself, and others, for clarification of the policies \nand procedures used in interrogations. What we got, it seems, were, at \nbest, reassuring statements by officials in Washington that were \nrepeatedly ignored in the field.\n  Several things bother me beyond the reports themselves. Not only is \nthere a long pattern of abuse that has been documented. But with \nrespect to the\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\nallegations at Abu Ghraib, Secretary Rumsfeld and General Myers knew of \nthese incidents and for over a week they not only did not disclose them \nto the Congress or the American people, they urged CBS News not to \nbroadcast the photographs.\n  Major General Taguba's report was written 3 months ago, and as of \nyesterday Secretary Rumsfeld said he still had not read it through.\n  There has been an appalling lack of appreciation or concern for the \nseriousness and frequency of these incidents.\n  None of us believes that prisoners of war, some of whom are suspected \nof having killed or attempted to kill Americans, should be rewarded \nwith comforts. Harsh treatment may, at times, be justified. But we also \nknow that many of the people who have been detained, who have been \ndepicted as terrorists and whose rights have been violated, have turned \nout to be innocent of any crime.\n  The use of torture or the inhuman or degrading treatment of \nprisoners, whoever they are, is beneath this Nation. It is also \nillegal. That is the law whether U.S. military officers engage in such \nconduct themselves, or they turn over prisoners to the government \nagents of another country where torture is commonly used, in order to \nlet others do the dirty work. It is also the law when contractors or \nsubcontractors of the U.S. military are involved.\n  It undermines our reputation as a nation of laws, it hurts our \ncredibility with other nations, and it invites others to use similar \ntactics against our troops and other Americans.\n  Torture is routinely used today in dozens of countries. In fact, some \nof those who have complained the loudest about the abuses at Abu Ghraib \nare among the world's worst violators of human rights. Their \nmistreatment of prisoners is flagrant, it is pervasive, and it is a \nmatter of state policy.\n  So I am cognizant of the hypocrisy of some of those who have equated \nthe U.S. military with Saddam Hussein's regime, which tortured and \nmurdered hundreds of thousands of people. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. But that does not detract from the fact that the Bush \nadministration's response to the pattern of reports of abuse of \ndetainees has been woefully inadequate.\n  It has been negligent, and innocent people have suffered and some \nquite possibly have died as a result. This negligence is anything but \nbenign in the damage it threatens to our national security and foreign \npolicy interests, at a particularly dangerous time.\n  What should be done? Human rights groups have suggested a number of \nimportant actions which I believe are long overdue. The administration \nshould undertake an investigation of the interrogation practices \nwherever detainees are held around the world, whether the facilities \nare run by the U.S. military or the Central Intelligence Agency, and \nmake the results public.\n  The administration should prosecute any military or intelligence \npersonnel found to have engaged in or encouraged any acts amounting to \ntorture or inhuman treatment. Administrative penalties are inadequate. \nThere needs to be a clear signal that these abuses will not be \ntolerated.\n  The administration should ensure that all interrogators working for \nthe United States, whether employees of the military, intelligence \nagencies, or private contractors, understand and abide by specific \nguidelines consistent with the policy outlined by General Counsel \nHaynes last year, which prohibited interrogation methods abroad that \nwould be barred in the United States by the U.S. Constitution as well \nas by the Geneva Conventions. These guidelines should be publicly \navailable.\n  The administration should grant the International Committee of the \nRed Cross access to all detainees held by the United States in the \ncampaign against terrorism throughout the world, whether held in \nfacilities run by the U.S. military or intelligence services, or held \nby other governments at the behest of the United States. The United \nStates should not be operating undisclosed detention facilities to \nwhich no independent monitors have access.\n  The administration should make public information about who is \ndetained by occupation forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and why, and \nenable families of detainees to visit their relatives. Even with \ninternal safeguards, incommunicado detention is an invitation to abuse.\n  The administration should videotape all interrogations and other \ninteraction with detainees so responsible personnel know there will be \na record of any abuses. These videotapes should be regularly reviewed \nby supervisory personnel to ensure full compliance with interrogation \nand detention standards in U.S. and international law.\n  The administration should release the results of the investigation \nthe Defense Department conducted into deaths in custody of two \ndetainees held at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.\n  The administration should ensure that private contractors working for \nthe United States in military or intelligence roles operate under \nclear, legal procedures so they can be held criminally responsible for \ncomplicity in illegal acts. Under the Military Extraterritorial \nJurisdiction Act, which I worked with Senators Sessions and DeWine to \nenact in the 106th Congress, a contractor or subcontractor of the \nmilitary can be prosecuted in Federal court if the crime of which he is \naccused is a felony when committed in the United States.\n  The administration should take responsibility and be accountable for \nthe breakdown of civilian control and loss of lawful authority.\n  Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ years ago, shortly after 2,986 people of some \n60 nationalities died in the attacks on the World Trade Center, on the \nPentagon, and in a lonely field in Pennsylvania, there were expressions \nof sympathy and good will toward our country unlike any we had \nexperienced since the end of the Second World War.\n  I remember how the cover of the French newspaper, Le Monde, \nproclaimed ``Today, We Are All Americans.'' The National Anthem was \nplayed at Buckingham Palace.\n  Today, that sympathy and good will, which offered such promise, has \nlong since dissipated. In fact, it has been squandered. Squandered by \nan administration blinded by arrogance, steeped in condescension, prone \nto distortions of the truth, motivated by simplistic notions of ``good \nversus evil,'' and having only the most rudimentary understanding of \nthe Iraqi people, their culture, their faith and traditions.\n  While we are continually treated with rosy assertions that things are \ngetting better, the number of U.S. casualties soars.\n  What was conceived as a campaign against terrorism, focused on al-\nQaida, is increasingly perceived by many of the world's 1.2 billion \nMuslims as a war of aggression against Islam by the United States and \nour predominantly Christian allies.\n  I have no doubt that most Iraqis are relieved to be rid of Saddam \nHussein and the horrors of his regime. Most Iraqis abhor violence and \nwant to rebuild their country.\n  Nor should there be any doubt about our concern for the safety of the \noverwhelming majority of American soldiers and civilians whose motives \nare honorable and who are bravely risking their lives.\n  But the individuals at Abu Ghraib prison, at Bagram Air Base, and \nelsewhere who have violated the rights of prisoners, were not acting in \na vacuum. There was a culture that encouraged or allowed it. Discipline \nwas lacking. Accountability was lacking. And just as those who \ncommitted these crimes should be prosecuted, the civilian and military \nofficials who failed in their responsibility to ensure that the law was \nrespected should also be held accountable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a May 4, 2004, op-ed in \nthe Washington Post by Leonard S. Rubenstein, executive director of \nPhysicians for Human Rights, entitled, ``Stopping the Abuse of \nDetainees,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 4, 2004]\n\n                    Stopping the Abuse of Detainees\n\n                       (By Leonard S. Rubenstein)\n\n       Photographs of American soldiers laughing over naked Iraqi \n     prisoners of war piled atop one another are a revolting \n     disgrace, all the more so because evidence of torture and ill \n     treatment of individuals detained by U.S.\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\n     forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is not \n     new. The humiliating acts seen in photos may not have been \n     predictable, but the abuse of detainees was, a product of the \n     circumstances of detention and the administration's \n     resistance to independent monitoring and accountability. \n     Stopping it requires a great deal more than the prosecution \n     of a handful of offenders.\n       The problem is that the main purpose of these military \n     detentions is interrogation, a practice that always has \n     potential for abuse. Preventing abuse requires compliance \n     with rules for treatment of prisoners, as well as access for \n     independent monitors and accountability for violators. But \n     many detainees in Afghanistan and Iraq have been held \n     virtually incommunicado, sometimes in undisclosed locations, \n     under rules that have never been made public. As early as \n     2002, news reports of abuse or prisoners began to surface, \n     and new allegations have continued to emerge.\n       The administration's response has been to stonewall. A year \n     ago, in response to the first set of allegations of abuse of \n     detainees, President Bush affirmed that the United States \n     does not practice or condone torture or cruel, inhuman and \n     degrading treatment, and that it investigates allegations of \n     violations. But the actions needed to convert this from a \n     statement to a commitment have been absent. For the past two \n     years, human rights organizations have requested the \n     guidelines used to govern interrogation, the results of \n     investigations of alleged instances of torture or \n     mistreatment, information on individuals transferred to third \n     countries for interrogation, and--most important--access to \n     the detainees and their medical records to ascertain whether \n     they have been abused. The administration either denied or \n     failed even to acknowledge many of these requests, including \n     those concerning findings of the investigation of the case of \n     two detainees who died in custody more than a year ago. As \n     for combatants sent to third countries, among them countries \n     with a record of torture, the administration claimed to have \n     obtained assurances that the countries do not torture \n     detained combatants.\n       An even deeper problem with the administration's approach \n     has been its efforts to evade compliance with the Geneva \n     Conventions, which protect detainees from torture, ill \n     treatment and humiliation, as well as in-human conditions of \n     confinement. It has said that captured al Qaeda suspects in \n     captivity at Guantanamo and Afghanistan are not subject to \n     the conventions at all. And U.S. officials took a shockingly \n     casual approach to the treatment of POWs by U.S. surrogates \n     in Afghanistan, assuming no responsibility for the horrific \n     conditions of imprisonment for thousands of Taliban fighters \n     and washing U.S. hands of reports that allies killed possibly \n     hundreds or thousands of detainees. Some of the holding \n     centers are even off-limits to the International Committee of \n     the Red Cross, which is internationally authorized to visit \n     all security detainees.\n       The president, the director of the CIA and the secretary of \n     defense must now do what should have been done 18 months ago. \n     The message has to be clear that interrogators must be \n     subject to rules, and if the rules are to be obeyed, the door \n     to the interrogation room must never be shut. They should \n     publicly pledge that the United States is bound by the Geneva \n     Conventions and will be bound by them with respect to every \n     single military detainee, whether or not it considers them \n     official prisoners of war. They should immediately account \n     for the whereabouts and condition of all in detention and \n     offer the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well \n     as independent human rights monitors and medical experts, \n     full access to all prisoners and all medical records that can \n     reveal abuse. The president should provide to the American \n     public a full accounting of interrogation practices, \n     including all records and documents relating to the most \n     recent violations and past allegations of abuse in \n     Afghanistan, Iraq, Guantanamo, the United States and other \n     countries where individuals have been sent.\n       When some Americans insulted and humiliated their Iraqi \n     captives, they shamed every American as well. Moreover, they \n     jeopardized the lives and well-being of U.S. soldiers and \n     people in custody throughout the world. President Bush \n     recoiled at the horror of it, but unless revulsion leads to \n     more concerted action, the abuses will continue.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3110\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is that we are now turning to the \namendment I have offered along with my colleague, Senator Mikulski; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is a period of \n1 hour of debate, 30 minutes allocated to the majority, 30 minutes \nallocated to the minority, of which 20 minutes is controlled by the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that 20 minutes begins at this point. Let \nme yield myself 2 minutes. Then I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  Let me just say, this is the easiest amendment to consider of all of \nthe issues that we have dealt with on this legislation. It deals with \nthe question of whether we should shut down the loophole that exists in \ncurrent tax law that says to a company, shut your American \nmanufacturing plant down, fire your workers, move your manufacturing \nplant overseas, manufacture the product, ship it back into the U.S. \nmarketplace and, by the way, we will give you a big tax break. If we \ncan't begin a baby step in the right direction of saying, we will no \nlonger subsidize in the Tax Code the movement of U.S. jobs overseas, \nthen we don't have a ghost of a chance of fixing what is wrong with \nthis Tax Code.\n  You have two companies side by side. Both make bicycles. One decides \nit will move its plant to China. The other continues to live in \nBaltimore and make its bicycles in Baltimore. The difference? The \ncompany that moved overseas gets a tax break. The company that stays in \nBaltimore doesn't. It is an insidious, perverse tax incentive that \nmakes no sense. We ought to end it.\n  That is what my colleague and I do with our amendment. I will explain \nit further at some later moment. I want to offer 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Maryland who has to go to the Intelligence Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota, \nthe lead sponsor of this amendment, for yielding me such time. I also \nacknowledge his outstanding leadership on trade. Trade is such an \nabstract word, but it is another word for jobs. The big question is, \nhow are we going to keep jobs in the United States?\n  This, then, takes us to tax policy. Tax policy is more than just \nsimply collecting revenue; tax policy is a statement of our principles. \nThe Tax Code in the United States has, since the New Deal, stood for \ncertain principles: That it should be fair, No. 1, and that the more \nwealthy you are, you would bear a little heavier responsibility. Part \nof the principle of fairness and of paying taxes is what is called \ncitizenship. It is called shared responsibility. It is called, how do \nyou make sure the U.S. Government functions to provide national \nsecurity and domestic opportunity and a safety net for seniors. That is \nreally what it is all about.\n  The Tax Code is the fundamental principle of how you collect revenue, \nand it is tied with citizenship, both individual citizenship and \ncorporate citizenship. The way we see it is: If you are a good \ncorporate citizen, you ought to stay in this country and keep your jobs \nhere. Right now we have a tax code that rewards just the opposite. We \nhave a tax code that rewards corporations for shipping jobs overseas.\n  I believe what the Dorgan-Mikulski amendment does is say that, No. 1, \nour Tax Code should be patriotic. Our Tax Code should stand up for \nAmerica. It should stand up for keeping jobs here. It should stand up \nfor rewarding good-guy companies that keep jobs here and provide health \nbenefits to their employees. It should also close the loophole where \npeople not only take jobs overseas but hide their income in the Bermuda \nTriangle or the Cayman Islands.\n  This deals with one aspect. The amendment Senator Dorgan and I offer, \nthe economic patriotism amendment, says that right now what we would do \nis close the loophole for sending jobs overseas. The Dorgan-Mikulski \namendment ends those huge tax breaks to manufacturing companies that \nsend jobs overseas, that only sell the products they make back here in \nthe United States. Right now this Tax Code lets these companies move \nthe jobs and not pay the taxes on the profits they earn by sales back \nhome.\n  Our amendment tells these companies: If you want to export jobs out \nof America, you can go, but you can't import these products back in the \nUnited States and be able to shelter your profits. Our amendment says: \nThe Tax Code can no longer be used to boost corporate earnings at the \nexpense of American workers. It is actually an amendment that makes \ngood sense. Why should we reward people who move their jobs overseas \nand penalize in the Tax Code the people who keep their jobs here in the \nUnited States and who also tend to provide their employees with health \ninsurance?\n  People in my State really cannot believe what is happening. We have \nlost\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\n21,000 manufacturing jobs since 2001. What a bloodless statistic. \nBehind every one of those numbers are 21,000 families, 21,000 families \nthat built ships, made steel, made garments and apparel, even made the \nkind of technology we use in high tech. Where did those jobs go? They \nwent on a slow boat to China. They went on a fast track to Mexico and a \ndial 1-800 anywhere. Why are they going? Because the Federal Tax Code \nsays it is OK.\n  The Federal Tax Code says, in fact, it is not only OK, we are going \nto give you a huge subsidy. I think we need to subsidize the good-guy \ncorporations. That is what I want to do. I believe that the Dorgan-\nMikulski amendment is a patriotic amendment. It is part of an economic \npatriotism that we have to start focusing on in this country. I don't \nwant my country, in a few years, to have the economic profile of a \nThird World country.\n  Vote for America, vote for patriotic economics, and vote for Dorgan-\nMikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as may be \nnecessary.\n  Again, this is not complicated. Levis used to be American. When you \nwould slip on a pair of Levis in the morning, you were wearing a pair \nof American pants. Not any longer. The manufacturer of Levis has gone \nto Mexico and China.\n  Fig Newtons. If you want some Mexican food, you can get Fig Newtons \nfrom Mexico. That old all-American Fig Newton cookie has gone to \nMexico.\n  Fruit of the Loom underwear has gone to Mexico.\n  I have mentioned previously Huffy bicycles. They have gone to China.\n  Do you know that little red wagon, the Radio Flyer? This one has gone \nto China.\n  The perversity of all of this is, whether it is Fig Newtons, Levis, \nRadio Flyers, Huffy bicycles, or Fruit of the Loom underwear, they were \nall rewarded for moving their jobs overseas because our Tax Code has \nembedded in it a special little deal: Move your jobs overseas and we \nwill give you a special deal.\n  We want to change that. According to the Joint Tax Committee, U.S. \ntaxpayers will pay $6.5 billion between 2004 and 2013 as tax incentives \nto U.S. companies that set up offshore subsidiaries to manufacture \nmerchandise and ship it back into this country. We have lost about 2.7 \nmillion manufacturing jobs in this country, and we have a perverse \nprovision in the Tax Code that says let's even enhance that by \nincentivizing those who would close their American factories and move \nthe jobs overseas.\n  This is not a new idea. This is a rather narrow amendment, by the \nway. We don't end deferral; we just end deferral with respect to U.S. \ncompanies that are manufacturing abroad and selling back into this \ncountry. President Kennedy tried to end the entire deferral system. \nPresident Nixon tried to end it. President Carter tried to end it. The \nSenate voted to end it in 1975. The House of Representatives voted to \nend it in 1987. In each case, the big economic interests that get \nrewarded for shipping American jobs overseas have won. The question is, \nwill they win today? We are losing jobs. We need to keep jobs in this \ncountry.\n  This amendment doesn't prevent a company that chooses to move Huffy \nbicycles or the little red wagons to China. It doesn't prevent a \ncompany from moving Fig Newton cookies, Fruit of the Loom, or Levis to \nMexico. But it does say if you are going to move those jobs, at least \nwe are not going to help pay for it with incentives in the Tax Code. \nThat is a simple enough proposition. This Senate should adopt this \namendment.\n  I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak against the Dorgan \namendment. I yield myself such time as I might consume. Before I speak \nspecifically to the amendment, since I heard the Senator from North \nDakota express his concerns--and legitimate concerns--about jobs going \noverseas, I think there might be some suggestion in this amendment that \nthis bill doesn't deal with moving jobs overseas.\n  This amendment is all about preserving manufacturing jobs in America \nand creating more manufacturing jobs in America, because the basis for \nthis legislation is that there is no benefit in this bill from the \nreduction of the corporate tax from 35 percent down to 32 percent for \nany organization that doesn't manufacture in the United States. So it \napplies to domestic manufacturers that are manufacturing in the United \nStates, not domestic manufacturers that manufacture overseas. It also \napplies to companies overseas--foreign companies--that would come to \nthe United States and invest here, create jobs here, and hire people in \nAmerica to manufacture here.\n  There is a lot of concern expressed about moving jobs overseas. I \ndon't denigrate any of those concerns. But that is what the debate on \nthis legislation has been all about for 1 whole week during the month \nof March, a few days during April, and now again this week. During that \nperiod of time of stalling, we have had a 5-percent European tax put on \nour exports to Europe--a percent again in April, and now a third \nmovement of 1 more percent. That is going to go on every month. Even if \nwe pass this bill this very minute, this bill probably won't be signed \nby the President for another month or so. We are going to continue to \nhave this terrible European tax put on our exports there.\n  I emphasize for listeners who ask, how can they do that? Well, it is \nlegal under international trade agreements. The reason it is legal is \nbecause we are trying to change our tax laws to conform with our \ninternational agreements--international agreements that this body has \nalready adopted.\n  So we are dealing with these amendments--probably very legitimate \nones--but we have had amendments put before this bill that have kept \nthis bill long enough on the agenda so that we are already 77 percent \nless competitive than we used to be with our global competition doing \nbusiness in Europe.\n  So why are we here? We are here with this underlying piece of \nlegislation to preserve and create more jobs in America.\n  We have heard the Senator from North Dakota make a very impassioned \ncase for American workers whose jobs have been lost when U.S. plants \nmove overseas. We have all witnessed this heart-wrenching event. I know \nthat my home State of Iowa has had plant closings or some parts of \nproduction move overseas. Unfortunately, this amendment will not do one \ndoggone thing to bring those jobs back. In fact, it could very well \ncost even more U.S. jobs.\n  I will explain my concerns by first examining his amendment. This \namendment repeals deferral for property imported into the U.S. by \nforeign subsidiaries of U.S. companies, even without regard to whether \nthat property was ever previously produced, manufactured, or grown in \nthe United States. This means the amendment doesn't focus on their \nprimary complaint that U.S. companies are shutting their plants, moving \nproduction offshore, and selling back into the United States.\n  The bill does not focus on this scenario. Instead, it overshoots the \nmark by hitting all goods sold into the United States by U.S. \ncompanies, even if it is impossible for those goods to first be \nproduced in the United States.\n  I will give an example. If a produce company sets up a banana farm in \nCosta Rica to import bananas into the United States and around the \nworld, the income from sales to the United States are not eligible for \ndeferral. I may be mistaken, but I am not aware of too many banana \nfarmers in Texas or Florida. So I do not see how deferring taxes on a \nbanana farm in Costa Rica is going to cost the United States jobs.\n  Similarly, if a U.S. company wanted to start a mining operation in \nsome far away land to extract a new and exotic mineral that is not \nfound here at home, they can sell that anywhere in the world, but they \ncould not and cannot import that back into the United States without \ntriggering this amendment.\n  How about coffee? The only place I know we grow coffee in the United \nStates is in Hawaii, and that was 25 years ago. Maybe they do not even \ngrow it there now. We have lots of coffee shops on our streets these \ndays. If they set up their own coffee plantation\n\n[[Page S4890]]\n\nin Brazil, they would get hit under this amendment that is before us. I \ndo not know whether we raise coffee anywhere else in the United States, \nbut we sure do not raise it in Iowa.\n  It appears the amendment of Senator Dorgan and Senator Mikulski would \nallow a U.S. company to sell foreign goods to anyone in the world \nexcept to America. That does not make sense to me.\n  I have described how the bill would operate, but I do not think that \nis the intent of this legislation. What I believe is intended is that \ndeferrals should be denied if a company closes a U.S. plant, produces \nthe goods offshore, and then imports the goods back into the United \nStates. This does not actually happen very often. The latest Department \nof Commerce data on U.S. multinationals shows that only 7 percent of \nforeign subsidiary sales were into the United States.\n  Nevertheless, this amendment insists that the rule of deferral in our \ntax law is somehow a tax benefit that moves jobs offshore and allows a \ncompany to not pay taxes on foreign income.\n  Of course, this is not true. Deferral has nothing to do with moving \njobs, and it never forgives taxes that are owed on foreign products of \nU.S. companies. The rule of deferral exists to keep U.S. companies \ncompetitive in the global marketplace. Let me repeat. The rule of \ndeferral exists to keep U.S. companies competitive in the global \nmarketplace, and it has been that way in our tax laws since 1918. For \n85 years it has been the law.\n  We are going to hear a great deal about deferrals this week. We will \nhear wild accusations about how this rule, which has been in place \nsince 1918, spells doom for American workers. None of this is true. In \nfact, just the opposite is true. By enhancing the international \ncompetitiveness of U.S. companies, deferral ensures an ever-growing \nbase of opportunity for U.S. companies and their employees at home and \nabroad.\n  U.S. multinationals are a critical component of our economy. These \ncompanies operate in virtually every industry and have investments of \nmore than $13 trillion in facilities located across our great country.\n\n  As employers, they provided 23 million jobs for Americans in 2001, \nnearly 18 percent of the payrolls in the country. With a payroll in \nexcess of $1.1 trillion, U.S. multinationals create more than 53 \npercent of the manufacturing jobs in America and employ more than two \nU.S. employees for every foreign worker.\n  During the 10 years between 1991 and 2001, U.S. multinationals \nincreased domestic employment at a faster rate than the overall \neconomy. We have a recent study confirming that U.S. multinationals are \nsignificant job creators, and those jobs are not created through \nexporting jobs to foreign nations with low labor and low tax costs, as \nthe amendment infers.\n  The Department of Commerce data shows that the bulk of U.S. \ninvestment abroad occurred in high-income, high-wage countries. In the \nyear 2001, 79 percent of the foreign assets and 67 percent of foreign \nemployment of U.S. multinationals were located in high-income, \ndeveloped nations, such as Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, New \nZealand, Singapore, South Africa, and the countries of the European \nUnion.\n  We have to remind ourselves that corporations are comprised of \npeople. People like good roads, safe water, reliable power grids, and \nstable societies. That is the only kind of environment where business \ncan flourish. So it is only rational that if a U.S. corporation is \ngoing to make a foreign investment, it is going to make the safest \ninvestment possible. That means going to fully developed countries with \nthriving markets and highly paid workers.\n  We also have to remember a simple maxim for why companies go into \nforeign markets: You have to be there to sell there.\n  Today, fully 95 percent of the world's population and 80 percent of \nthe purchasing power is located outside the United States. In other \nwords, the United States is 5 percent of the world's population. But if \nwe want to sell, we go where the people are. Ninety-five percent of the \npeople are outside the United States. If you want to make sales, you go \nwhere the people are.\n  We have an instance in which foreign sales growth has outstriped \ndomestic sales growth. So this increased growth requires increased \nforeign involvement. The good news is foreign growth also results in \nU.S. job growth.\n  A recent study confirmed that during the 10 years, 1991 through 2001, \nfor every job U.S. multinationals created abroad, they created nearly \ntwo jobs in the United States in their parent corporation. That is why \nit is critical to our company that U.S. companies remain competitive in \nthis international marketplace.\n  Let's review for a moment a more rational explanation for deferral \nand how it works to keep our U.S. companies competitive.\n  The United States taxes all of the worldwide income of its citizens \nand corporations. The U.S. income tax applies to all domestic and \nforeign earnings of U.S. companies. The United States fully taxes \nincome earned overseas by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. \nHowever, many foreign countries tax their companies on a territorial \nbasis, meaning they only tax income earned within their country's \nborders and do not impose tax on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\n  Countries that use a territorial system, such as Australia, Belgium, \nCanada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourgian, the \nNetherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland, among other countries, have a \ngreat advantage over a U.S. company.\n  We have to take that into consideration. The tax system is the cost \nof operation, and if we do not have a more level playing field for our \ncompanies, how do we expect to compete in this world marketplace?\n  I will give an example. A U.S. company with a Singapore subsidiary \nwill pay U.S. tax and a Singapore tax on the subsidiary's income. A \nFrench company with a Singapore subsidiary will pay Singapore tax but \nnot any tax in Paris. That means the U.S. company in Singapore has a \nhigher tax burden than the French company in Singapore. Two basic tax \nrules answer this problem and seek to put U.S. companies on a level \nplaying field with foreign competitors from territorial countries.\n  The first rule says when foreign income is brought home, the U.S. \nallows a reduction against U.S. tax for any foreign tax paid on that \nincome. This foreign tax credit prevents the U.S. from double-taxing \nforeign earnings. Does anybody believe in double taxing?\n  In effect, that would make our companies noncompetitive in this \ninternational marketplace. Like deferral, this too has been on the tax \nlaws of the United States since 1918. The foreign tax credit is \nlimited. It may only offset up to 35 percent of the U.S. corporate tax. \nIf the foreign tax rate is higher, the credit stops where we stop \ntaxing corporations at 25 percent. If the credit is lower, say 10 \npercent, then an additional U.S. tax will be owed up to the full 35 \npercent. In this example, the additional 25 percent of taxes would be \nowed to the U.S., which is the difference between the 10 percent and \nour 35-percent top rate.\n  The second basic tax rule is U.S. companies are allowed to defer U.S. \ntax on income from the active business operation of a foreign \nsubsidiary until that income is brought back to the United States, and \nthat is usually brought back in the form of a dividend paid to the U.S. \nparent. This is referred to as the rule of deferral, meaning the U.S. \ntax is deferred until the earnings are brought back. This is the rule \nthis amendment attacks.\n  It is important to note deferral is not a forgiveness of a tax. It \nsimply means we impose full U.S. tax tomorrow instead of today. We do \nnot forgive tax under deferral because we do not want to create \nincentives to move operations offshore. The reason we defer tax on \nactive business operations is so U.S. companies can remain competitive \nwith foreign companies, from those countries that have a territorial \ntax system.\n  We do not defer tax on passive activities such as setting up an \noffshore bank account. We tax passive activities yearly, and active \noperations are subject to competitive disadvantage. For example, if we \nimpose U.S. tax today on the profits of a Singapore subsidiary, then a \nU.S. company will pay 35-percent U.S. taxes plus any Singapore taxes, \nbut the French competitor located next door will only pay the Singapore \ntax and not the Paris tax.\n  If a Singapore tax rate is less than the 35-percent U.S. tax rate, \nthen the\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\nFrench competitor will have a tax advantage. This is because the U.S. \nallows the foreign tax credit offset against U.S. income tax imposed on \nthose foreign earnings but only up to a 35-percent top corporate rate.\n  If the foreign rate is less than the U.S. 35-percent rate, then \nresidual U.S. taxes are owed on the difference between the U.S. and \nforeign rates.\n  In another example, if the Singapore tax is 15 percent and the U.S. \ntax 35 percent, then the U.S. will impose an additional 20-percent tax \non those Singapore earnings. The French company, however, will only pay \n15 percent Singapore tax, no tax in Paris.\n  If we did not allow deferral of that additional 20-percent tax, then \nthe U.S. company today would have to pay 20-percent tax compared to the \nFrench company. The question on repealing deferral is whether we want \nto hand over the world markets to companies from France and Germany.\n  This amendment is being offered presumably to save jobs in America, \nbut when we have a tax system like they want, there is going to be an \nincentive for moving those jobs. Repealing deferral means we export our \nhigh U.S. tax rates to U.S. operations around the globe.\n  The U.S. has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. \nThere are very few countries with higher marginal corporate rates. This \nmeans without deferral, U.S. companies will be at a continual worldwide \ndisadvantage compared to their foreign competitors. That is why we \ndefer U.S. tax on active business operations, to allow U.S. companies \nto be competitive in the global marketplace.\n  Some Senators today propose repealing deferral or cutting back. These \nproposals would export the high U.S. tax rate to U.S. operations around \nthe world. That would be fine if all companies around the world were \npaying the high U.S. tax rate, but they are not. Companies of foreign \ncountries are not subject to our tax laws and are usually taxed at a \nlower rate.\n  That brings us back then to the implications of the amendment before \nthe Senate. Our focus in considering this amendment must be on the \nability of American companies to compete within the United States. The \nissue is not whether we tax foreign earnings currently but whether we \ncede the U.S. market to foreign competition: You compete or you die.\n  The Dorgan-Mikulski amendment will increase taxes on U.S. companies, \nbut their foreign competitors in the United States will not face a \nsimilar tax increase. This can lead to a loss of domestic market share, \nor even if market share is maintained losses may be incurred on \ndomestic sales because of pricing pressures and uncompetitive margins \ncreated by the additional tax burden.\n  The best measure of an economic impact of their tax increase is the \nvery concerns Senators Dorgan and Mikulski cite in debating their \namendment, whether U.S. employment levels of the U.S. companies will \ndrop after this additional tax is imposed. This goes to the issue of \nwhether salespeople, purchasing agents, line workers, or others could \nlose their jobs if the Dorgan-Mikulski tax increase is imposed on \ncompanies' imports.\n  Keep in mind their amendment would attack imports of bananas from \nCosta Rica and coffee from Brazil. That is going to cost U.S. jobs. The \namendment will kill U.S. jobs and the amendment is defeating its own \npurpose and should not be supported in the Senate.\n  If the objective of Senators Dorgan and Mikulski is to ensure \ncompanies do not reduce U.S. employment by round-tripping production, \nthen it is equally important to ensure their tax increase does not \nreduce U.S. employment.\n  Increasing taxes on U.S. companies will not bring those jobs back to \nAmerica. A company will only pay taxes if the company is profitable, \nand they will only stay profitable if they remain competitive in their \nmarkets. But in the United States, taxes are a 35-percent cost to \nprofit, and that is where a competitiveness disadvantage can occur when \nthe U.S. company is competing against foreign companies that will not \nincur this tax increase.\n\n  Senator Baucus and I, in trying to develop this bipartisan bill that \nis before us, held hearings last July regarding the effects of \ninternational competition within the United States. So I think we have \na right to believe we are very familiar with the domestic effects of \nthese kinds of rate differentials.\n  I would like to close with a quote from Joseph Guttentag, \nInternational Tax Counsel for the Clinton administration. He gave this \ntestimony before the Senate Finance Committee 9 years ago, July 21, \n1995. He said this:\n\n       Current U.S. tax policy generally strikes a reasonable \n     balance between deferral and current taxation in order to \n     ensure that our tax laws do not interfere with the ability of \n     our companies to be competitive with their foreign-based \n     counterparts.\n\n  I hope a statement from another administration, particularly from a \nrecent Democratic administration, the Clinton administration, will \ncarry a lot of weight with both Republicans and Democrats in helping to \ndefeat this amendment on which we will soon be voting.\n  I hope Senators will join me in voting against the job losses that \nwill result from this amendment and this tax increase that comes on \nAmerican business with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was sitting here wondering how someone \nwould actually support a tax provision that incentivizes the moving of \nU.S. jobs overseas. I thought: That is hard to support. I am going to \ncall this defense the banana defense because my colleague talked a \ncouple of times now about bananas from, I believe, Costa Rica. So we \nwill call that the banana defense.\n  I have great respect for my colleague from Iowa. I enjoy his work and \nI think he is a good legislator. But in my judgment, some of the \nstatements that have just been made are not accurate, and I would like \nto at least give a response to them so people understand.\n  First of all, this is not a tax increase. What a bunch of nonsense. \nThis eliminates a tax break for those companies who want to move jobs \noverseas. This is very simple. If we are going to shut down loopholes \nthat incentivize the moving of jobs overseas and have people call it a \ntax increase, I am sorry; it is not. That is not the purpose of it, \nthat is not the intention of it, and not the effect of it.\n  My colleague talks about the 35-percent corporate tax rate. I am \nsorry, he knows that is a statutory rate. He also knows very few \ncorporations pay a 35-percent tax rate.\n  Mr. President, 61 percent of the U.S. domestic corporations in this \ncountry pay zero--not 5 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, or 35 percent; \nthey pay zero. That is according to a recent GAO report. The rest that \ndo pay do not pay the 35-percent statutory rate. They pay substantially \nless than that.\n  About 40 to 50 years ago, corporations paid 40 percent of the total \ntaxes paid in this country. They now pay less than 9 percent, and the \nAmerican people, individuals, pick up the rest.\n  My colleague says this defers taxes; it doesn't mean we forgive \ntaxes. Of course, it does. This very bill brings to the floor of the \nSenate the most generous provision I have ever heard of. It says \nrepatriate all your earnings from overseas that have never been taxed, \nand we will let you be taxed at 5.25 percent. You repatriate it and we \nwill reduce your taxes to 5.25 percent. I say how about my constituents \nin North Dakota? Why don't we give all those constituents--regular \npeople, family farmers--an opportunity to pay a 5-percent tax rate? Why \njust the folks who decided to invest overseas? Why not everybody? If 5 \npercent is good enough for those who have over $600 billion in \nunrepatriated income, and you say bring it back and we will cut your \ntax rate to 5 percent, let's do it for the folks from Iowa and North \nDakota. Let me get their names and let's give them a 5-percent tax \nrate.\n\n  This notion we are not forgiving taxes is wrong. Of course we are \nforgiving taxes. This bill forgives taxes of those that are big enough \nto earn billions overseas, and says to them: If you want to repatriate \nit, we will give you a huge, big tax break.\n  Let me say with respect to the issue of a company that has never been \nlocated here with a manufacturing plant, deciding to manufacture in \nChina versus here--my proposal, and the amendment we have introduced, \ndeals only with sales back into this country. So the question that will \nbe asked by\n\n[[Page S4892]]\n\nsomeone who is building a manufacturing plant for the purpose of \nproducing the little red wagon called the Radio Flyer, for a company to \ndecide where to manufacture this, what the underlying provision in law \ndoes is to say: Make a decision. Either build it here or build it \nthere. By the way, if you decide to build it there--in this case \nChina--we will give you a tax break.\n  My colleague says this bill closes all these things--not true. In \nfact, it produces a very generous, juicy, big tax break at 5.25 \npercent, and in addition it leaves untouched this tax break.\n  I can quote a good number of economists who say there is embedded in \nthis tax law a provision that says build it here or build it there. \nMake a decision to build it there. Take it offshore. Take it outside \nthis country.\n  In my judgment, it ought not be a significant choice for this \nCongress to change this. This is a loophole that ought to be closed.\n  With respect to competition, my colleague talked about \ncompetitiveness. Let me ask this question. Let's assume that you are \nthe corporation that stays in this country to build a bicycle. Your \nmanufacturing plant is here. Now you are competing with the Huffy \nbicycle company that moved to China. The difference? They pay less in \ntaxes than you do because you stayed here and they left. What about \nthat competitiveness? What about the competitive issue of the company \nthat stayed and now pays higher taxes than the company that left? \nIncidentally, this company did leave. They fired the workers. Why? \nBecause it cost too much at $11 an hour to have them keep making \nbicycles in our country.\n  This cannot be obfuscated so much that we can't see what this \nquestion is before the Senate. Do you want to continue to have a Tax \nCode that incentivizes the movement of jobs overseas, or do you want to \nclose the loophole? This is not an attack on all ``deferral.'' This is \na much narrower amendment. The Senate is going to vote on this, and it \nis not going to be able to waltz around and tap dance. This is not \nabout having an American corporation with a foreign subsidiary in \nBangladesh that is producing a product to ship to South Korea, and \ntherefore it must be competitive with a company from France. That has \nnothing to do with this amendment. So in addition to the banana \ndefense, we now have the French defense, I guess, or the U.S. \ncorporation against French competition. I don't understand that. That \nis not what this amendment is about. We could debate that at some later \npoint, but it is not what this amendment is about.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I respect those who disagree with me. They have a right \nto disagree. My colleague ended with a quote from someone from the \nClinton administration. Let me quote Will Rogers. He said:\n\n       It's not what they know that bothers me. It's what they say \n     they know for sure that just ain't so.\n\n  In this case, this narrow question with respect to deferral simply \nasks whether we want to continue to make it beneficial for someone to \nclose a plant here and move it elsewhere, or to answer the question, if \nrequested: Should I build it here or build it there, to answer the \nquestion by saying let's build it there because our Tax Code provides a \nbenefit for me if I build it there. Move a job to China and our tax \nbill rewards you. Keep a job here and you actually face unfair \ncompetition because of the provision that is now in law, the one I want \nto get rid of. This is very simple. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the \nSenators from North Dakota and Maryland. I supported this amendment \nbecause it repeals an unfair provision that pulls jobs away from the \nAmerican manufacturing sector. I supported this amendment because it \ngives a tax break to companies who ship jobs overseas and then compete \nwith domestic manufacturers. And I supported this amendment because \nWisconsin has seen a steady decline in manufacturing jobs, with many of \nthese jobs being sent offshore because the U.S. Government would not \ntax their profits.\n  Under current law, a U.S. company that moves its manufacturing \noperations overseas may defer paying U.S. taxes on the profits it makes \nabroad until those profits are sent back to the U.S. This process, \nknown as deferral, clearly serves as a reward for foreign investment \nand for shifting jobs off American soil. This reward comes at the cost \nof American taxpayers; as much as $2.2 billion over 7 years is lost for \nthis misguided incentive. A tax policy that moves American jobs abroad \nat the expense of American taxpayers--clearly this is not something \nthat Congress should continue to endorse.\n  In addition to providing an incentive to move overseas, current law \nputs domestic manufacturers who keep jobs in the U.S. at a competitive \ndisadvantage. While foreign companies can reinvest profits abroad \nwithout paying any U.S. taxes, U.S.-based manufacturers investing in \nAmerican jobs have their profits subject to U.S. taxes. Multinational \ncompanies should pay the same taxes that domestic companies pay, and \ncompanies keeping jobs in America should not be penalized for doing so.\n  This is especially true given the continuing job loss in the \nmanufacturing sector. Wisconsin has been especially hard hit by the \nloss of manufacturing jobs to overseas competitors. My State is one \nwhere manufacturing jobs have historically made up the core of our \neconomy. Due in part to tax incentives such as deferral, Wisconsin has \nlost one out of every seven manufacturing jobs since 2000. The State's \neconomy has not been able to absorb this increase in unemployed \nworkers, resulting in a stagnant unemployment rate.\n  The Dorgan-Mikulski amendment would repeal the tax incentive for \nAmerican companies to move overseas. Our Tax Code should not endorse \nthe continued loss of American jobs to companies investing overseas. \nThe Dorgan-Mikulski amendment is the first part of a prolonged solution \nto the continuing loss of American manufacturing jobs. The amendment \nwould partially repeal deferral, and targets the repeal to apply only \nto firms that move production overseas but continue to sell those \nproducts in the U.S. Thus, the amendment would repeal the competitive \nadvantage that companies moving their production facilities offshore \ncurrently receive.\n  At a time when the country's manufacturers are struggling, we cannot \ncontinue to give a benefit for those companies who send American jobs \nabroad. We must bring equity to the tax code, and bring jobs back to \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think I have about 3\\1/2\\ minutes. I \nam going to take 1\\1/2\\ minutes for myself, and then I hope Senator Kyl \nwill get over here. He asked me for 2 minutes. Then that would use up \nour time.\n  The first reaction to the response to my remarks that I have that I \nwant to clear up is that the author of the amendment speaks to the \npoint that it only hits imports coming into the United States if a \ncompany moved overseas. The fact is--it may be a flaw in the way it is \nwritten--this amendment hits all imports coming into the United States.\n  The second point is, it was stated that this was not a tax increase. \nThis amendment raises $6.5 billion. In my judgment, when you change tax \nlaw and you bring revenue in, that is a tax increase.\n  The second issue regarding Huffy moving overseas, the response to \nthat is, their competition is in China and Taiwan. Companies have to do \nwhat they can to meet the competition. Would they rather have a Huffy \ncompany that existed as a U.S. corporation competing with China and \nTaiwan manufacturers or would they rather have the whole company go out \nof business? If you do not meet your competition, you do not compete \nyou die.\n  Then there was reference to the fact the GAO report says 61 percent \nof companies did not pay taxes. That could be true. But that also \nincludes new companies and it includes companies that maybe are \ndormant; in fact, it does include all of those.\n  Here is the significant thing about this GAO report: It says 96 \npercent of all large corporations in America pay tax.\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\n  We are back to the issue of what this amendment does or does not do. \nIt does not do enough.\n  I have to ask the Presiding Officer if Senator Kyl does not arrive \nand I have 1 or 2 minutes remaining, what do I do? I want to save the \ntime for him, if I can, under the rules of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and save my time for Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Kyl is here.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't have much time remaining, 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Could the Senator be kind enough to give him an \nadditional minute and a half for our side? That is infinitesimal. We \nwill argue for a minute and a half over it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that a minute and a half be added \nto the Republican side and a minute and a half be added to our side.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield Senator Kyl my remaining time.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Iowa and I thank the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it seems to me the amendment of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota does both too little and too much. A lot of thought \nwent into crafting the bill before the Senate by staff and members on \nthe Finance Committee. It is hard to get this exactly right. We have \ndone that. This is very complicated.\n  What I mean by doing too little and too much is this: The amendment \nonly affects about 7 percent of the products according to the Commerce \nDepartment; 7 percent of the goods and services these multinational \ncorporations produce are imported back into the United States. That is \nthe only part of the new deferral rule that would be affected.\n  In that sense, it probably does not do much to accomplish the \npurposes of the authors of the amendment. But it does too much in the \nsense that anything that impedes the competitive advantage of the U.S. \ncorporations and the quality of their products is going to hurt their \nability to do business.\n  What we have tried to do with the deferral rules is to even the \nbalance between the European corporations, for example, and the \nAmerican corporations, so our companies are not taxed more than their \ncompetitors. This would, to the extent it changes these deferral rules, \nimpose a higher tax on American businesses than their European \ncounterparts are required to pay. In that sense, it changes this \ncompetitive balance. It is exactly what we are trying to get away from.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, acknowledge the work of the Finance Committee which, as I \nsaid, very carefully tried to get this balance right and ensure \nAmerican companies would not be at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis \ntheir European competitors.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and support the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes total on the minority side \nremains. The Senator from North Dakota has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me consume the 2\\1/2\\ minutes. Does \nthat include the 1\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does not.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Baucus has left the room. Let me \nconsume 5 minutes, with Senator Baucus's consent, of the minority time \nafter which I will yield back the time and I believe all time will have \nbeen yielded back on this issue. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make a couple of comments about the facts. First \nof all, the number of manufacturing jobs we have lost in this country. \nThis chart shows the number of manufacturing jobs we have lost since \nthe year 2000, a little over 2.7 million manufacturing jobs.\n  One cannot make the case this is not a problem. Of course, we are \nlosing manufacturing jobs. The number of jobs in foreign manufacturing \naffiliates of U.S. firms has grown by a million in an 8-year period. \nSo, of course, they are gaining jobs. We are losing manufacturing jobs \nand they are gaining jobs. It is hard to make the case there is not an \nissue here.\n  Now with respect to the issue of the corporations, 61 percent of whom \npay no taxes according to the GAO, my colleague says, well, probably \nsome of them are dormant. The U.S. corporations made $2.7 trillion in \ngross income on which they paid zero in taxes. If that is dormancy, it \nis an interesting state of affairs, in my judgment.\n  Second, the issue of Huffy bicycles. I have used the issue of Huffy \nbicycles and the Radio Flyer wagon to make the point. The point is jobs \nare migrating overseas. This Radio Flyer red wagon was made here for a \ncentury and now it is being made in China. This Huffy bicycle was made \nhere for a long time. Now it is gone. It is made in China. We saw the \nlittle red wagons and Huffy bicycles leave America and move to China.\n  With respect to Huffy, the workers here made $11 a hour. The company \nsaid that is way too much; I will hire a Chinese worker at 33 cents an \nhour, 7 days a week, 12 hours a day.\n  As we did that, we said, We will give you a tax break. Move this \nplant to China and we will give you a tax break. That is what our \namendment would shut down.\n  I was trying to think how would we construct a defense, or how will I \nhear a defense about this, and it started out with trade. The Europeans \nare hitting us with these trade sanctions. Yes, well, we are really \nweak-kneed on trade. This country has a beef problem with Europe, so we \nslap them around. Do you know what we do with the Europeans? We slap \nthem around with sanctions on truffles, goose liver, and Roquefort \ncheese. My God, that will send fear into an adversary.\n  If Members want to talk trade, spend time talking about trade and \nwonder why we do not have a spine and backbone and strong knees to \nstand up for this country for a change.\n\n  But this is not about trade. This is about an insidious, perverse \nlittle provision in the Tax Code that says, Move your jobs, decide to \nbuild overseas rather than here, and we will give you a little tax \nbreak.\n  If we cannot take a baby step in doing this, if we cannot close this \nloophole, what on Earth can we do?\n  With respect to the fact it is alleged this is a tax increase, my \nguess is almost everything will be alleged to be a tax increase in the \nfuture. It does not matter what you talk about, they will say it is a \ntax increase. Is closing a loophole that is fundamentally unfair, that \nincentivizes the moving of American jobs overseas, is that really a tax \nincrease, or is it closing a loophole? Do you want to keep doing this?\n  Should we take taxpayers' money, incentivize it to say, let's pay \nthese guys to move bicycles and red wagons overseas? Or, let's pay them \nto move Fig Newton cookies to Mexico, or pay them to move tennis shoes \nto Indonesia. Is that what we want to do, pay them to do that? That is \nwhat exists in our Tax Code.\n  This is the simplest possible amendment. If Members want to support \nAmerican jobs and want to at least have a neutral Tax Code and want to \nstop the perversity of saying let's actually help finance and keep jobs \nfrom moving overseas, then vote for this. If you want to talk about \ncompetition between Bangladesh and France and Costa Rica, and construct \nall kinds of interesting theories that have nothing to do with this \namendment, then vote against it. There is nothing wrong with that. I \nhave lost before. I hope I will not lose today.\n  This amendment will come up again and again because this country \nshould not be subsidizing the loss of jobs to other countries. Those \njobs are going in part because they can buy 33 cent an hour labor and \nput 12 people in a room and work them 7 days a week and say, if you try \nto organize as a group of workers, you are fired. If you complain about \nan unsafe work plant, you are fired. So that is the incentive to move \njobs overseas.\n  On top of that, we actually, in public policy, say we will buy you a \nlittle cherry on top of the sundae. The cherry on top of the sundae is \nyou actually get a tax break here. The company you are competing \nagainst, that you left back\n\n[[Page S4894]]\n\nin the United States--tough luck for them. They are paying higher taxes \nthan you are.\n  It seems to me if we cannot think our way through this short little \nmaze, this Congress cannot think its way through anything. This is not \norganizing a two-car caravan. This is simple. This is easy. And the \nchoice, when we cast this vote, is not going to be complicated at all. \nEither you believe this incentive should not be in the Tax Code or you \nbelieve we ought to continue to subsidize jobs that are moved overseas.\n  We have more to do. We have a debate on trade that has to come. I \ndon't expect we will get to the debate on trade because of the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. It should be brought to the floor and \ndebated, but will not be before the election because, I am guessing, \nthe President does not want to have that debate--I would love it. Let's \nget it here tomorrow, as far as I am concerned.\n  There is much more to discuss on this issue. With respect to this \nalone, the Senator from Maryland and I have offered an amendment that \nis painfully simple and I hope will be painless to vote for.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Chair advise the Senate with \nregard to the time agreements at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired on the majority side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, can the Senator from Virginia ask for a \nperiod of 5 minutes to discuss a matter of importance to all Senators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                 Notice Of Hearing And Briefing On Iraq\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this morning I had the privilege of \nengaging in a colloquy with the distinguished minority leader with \nregard to the desire of the Senate to have Secretary Rumsfeld come in \nopen session and respond to questions from Senators with regard to the \nvery serious situation of allegations about the mistreatment of \nprisoners in Iraq.\n  Senator Daschle, Senator Frist, and I--Senator Frist and I worked on \nit yesterday together; we worked on it again today--Senator McCain, \nSenator Levin--I just left him--so there has been a group of us who \nhave worked on this.\n  I just finished a conversation with Secretary Rumsfeld, and he has \nalways been quite willing to come up. It is a question of the time and \nthe ability to get together a team of witnesses to join him. That has \nnow been concluded. So the distinguished majority leader and I have set \nthe time for this to be 11:45 on Friday morning for a session of \napproximately 2 hours with the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nFollowing that, the respective leaders of the Senate will have the \nusual type of briefing in S-407, at which time other Senators not \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee will have the opportunity to \nengage the Secretary in questions with regard to their individual \nconcerns on this and such other topics as they may have.\n  I thank my colleagues. Many of you have come to me and spoken about \nthat, and spoken to Senator Levin, and to our leaders. There is always \na willingness on behalf of the Secretary to come forward. He will be \njoined by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, the Acting Secretary of the Army, and perhaps others, because I \nwas very insistent and he was quite willing to provide a full array of \nwitnesses such that the entire spectrum of facts now known and \navailable can be shared openly with the Senate and the general public.\n  I thank the Chair. I hope all colleagues can arrange their schedules \nto attend these very important meetings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority manager has 8\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I can yield \nback. I also suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before we move on this amendment, I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 4 minutes of debate equally divided \nprior to the vote in relation to the Allard amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3110\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Dorgan \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to table the Dorgan amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Allen amendment No. 3118.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in behalf of amendment No. \n3118. This amendment is important to nearly all States in this time of \nenergy shortages. It provides for and encourages the use of renewable \nenergy.\n  I am pleased to have cosponsorship from Senators Miller, Clinton, \nSchumer, and Chambliss.\n  Passage of the green bonds provision is relevant to the JOBS bill. It \nis anticipated to create over 100,000 construction and permanent jobs.\n  It also promotes the large-scale development and deployment of \nrenewable energy generation. This will stimulate the market for \nrenewable technologies, such as solar, helping to bring down the cost \nof technology.\n  I also believe it is important to note that our amendment contains a \nprovision which pays for its costs.\n  In closing, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment. \nIt is limited only by the amount of total bonding authority and the \nfact that each State is allowed only one project. I think every State \ncan work to take advantage of the benefits that this amendment will \nprovide.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spoken to the Democratic leader, I \nhave spoken to our manager. On our side we have six amendments \nremaining. I mention them by name: Feingold, 5 minutes on his side; \nLautenberg, 30 minutes; Corzine, 30 minutes; Cantwell, 30 minutes; \nHollings, 40 minutes; Landrieu, 30 minutes. This bill can be completed \nin a relatively short time. I understand the Members would rather not \nvote on some of these amendments, but I want the record to reflect we \nwould agree to these very short time limits. There are no surprises in \nany of the amendments. Everyone knows what they are. Certainly on \nHollings and Landrieu, we have agreed with the majority these could be \nnext in order.\n  The problem we have, everyone should understand, is Senator Cantwell \nwill not let us do the unanimous consent agreement unless we have some \nway of disposing of her amendment. I have also been contacted by \nSenator Corzine, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Feingold. They will \nagree to no more unanimous consent agreements unless they are included \nin the order in some way.\n  I repeat: Each of these Senators wants this bill passed. None of them \nis trying to stall. They understand the importance of this legislation. \nBut add up all the time on our side, and it is about 2 hours 45 \nminutes. That is all that is remaining on debate time on our side. I \nhope we recognize and can figure out some way to get through these \namendments and get this bill passed. I see no reason we could not do it \ntomorrow easily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, first of all, there has been a very \ngood working relationship between the two sides on this bill. That is \nvery encouraging. I recognize that upfront.\n  In regard to the list of amendments, the fact that it is very short, \nwith time agreements, is very good news. However, in that list of \namendments, there are some that are nongermane, some that are very \ncontroversial, some on our side of the aisle we do not think are \nappropriate to be brought up on this legislation; and also a reminder \nthat we have only dealt with two Republican amendments at this point \nand we have dealt with a lot of amendments on the other side. Now, \nthere is nothing wrong with dealing with more amendments on one side \nthan on the other, and we have been very fair in how we have approached \nthis.\n  I don't have a response to the Senator from Nevada, the distinguished \nDemocratic assistant leader. We intend to work very closely with him to \nsee if we can get this bill to finality. In the same way we have gotten \nthis far this week--we have made a great deal of progress--it is \nbecause we have had a good working relationship with the Senator from \nNevada and the Senator from Montana.\n  I cannot state an agreement at this point. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. Is the Cantwell \namendment now the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Cantwell amendment is the pending \namendment.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see the Senator from Washington on her feet and ready \nto address the Senate. As I understand, she would be willing to set a \ntime for a vote on her amendment sometime in the morning. So we can \ngive the Senate some idea what the program will be, I am just wondering \nnow whether the floor managers would be willing to agree to a time \nlimit on the amendment of the Senator from Washington, for a vote on it \nin the late morning tomorrow, with the time to be divided.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, to respond to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, first of all, not involving me but other people that are \ninterested--I am interested--I have asked other members to see what \ncould be negotiated. There are talks ongoing now that range from, \nhopefully, we can establish a couple other amendments for votes before \nthat. Part of that discussion is seeing if we can reach an agreement on \nbringing up the amendment. However, I don't have anything to report to \nSenator Kennedy at this point.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Again, I don't want to interfere with the Senator from \nWashington, but I know the Senator has attempted to get this amendment \nup, at my last count, some 14 times over the period of the last 7 or 8 \nmonths. Now it is before the Senate. She is entitled to have it \nconsidered.\n  It is an amendment of enormous importance to working families in this \ncountry. We have 85,000 workers who, each week, lose their unemployment \ninsurance. This represents an extremely important issue to hard-pressed \nmiddle-income families that are trying to make ends meet and facing \nserious issues in terms of the increase in health care costs, increases \nin tuition, increases in terms of their utilities, their mortgage \npayments. This is a lifeline to hundreds of thousands of American \nfamilies. This is a matter of enormous importance. It is not just a \nminor amendment. For many of us, it is the most important or perhaps \nthe second most important outside of the overtime amendment on this \nbill.\n  I thank the Senator for Washington for her perseverance on behalf of \nthe working families of this country, commend her for her diligence in \nprotecting their interests, and look forward to following her \nleadership, hopefully getting the opportunity to have a reasonable \nperiod of time and then have the Senate express its will. I certainly \nhope we would not have the blind opposition to this amendment we have \nfaced in the past when Members have tried to basically handcuff the \nSenate from being able to give consideration to this amendment.\n  I commend the Senator from Washington for her diligence and \nperseverance. This is a matter of enormous importance and enormous \nconsequence to the people of my State, I know to the people in her \nState, and for people all over this country. I commend her for \ndeveloping the bipartisanship she has with the Senator from Ohio and \nother Senators. This has been a bipartisan effort she has led. That is \nthe way it should be because, obviously, the workers who need this help \nare from all parts of the country and represent all kinds of different \nviewpoints.\n  I thank her for her leadership and look forward to following this \nissue.\n\n[[Page S4896]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to speak to one provision in \nthe FSC/ETI tax legislation we are considering on the Senate floor \nwhich is very imporant--the broadband expensing provision. This \nprovision would allow investments in broadband infrastructure, or high-\nspeed Internet access, to be deducted for tax purposes in the year the \ninvestment was made rather than over several years. The simple point of \nthis provision is to stimulate new technology investment.\n  We have worked on the bill since mid-2000, and it is time to see it \nenacted. I am particularly pleased to have worked with Senator \nRockefeller on this issue and to join him in sponsoring legislation to \nprovide a broadband tax incentive. He and I go back quite a few years \non technology matters. We worked side by side to ensure that all of our \nNation's schools are wired for basic Internet service, and that has \nbeen a tremendous success. I also appreciate the effective work Senator \nBurns has done to fight for broadband investment.\n  It is time to move beyond basic dial-up service. Dial-up is adequate \nfor sending e-mail, and sharing short documents, and browsing the web \nslowly. But if you need to receive information quickly, or if you need \nsomething that is data-intensive like photographs or graphics or \nlengthy documents, then you need broadband.\n  Unfortunately, in rural States like mine, broadband deployment is not \nproceeding quickly enough. And that is what this provision is \ndesignated to address--the rural and low-income areas where broadband \ngenerally is not already or readily available. It is designed to help \nus move to the next generation of broadband that some countries are \nalready rolling out. There are times when it makes sense to help the \nmarket deploy technology more quickly, and this is one of those times. \nWhy? Because here we are taking about infrasturcture, and the \nGovernment can help ensure that all our citizens have access to basic \ninfrastructure so all Americans regardless of their zip code will have \nthe chance to participate in--and succeed under--the tremendous \nbenefits of new technologies.\n  It is critical we act quickly in this area. A report by the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development finds that the \nUnited States has dropped to sixth in the world in percentage of \nbroadband penetration. We must not sit idly by and allow the United \nStates to fall further behind in this crucial area.\n  In addition to accelerating the deployment of broadband, the \nprovision will also infuse immediate stimulus for the economy by \nencouraging firms to invest in high-speed telecom equipment. \nFurthermore, these new capital expenditures will create jobs--equipment \nmanufcturers will expand their production capabilities to meet \nincreased demand, and broadband providers with hire additional \nemployees to install this new infrastructure.\n  We must engage on this issue and we must do it now. I thank Senator \nRockefeller for his leadership and partnership on this issue, and the \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee for their support, \nand I look forward to passing this provision and seeing it enacted this \nyear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to a period of morning business with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, will the Senator hold back for a second \nbefore making that request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I will. Madam President, I withdraw my unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa yield the floor?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I withdraw my unanimous consent \nrequest and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this is a good bill on which we have \nmade a lot of progress. There are a lot of good amendments yet \noutstanding. It is amazing how much is in this bill that is so \npositive.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, it is important \nfor us to go the extra mile, to see if there is a way to compromise. I \nwill say that again: both sides of the aisle.\n  Here we have the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington, \nand we are kind of at a little bump in the road. But this can be \nresolved. This is resolvable. I hope very much we are not in a \nsituation where backs stiffen up and people dig their heels in the \nground and pride becomes the overriding emotion. Rather, we are very \nclose to resolving a very important issue. So I ask that cooler heads \nprevail over the evening, to sleep on it, and tomorrow morning--and/or \ntonight--find a way to resolve this issue; otherwise, people could see \nthe Senate not at its best. There is an opportunity, a real \nopportunity, for Senators to show they can work together on both sides \nof the aisle on very important matters.\n  We know none of us can have everything. We also know for things that \nare important and worthwhile, generally it takes some give-and-take and \ncompromise. We are almost there.\n  I thank the Senators for how far we have come thus far, and I urge us \nto work together to find a solution to these remaining amendments so we \ncan get the bill passed very quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, will the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee allow a modification to his \nrequest, that the Senator from Washington be allowed to speak for 10 \nminutes prior to us going into morning business?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Limited to speaking, and no requests or anything like \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. My request would be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure the \nSenator from Washington be allowed to speak and there be no unanimous \nconsent requests made pertaining to her amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could respond, the Senator from \nWashington is protected. Her amendment is the next amendment. I mean, \nit is an amendment that is now before the Senate, and she understands \nnothing is going to happen on this bill until there is an agreement in \nsome regard to her vote. She is not going to ask at this period of time \nfor a unanimous consent. She does not need to be protected.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield further, the unanimous consent \nrequest only limits time; is that correct?\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues we are here \ntalking about a JOBS bill. That is what we are talking about, how we \nkeep jobs in America. So I think it is more than appropriate to be \ntalking about one of the biggest problems in our country right now, the \nfact we have not created jobs. We have lost 2 million jobs since this \nadministration began. It is more than appropriate to be discussing the \nunemployment benefits American workers need because they have lost \njobs, through no fault of their own, since 9/11 and have been \nstruggling to get recognition by this body and the other body on \nunemployment benefits.\n  We still have 1.5 million Americans who have exhausted State benefits \nand have not gotten assistance from this body, the Senate, which now \nwants to talk about a JOBS bill. Well, the most important jobs issue we \nare facing in America right now is that people who are trying to go \nback to work would love to be getting a paycheck instead of an \nunemployment check, and yet we are not giving them the option to have \nsupport in a program they have already paid into through their employer \nfor unemployment benefits.\n  So what are people across the country saying? As the Senator from \nMassachusetts pointed out, we have had\n\n[[Page S4897]]\n\nsomething like 15 different attempts to get unemployment benefits for \nworkers who are trying to find jobs but are not finding jobs available. \nThey are certainly people who would rather work.\n  The Dayton Daily News recently said:\n\n       What's troubling . . . is how some Republican leaders are \n     hoisting another ``Mission Accomplished'' banner, this one to \n     hide the struggle for more than a million unemployed workers \n     who have exhausted state benefits without finding another \n     job.\n\n  That is not what this Senator is saying. That is what a newspaper in \none of the hardest hit States is saying about this particular problem, \nthe fact we cannot simply say on a certain day the economy is better \nand Americans are back to work, when, for the first part of this year, \nwith last month's numbers, we only created somewhere between 300,000 \nand 400,000 new jobs. We have lost 2 million jobs since this \nadministration has been in power.\n  We had an economic report by the administration that they were going \nto create all sorts of jobs in 2002. That did not come about. In 2003 \nthere was another projection. That did not happen. Now we are in 2004. \nAnd even though the administration said they thought they were going to \ncreate, I think the number was 2.6 million jobs this year, the \nPresident's own economic advisers backed off of those numbers and said: \nWe don't know how many jobs are going to be created.\n\n  Well, I can tell them, having been in the private sector, trying to \ndetermine whether a company is growing at a rate in which you can \nresume hiring is a tough question. So I get that this is a complicated \nissue, and we do not know how fast our economy is going to grow. But we \nknow this: We are not going to find 2 million jobs in the next 6 \nmonths. We are not going to hire 2 million Americans who basically have \nlost their jobs, and in many cases through no fault of their own, and \nput them back to work in that short a period of time.\n  The question is whether we want to give the American worker who is \nunemployed an opportunity to receive the Federal benefit this program \nwas created for, what they paid into through their employer so there \ncould be assistance in tough economic times.\n  Well, if the last year and a half does not qualify for tough economic \ntimes, I don't know what would. Newspapers across the country are \nsaying it is time we deal with this.\n  The Dayton Daily News again said early last month:\n\n       Maybe there are brighter days ahead. But that's no comfort \n     now to the unprecedented number of laid-off workers, who have \n     scrambled without success to find a job and . . . lost the \n     little bit of help given under state unemployment benefits \n     programs.\n\n  It cannot be any more plain than that. The President is on a bus \ndriving through a State that is basically saying, as crisply and \nclearly as they possibly can: We need additional help and support. The \nState program has expired. People are still unemployed, and they cannot \nfind a job. These people would gladly go back to work, gladly go back \nto getting health benefits, gladly go back to getting the other \nbenefits of being employed, but the jobs are not there. So the question \nis whether we are going to do the job we have said we were going to do.\n  In fact, you can take the economists who are also looking at this, \nbecause I think part of the other side of the aisle would like to say: \nDon't worry, it is all going to get better. But even if we double last \nmonth's numbers, even if in the next 2 months we created 500,000 or \n600,000 jobs, it still isn't going to be enough jobs for the 2 million \nAmericans who have lost their way. So why not put some stimulus into \nthe economy.\n  That is why the Miami Herald said last month: Mixed messages, the \nWhite House gets a boost from strong job growth, but economists say \nunemployment will remain a problem.\n  That is because economists are looking at the numbers and they are \nsaying: You are still going to have unemployment.\n  It is no surprise that Alan Greenspan came before a House committee \nand, when asked about whether we should expand Federal unemployment \nbenefits, basically said: I think it is a good idea, largely due to the \nnumber of exhaustees that are out there in America. By that he means \nthe number of people who have fallen off the State program and could \nqualify for Federal assistance.\n  I know some of my colleagues have said they want to cut this program \noff at some point in time: Why should we keep doing it; the economy is \nstarting to pick up.\n  You do it because these exhaustees don't have a job. They can't pay \nmortgage payments, take care of health care. Their employer paid into \nthis program for this very benefit. This is the best economic stimulus \nthis country could get right now. Giving employees access to the \nassistance of the Federal program for the next 6 months would generate \n$11 billion in economic stimulus. That is for every dollar spent on \nunemployment benefits, it generates $2 of economic stimulus.\n  I think about the States that have been hard hit, such as Ohio, \nPennsylvania, Missouri, Washington, Oregon, Alaska. Those are States \nthat certainly could use the economic stimulus in their States to keep \ncompanies from not defaulting on mortgage payments, keep families in \ntheir home, and provide additional stimulus to those sagging economies.\n  People on the other side of the aisle say: At some point in time, the \nPresident's economic plan is going to kick in and work. But I don't \nthink anybody can say it is going to kick in and work in the next 2 \nmonths to the degree necessary to take care of the number of \nunemployed. It is not going to take care of 1.5 million. It is not \ngoing to take care of 2 million people who have lost their jobs and 1.5 \nmillion who have already exhausted State benefits.\n  The question is whether this body is going to stand up and do the \nright thing and come up with a program to expand unemployment benefits \nfor the next several months so unemployed workers in America can have \nsome certainty they are going to have a future where they can stay in \ntheir home.\n  I am having a tough time convincing the other side of the aisle. \nMaybe they haven't heard from their constituents on this issue. I think \nthere are one or two States that may not have lost any manufacturing \njobs. Maybe their constituents don't feel the same pain that we do in \nthe Northwest. In 2002 alone, we lost 72,000 jobs in our State, mostly \nas a result of the downturn after 9/11 and its impact on the aviation \nindustry, but certainly other industries as well. So we have had a lot \nof people who have continued to look for jobs. We have heard from a lot \nof these individuals. We have a Web site anybody can access at \ncantwell.senate.gov that tells you the stories of these individuals in \ntheir own words.\n\n  What each person tells over and over is how much they would like to \nhave a job, how many job interviews they have gone on, only to find \npeople five and six times more qualified than they taking the minimal \nnumber of jobs that are actually being created. That is why one of the \nchief economists in the country, Alan Greenspan, has said the size of \nthe exhaustees alone should drive us to expand unemployment benefits. \nIt would, in and of itself, give us the stimulus that would help us \nreturn the economy.\n  We had a vote not that long ago. Fifty-eight Members in this body \nvoted in support of unemployment benefits. There was a similar vote, \nnot the exact same language, in the House of Representatives. They \nvoted to basically give an extension of unemployment benefits through \nthe Federal program. So basically majorities in both the House and the \nSenate have voted for unemployment benefits. Yet still we do not have a \nbenefit package.\n  The administration was asked whether they thought we should do this. \nSecretary of the Treasury Snow basically said it was something the \nWhite House wasn't objecting to. We asked the White House in their \ncommunications shop. They said they thought it should get done.\n  Now the question remains, who wants to hold up this benefit package? \nThe American workers have paid into this. They want the money they paid \ninto the Federal program to give them economic support so we can give \npeople an opportunity to go back to work when jobs are created and not \npenalize them for the economic situation they are in today.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4898-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4898]]\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are several other points I would \nlike to make. I know some people are thinking, why not do this for a \nshorter program. Why not expand the program for maybe another 60 days. \nThe point is, where are we going to be in 60 days? Even if, say, we get \na report on Friday that says there are 300,000 jobs being created and \nthe next month there are 300,000 jobs being created, you still have at \nthat point 1.4 million Americans looking for work; that is, people who \nhave completely exhausted their State benefits.\n  My constituents are making all sorts of choices. They are putting up \ntheir homes for sale. They are moving in with relatives. They are \nselling family possessions to pay mortgage payments. They are trying to \nhold on so this economy recovers. And they are hoping the next several \nmonths will bring good economic news, as I hope it does. I hope the \nnext several months brings good economic news. But even if we have good \neconomic news, we are not going to have the return of 1.4 million \npeople or 2 million people back to work in the next several months. The \nquestion is, do we want to meet our obligation under the Federal \nprogram and help them.\n  In the 1990s we had a very similar situation. We had an economic \ndownturn and the first Bush administration basically had to come up \nwith a program for unemployment benefits. They actually had already had \nthe program in place for more than a year and had good economic news. I \nthink more than 600,000 jobs had been created. The administration still \nsupported another 9-month extension to unemployment benefits.\n  Actually, they supported that 9-month extension, even with a richer \nprogram than what we are suggesting today. We are suggesting that the \nprogram ought to go for 13 weeks of Federal program and 13 weeks for \nvery high unemployment States. At that point, the program was 20 weeks. \nSo in the 1990s, the Bush administration decided, even though it had \nseen more than a half million in job growth--I think they had several \nmillion in job loss--even though they had seen the economy pick up, \nthey made the decision that so many people had been impacted, laid off, \nand could not find work, that it was important to give them access to \nthe Federal program. So they expanded the program for another 9 months.\n  Now, I know this administration is now, as I said, through various \nmembers of its Cabinet, backing away from its economic numbers for the \nyear, but it is also saying they would support an unemployment benefit \npackage that would come out of the House and Senate. I say to the \nadministration, obviously, we are not getting this bill done in the \ntimely fashion that would benefit most Americans. Maybe they can come \nand help in this effort because the preceding Bush administration did a \ngreat job supporting the package, even though jobs were starting to be \ncreated, to stem the tide of job loss and negative impact on the \neconomy, and still the economy started to pick up again. So we should \ndo the same.\n  I think the administration should take some time, as it is riding \naround Ohio--and some of these middle America States have been hard hit \nwith unemployment benefits--and listen to the people who have lost \njobs. They will tell them this program is important to them, as I just \noutlined from several newspaper editorials that have been in the Dayton \npaper, specifically. I am sure there are editorials from other places \nthroughout the Midwest as well. I know we had editorials from more than \na dozen newspapers wondering why we were not moving forward on this \nlegislation.\n  So the point is, we have a case study in the 1990s--and a good one--\nthat this administration should follow. This administration should look \nat the success of that program, how jobs were being created, and still \nthey expanded unemployment benefits because they knew it would take \nseveral months to put that many Americans back to work. That is what we \nare talking about today. We are talking about a jobs proposal that \nreally is what we are going to do to incentivize or disincentivize \ncorporations from moving overseas or doing business overseas. That is \nwhat the FCI/ETI bill is primarily about.\n  While we are debating what is good to massage the intention of \ncorporations in America, we should be talking about what we are doing \nto support the American workers who lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own. Why try to mastermind and guess about corporate intentions \nand incentive in the tax policy but then leave American workers who \nhave a program that is designed to help them out in the cold without an \nopportunity?\n  We have fought this battle a couple of times now. We fought it last \nyear when the benefits expired and got it reinstated. We fought it when \npeople actually lapsed off of benefits and we had to get them to \nunderstand that when we came back into session, the benefits were going \nto be restored. But now many Americans have lost hope. It has been \nsince January 1 these people have been without benefits. Given that \ninformation, Americans have tried to make the best they can out of a \ntough situation. They have made those tough choices, and if you read \nthe stories on my Web site, or talk to constituents, you will see very \nheartbreaking stories of people who have struggled to make ends meet \nand would rather work.\n\n  I think it is very important that Congress act to move forward on \nthis legislation. I know my colleagues would like to get the FSC/ETI \nbill done. I know they would like to say they passed something that \ndealt with jobs. Let's be honest. There haven't been a lot of jobs \ncreated in the last 3 years. We are at a net negative jobs. We are at a \nnet negative 2 million jobs lost in America. So let's not kid \nourselves. Job creation will come back. It will come back slowly. It \nwill start to pick up, but that pickup is not going to be at the pace \nto give people relief in America and relief that is due to them.\n  Mr. President, while I am not making a unanimous consent request, I \nhope that my colleagues understand how important this is, and that \ntomorrow we will find time to vote on this amendment. Not to vote on \nthis amendment, again, is to say it is more important to deal with \ncorporations and their tax incentives and tax breaks than it is to deal \nwith the American workers who have lost their jobs. I don't want to \nsend that message to these high-unemployment States, to those \nindividuals who thought they supported this concept of a Federal \nprogram, and then tell them we have almost $15 billion in a Federal \nfund that was paid into by their employers, but now they are not going \nto be able to access any of it. I would rather tell them this body \ndecided to do the right thing; that while we are waiting for the \nprivate sector to return to a strong economic engine, we are going to \ndo the right thing and give people access to the Federal dollars from \nthe program they have already paid into; that we are going to help the \nAmerican workers in their time of greatest need; that our body, this \ninstitution, and the other side, the House of Representatives, believe \nthe American workers deserve to have support.\n  I hope tomorrow we can work out a time agreement so this amendment \ncan be voted on, so we can move forward on not only getting the \nunderlying bill done but getting this legislation moved, since both \nbodies have supported it and a majority of Members have supported the \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4898-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4898-S4900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CINCO DE MAYO\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on the fifth of May, 1862, in Puebla, \nMexico, a fighting force of 2,000 peasants confronted 6,000 well-\nequipped and expertly trained French troops, The French troops had come \nto conquer the\n\n[[Page S4899]]\n\nsmall town. Instead, the peasant army prevailed, and their historic \nvictory is celebrated each year as Cinco de Mayo.\n  Today, millions across the Americas will celebrate the spirit of \nCinco de Mayo. They will cheer the shared goals of independence, \nliberation, and freedom. Today, the people of North America are united \nin good will.\n  Indeed, the relationship between the United States and Mexico is \ncloser than it has ever been. We are neighbors and we are friends.\n  Mr. President, 33 million Latinos live in the United States. The \nlarge majority, 66 percent, are of Mexican origin.\n  In my home state of Tennessee, the Hispanic population has grown by \nnearly 1 million people since 1990.\n  Hispanics are strongly represented in our Armed Forces and can claim \nmore Congressional Medals of Honor for valor than any other group.\n  The U.S. and Mexico are partners in NAFTA. Mexico is our second \nlargest trading partner.\n  The United States accounts for 60 percent of all foreign direct \ninvestment in Mexico.\n  Mexicans living in the United States send about $9 billion a year \nhome to their families.\n  And more than 500,000 American citizens live in Mexico.\n  So, today, I rise to recognize this historic day and join others in \ncelebrating this day in this spirit. It teaches us a profound lesson: \nthat freedom is a universal drive, and ultimately, freedom will out.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Cinco de \nMayo, a holiday celebrated in Mexico and increasingly in the United \nStates, that commemorates an important victory of the Mexican Army \nagainst the French at the Battle of Puebla. In my home State of New \nYork and across the Nation, Hispanic communities--particularly the \nMexican-American community--have embraced this holiday and transformed \nit into a day of recognition and celebration of the contributions \nHispanics have made in the United States.\n  Among all cities across the Nation, New York ranks 11th in the size \nof its Mexican population, close to cities with long standing Mexican \ncommunities such as San Diego, Santa Ana, and San Jose, CA. The number \nof Mexican New Yorkers counted by the U.S. Census more than tripled in \nthe 1990s, increasing from 61,772 in 1990 to 186,872 in 2000. \nCurrently, Mexicans constitute the third largest Hispanic/Latino \npopulation in New York State after Puerto Ricans and Dominicans.\n  As the Nation's largest minority group, Hispanics are adding to our \nNation's cultural richness and economic prosperity. Every day they are \nworking and creating businesses in all sectors across the country. \nToday, one in nine workers in America is of Hispanic descent and there \nare currently 1.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses with annual \nrevenues of $200 billion.\n  Even as we celebrate these important contributions, Hispanics across \nthe Nation continue to face unique challenges, including high \nunemployment, stagnant or declining wages, high school dropout rates, \npoverty, and lack of access to health insurance. The Bush \nadministration's 2005 budget proposal fails to make adequate \ninvestments to help improve the quality of life for Hispanics. In fact, \nhis budget proposal cuts funding for small businesses, fails to \nadequately fund the No Child Left Behind Act, eliminates funding for \ndropout prevention, and underfunds minority health care programs.\n  The President's budget also provides tax breaks that benefit the \nwealthy at the expense of working families. That is why I have joined \nmy fellow Democrats in Congress in supporting an agenda that increases \ninvestments in key economic, educational, and health-related programs \nto make America even stronger for future generations and will continue \nto fight for these key programs in the 108th Congress.\n  I hope that today's Cinco de Mayo celebrations serve as an important \nreminder of the contributions of Hispanics and the need to support \nadditional investments in programs and services that help them build a \nbetter future for their families and for our Nation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Cinco de \nMayo, an important day in both Mexican and American history as well as \na symbolic day to honor Mexican heritage.\n  Cinco de Mayo pays tribute to the courage and strength of the people \nof Mexico and to the profound contributions Mexican Americans have made \nto our country's history and culture.\n  The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there are nearly 10 million \npeople of Mexican descent living in my home State of California alone. \nEvery day, Mexican Americans make huge contributions to our communities \nin every sector of the economy, in every level of government, and in \nevery aspect of society.\n  Mexican-American leaders such as the late Cesar Chavez, founder of \nthe United Farm Workers Union, have left indelible footprints in our \nnational memory.\n  Organizations such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, \nthe National Council of La Raza, and the Mexican American Legal Defense \nand Education Fund collaborate with government, civic, community, and \nother organizations to improve economic, educational, and civil rights \nfor Latinos.\n  Truly, a comprehensive snapshot of California would be grossly \nincomplete without full representation of the Mexican-American \ncommunity.\n  Many celebrations with traditional food, music, and parades take \nplace across the country and throughout California on Cinco de Mayo. \nHundreds of thousands will gather to embrace and celebrate Mexican \nheritage.\n  Cinco de Mayo celebrations can be large festivals drawing thousands \nof people, such as those in San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San \nFrancisco, and San Jose as well as small, more intimate events among \nneighbors.\n  It is very much the same as the way we observe the Fourth of July--\nboth in the variety of ways people choose to celebrate and in that a \nspecific historic event inspired the holiday, which has come to \nsymbolize a much broader spirit.\n  No one would want to limit the meaning of the Fourth of July to a \nnarrow celebration of American independence from Great Britain, nor \nwould you reduce Cinco de Mayo to a commemoration of the Mexican \nmilitary victory in Puebla by itself.\n  However, it is important to recall the bravery of the Mexican Army \nwhen France, under the rule of Napoleon III, sought to establish a \npolitical and economic foothold in Latin America by installing their \nown ruler in Mexico.\n  Napoleon's troops, who had not been defeated in battle for almost 50 \nyears, entered Mexico with considerable technological advantages over \nthe Mexican Army. The French Army moved west to attack Mexico City, \nmindful that if the Mexican capital fell, a complete takeover of Mexico \nwas imminent.\n  On May 5, 1862, the Mexican Army defeated the invading French forces \nin the city of Puebla under the command of General Zaragosa and Colonel \nPorfirio Diaz. If not for the great courage of the Mexican Army, the \ncourse of history would be undoubtedly altered.\n  In my mind, Cinco de Mayo epitomizes what it means for immigrant \ncommunities to flourish, making their own unique additions to American \nculture.\n  One San Francisco family, the Ramirezes, who immigrated to the United \nStates from Jalisco, Mexico, in 1955, are truly an American success \nstory.\n  Ramon Ramirez and his wife Guadalupe worked several jobs before \nacquiring a San Francisco deli in 1967. Soon the space proved too small \nto accommodate their customers and in 1982, they expanded and opened \nDon Ramon's restaurant.\n  I used to frequent Don Ramon's when I was the Mayor of San Francisco \nand I was always sincerely impressed with the Ramirez family. Ramon and \nGuadalupe still work every day at Don Ramon's, arriving before dawn. \nTheir three daughters remain involved in running the restaurant, though \ntheir youngest daughter, Nati, has also pursued another career as \ndirector of the San Francisco district attorney's subpoena unit.\n  This is only one of many examples of how Mexican Americans have \nhelped our country to flourish.\n  Finally, I am pleased to join every American and every Mexican in \ncelebrating this important day in Mexican history. On Cinco de Mayo we \npay tribute not only to the bravery shown at\n\n[[Page S4900]]\n\nthe Battle of Puebla, we also recognize the contributions of Mexican \nAmericans to our country as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4900-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            IRAQI PRISONERS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the past week we have become aware--\nindeed, the entire world has learned of the graphic evidence--of abuse \nagainst Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison. We express shock; we \nexpress condemnation of these despicable acts. That has been expressed \non the floor--indeed, throughout the Nation.\n  The persons who carried these acts out must face justice. The \nperpetrators have disgraced themselves and, in the process, have \nbrought shame to all of us who cherish justice and decency and dignity.\n  Moreover, their behavior is deeply un-American. This country is \nfounded on those universal principles of human rights and respect for \neach and every individual. Those disturbing pictures show men and women \nwho have abandoned America's values and, in the process, jeopardized \nour efforts to bring democracy and the rule of law to Iraq.\n  Thousands of honorable men and women are working and sacrificing each \nand every day to bring peace and freedom to the Iraqi people. We cannot \nlet these intolerable acts of a few undermine the noble work of the \noverwhelming majority of our troops.\n  The abusers of Abu Ghraib must face justice and they will face \njustice. In March, the Army charged 6 military police officers with \nphysical and sexual abuse of 20 Iraqi prisoners. Three of the six cases \nhave been referred to military trial. The criminal probe into \nallegations against four other soldiers is continuing. In total, our \nmilitary has launched five separate investigations. An administrative \nreview has resulted in notices of reprimand filed against seven \nofficers and noncommissioned officers this week. The inspector general \nof the Army and the commander of the Army Reserve are also conducting \ntheir own investigations.\n  I commend President Bush for his efforts to reach out to the Arab \nworld to address this matter. It is important that we address these \nreprehensible acts directly and fully and quickly and in a fully \ntransparent manner.\n  Our men and women in uniform are respected around the world. They are \nrespected for their professionalism and because they defend the highest \nof political ideals: individual rights, freedom, justice, and the rule \nof law. In Bosnia, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Iraq, and elsewhere, our troops \nare serving with honor, with courage, and with professionalism to \nadvance democracy and to advance liberty.\n  As the Abu Ghraib investigations unfold, I do urge my colleagues and \neveryone watching and listening to keep that in mind. The vast majority \nof our men and women in uniform are serving ably and honorably, and \nthrough their heroic efforts, they are advancing our freedoms and \nvalues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4900-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING WOLFGANG PUCK\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the city of Las Vegas, in my native State of \nNevada, is recognized as the entertainment capital of the world.\n  Our amazing resorts offer many options for fun, but one of their \ngreatest attractions is world-class dining.\n  Over the last 12 years, many of our Nation's leading chefs have \nopened restaurants in Las Vegas, transforming our desert city into even \nmore of a culinary oasis.\n  The man most responsible for this remarkable transformation is \nWolfgang Puck.\n  Wolfgang Puck was born in Austria. He began his formal training at \nage 14, inspired by his mother, who was a hotel chef. By the time he \ncame to this country at age 24, Wolfgang had prepared himself for \nsuccess, but nobody could have predicted just how dramatic that success \nwould be.\n  By combining classic French techniques with influences from Asia and \nCalifornia, and by using the finest ingredients from local purveyors, \nhe has changed the way Americans think about food and the way chefs \nprepare it.\n  Along the way he has become American's most famous chef, and created \nan empire comprising a dozen fine dining restaurants and more than 50 \ncasual and quick service establishments.\n  Four of his best restaurants are in Las Vegas: Spago and Chinois at \nthe Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace; Trattoria Del Lupa at Mandalay Bay; \nand Postrio at the Venetian.\n  One thing all these places have in common is a remarkable attention \nto detail. Wolfgang Puck is a person who thinks about everything that \ncould possibly affect the dining experience. Some would even call him a \nworrier. The story goes that before his first Spago restaurant opened, \nhe couldn't sleep for two days because he was worried that nobody would \nshow up. Well, people did show up, and they lined up to get in. So \nWolfgang's reaction was to worry about how he would ever be able to \nfeed such a crowd.\n  Wolfgang Puck has been influential because of his cooking techniques \nand his approach to food; almost every American chef has learned \nsomething from him. But you don't have to be a chef to learn from \nWolfgang Puck. We can all learn from his willingness to take risks and \ntry new ways of doing things. He has said that he learned more from his \none restaurant that failed than he learned from the many that \nsucceeded.\n  Wolfgang has a great partner in life and in business--his wife, \nBarbara Lazaroff. She is an acclaimed architectural designer who has \ncreated magnificent environments where diners can appreciate Wolfgang's \nfood. I'm sure Wolfgang would be the first to acknowledge that he \ncouldn't have accomplished what he has without Barbara by his side.\n  Wolfgang and Barbara and their two sons live in California, but we \nthink of them as part of our Las Vegas community. They are very active \nin charitable activities in Nevada, as well as California. Their Puck-\nLazaroff Charitable Foundation was established in 1982, and has raised \nmore than $5 million for charity. It sponsors the annual American Food \nand Wine Festival, which raises money for Meals on Wheels.\n  Wolfgang and Barbara are also major supporters of the American Cancer \nSociety, the American Heart Association, the Boys and Girls Clubs, Big \nBrothers and Big Sisters of California and Nevada, and the Alzheimer's \nAssociation.\n  In fact, on May 15, Wolfgang will be the honored guest at Keep Memory \nAlive, an annual dinner in Las Vegas that combats Alzheimer's by \nraising money and public awareness. This event began in 1996 as an \nintimate dinner party. It has been repeated each year since, thanks to \nLarry Ruvo and Bobby Baldwin. Last year, Keep Memory Alive had grown to \na feast for 300 people at Postrio. Wolfgang and other chefs prepared a \nmemorable dinner, and Muhammed Ali and other celebrities auctioned off \nsome memorable items. The evening raised $2.6 million to fight \nAlzheimer's.\n  It is entirely fitting that this year's event at the Mirage will \nhonor Wolfgang Puck for his work to combat this horrible disease. \nPlease join me today in saluting Wolfgang and Barbara for all their \ncontributions to the southern Nevada community, and the entire country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4900-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life and \nmourn the death of Corporal Patrick D. Tillman, age 27, who was killed \nin action in Afghanistan on April 22, 2004. Pat Tillman was originally \nfrom San Jose, CA. He was a true hero.\n  Pat Tillman exuded greatness and humility throughout his short life. \nHe\n\n[[Page S4901]]\n\nwas a shining star on and off the football field. In high school at \nLeland High in San Jose, CA, Pat was named the Central Coast Co-Player \nof the Year for 1993 and earned a scholarship to Arizona State \nUniversity. At Arizona State, he led the team to the Pacific-10 \nConference Title and then to the Rose Bowl. In 1997, while at Arizona \nState, Pat was named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year. Pat also knew \nthe value of a good education. He earned a degree in marketing at \nArizona State University, while also maintaining a 3.84 GPA. The \nArizona Cardinals selected Pat in the 1998 NFL draft where he played \nhard for the Cardinals as a safety. In 2000, the St. Louis Rams offered \nhim a substantial increase in compensation to play for them. However, \nout of loyalty, Pat turned it down to stay in Phoenix.\n  It was Pat's deep loyalty and character that led him to his next \ncareer move. After the horrific attacks of 9/11, Pat, who was just \nreturning from his honeymoon, announced that he was leaving the NFL to \njoin the Army Rangers.

He was a remarkable young \nman who put his country and its ideals ahead of himself.

Mr. President, law enforcement officers from around \nthe Nation--troopers, police officers, sheriff's deputies, professional \ncorrections officers, conservation officers and rangers and federal law \nenforcement officers--are traveling to our Nation's Capital for the \nannual observance of National Police Week which begins on May 9 and \ncontinues through May 15.\n  National Police Week is a solemn period, during which law enforcement \nofficers recognize their brothers and sisters who died in the line of \nduty and provide support and comfort to the survivors.\n  Last year, during National Police Week, I had the sad duty of \nacknowledging the loss of Officer James C. Hesterberg, the first member \nof the Alaska Department of Corrections to lose his life in the line of \nduty. This year, I must sadly acknowledge the loss of Officer John \nWatson of the Kenai Police Department who was fatally shot while on \nduty on Christmas night 2003.\n  On May 11, as part of the National Police Week observance, \nCorrections U.S.A., an association of 90,000 publicly-employed \nprofessional corrections officers, will meet to honor their brothers \nand sisters who have performed acts above and beyond in the protection \nof public safety.\n  It gives me great pride to recognize Officer Daniel Bates, an \nemployee of the Alaska Department of Corrections, presently assigned to \nthe Hiland Mountain Correctional Center, who will receive the 2004 \nSilver Medal of Valor from Corrections U.S.A.\n  On December 31, 2000, Officer Bates, then assigned to the Ketchikan \nCorrectional Center, reacted quickly and professionally to an incident \ninvolving an inmate who one month prior was convicted of twelve \ncriminal counts stemming from the armed robbery of a liquor store and a \nconvenience store. Two of those counts were for the crime of attempted \nmurder. The prisoner in question was arrested after an all night \nmanhunt during which he shot at police officers who tried to apprehend \nhim at a motel.\n  The inmate was participating in outdoor recreation at the jail when \nhe began to scale the first of two perimeter fences around the exercise \narea. He succeeded in scaling the inner fence, ignoring orders to stop, \nand failed to stop after being struck by a rubber projectile fired by \nOfficer Bates. After the prisoner breached the outer fence, the final \nbarrier, Officer Bates fired at him with live ammunition, bringing him \ndown.\n  Given this inmate's history of violence toward law enforcement \nofficers, it was critical to the public's safety that Officer Bates \nacted promptly and decisively to prevent the escape. His calm and \nprofessional actions may have been instrumental in keeping the names of \none or more Alaska law enforcement officers off of the National Law \nEnforcement Officer's Memorial Wall in Judiciary Square. For this we \nare grateful.\n  Our Nation's professional correctional officers are said to walk the \ntoughest beat in law enforcement. I am pleased to join with Corrections \nU.S.A. in recognizing one of America's finest officers, Daniel Bates, a \nveteran member of the Alaska Department of Corrections, whose actions \npersonify the department's motto, ``Vigilance Pride Dedication.''\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4901-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ABUSE OF IRAQI PRISONERS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I share the sense of outrage and disgust \nthat has been expressed by so many Americans since the allegations and \nhorrifying pictures of deeply troubling abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison \nin Iraq have come to light.\n  I am particularly sickened by the damage that has been done to the \nbrave men and women of the United States military. The depraved acts of \na few risk tarnishing the reputation of hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican servicemen and women who behave honorably every day, even in \nextraordinarily difficult circumstances. These acts also put our troops \nat risk, by casting them in the role of abusers, making it more \ndifficult to gain the trust and cooperation of Iraqis. Anytime the \nGeneva Convention is violated, the framework of basic standards on \nwhich all military personnel and their families depend is weakened.\n  I am also troubled by the irreparable damage done to American power. \nOur power does not come only from military might or economic muscle. We \nalso derive power from what we stand for. Our commitment to basic human \nrights, to human dignity, and to the rule of law gives us power to \npersuade and to lead and to inspire. When this commitment is called \ninto question, American power is diminished, and this is a terrible \nloss.\n  Now that these appalling acts have been exposed and reported around \nthe world, we must proceed to show the world something else--that our \nmilitary, our political system, and our society do not condone this \nbehavior, that we are capable of a full and transparent accounting for \nwhat has happened and how it has happened, that we will take action to \ncorrect the failures in the system, and that we are committed to \naddressing these abuses through the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4901-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4901-S4902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DISCLOSING GOVERNMENT WRONGDOING\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to those public \nservants who step forward to disclose government waste, fraud, and \nabuse. Commonly called whistleblowers, these individuals alert Congress \nand the public to threats to health, waste of taxpayer money, and other \ninformation vital to running an effective and efficient government. \nWhile there are protections in place for Federal employees who disclose \ngovernment wrongdoing, certain legal decisions prevent many from coming \nforward. To underscore the importance of whistleblowers, Time Magazine \ncalled 2002 the ``Year of the Whistleblowers'' because of the bravery \nof FBI Agent Colleen Rowley, who alerted Congress to serious \ninstitutional problems at the FBI, and Sherron Watkins and Cynthia \nCooper, who blew the whistle on financial mismanagement at Enron and \nWorldCom, respectively.\n\n[[Page S4902]]\n\nToday, as in 2002, it is important that during Public Service \nRecognition Week we acknowledge those who disclose information without \nassurances of protection and pledge to do what we can to provide full \nprotection for those trusted public servants.\n  Congress has a duty to taxpayers to make informed decisions when \ncarrying out its legislative, appropriation, and oversight functions. \nSuch decisions require access to timely and accurate information, and \nwhen access is restricted, we are unable to provide oversight and \nfulfill our constitutional responsibilities. Only through a credible, \nfunctioning statute can we protect the rights of Federal workers who \nwish to communicate with Congress. Guaranteeing freedom from \nretaliation or abuse when disclosing critical information to Congress \nis the underpinning of the Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA.\n  Congress has worked hard, and continues to work, to provide real \nwhistleblower protection to Federal employees. Unfortunately, through a \nseries of decisions contrary to both statutory language and \ncongressional intent, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which has \nsole appellate review for the WPA, has denied full whistleblower \nprotections to Federal workers and harmed Congress's ability to do its \njob. In fact, of the 85 retaliation cases decided on the merits since \n1994, the Federal circuit has ruled for the whistleblower only once.\n  To ensure continued whistleblower protection, I introduced S. 1358, \nthe Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act, on June 26, 2003, \nwith Senators Grassley, Levin, Leahy, and Durbin. Since introduction, \nwe have been joined by Senators Dayton, Pryor, and Johnson. Our bill \nwould strengthen protections for Federal employees who report \ngovernment waste, fraud, abuse, gross mismanagement, and substantial \nand specific dangers to public health and safety.\n  Congress has consistently supported the principle that Federal \nemployees should not be subject to prior restraint from disclosing \nwrongdoing. For example, every year since 1988 Congress has included in \nevery Transportation, Treasury, and General Government Appropriations \nbill an ``anti-gag'' provision which prohibits the use of Federal funds \nto implement nondisclosure policies that are inconsistent with several \nopen government statutes, such as the WPA of 1989 as amended in 1994, \nthe Military Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998, and the Lloyd \nLafollette Act of 1912, which prohibits discrimination against \ngovernment employees who communicate with Congress.\n  However, more must be done. Since we introduced our bill there have \nbeen several more public reports of Federal employees allegedly being \nfired or threatened with termination or other retaliation for \ncommunicating with Congress and disclosing government wrongdoing to the \npress. These reports include the controversy surrounding the U.S. Park \nPolice and cost estimates for the newly enacted Medicare prescription \ndrug program. In order to aid these and other employees and provide \nfull protection to Federal whistleblowers, S. 1358 would codify the \n``anti-gag'' provision and allow employees to bring cases seeking \nremedial action for retaliation before the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard, MSPB, an independent, quasi-judicial agency that adjudicates \nFederal employee appeals.\n  In addition, our bill, the Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures \nAct, would overturn certain Federal Circuit decisions which have denied \nprotection to employees who made disclosures in the course of their job \nduties or reported initially to the wrongdoer or a coworker. S. 1358 \nwould also suspend the Federal Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction over \nWPA reprisal cases for 5 years, and overturn the wrongly established \n``irrefragable proof'' standard imposed by the Federal circuit for \nwhistleblowers to qualify for protection.\n  Although much press has been given to recent whistleblower cases, it \nis important to remember those who have reported allegations of \naircraft maintenance violations, water safety regulations, and lapses \nin our national security. Protecting Federal employees who blow the \nwhistle allows us to protect taxpayers and, in recent notable \ninstances, national security as well. That is why the WPA is often \nreferred to as the Taxpayer Protection Act.\n  During Public Service Recognition Week, I urge my colleagues to \nremember public servants who have come forward and honor them by \nsupporting S. 1358 and strengthening protections for whistleblowers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4902-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4902-S4903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        THE BLACK SHIPS FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this year marks the 150th \nanniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Kanagawa, which opened \ntrade between Japan and the United States. Rhode Islanders take great \npride in the historic role played by Commodore Matthew C. Perry, USN, \nwho was integral in the formation of the treaty.\n  In 1853, Japan had been almost completely closed to foreigners for \nover 200 years, denying trade, refusing shipwrecked sailors, and, most \nimportantly, refusing to serve as a coaling station for the growing \nnumbers of steamships slogging the long haul across the Pacific. \nCommodore Perry was dispatched to Japan with full diplomatic powers by \nPresident Millard Fillmore for the purpose of opening that nation's \ndoors to foreign trade.\n  On Friday, July 8, 1853, Commodore Perry steamed four huge ships into \nwhat is now Tokyo Bay. The hulks breathed thick dark smoke, and were \ninstantly dubbed the ``Black Ships'' by the shocked citizens of Japan. \nTheir arrival set the city of Edo, inhabited by more than one million \npeople, into commotion. The Japanese had not fought a single war for \n256 years, but now they feared an invasion.\n  But Perry had not come to invade. Instead, he planned to deliver a \nletter to the Emperor, signed by President Fillmore, proposing ``that \nthe United States and Japan should live in friendship and have \ncommercial intercourse with each other.'' When his peaceful intentions \nbecame clear, tension around Edo Bay soon gave way to curiosity as each \npeople sought to learn more about the strange new other.\n  Commodore Perry gave the presidential letter to local officials \nshortly after his arrival, explaining that he would return the \nfollowing spring to receive the Japanese reply. He arrived in Edo Bay \nslightly ahead of schedule, on February 13, 1854, this time with nine \nships anchored near the city of Kanagawa. The cultural exchanges \ncontinued. After a stunning parade on land, Perry arranged a 21-gun \nsalute to honor the Emperor, and then flew the Shogun's flag from the \nmasthead of one of his ships. He presented his hosts with an array of \ngifts, including books, maps of America, whiskey, wine, clocks, rifles, \nperfumes, a miniature steam engine with railroad, and telegraph \nequipment--all of which aroused much awe in the growing crowds. The \nJapanese presented the Commodore and his officers with gifts from the \nEmperor, including scrolls, porcelain tea sets, silks, jars of soy \nsauce, umbrellas, swords, and ornate lacquer ware. They even treated \nthe sailors to a Sumo wrestling show. When one Japanese commissioner \nleft an American-hosted banquet, he gave Perry a crushing hug and \nexclaimed, ``Japan and America, all the same heart.''\n  On March 31, after weeks of delicate and complex negotiations, a \ntreaty declaring ``peace and friendship between the United States of \nAmerica and the Empire of Japan'' was signed. The treaty of Kanagawa \nopened the seaports of Shimoda and Hokodate to American ships, and \ngranted shipwrecked sailors protection in Japan. After the signing, the \nJapanese held a great feast for the Americans, and there was much \ncelebration. As author Rhoda Blumberg writes, ``It is remarkable that \npeople in the land of the Shogun could be so gracious and hospitable to \nunwanted visitors from the Black Ships and that the Americans could \novercome their prejudice against a `different' people and enjoy their \ncompany.''\n  Americans and Japanese were gracious, hospitable, and did enjoy each \nother's company at their first encounter. And that relationship \ncontinues today. The Japan-America Society and Black Ships festival of \nRhode Island have helped maintain the bonds of friendship between our \ntwo nations. This month, representatives from Rhode Island will be \nparticipating in a ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island's sister city, \nShimoda, Japan, commemorating the 65th anniversary of\n\n[[Page S4903]]\n\nthat city's Black Ships festival. I am proud to draw the Senate's \nattention to this historic occasion, and to express on behalf of my \ncolleagues our deep congratulations to Mayor Naoki Ishii, members of \nthe City Council, and the citizens of Shimoda, Japan as they host the \ncelebration of the mutual friendship and shared values between our two \nnations, common bonds that will last for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4903-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TEACHER APPRECIATION DAY\n\n Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to honor Andrea C. Silbert, founder of the Center for Women \nand Enterprise, CWE, for her dedicated and tireless work on behalf of \nwomen in business. On Friday, after 9 years of outstanding service, \nAndrea stepped down as chief executive officer for CWE. I am pleased to \ntake this moment to reflect on Andrea's achievements and her \ncontribution to the growing community of women entrepreneurs.\n  Andrea began her career working for Morgan Stanley in New York, but \nafter only a few years, left the financial capital of the world to \npursue her interest in community economic development. This led Andrea \nto spend several years helping the less fortunate in Costa Rica, \nColombia and Brazil. While in Latin America, Andrea conducted research \non nontraditional exports, taught seminars in financial planning of \nmicroloan programs for Women's World Banking, and in Brazil helped \ndisadvantaged young girls with income-generating projects.\n  In 1994, with this invaluable experience and fresh perspective on \neconomic development issues in the United States, Andrea returned to \nher hometown of Boston with the hope of starting a nonprofit for women \nentrepreneurs. Her idea was to create a launching pad for all women, \nregardless of background, to start a business. She was particularly \nconcerned with helping disadvantaged women break the cycle of poverty \nand become financial self-sufficient. Her efforts led to the \nestablishment of a community-based resource where aspiring women \nentrepreneurs learn from those who have the experience and knowledge to \nhelp others succeed. On October 23, 1995, with financial backing from \nthe Small Business Administration, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \nthe Bank of Boston, and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, Andrea \nstarted CWE.\n  Under Andrea's leadership and with a budget of $350,000, three \nemployees, and donated space at Northeastern University, CWE developed \ninto a $2.6 million nonprofit employing 25 full-time staff with centers \nin Boston, Worcester, MA, and Providence, RI assisting nearly 2,000 \nclients a year. Although CWE has quickly become the model for \nsuccessful women's business centers, the importance of CWE to women \nentrepreneurs cannot be summed up with numbers.\n  As more women experience this dream of business ownership, there will \ncontinue to be a need for community leaders, like Andrea, who help \nfacilitate the path from poverty to prosperity through \nenterpreneurship--leaders who can help these women start small \nbusinesses, lift themselves up, and give back to their communities.\n  As a past president of the Association of Women's Business Centers \nand former member of the National Women's Business Council, Andrea has \nbeen an advocate for women in business not only in Massachusetts, but \nacross the country. Her testimony before the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship in February of 1997 helped develop the \nnationwide network of Women's Business Centers and helped build a \nrecord of support for continued and increased funding for women who \nwant to start businesses.\n  When Andrea started CWE in 1995, there were only 28 centers in the \nWomen's Business Center network. Today, with Andrea's support, \nassistance and outreach through the Association of Women's Business \nCenters, there are 88 centers in 47 States, the District of Columbia, \nAmerican Samoa, and the Virgin Islands. Last year, these centers helped \n106,000 clients, but without the devotion and vision of people like \nAndrea, many of the women entrepreneurs across the country would not \nhave this invaluable resource.\n  Andrea Silbert has not only been a leader for women in business, but \na resounding voice for social change. On behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues on the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I want to express my sincere gratitude and \nappreciation for Andrea's commitment to women entrepreneurs and for her \nmany years of creating new opportunities for women and their \ncommunities. Her work through the Center for Women and Enterprise will \nbe greatly missed, but I am confident that her successor, Donna Good, \nis well suited to continue Andrea's legacy of accomplishment. I want to \nwish Andrea success and good luck in whatever the future holds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4903-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DR.

As the first female president of the college, she \nimplemented numerous projects, including a major renovation and \nconstruction plan, and a new campus technology plan. She also helped \nincrease enrollment, improve academic quality, and increase the \nendowment at Wesleyan.\n  In July 2002, Dr. Bell took office as president of Hollins University \nin Roanoke. During her tenure, she worked hard to make the school a \nTier One university and twice saw Hollins take the top rank in \n``Quality of Life,'' according to the Princeton Review.\n  Dr. Bell, a magna cum laude graduate of Randolph-Macon Women's \nCollege, was an articulate advocate of single-gender education. Over \nthe years, she wrote on the issue in several prestigious publications, \nincluding: USA Today, the Washington Post and the Christian Science \nMonitor. For her work, she was the recipient of numerous awards, \nincluding the Order of the Palmetto, the highest civilian award \npresented by the Governor of South Carolina.\n  Dr. Bell was the loving spouse of Dr. David A. Bell, President of \nMacon State College, and the devoted mother of three children.

AND THE MICHIGAN ATHLETES WITH DISABILITIES HALL \n                                OF FAME\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a remarkable \nman and his organization--Mr. Tony Filippis, Sr. and the Athletes with \nDisabilities Hall of Fame.\n  Winston Churchill once remarked, ``We shall draw from the heart of \nsuffering itself the means of inspiration and survival.''\n  And that is exactly what Mr. Filippis did.\n  When tragedy struck in 1929, Mr. Filippis found inspiration not only \nfor\n\n[[Page S4904]]\n\nhimself, but also for the 1.7 million disabled persons living in my \nhome State of Michigan. Seventy-five years ago, almost to the day, Mr. \nFilippis's legs were mangled in a train accident, forcing amputation.\n  Frustrated by the discrimination plaguing him in the years that \nfollowed, he sought change. And change he found.\n  Mr. Filippis accepted a position as the apprentice of Carl Wright, \nwho worked for a company that made his prosthetic legs; 10 years later \nthey founded their own company, Wright & Filippis.\n  Since its founding, Wright & Filippis has grown into one of the only \ncompanies in the United States that offers complete equipment services \nfor the disabled, from state-of-the-art prosthetic limbs to public \neducation about rehabilitation.\n  More remarkably, however, is what Mr. Filippis has done for the \nspirit of the disabled community in Michigan. In June 1999, he founded \nthe Athletes with Disabilities Hall of Fame.\n  Annually, the Hall of Fame recognizes the top Male and Female \nAthletes of the Year, as well as identifying a Lifetime Achievement \nAward winner and other Hall of Fame inductees.\n  The Hall of Fame, however, does more than recognize the immense \nathletic achievement of Michiganians with disabilities. It also tells \ntheir stories so that other people with disabilities can draw strength \nand inspiration from them.\n  It tells stories of people like Cheryl Angelelli who, despite being \nconfined to a wheelchair due to spinal cord damage, has proven herself \na formidable opponent in a swimming pool.\n  Among other achievements, she claimed a national title with one gold \nand four silver medals at the 1999 U.S. National Disability \nChampionships. Ranking 10th in the world and second in the U.S. in the \n100-meter breast stroke and the 200-meter individual medley, she earned \na spot on the paralympic swimming team for the 2000 Games in Sydney, \nAustralia.\n  It tells stories of people who also give back to their community. Ms. \nAngelelli is a member of several advisory councils for people with \ndisabilities and her expertise is sought by the management of concert \nhalls and stadiums on how to make their venues more accessible to their \ndisabled patrons.\n  In the manner that Churchill called for, Mr. Filippis took his \npainful experience of discrimination and used it as fuel to try to \nprevent those with disabilities today from feeling the same sense of \nalienation he had. Through his organization, others with disabilities \ncan be honored for their achievement and be a source of motivation to \nothers.\n  We appreciate his hard work and thank him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4904-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CARILION MEDICAL CENTER NURSES\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

Currently, Carilion Medical \nCenter is one of just 102 health care organizations in the U.S. to have \nreceived this recognition from the ANCC.\n  Last November, I had the opportunity to tour the Carilion Medical \nCenter. During my visit, I got to see firsthand the outstanding \ndedication and commitment that the nurses provide their patients. I am \npleased today to recognize the exceptional nurses at Carilion Health \nCenter on their tremendous achievement and wish them continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4904-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING D.L. EVANS BANK ON 100 YEARS OF SERVICE\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I today honor D.L. Evans Bank on \nreaching a tremendous milestone--100 years in business. D.L. Evans bank \nis a financial institution in the largest sense of that word. It is a \nsignificant, established organization with branches solely in my home \nState of Idaho, and widely recognized for quality, personalized banking \nservices to the community. Today I honor the Evans family and their \nemployees for their long, proud history of financial service to \nIdahoans and many others.\n  In 1904, D.L. Evans and a group of pioneer businessman met and \norganized Cassia County's first bank. Despite the floods, fires, \ndroughts, and even grasshoppers that have wreaked havoc on its \ncustomers, the bank has survived many tough economic times. As other \nbanks around the country were closing their doors, D.L. Evans Bank was \nexpanding--moving from its one-story frame building to a two-story \nstone headquarters in the early 1900s. From that original Albion \nbranch, the bank has opened locations in Boise, Burley, Meridian, \nKetchum, Jerome, Rupert, and Twin Falls. It is now the second largest \ncommunity bank head quartered in southern Idaho with $388 million in \nassets and $345 million in deposits.\n  The Evans family's participation in the Idaho State Government has \nbeen no less impressive. The bank's founder, D.L. Evans, served in the \nIdaho Senate from 1903-1904 and 1923-1924. The current President, John \nV. Evans Sr., has served in numerous government capacities including as \nGovernor of Idaho, Mayor of Malad City, State Senator and Majority and \nMinority Leader of the Idaho Senate, and Lieutenant Governor. The Evans \nfamily and D.L. Evans Bank have made important contributions to both \nthe private and public sector in Idaho.\n  Congratulations to the employees, friends, and family of D.L. Evans \non the centennial anniversary. D.L. Evans is a bank with a proud \nhistory, impressive current achievements, and a promising future. I \nwish the bank and its employees the best as they continue to serve the \ncommunities and families of Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4904-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4904-S4905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPAGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL 2003 BOYS' CROSS COUNTRY AND CHEERLEADING TEAMS\n\n   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to \nrecognize the great achievements and dedication of the Page County High \nSchool Boys' Cross Country and Cheerleading teams. Both teams finished \ntheir outstanding 2003 seasons by winning State championship titles.\n  Throughout the season, the cross country and cheerleading teams \nshowed the determination of a championship team. They worked \ncontinuously to develop needed skills, persevere as athletes and follow \nthe leadership of their coaches.\n  This is the third State title in 4 years for the Panthers Boys' Cross \nCountry Team. In addition, the Panthers have won the Shenandoah \nDistrict regular season championship for six consecutive seasons and \nhave now been crowned District Champions for 5 years in a row.\n  Congratulations to the members of the Page County High School Boys' \nCross Country Team: Adam Atkins, Nathan Batman, Steve Beers, Wayne \nBeers, Zach Bouldin, Tommy Copeland, Jeff Frazier, Nathaniel Nelson, \nEthan Price, Todd Somers, T.J.

Mr. President, I rise today with great pride to \nhonor a group of distinguished Montanans. Alyson Mike and Thomas \nAndres, Montana's 2004 Milken Educator Award recipients deserve \nrecognition for their outstanding work and service to our State and to \nthe children they teach every day.\n   Public service is the most noble thing a person can do. Whether it \nis service to one's church, community or government, there is nothing \nmore honorable. Alyson and Thomas are at the top of a lengthy list of \nquality teachers in Montana to stand among their fellow American \nteachers to receive this national award.\n   The Milken Educator Award provides public recognition and a $25,000 \nhonorarium to teachers, principals and other educators who have a \nproven record of excellence in education. Alyson, a natural science \nteacher at East Valley Middle School, and Thomas, a science teacher at \nSt. Labre Catholic Indian School, both have strong records of \nexcellence. In fact, I was recently honored to recognize Alyson as \nMontana's 2004 Teacher of the Year.\n   In Montana, there is little difference between our schools and our \ncommunities. This award highlights the great quality of teachers we \nhave in Montana and spotlights the good things happening in our \nschools.\n   Alyson and Thomas are two of Montana's high quality teachers that \nare helping to shape our State's future. They are creating an \nenvironment that encourages learning, instilling a curiosity and a \ndesire to learn--all of which will produce a more educated workforce. A \nbetter educated work force will spur job creation and translate into a \nstronger economy with more good-paying jobs. The best way to ensure \nMontana's future is through a well-educated work force.\n   We in Montana are very fortunate to be able to claim teachers like \nAlyson Mike and Thomas Andres as our very own. They are playing a vital \nrole in our State's future. I commend Alyson and Thomas for all they \nhave done and I am confident they will continue to serve their students \nwell.\n   I would also like to recognize Polson High School as Montana's 2004 \nwinner of the `We the People' Competition. By winning the State \ncompetition, nineteen of our State's brightest government students and \ntheir teacher qualified to represent Montana in the National Civics \nCompetition on the United States Constitution.\n   The names of the 19 students who are receiving this honor are as \nfollows: Charlie Cooper, Chance Dupuis, Sky Fredrickson, Ashley \nGilchrist, Kasey Harwood, Rosanna Ho, Chad Hunsucker, Bonnie Klein, \nBrandon McCurdy, Kdee Meidinger, Zach Morrow, Candace Myers, Andrew \nOfstad, Kiel Rafter, Chris Rossmith, Kai Smith, Kate Taylor, and \nChristine Woidtke.\n   Pat Danley is the teacher whose expertise, guidance, and \nencouragement that helped these students receive this honor. Pat Danley \nis a veteran government and political science teacher at Polson High \nSchool. I commend Pat on his ability to prepare these students for this \ncompetition.\n   These students have demonstrated a strong understanding of the U.S. \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. Here in Congress, I think we can \nall recognize the value of fostering civic competence and \nresponsibility. These students are Montana's future leaders, and I am \nproud to recognize their accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4905-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FLORENCE WOMAN'S CLUB\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the \nFlorence Woman's Club of Florence, KY on the recent celebration of its \n50th anniversary.\n  The Florence Woman's Club was founded on April 20, 1954. Its goal was \nsimply to make the city of Florence a better place to live. The causes \nthat the club has lent its time to are almost too numerous to mention. \nThey have been involved in raising money to fight cancer, working at \nlocal veterans' hospitals, and helping with the preservation of \nhistoric buildings in the area, to name just a few.\n  The citizens of northern Kentucky are fortunate to have the services \nof the Florence Woman's Club. This organization's example of \ndedication, hard work and compassion should be an inspiration to all \nthroughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  They have my most sincere appreciation for this work, and I look \nforward to their continued service to Kentucky. I have no doubt that \nthey will be just as productive in their next 50 years as they have \nbeen in their first 50.

It was through their endless drive and dedication that they \nwere able to become ACC Champions this season.\n  As a former student-athlete at UVA, I understand the impact that \nathletics play in the development of an individual's character and \nlife. Sports teach us important lessons of self-discipline, \nperseverance, teamwork and sportsmanship. The benefits of participating \nin athletics can prove valuable in the daily lives of student-athletes \nwhether at school or at work in their communities. Each of these \nstudent-athletes is a leader and a winner, not just in the water but \nalso in the classroom.\n  I congratulate Coach Bernadino and the University of Virginia Swim \nand Dive teams on their 2004 ACC Championship and wish them continued \nsuccess in the future. Keep winning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4905-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SAMUEL HOPKINS SHRUM\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize Mr. \nSamuel Hopkins Shrum, a native of Dayton, VA, who was honored this year \nfor 55 years of perfect attendance by the Rotary Club of Harrisonburg, \nVA. Mr. Shrum's commitment to the Harrisonburg Rotary is just one \nexample in a lifetime of dedication and hard work.\n  An architectural engineering graduate of the Virginia Polytechnic \nInstitute, Mr. Shrum later attended Westminster Choir College in \nPrinceton, NJ for post-graduate studies. He began his professional \ncareer with George E. Shrum & Son, eventually becoming a production \nengineer at Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. Hard work \nand dedication led him to become President of Nielson Construction \nCompany in 1962 where he served until his retirement in 1976. The \ncompany grew from a small operation of seven employees to nearly 300 \nwhile Mr. Shrum served as executive vice-president, general manager, \ntreasurer and director, before being named its president.\n  Today, I congratulate Mr. Shrum for his dedication and commitment to \nservice in the Harrisonburg community and wish him continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4905-5", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4905-S4906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       H. ODELL ``FUZZY'' MINNIX\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize Mr. \nH. Odell ``Fuzzy'' Minnix for his community service and leadership. Mr. \nMinnix recently retired after serving three terms on the Roanoke County \nBoard of Supervisors, including several years as the board's chairman. \nDuring his 12 years on the Board of Supervisors, Roanoke County saw \nsignificant improvement in its quality of life; in recent years, the \ncounty was recognized as one of the best school systems in the Nation \nand the community's continued commitment to expansion and growth \nresulted in the creation of more jobs and opportunity in the region.\n  Throughout his life, Fuzzy Minnix has been a community leader and \nvolunteer. He was the recipient of the Roanoke Valley Big Brother of \nthe Year Award and has been an avid supporter of youth sports, having \nbeen Head Football Coach at Hidden Valley Junior High School. Mr. \nMinnix also served as Head Softball Coach, Assistant Varsity Football \nCoach and Assistant Varsity Track Coach at Cave Spring High\n\n[[Page S4906]]\n\nSchool. Over the years, he has remained active as a Virginia High \nSchool League Football and Basketball official.\n  A Roanoke native, Mr. Minnix began his distinguished career serving 4 \nyears in the U.S. Air Force. After his military service, he entered a \ncareer in the air traffic control industry. A graduate of the FAA Air \nTraffic Control Academy in Oklahoma City, Mr. Minnix has worked as an \nAir Traffic Controller at airports in Norfolk, Dulles, Roanoke and \nLynchburg.\n  Among his professional recognitions, Fuzzy Minnix was the winner of \nthe Roanoke Federal Employee of the Year award and the FAA Education \nFacilitator of the Year award for the Eastern Region.\n  Mr. Minnix and his wife, Janet, have two sons. They are active \nmembers of the Ghent Grace Brethren Church, where Fuzzy has served as a \nModerator and Sunday School Superintendent.\n  The Roanoke region will surely miss the leadership and talents that \nMr. Minnix displayed on the county's Board of Supervisors. I \ncongratulate him on his community service and wish him well in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4906-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DAVIS COINER ROSEN\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to the federal temporary \n     unemployment compensation program; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4031\n\n       Whereas, over the past few years, the national economy has \n     struggled unsuccessfully to rebound from the recession, and a \n     strong and sustainable recovery remains elusive; and\n       Whereas, there are two million four hundred thousand fewer \n     jobs today than when the recession began; and\n       Whereas, in November 2003, long-term joblessness reached a \n     twenty-year high, and nearly one-fourth of the unemployed \n     have been out of work for at least half a year; and\n       Whereas, in November 2003, the nation's unemployment rate \n     remained at five and nine-tenths percent, and Washington's \n     unemployment rate was among the highest in the country at six \n     and eight-tenths percent; and\n       Whereas, Congress and the President originally approved \n     temporary extended unemployment compensation to provide \n     assistance to unemployed workers who were unable to find new \n     jobs before exhausting their regular benefits, and to \n     stimulate the economy by injecting dollars directly into \n     local communities; and\n       Whereas, unemployed workers in most states could receive up \n     to thirteen weeks of federal temporary extended unemployment \n     compensation; and\n       Whereas, unemployed workers in states suffering from severe \n     economic distress such as Washington could receive up to \n     twenty-six weeks of federal temporary extended unemployment \n     compensation; and\n       Whereas, Congress adjourned without providing for a further \n     extension of unemployment compensation benefits after \n     December of 2003; and\n       Whereas, across the nation, more than one million \n     unemployed workers are expected to exhaust their regular \n     benefits in the first quarter of 2004; and\n       Whereas, in Washington, more than twenty-five thousand \n     unemployed workers are expected to exhaust their regular \n     benefits in the first quarter of 2004; and\n       Whereas, these unemployed workers are left with few, if \n     any, job prospects or other means of assistance; and\n       Whereas, Federal temporary extended unemployment \n     compensation benefits helped these hard-working people and \n     their families put food on the table and pay their bills \n     while they looked for work; and\n       Whereas, Federal temporary extended unemployment \n     compensation injected cash into troubled economies throughout \n     the nation and in Washington; and\n       Whereas, the economic and labor market conditions that \n     warranted federal temporary extended unemployment \n     compensation still persist; and\n       Whereas, if federal temporary extended unemployment \n     compensation benefits are not extended, workers and their \n     families will suffer severe economic hardships and states \n     such as Washington will be deprived of this crucial economic \n     boost: Now, therefore,\n       Your Memorialists respectfully pray that Congress and the \n     President extend and make retroactive the federal temporary \n     unemployment compensation program. Be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of the Department of Labor, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, and each member of Congress from \n     the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-414. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to treatment of chronic diseases; to the Committee \n     on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 170\n\n       Whereas, an estimated 125 million Americans suffer from at \n     least one chronic illness, which includes such maladies as \n     asthma, arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, mental illness, \n     and many cancers. Approximately 60 million people are \n     afflicted with more than one of these conditions; and\n       Whereas, chronic illnesses, which are responsible for 7 of \n     every 10 deaths, are the\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\n     leading cause of death in our country. More than 75 percent \n     of state Medicaid spending goes toward the treatment of \n     chronic illnesses, and more than half of Medicaid spending \n     treats Medicaid enrollees who have more than one chronic \n     disease; and\n       Whereas, the health care system of the United States could \n     more accurately be called a ``sick care'' system, as most \n     costs are incurred in the treatment of acute episodes of \n     chronic illnesses that, in many cases, could be avoided or \n     lessened by preventive measures. Many chronic diseases can be \n     mitigated through improved diet, increased exercise, avoiding \n     tobacco use, or other management steps. In spite of this, our \n     country spends only a fraction of its health care money on \n     prevention; and\n       Whereas, many studies have demonstrated widespread problems \n     with the quality of care delivered to individuals with \n     chronic illnesses. These studies often cite the absence of \n     appropriate screening and follow-up care, inadequate \n     coordination of treatment among health care providers, and \n     many preventable and costly complications; and\n       Whereas, there are structural barriers to improved \n     treatment of chronic illnesses. Specifically, Medicaid and \n     Medicare do not encourage preventive steps or better \n     coordination for the treatment of people with more than one \n     disease. Clearly, with the financial pressures in health care \n     and the aging of our population, we need to take stronger \n     steps to deal with chronic conditions in a more effective \n     manner: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the United \n     States Department of Health and Human Services to make the \n     treatment of chronic diseases a higher priority. We urge \n     federal policy makers to transform the regulatory, financial, \n     and clinical structures for dealing with chronic diseases, \n     including more support for preventive measures, better \n     coordination of care, and the removal of regulatory barriers \n     within Medicaid and Medicare and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the United States \n     Department of Health and Human Services.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-415. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to pregnancy care centers in Michigan; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 167\n\n       Whereas, pregnancy care centers, which are also known as \n     crisis pregnancy centers, are located in Michigan and across \n     our country and provide vitally needed help to women and \n     families at difficult times in their lives. These centers \n     offer free, confidential, and compassionate services, which \n     range from pregnancy testing and childbirth classes to help \n     with housing, counseling, and medical referrals; and\n       Whereas, pregnancy care centers encourage women to make \n     positive choices in life by providing them with accurate and \n     complete information. This information covers such key topics \n     as nutrition, prenatal care, adoption service, and parenting; \n     and\n       Whereas, many pregnancy care centers across the country \n     also offer classes in abstinence education, including \n     programs carried out in schools; and\n       Whereas, the work of pregnancy care centers is largely \n     conducted by volunteers, with contributions of time, talent, \n     and financial support from people who seek the intrinsic \n     value of helping women and families facing a variety of very \n     personal difficulties. With the strong societal implications \n     of the good work being done at pregnancy care centers across \n     our state, these centers are performing a great volume of \n     services that clearly are carried out for the public benefit: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the \n     Michigan Department of Community Health to develop \n     collaborative relationships with pregnancy care centers in \n     Michigan. We urge that any assistance made available to help \n     with medical and abstinence education programs be \n     administered in a manner that does not compromise the values \n     of the centers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the Michigan \n     Department of Community Health.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-416. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative funding for DNA testing; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 193\n\n       Whereas, one of the most significant breakthroughs in the \n     area of crime fighting is DNA testing. This scientific \n     technology has had a dramatic impact in protecting innocent \n     people accused of crimes and identifying murderers, rapists, \n     and other violent criminals. Because of the effectiveness of \n     this tool, there is enormous frustration among citizens and \n     law enforcement professionals that there is a large backlog \n     of cases awaiting laboratory testing, both here in Michigan \n     and across the country; and\n       Whereas, in spite of state and federal efforts to date, \n     there remains in Michigan a backlog of over 74,000 cases \n     awaiting DNA testing. It is estimated that Michigan State \n     Police labs can expect 50,000 new DNA samples per year. At \n     the current level of funding available, it is expected that \n     only 42,000 of these can be processed annually, adding to the \n     backlog of cases; and\n       Whereas, this lag in testing represents a genuine threat to \n     public safety. There have been well-publicized reports of new \n     violent crimes being committed by people who were on the \n     streets solely because tests were still pending. Police \n     across the state are confident that, if the backlog of cases \n     were to be eliminated, thousands of unsolved serious crimes, \n     including murders and rapes, would be solved. The magnitude \n     of removing so many violent criminals from society cannot be \n     ignored; and\n       Whereas, the issue of finding ample resources to conduct \n     DNA tests on a timely basis is a substantial security issue \n     for our nation. The federal nature of this issue is further \n     underscored by the fact that violent criminals often move \n     around the country. Clearly, this issue is vital to the \n     safety of our citizens: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to increase the \n     level of federal funds available to the states for DNA \n     testing; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-417. A memorial adopted by the House of Representatives \n     of the Legislature of the State of Florida relative to the \n     protection of crime victim's rights; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                         House Memorial No. 335\n\n       Whereas, the rights of a victim of violent crime, being \n     capable of protection without denying the constitutional \n     rights of those accused of victimizing him or her, should not \n     be denied, and\n       Whereas, a victim of a violent crime should have the right \n     to reasonable and timely notice of any public proceeding \n     involving the crime and of any release or escape of the \n     accused, and\n       Whereas, a victim has the right to be included in such \n     public proceeding and to be reasonably heard at public \n     release, plea, sentencing, reprieve, and pardon proceedings, \n     and\n       Whereas, a victim has the right to adjudicative decisions \n     that duly consider the victim's safety, interest in avoiding \n     unreasonable delay, and just and timely claims to restitution \n     from the offender, and\n       Whereas, these rights should not be restricted except when \n     and to the degree dictated by a substantial interest in \n     public safety or the administration of criminal justice or by \n     compelling necessity: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida, That \n     the Congress of the United States is requested to enact a \n     proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States \n     to protect the rights of crime victims. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-418. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to the Aganda family of Selah, \n     Washington; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4041\n\n       Whereas, the plight of the Aganda family of Selah, \n     Washington has touched the hearts of citizens all over the \n     state; and\n       Whereas, Tomas Aganda, his wife Judy Aganda, and their \n     daughter Jennylyn Aganda face concerted and repeated efforts \n     by the United States Government to deport this family back to \n     the Philippines; and\n       Whereas, the Aganda family, including sons Herbie and \n     Khmson and daughter Stephanie, have been outstanding members \n     of the Selah community for over a decade; and\n       Whereas, the Aganda family lawfully entered this country on \n     October 22, 1990, and shortly thereafter purchased a small \n     laundry business in the Selah community; and\n       Whereas, Judy Aganda's parents are United States citizens \n     who live in Yakima; and\n       Whereas, the Aganda family first sought an investor's visa \n     so that they could stay and contribute their energy and \n     talents to this community and Country, but were denied \n     because the business was considered too small to support the \n     family; and\n       Whereas, the business is viable and has supported the \n     family for over a decade; and\n       Whereas, Judy Aganda has a cancerous growth as the base of \n     her skull that requires continued treatments that would not \n     be available to her in the Philippines; and\n       Whereas, United States District Court Judge Fred Van \n     Sickle, in granting a six-month stay of the deportation \n     order, noted that the United States Government's insistence \n     on deporting Judy Aganda, in the face of her life-threatening \n     condition, was a\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\n     ``magnitude of constitutional violation that is what I regard \n     as a manifest injustice''; and\n       Whereas, the protection of the six-month stay will end \n     April 17, 2004, but the need for a compassionate and reasoned \n     resolution of this crisis remains: Now, therefore,\n       Your Memorialists respectfully pray that the United States \n     Government end its concerted efforts to deport the Aganda \n     family and to instead provide them an opportunity to remain \n     in this country, especially in light of the fact that their \n     daughter Stephanie, who is a United States citizen, will be \n     twenty-one years old in 2005 and will then be able to file an \n     immigrant visa for her parents; and further,\n       That is the United States Bureau of Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services, acting in concert with the Department \n     of Homeland Security, is unwilling or unable to provide this \n     compassionate relief, then we call upon the members of our \n     state's congressional delegation to seek relief for the \n     Aganda family through the passage of a private bill of \n     relief.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to granting a federal charter to the Korean War \n     Veterans Association; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 24\n\n       Whereas, as our nation witnesses once again the sacrifices \n     of our fellow citizens taking up arms to preserve liberties, \n     we have reawakened our sensitivity to the importance of \n     service to veterans from all of America's wars. Organizations \n     that work to help and advocate on behalf of veterans help \n     fulfill a promise between our country and its defenders; and\n       Whereas, the Korean War Veterans Association is the only \n     veterans organization comprised exclusively of Korean War \n     veterans. This group has established an excellent record of \n     service to those who served and suffered in Korea and their \n     families; and\n       Whereas, however, the Korean War Veterans Association is \n     one of the few veterans groups of its size operating without \n     a federal charter. Legislation is currently pending in \n     Congress in both the House of Representatives (H.R. 1043) and \n     the Senate (S. 478) to grant a federal charter; and\n       Whereas, the long overdue granting of a federal charter \n     would enable the association to significantly enhance its \n     efforts to help needy Korean War veterans and their families. \n     With a charter, which would extend to it the same status as \n     other veterans groups, the Korean War Veterans Association \n     would be able to further its work and participate more fully \n     with other groups. A federal charter also would permit the \n     organization to assist in processing claims for benefits; and\n       Whereas, as our nation marks the fiftieth anniversary of \n     the end of military hostilities on the Korean Peninsula, \n     granting the federal charter would be most appropriate: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives (the senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to enact legislation to grant a federal charter to the \n     Korean War Veterans Association; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-420. A resolution adopted by the City Council of the \n     City of Gulfport of the State of Mississippi relative to same \n     sex marriages; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Mayor and City Council recognize that marriage \n     as an exclusive ceremonial relationship between a man and a \n     woman is not only traditional, but is a principle upon which \n     this country was founded, and is a union that has been held \n     sacred in society and essential to the moral value system in \n     the City of Gulfport, State of Mississippi, and throughout \n     this land; and that state and local tax laws, criminal laws, \n     marital benefits, rights and benefits arising from the \n     spousal relationship and dependents' rights are structured in \n     this country historically and presently to a man and woman \n     (opposite sex) marital relationship; and\n       Whereas, it is recognized that same sex relationships are \n     offensive to many citizens in this country for traditional, \n     personal, and religious reasons, and that marriages of a man \n     and woman have always been celebrated as proper, and always \n     will be acknowledged as natural, proper and built and honored \n     upon a foundation of values of the United States of America; \n     and the recognition of same sex marriages on the other hand \n     will have a devastating effect on the moral traditions and on \n     the laws and legal system of the country, and shall \n     ultimately mandate marriage unions to be ordained within \n     religious denominations against serious religious beliefs of \n     certain faiths thereby bringing about a dissolution of \n     freedom of religion in this Country; and\n       Whereas, believing that States should have a right to \n     protect its traditions and values, especially when confirmed \n     by the will of the people, and for the purpose of protecting \n     the family and its values, the Governing Authority of the \n     City of Gulfport hereby desires to memorialize its support of \n     the position addressed by President George W. Bush that an \n     amendment to the United States Constitution should be placed \n     by the legislative branch of the United States of America on \n     the ballot to allow the electorate to decide whether or not \n     laws prohibiting recognition of same sex marriages are \n     legitimate and not to be overruled by the Courts: Now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Mayor and City Council of Gulfport, \n     Mississippi, as follows:\n       Section 1. That the matters, facts, and things recited in \n     the Preamble hereto are hereby adopted as the official \n     findings of the Governing Authority.\n       Section 2. That United States President George W.

That this Resolution shall take effect \n     immediately upon its passage, and shall be spread upon the \n     minutes of the Gulfport City Council, and copies shall be \n     directed to the President of the United States of America, \n     Honorable Dick Cheney, Vice President of the United States of \n     America, to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, \n     to the Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate, and to Honorable \n     Trent Lott, U.S. Senator, Honorable Thad Cochran, U.S. \n     Senator, and Honorable Gene Taylor, U.S. Representative to \n     Congress, and the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the \n     State of Mississippi, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Mississippi, the President \n     Pro Tem of the Mississippi State Senate, and the Harrison \n     County delegation to the Mississippi Legislature, such other \n     officials in government as the Mayor or City Council may \n     direct to receive a copy thereof.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-421.

Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate strongly urges the United States \n     Congress and the President of the United States to restore \n     funding for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grants because \n     of the tremendous value these funds provide for local \n     communities in Tennessee.

Your Memorialists further pray that \n     Congress and the President affirm the debt owed these \n     veterans and provide funding for those services deemed \n     necessary. Be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to eligibility for prisoner of war benefits; to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 179\n\n       Whereas, under current federal law, a former Prisoner of \n     War is eligible for special benefits when the imprisonment \n     extends for a period of at least 30 days. These benefits \n     include a variety of health services, including some that \n     require a threshold of eligibility of 90 days of internment; \n     and\n       Whereas, many people strongly feel that the length of time \n     served as a POW necessary to receive special benefits is far \n     too long. The sacrifice being made by members of our military \n     who are incarcerated as prisoners and the conditions they \n     face are such that the 30-day requirement is entirely \n     inappropriate; and\n       Whereas, much stronger protections should be extended to \n     the men and women who risk everything in defense of their \n     country and their fellow citizens. Creating a minimum \n     threshold for POW benefits eligibility would send an \n     important message to our military that our country is making \n     a true commitment to these heroes commensurate with their \n     suffering and sacrifices: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to reduce the threshold of eligibility for \n     Prisoner of War benefits to one day of imprisonment; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4910-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ROBERTS, from the Select Committee on Intelligence:\n       Report to accompany S. 2386, An original bill to authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2005 for intelligence and \n     intelligence-related activities of the United States \n     Government, the Intelligence Community Management Account, \n     and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability \n     System, and for other purposes (Rept.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to require the \nregistration of contractors' taxpayer identification numbers in the \nCentral Contractor Registry database of the Department of Defense, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Central \nContractor Registry Act of 2004 whose purpose is to establish a \ncentralized contractor database within the Department of Defense and to \nrequire federal contractors who register in that database to provide \ntheir taxpayer identification number and their consent to verifying \nthat number with the Internal Revenue Service as a condition that must \nprecede the awarding of a contract by the Department of Defense. This \nbill will close a $3 billion tax loophole and will help to recover over \n$100 million annually from federal contractors who have not filed \nfederal tax returns or who have not paid the taxes they owe the \ngovernment. I am joined by Senators Carl Levin, Susan Collins and Jack \nReed.\n  In a hearing before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the \nGeneral Accounting Office testified that over 27,000 contractors at the \nDepartment of Defense owed over $3 billion in unpaid Federal taxes. \nNormally, these taxes could be collected through the Federal Payment \nLevy Program by levying fifteen percent of the contractors' payments. \nIn fiscal year 2002, the Financial Management Service should have \ncollected over $100 million from tax delinquent Department of Defense \ncontractors. However, actual collections for the year were less than\n\n[[Page S4913]]\n\n$500,000. Further, in 2001, the Department of Defense provided the \nInternal Revenue Service with over 26,000 information returns that \ncould not be used to determine contractors' tax liability. One of the \nprincipal reasons for this anemic state of collections and the large \nvolume of unusable information returns has been and remains the \ninability of the Department of Defense and the Internal Revenue Service \nto reach an accord on verifying the taxpayer identification numbers of \nthe contractors who have registered in the Department of Defenses's \nCentral Contractor Registration database.\n  Under current law, the Department of Defense's authority to verify \ncontractors' taxpayer identification numbers is limited to those \ncontractors who have contracts with the Department of Defense and for \nwhom the department is required to report miscellaneous income to the \nInternal Revenue Service on a Form 1099 information return. However, \nthere are contractors who have registered in the Central Contractor \nRegistration for whom the Department of Defense lacks authority to \nverify their taxpayer identification numbers including individuals and \ncompanies who would like to contract with the federal government and \ncontractors who have contracts with agencies and departments other than \nthe Department of Defense. On the other hand, current law also allows a \ntaxpayer to consent to the verification of their taxpayer \nidentification number with the Internal Revenue Service and allows the \nInternal Revenue Service to provide a validated taxpayer identification \nnumber.\n  My bill will resolve the impasse between the Department of Defense \nand the Internal Revenue Service by requesting contractors' consent to \nthe validation of their taxpayer identification number as part of the \nregistration process. Contractors will not be required to provide their \nconsent. But if they do not, they will not be awarded a contract by the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Further, my bill requires the Department of Defense to warn \ncontractors as part of the registration process that if they do not \nprovide a valid taxpayer identification number they may be subject to \nbackup withholding. This would apply to those contractors who list an \ninvalid taxpayer identification number, have a contract with the \nDepartment of Defense, and will earn miscellaneous income that is \nrequired to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I would like to briefly summarize the major provisions of my bill. It \nprovides a statutory basis for the Central Contractor Registration and \nrenames the database as the Central Contractor Registry. It requires \nthat the registry contain contractor's taxpayer identification numbers, \ntheir consent to verifying their numbers with the Internal Revenue \nService and for the Internal Revenue Service to provide a corrected \nnumber if possible. It requires that registrants furnish this \ninformation as a condition for registration, and requires the \nDepartment of Defense to warn contractors who fail to provide a valid \ntaxpayer identification number that they may be subject to backup \nwithholding and requires implementation of backup withholding in cases \nwhere it is required. It precludes awarding a contract to any \nregistrant who has not provided a valid taxpayer identification number \nand excludes from coverage any registrant who is not required to have a \ntaxpayer identification number.\n  It directs the Secretary of Defense to apply to the Internal Revenue \nService for inclusion in the Taxpayer Identification Number Matching \nProgram and directs the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to provide \nresponse to the Department of Defense. It directs the Secretary of \nDefense to provide any registrant who is determined to have an invalid \ntaxpayer identification number with an opportunity to provide a valid \nnumber. It further requires that the Central Contractor Registry \nclearly indicate whether a registrant's taxpayer identification number \nis valid, under review, invalid, or not required. Finally, it requires \nthat contractors taxpayer identification numbers be treated as \nconfidential by federal contract officers who have access to the \nCentral Contractor Registry.\n  My overall objective in introducing this bill is to ensure that tax \ncheats are not rewarded with federal contracts. If the Department of \nDefense and the Internal Revenue Service do not have accurate and \nreliable taxpayer identification numbers then we will not be able to \nstop this practice. My bill takes the necessary first step toward \nensuring that the Department of Defense and the Internal Revenue \nService have valid taxpayer identification numbers in the Central \nContractor Registry database.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the  \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Central Contractor Registry.''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Norm Coleman, Susan Collins and Jack Reed, in introducing the \nCentral Contractor Registry Act of 2004. The purpose of this bipartisan \nbill is to strengthen the ability of the Federal Government to stop tax \ncheats from obtaining Federal contracts or use a portion of their \ncontract payments to repay their tax debts.\n  In February, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which \nSenator Coleman and I sit, held a hearing on a report by the General \nAccounting Office which disclosed that over 27,000 contractors at the \nDepartment of Defense owe $3 billion in unpaid taxes, mostly from \nfailing to transmit payroll taxes to the IRS. Think about that for a \nminute--27,000 DOD contractors--more than one in every ten DOD \ncontractors--had outstanding tax debts at the same time they were \nholding out their hands for taxpayer dollars.\n  Allowing tax cheats to bid on federal contracts is a disservice to \nall of the honest taxpayers out there who manage to meet their tax \nobligations. It is a disservice to all of the military men and women \nwho put their lives on the line for us every day. It is a disservice to \nall of the honest companies that compete for the same DOD contracts, \nsince companies that do not pay their taxes have lower costs and a \ncompetitive advantage over the companies that do.\n  Under current law, DOD has an obligation to identify any DOD \ncontractor with unpaid taxes, to withhold up to 15 percent of their \ncontract payments, and to forward that money to the IRS to be applied \nto the contractor's tax debt. The official title of the DOD program to \ncarry out this obligation is the Federal Payment Levy Program, also \nsometimes referred to as the DOD tax levy program.\n  The first step in the program is for DOD to identify tax delinquent \nDOD contractors who are scheduled to get a contract payment in the near \nfuture. To identify these contractors, DOD participates in a computer \nmatching program administered by the Treasury Department that cross-\nchecks DOD lists of upcoming contractor payments with IRS lists of \ndelinquent taxpayers. If a match occurs, DOD is supposed to withhold \nmoney from the identified contractor's upcoming contract payments.\n  The problem is that the DOD-IRS computer matching program has so far \nproduced relatively few matches. In 2003, for example, DOD collected \nonly about $680,000 of back taxes through its tax levy program instead \nof the $100 million that GAO estimates should have been collected. That \nmeans DOD collected less than 1 percent of the back taxes it should \nhave.\n  On major impediment to the computer matching program has been that it \ndepends upon DOD's providing the correct taxpayer identification number \nor TIN for each of its contractors, when many DOD contractors have \neither failed to submit a TIN or supplied an incorrect number.\n  When a TIN is incorrect or missing, the computer matching program is \nunable to determine whether the relevant DOD contractor is on the IRS \nlist of delinquent taxpayers. Data indicates that, in one year, DOD \nsent the IRS over 26,000 invalid TINs that could not be used.\n  To increase the efficiency of the computer matching program, DOD and \nthe IRS have tried to improve the accuracy of the TINs in DOD's \ncontractor data. The IRS has, for example, set up a computer-based TIN \nvalidation system that can electronically verify a TIN number in \nseconds. This electronic system is available for use by DOD and all \nother Federal agencies. Unfortunately, the IRS has also interpreted \ncertain tax laws as prohibiting DOD from obtaining TIN validations for \nmany types of contracts. In addition, in the case of TIN numbers with \nclerical errors, the IRS has interpreted current taxpayer \nconfidentiality laws as prohibiting it from supplying DOD with a \ncorrected number.\n  The bill we are introducing today would eliminate this bureaucratic \nred tape and significantly increase the effectiveness of the tax levy \nprogram by increasing the accuracy of the TINs used by DOD.\n  The bill would strengthen TIN accuracy by focusing primarily on the \nTINs in the Central Contractor Registry, a government-wide database of \npersons wishing to bid on federal contracts. This registry is currently \nadministered by DOD, and current Federal regulations require potential \nbidders to self-register in the system by supplying specified \ninformation. As part of the process, registrants are currently supposed \nto supply a TIN, but many either do not or supply an incorrect number. \nThe bill would, for the first time, impose a legal requirement on \nregistrants to supply a valid TIN and would also bar contracts from \nbeing awarded to contractors who fail to supply a valid TIN.\n  In addition, the bill would require registrants to authorize DOD to \nvalidate their TINs with the IRS and obtain a corrected TIN from the \nIRS, if needed and possible. This requirement would apply to all \nregistrants in the Central Contractor Registry, no matter what type of \ncontract is involved and whether the contract is with DOD or another \nFederal agency. It would also allow the IRS to supply corrected TINs \nwhere it can promptly and reasonably do so.\n  If, by chance, a registrant managed to obtain a DOD contract without \nhaving supplied a valid TIN, the bill would direct DOD to withhold a \nportion of their contract payments to satisfy their tax debt as \nspecified under existing law. Although this backup holding requirement \nhas been on the books for years, DOD has not implemented it. The bill \nwould require DOD to start doing so.\n  Finally, the bill would provide a number of protections. It would \nrequire DOD and other federal procurement officials not to make TIN \nnumbers available to the public, so that this information is kept \nconfidential within the procurement community using the Central \nContractor Registry. It would explicitly exempt from the TIN \nrequirements any contractor, such as a foreign business, not required \nby U.S. law to have a taxpayer identification number. The bill would \nalso require DOD to show in the registry database whether a particular \nTIN has been validated, is awaiting validation, has been found invalid, \nor is not required, so that procurement officials using the database \nwill know the status of a contractor's TIN. If the IRS were to \ndetermine that a particular TIN was invalid, the bill would require DOD \nto give the relevant contractor an opportunity to correct the number. \nDOD would also be required to warn all registrants in the Central \nContractor Registry of the possibility of backup withholding in the \nevent they fail to provide a valid TIN.\n  It is common business sense for the Federal Government to require \ncontractors who want to be paid with Federal taxpayer dollars to allow \nthe United States to determine whether they owe any taxes and, if so, \nto offset a portion of their contract payments to reduce their tax \ndebts. To accomplish that objective, the Federal Government has to do a \nbetter job in identifying federal contractors with unpaid taxes. Our \nbill, by improving the accuracy of taxpayer identification numbers in \nthe Central Contractor Registry, will strengthen DOD's ability to \nidentify tax delinquent contractors and either deny them new contracts \nor reduce their tax debts.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join us in supporting this \nlegislation's enactment during this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Kennedy):\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\n  S. 2384. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to permit business \nconcerns that are owned by venture capital operating companies or \npension plans to participate in the Small Business Innovation Research \nProgram; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the United States biotechnology industry is \nthe world leader in innovation. This is due, in large part, to the \nFederal Government's partnership with the private sector to foster \ngrowth and commercialization in the hope that one day we will uncover a \ncure for unmet medical needs such as cystic fibrosis, heart disease, \nvarious cancers, multiple sclerosis, and AIDS.\n  However, the industry was dealt a major set-back when the Small \nBusiness Administration (SBA) determined that venture-backed \nbiotechnology companies can no longer participate in the Small Business \nInnovation Research (SBIR) program. Until recently, the SBIR program \nwas an example of a highly successful Federal initiative to encourage \neconomic growth and innovation in the biotechnology industry by funding \nthe critical start-up and development stages of a company.\n  Traditionally, to qualify for an SBIR grant a small-business \napplicant had to meet two requirements; one, that the company have less \nthan 500 employees; and two, that the business be 51 percent owned by \none or more individuals. Recently, however, the SBA determined that the \nterm ``individuals'' only means natural persons, whereas for the past \n20 years the term ``individual'' has included venture-capital \ncompanies. As a result, biotech companies backed by venture-capital \nfunding in Missouri and throughout our Nation, who are on the cutting \nedge of science, can no longer participate in the program.\n  The biotech industry is like no other in the world because it takes \nsuch a long span of time and intense capital expenditures to bring a \nsuccessful product to market. In fact, according to a recent study \ncompleted by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, it \ntakes roughly 10-15 years and $800 million dollars for a company to \nbring just one product to market. As you can imagine, the industry's \nentrepreneurs are seeking financial assistance wherever they can find \nit.\n  For the past 20 years, the SBIR program has been a catalyst for \ndeveloping our Nation's most successful biotechnology companies. In \naddition to these important government grants, venture-capital funding \nplays a vital role in the financial support of these same companies. \nThe strength of our biotechnology industry is a direct result of \ngovernment grants and venture-capital working together.\n  However, some have argued that a biotech firm with a majority of \nventure-capital backing is a large business. This is simply a bogus \nconclusion. Venture-capital firms solely invest in biotech start-ups \nfor the possibility of a future innovation and financial return and \ngenerally do not seek to take control over the management functions or \nday-to-day operations of the company. Venture-capital firms that seek \nto invest in small biotech businesses do not, simply by their \ninvestment, turn a small business into a large business. These are \nlegitimate, small, start-up businesses. Let's not punish them.\n  Instead, we must work together to avoid stifling innovation. Let me \nbe clear. Our impact today will foster cures and medicines tomorrow \nthat were once thought to be inconceivable. However, the industry \ncannot do it alone. We must nurture biotechnology and help the industry \ngrow for the future of our economy and for our well-being.\n  This bill that I am introducing today will do just that. It will \nensure that the biotechnology industry has access to SBIR grants, as it \nhas had for 20 years. It will level the playing field to ensure that \nSBIR grants are given to small businesses based on fruitful science and \nnothing else. This is still a young and fragile industry, and we are on \nthe cusp of great scientific advances. However, there will be profound \nconsequences if biotechnology companies continue to be excluded from \nthe SBIR program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2384\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse at South \nFederal Place in Santa Fe, New Mexico, as the ``Santiago E. Campos \nUnited States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nDomenici to introduce a bill to designate the United States Courthouse \nin Santa Fe, NM as the ``Honorable Santiago E. Campos United States \nCourthouse.'' Santiago Campos was appointed to the Federal Bench in \n1978 by President Jimmy Carter and was the first Hispanic Federal judge \nin New Mexico. He held the title of Chief U.S. District Judge from \nFebruary 5, 1987 to December 31, 1989 and took senior status in 1992.\n  Judge Campos was a dedicated and passionate public servant who spent \nmost of his life committed to working for the people of New Mexico and \nour Nation. He served as a seaman first class in the United States Navy \nfrom 1944 to 1946, as the Assistant Attorney General and then First \nAssistant Attorney General of New Mexico from 1954 to 1957, and as a \ndistrict court judge from 1971 to 1978 in the First Judicial District \nin the state of New Mexico. He was the prime mover in reestablishing \nFederal court judicial activity in Santa Fe and had his chambers in the \ncourthouse there for over 22 years. For his dedication to the State, \nJudge Campos received distinguished achievement awards in 1993 from \nboth the State Bar of New Mexico and the University of New Mexico.\n  Sadly, Judge Campos passed away January 20, 2001 after a long battle \nwith cancer. Judge Campos was an extraordinary jurist and served as a \nrole model and mentor to others in New Mexico. He was admired and \nrespected by all that knew him. I believe that it would be an \nappropriate tribute to Judge Campos to have the courthouse in Santa Fe \nbear his name.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 \nto direct the Secretary of the Army to provide assistance to design and \nconstruct a project to provide a continued safe and reliable municipal \nwater supply system for Devils Lake, North Dakota; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct a new municipal \nwater supply system for the city of Devils Lake, ND. This project is \nvery important to the reliability of the water supply for the residents \nof Devils Lake and is needed to mitigate long-term consequences from \nthe rising flood waters of Devils Lake.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Devils Lake region has been \nplagued by a flooding disaster since 1993. During that time, Devils \nLake, a closed basin lake, has risen 25 feet, consuming land, \ndestroying homes, and impacting vital infrastructure. As a result of \nthis disaster, the city of Devils Lake faces a significant risk of \nlosing its water supply. Currently, six miles or approximately one-\nthird of the city's 40-year-old water transmission line is covered by \nthe rising waters of Devils Lake. The submerged section of the water \nline includes numerous gate valves, air relief valves, and blow-off \ndischarges.\n  All of the water for the city's residents and businesses must flow \nthrough this single transmission line. It is also the only link between \nthe water source and the city's water distribution system. Since the \ntransmission line is operated under relatively low pressures and is \nunder considerable depths of water, a minor leak could cause \nsignificant problems. If a failure in the line were to occur, it would \nbe almost impossible to identify the leak and make necessary repairs, \nand the city would be left without a water supply.\n  The city is in the process of accessing a new water source due both \nto the threat of a transmission line failure and the fact that its \ncurrent water source exceeds the new arsenic standard that will take \neffect in 2006. The city has worked closely with the North Dakota State \nWater Commission in identifying a new water source that will not be \naffected by the rising flood waters and will provide the city with \nadequate water to meet its current and future needs.\n  The bill I am introducing today will authorize the Corps to construct \na new water supply system for the city. I believe the Federal \nGovernment has a responsibility to assist communities mitigate the \nadverse consequences resulting from this ongoing flooding disaster. In \nmy view, the Corps should be responsible for addressing the unintended \nconsequences of this flood and mitigate its long-term consequences. \nThis bill will help the Federal Government live up to its \nresponsibility and ensure that the residents of Devils Lake have a safe \nand reliable water supply. I urge my colleagues to review this \nlegislation quickly so we can pass it this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Miller, Mr. Smith, Mr. Graham of \n        South Carolina, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Thomas, Mr. Burns, Mr. Lott, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 2389. A bill to require the withholding of United States \ncontributions to the United Nations until the President certifies that \nthe United Nations is cooperating in the investigation of the United \nNations Oil-for-Food Program; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation in \nthe hopes that it will correct a grave injustice committed against the \npeople of Iraq as well as the honest and law-abiding citizens of the \nworld community.\n  We now believe that Saddam Hussein, corrupt U.N. officials, and \ncorrupt well-connected countries were the real benefactors of the Oil-\nfor-Food Program. Their benefits came from illegal oil shipments, \nfinancial transactions, kickbacks, and surcharges and allowed Saddam \nHussein to build up his armed forces and live in the lap of luxury.\n  The evidence in this far-reaching scandal tells an unbelievable \nstory. In January of this year, the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) \nreleased a list of 270 former government officials, businessmen, \npolitical parties, and foreign cronies of Hussein from more than 46 \ncountries suspected of profiting from illegal oil sales that were part \nof the U.N.'s Oil-for-Food Program.\n  Our own U.S. General Accounting Office estimates that Saddam Hussein \nsiphoned off $4.4 billion through oil sale surcharges. Saddam Hussein \nalso demanded kickbacks on the humanitarian relief side from suppliers \nwhich amounted to 10-20 percent on many contracts.\n  Saddam used this revenue to rebuild Iraq's military capabilities, to \nmaintain lavish palaces, buy loyalty, oppress his people and \nfinancially support terrorism. And as Claude Hankes-Drielsma, an IGC \nconsultant investigating the scandal testified, the secret payments \n``provided Saddam Hussein and his corrupt regime with a convenient \nvehicle through which he bought support internationally by bribing \npolitical parties, companies and journalists . . . This secured the \ncooperation and support of countries that included members of the \nSecurity Council of the United Nations.''\n  The United Nations should be embarrassed.\n  What resulted from the goodwill gesture was international scandal, \ncorruption at the highest levels, and suffering Iraqi citizens. Not \nexactly a model U.N. program.\n  Contrary to its protestations, the United Nations Secretariat had a \ncritical role in the implementation and management of the program. It \nkept the contract records. It controlled the bank accounts and was the \nonly entity allowed to release Saddam Hussein's oil earnings. And it \narranged for the audits. As Secretary General Kofi Annan noted, ``under \nthe program, the [U.N.] Secretary General was required to supervise the \nsale of Iraqi oil, and to monitor the spending of the proceeds on \nspecific goods and services for the benefit of the Iraqi people.''\n  Well, he did a lousy job.\n  Tasked by the international community to deny Saddam Hussein the \nability to rebuild his military apparatus while providing humanitarian \nneeds, the United Nations allowed the corrupt to become richer and \ninnocent Iraqis to be oppressed.\n  Today we have a chance to rectify that injustice. We must demand that \nthe United Nations cooperate completely with efforts to extrapolate the \ntruth from this scandal and punish the guilty. We know that the Volker \npanel does not have subpoena power.\n  And we've now learned that officials acting on behalf of Benon Sevan, \nthe Executive Director of the Oil-for-Food Program, who is personally \nimplicated in the scandal, are asking contractors not to release \ndocuments relating to the program to congressional investigators \nwithout getting U.N. authorization. An April 2, 2004, U.N. letter to a \nSwiss firm Cotecna reminded the firm that according to its contract all \ndocuments: ``shall be property of the United Nations, shall be treated \nas confidential and shall be delivered only to United Nations \nauthorized officials.'' Cotecna, was in charge of inspecting the \nhumanitarian goods shipped to Iraq under Oil-for-Food. It had Kofi \nAnnan's son Kojo on its payroll until the month it won its U.N. \ncontract. And an April 14 letter reminded a Dutch company called \nSaybolt of its confidentiality agreements with the U.N., demanding \n``that Saybolt address any further requests for documentation or \ninformation concerning these matters to us.'' Saybolt was in charge of \nmaking sure oil invoices matched shipments.\n  The United Nations should be more interested in bringing the truth to \nlight then trying to protect its tattered reputation and its corrupt \nofficials.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will hold the United Nations' \nfeet to the fire on this scandal. It calls for transparency and \naccountability. Under this bill, the United Nations must allow GAO and \nlaw enforcement agencies access to its Oil-for-Food records. U.N. \nofficials must waive their immunity for any crimes committed on United \nStates soil and repay their ill-gotten gains.\n  If not, 10 percent of our assessed U.N. regular budget contributions \nwill be withheld the first year and 20 percent the second year. \nGranted, the withholding of $36 million in the first year is no where \nnear the more than $1 billion that the United Nations skimmed\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\noff the top of Iraqi oil sales for administrative costs or the billions \nthat were stolen from the Iraqi people through corruption and \nmismanagement. But the 10 percent withholding worked in the past when \nthe 103rd Congress used it to compel the United Nations to create an \ninspector general. And I believe it can work again.\n  But we have to make an important choice first. We can do nothing and \nallow the word ``humanitarianism'' to be the new code word for \ncorruption scandal from here on out. Or we can stand up and make the \nUnited Nations rightfully accountable for the corruption that harmed \ninnocent Iraqis. The answer is clear. We must act.\n  The U.N. is broken. This scandal revealed that the U.N. Security \nCouncil is unable to do its job when some members are more interested \nin lining their pockets than preserving security. I contend that there \nwas no way that the U.S. could get France and Russia to enforce \nSecurity Council resolutions on Iraq and go to war when so many of \ntheir politically connected individuals, companies, and institutions \nreceived Iraqi oil contracts. Victory brought their corruption to \nlight. And I am deeply worried that the ability of the United Nations \nto convey ``legitimacy'' to the new Iraqi government and assist in \npostwar Iraq is hampered by its history of corruption and mismanagement \nin the Oil-for-Food program.\n  The U.N. needs to come clean and start over. The first step toward \ndoing that is to accept the terms and conditions of the Oil-for-Food \nAccountability Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4917-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4917-S4918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 352--URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE TO ENSURE A \nDEMOCRATIC, TRANSPARENT, AND FAIR ELECTION PROCESS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL \n                      ELECTION ON OCTOBER 31, 2004\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Biden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 352\n\n       Whereas the establishment of a democratic, transparent, and \n     fair election process for the 2004 presidential election in \n     Ukraine and of a genuinely democratic political system are \n     prerequisites for that country's full integration into the \n     Western community of nations as an equal member, including \n     into organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine has accepted numerous \n     specific commitments governing the conduct of elections as a \n     participating State of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including provisions of the \n     Copenhagen Document;\n       Whereas the election on October 31, 2004, of Ukraine's next \n     president will provide an unambiguous test of the extent of \n     the Ukrainian authorities' commitment to implement these \n     standards and build a democratic society based on free \n     elections and the rule of law;\n       Whereas this election takes place against the backdrop of \n     previous elections that did not fully meet international \n     standards and of disturbing trends in the current pre-\n     election environment;\n       Whereas it is the duty of government and public authorities \n     at all levels to act in a manner consistent with all laws and \n     regulations governing election procedures and to ensure free \n     and fair elections throughout the entire country, including \n     preventing activities aimed at undermining the free exercise \n     of political rights;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires a \n     period of political campaigning conducted in an environment \n     in which neither administrative action nor violence, \n     intimidation, or detention hinder the parties, political \n     associations, and the candidates from presenting their views \n     and qualifications to the citizenry, including organizing \n     supporters, conducting public meetings and events throughout \n     the country, and enjoying unimpeded access to television, \n     radio, print, and Internet media on a non-discriminatory \n     basis;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires that \n     citizens be guaranteed the right and effective opportunity to \n     exercise their civil and political rights, including the \n     right to vote and the right to seek and acquire information \n     upon which to make an informed vote, free from intimidation, \n     undue influence, attempts at vote buying, threats of \n     political retribution, or other forms of coercion by national \n     or local authorities or others;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires \n     government and public authorities to ensure that candidates \n     and political parties enjoy equal treatment before the law \n     and that government resources are not employed to the \n     advantage of individual candidates or political parties;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires the \n     full transparency of laws and regulations governing \n     elections, multiparty representation on election commissions, \n     and unobstructed access by candidates, political parties, and \n     domestic and international observers to all election \n     procedures, including voting and vote-counting in all areas \n     of the country;\n       Whereas increasing control and manipulation of the media by \n     national and local officials and others acting at their \n     behest raise grave concerns regarding the commitment of the \n     Ukrainian authorities to free and fair elections;\n       Whereas efforts by the national authorities to limit access \n     to international broadcasting, including Radio Liberty and \n     the Voice of America, represent an unacceptable infringement \n     on the right of the Ukrainian people to independent \n     information;\n       Whereas efforts by national and local officials and others \n     acting at their behest to impose obstacles to free assembly, \n     free speech, and a free and fair political campaign have \n     taken place in Donetsk, Sumy, and elsewhere in Ukraine \n     without condemnation or remedial action by the Ukrainian \n     Government;\n       Whereas numerous substantial irregularities have taken \n     place in recent Ukrainian parliamentary by-elections in the \n     Donetsk region and in mayoral elections in Mukacheve, Romny, \n     and Krasniy Luch; and\n       Whereas the intimidation and violence during the April 18, \n     2004, mayoral election in Mukacheve, Ukraine, represent a \n     deliberate attack on the democratic process: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges and welcomes the strong relationship \n     formed between the United States and Ukraine since the \n     restoration of Ukraine's independence in 1991;\n       (2) recognizes that a precondition for the full integration \n     of Ukraine into the Western community of nations, including \n     as an equal member in institutions such as the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO), is its establishment of a \n     genuinely democratic political system;\n       (3) expresses its strong and continuing support for the \n     efforts of the Ukrainian people to establish a full \n     democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights in \n     Ukraine;\n       (4) urges the Government of Ukraine to guarantee freedom of \n     association and assembly, including the right of candidates, \n     members of political parties, and others to freely assemble, \n     to organize and conduct public events, and to exercise these \n     and other rights free from intimidation or harassment by \n     local or national officials or others acting at their behest;\n       (5) urges the Government of Ukraine to meet its \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     commitments on democratic elections and to address issues \n     previously identified by the Office of Democratic \n     Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the OSCE in its \n     final reports on the 2002 parliamentary elections and the \n     1999 presidential elections, such as illegal interference by \n     public authorities in the campaign and a high degree of bias \n     in the media;\n       (6) urges the Ukrainian authorities to ensure--\n       (A) the full transparency of election procedures before, \n     during, and after the 2004 presidential elections;\n       (B) free access for Ukrainian and international election \n     observers;\n       (C) multiparty representation on all election commissions;\n       (D) unimpeded access by all parties and candidates to \n     print, radio, television, and Internet media on a non-\n     discriminatory basis;\n       (E) freedom of candidates, members of opposition parties, \n     and independent media organizations from intimidation or \n     harassment by government officials at all levels via \n     selective tax audits and other regulatory procedures, and in \n     the case of media, license revocations and libel suits, among \n     other measures;\n       (F) a transparent process for complaint and appeals through \n     electoral commissions and within the court system that \n     provides timely and effective remedies; and\n       (G) vigorous prosecution of any individual or organization \n     responsible for violations of election laws or regulations, \n     including the application of appropriate administrative or \n     criminal penalties;\n       (7) further calls upon the Government of Ukraine to \n     guarantee election monitors from the ODIHR, other \n     participating States of the OSCE, Ukrainian political \n     parties, candidates' representatives, nongovernmental \n     organizations, and other private institutions and \n     organizations, both foreign and domestic, unobstructed access \n     to all aspects of the election process, including unimpeded \n     access to public campaign events, candidates, news media, \n     voting, and post-election tabulation of results and \n     processing of election challenges and complaints; and\n       (8) pledges its enduring support and assistance to the \n     Ukrainian people's establishment of a fully free and open \n     democratic system, their creation of a prosperous free market \n     economy, their establishment of a secure independence and \n     freedom from coercion, and their country's assumption of its \n     rightful place as a full and equal member of the Western \n     community of democracies.\n\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as Co-Chairman of the Helsinki \nCommission, I submit today a resolution urging the Government of \nUkraine to ensure a democratic, transparent and fair election process \nfor the presidential elections scheduled to be held in late October. An \nidentical resolution is being submitted by Chairman of the House \nInternational Relations Committee Henry Hyde and my colleague and \nChairman of the Helsinki Commission, Representative Chris Smith. I am \npleased to note that the Commission's Ranking Member, Mr. Dodd, and the \nRanking Member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, Mr. Biden, are \noriginal cosponsors of the resolution.\n  The Helsinki Commission, which has long monitored and encouraged \nhuman rights, rule of law and democracy in Ukraine, continues to be a \nstalwart supporter of Ukraine's development as an independent, \ndemocratic and market-oriented state. There is a genuine desire in the \nUnited States for Ukraine to succeed in this process and for the long-\nsuffering Ukrainian people to fully realize their dreams and \naspirations. This resolution, by encouraging fair, open and transparent \nelections, is a concrete expression of the commitment of the U.S. \nCongress to the Ukrainian people.\n  The resolution underscores that an election process and the \nestablishment of a genuinely democratic political system consistent \nwith Ukraine's freely-undertaken OSCE commitments is a prerequisite for \nUkraine's full integration into the Western community of nations as an \nequal member, including into NATO. The October elections will be vital \nin determining Ukraine's course for years to come and they present the \nUkrainian authorities with a real opportunity to demonstrate their \ncommitment to OSCE principles and values.\n  Unfortunately, Ukraine's pre-election environment has already been \ndecidedly problematic and of increasing concern to the United States \nand the international community. During the course of this year I have \nshared specific concerns with Senate colleagues, particularly in terms \nof the media. The resolution submitted today focuses squarely on key \nproblem areas, including increasing control and manipulation of the \nmedia and attempts by national authorities to limit access to \ninternational broadcasting, including Radio Liberty and Voice of \nAmerica. Among other concerns are the blatant obstacles to free \nassembly and a free and fair political campaign as well as substantial \nirregularities in several recent elections.\n  An egregious example of how not to conduct elections was the mayoral \nelection held two weeks ago in the western Ukrainian city of Mukacheve. \nThis election was marred by intimidation, violence, fraud and \nmanipulation of the vote count, electoral disruptions and \nirregularities. Despite strong evidence indicating that a candidate \nfrom the democratic opposition ``Our Ukraine'' bloc had won, the \nterritorial elections commission announced as winner the candidate of a \nparty led by the head of Presidential Administration, Viktor \nMedvedchuk. That some of the abuses and violence took place in front of \nOSCE observers, and that some of the victims of violence were members \nof the Ukrainian parliament, only underscores the brazenness of these \nactions. The outlandish conduct of the Mukacheve elections not only \ncasts doubt over their outcome, but when coupled with other recent \nproblematic elections, including in Constituency No. 61 in Donetsk, \ncould be a barometer for the October presidential elections.\n  The resolution I submit today outlines those measures the Ukrainian \nauthorities need to take--consistent with their own laws and \ninternational agreements--for a free, fair, open and transparent \nelection process. The Ukrainian authorities at all levels, including \nthe executive, legislative and judicial branches, need to ensure an \nelection process that enables all of the candidates to compete on a \nlevel playing field. This includes the various institutions and \nagencies involved directly or indirectly in the elections process, such \nas the Central Election Commission, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, \nProcuracy, the State Security Service (SBU), Tax Administration, as \nwell as the Constitutional and Supreme Courts.\n  Ukraine's October presidential elections should be a watershed for \nthe future direction of that country of great potential. It is \nabundantly clear that a small clique have a vested interest in \nperpetuating the outmoded status quo. Ukrainian authorities need to \nradically improve the election environment if there is to be hope for \nthese elections to meet OSCE standards. The question is whether their \nperceived self-interest will trump the interest of the people of \nUkraine. Having restored the independence of their proud land, the \nUkrainian people deserve an opportunity to overcome the legacy of the \npast, and consolidate democracy, human rights and the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4918-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3117.

Mr. President, I was present for the concluding remarks \nof the majority leader regarding the atrocities committed in Iraq \nagainst the prisoners there. I certainly share his sentiments. A number \nof my colleagues have spoken today from both sides of the aisle \nexpressing their horror, their outrage, and their deep regret. I join \nwith them as well.\n  I also am deeply disturbed as a Senator and as a Member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee at the lack of communication from the military \nand the civilian command to those Members of the Senate about these \nincidents--in fact, right up to the moment they were disclosed to the \nAmerican people through, fortunately, a free and vigilant press.\n  According to the information I have been able to obtain, a copy of \nthe most recently referenced classified internal military report, and \nother news reports about that and other information, many of these \nincidents that have been under investigation occurred last October, \nlast November--in other words, over half a year ago. They are horrible \nevents. The report said that Iraqi prisoners had been victims of \nsadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses. They were beaten with \nbroom handles and chairs and threatened with rape. One prisoner was \nsodomized with a chemical light stick or with a broomstick. Military \ndogs were also used to frighten and intimidate detainees. One graphic \ndescription in the New York Times today talks about the experience of a \nparticular Iraqi male, the deep humiliation and shame he still feels, \nthe utter degradation, the sadistic and disgusting abuse of him night \nafter night by his American captors.\n  I agree with the remarks of the majority leader that these people \ncarrying out these terrible deeds were few in number, but tragically \ntheir impact is enormous. They are going to make life a lot more \ndifficult and a lot more dangerous for the 134,000 incredibly brave, \npatriotic Americans who are over there putting their lives on the line \nevery day and night.\n  A story in the New York Times gives a sense of how this is affecting \nthe way the United States is viewed in the Arab world, saying in the \nArab world and beyond, the tormenting of Iraqi prisoners by their \nAmerican guards shredded already thin support for Washington's invasion \nof Iraq and its vow to install democratic values and respect for human \nrights.\n  The outrage over the abuse shown in pictures flashed across front \npages and television screens drew emotional comparisons, asking how the \nAmerican occupation of the country could be distinguished from the way \nSaddam Hussein's government oppressed the ordinary Iraqis. This kind of \noutrage will lead to more attacks against our forces, greater intensity \nof attacks, more bombing and assassination attempts against our forces \nand other representatives, more casualties, more men and women from \nAmerica dying, shedding blood as a result of this immoral and illegal \nmisconduct.\n  The U.S. military, according to this report, first became aware of \nthese incidents, or some of them, as early as January of this year; in \nfact, maybe even sooner than that. It was January 19 that LTG Ricardo \nSanchez, the commander of the joint task force in Iraq, requested that \nthese incidents of last October, November, and December be \ninvestigated. There was a preliminary report which indicated systemic \nproblems within the prison brigade and suggested a lack of clear \nstandards, proficiency, and leadership.\n  That investigation began then on January 24. It was carried out \nthrough interviews and other investigations of both Iraqi prisoners, \nformer prisoners, and U.S. military personnel who had witnessed these \nincidents.\n  On February 29, the executive summary was presented to the military \ncommand; on March 19, the final written report. The outbrief to the \nappointing authority took place on March 3, 2004. That is 2 months ago, \nand actually the 2 months preceding that, various people in the chain \nof command were aware of these incidents.\n  They must have recognized the enormous impact they would have, the \ndevastating effect they would have upon our situation in that country, \nmilitarily, diplomatically, and in our relations with other countries \nthroughout\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\nthe world. Yet as far as I have been told, not one word--not one word, \nliterally, was communicated to anyone in the Senate, Democrat or \nRepublican.\n  We had, in fact, a briefing last Thursday afternoon, a top-secret \nclassified briefing, which was attended, as I recall, by about 40 to 45 \nMembers of the Senate with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. That briefing occurred 2, 3 hours before the \n``60 Minutes II'' report which disclosed these incidents and this \nreport. Not one word--not one word--was mentioned to any of us.\n  I have been in briefings as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee through the last weeks and months where we have asked, time \nafter time: What is going on? What is the progress? What is the lack of \nprogress? Where are the problems? What is occurring? Not a word about \nthis. Not a word, until it occurred, of the eruption of violence, the \nintensification of violence, in key areas of Iraq over the last several \nweeks, which caused, in April, the highest level of casualties since \nthe war began. We ask, again and again: What is going on? And we are \ntold: Everything is fine. We are making great progress.\n  As early as last August, we were told 95 percent of the country is \npeacefully progressing. Everything is going well. And we find out, \nthrough news reports or through the reality of events, that is not the \ncase.\n  There is no credibility. The American people are not being told the \nfacts and the truth. The U.S. Congress is not being told the facts and \nthe truth. We deserve the facts and the truth.\n  I do not know who knew what at what point in time up through this \nchain of command. But I believe we have the responsibility and the \nright to find out. We are going to have, I am told, the opportunity, in \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, to meet with Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld this Friday morning. I certainly--and I know others, too--will \nbe asking for that sequence of events and asking why it is that we are \nnot told relevant information, crucial information that affects the \nconditions over there, the progress or lack thereof, that then, in \nturn, affects the lives, the safety, the well-being of the men and \nwomen who are serving over there heroically, and whose families are \nwaiting back in my State of Minnesota and across this country, \nfrantically, anxiously, wondering what their future is going to be, \nwondering if they are going to return home alive safely.\n\n  We were elected in a democratic process by those men and women, their \nfamilies, to be here to look out for them, to ask questions about what \nis going on, to be given the information about what is occurring, so we \ncan participate in decisions that are going to affect U.S. policies \nthat are going to determine the outcome of their lives--when they will \nbe home, whether they will come home.\n  I think the people at various levels who participated in this \ninvestigation--I am not going to call it a coverup because there was an \nongoing investigation, but, my goodness, for the last 2 months, when it \nwas completed, and we were not informed, it was not being reported. If \nnot covered up, it was being hidden from Congress.\n  I am going to ask those individuals to read or reread the United \nStates Constitution and refresh their understanding of what it means to \nbe in a constitutionally established democracy where the executive \nbranch and the legislative branch have coequal responsibilities.\n  I certainly would like to work with Members of both sides of the \naisle in regard to the authorization of military----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to \nconclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I would like to work with Members of both \nsides of the aisle to put in place language, in the military \nauthorization and in any supplemental requests that are going to be \nmade, that we be given full and necessary disclosure, the same way we \nrequire corporations that are making stock offerings to inform their \ninvestors, the same way we require corporations and those running them \nto inform their boards of directors of relevant, critically important \ninformation that has a material bearing on the information that is \nbeing presented so they can make informed decisions. We are getting far \nless than that. We are being asked to make informed decisions when we \nare not being given the information, we are not being told the truth. \nWe are having vital, important information withheld. That has to stop. \nWe need to disclose what has occurred in these incidents.\n  We need to make sure they never happen again. And we need to make \nsure that we in Congress are given the opportunity that we deserve, the \nright that we have, to look out on behalf of the American people to \nmake sure they never occur again.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, will the last aerospace worker leaving \nAmerica turn out the lights? I ask that question to sound an alarm for \nevery American who cares about our economy and our security.\n  We are about to surrender our global aerospace leadership because we \nare sitting on our hands while Europe is doing everything it can to \ndismantle our aerospace industry.\n  Today, I am sounding the alarm. Unless we wake up to this threat, we \nare going to lose an industry that Americans created and that has \nbrought innovation to every corner of our economy.\n  We Americans led the first century of flight, but we might not even \nhave a role in the second century if we keep sleepwalking down this \ndangerous road.\n  I am here on the Senate floor tonight to say: Wake up. Wake up to \nthis threat before we lose another American industry. Wake up to this \nthreat before we lose more high-wage, high-skill American jobs. Wake up \nto this threat before it is too late.\n  Too many Americans, especially in our Government, are not aware of \nwhat Europe is doing to kill off our aerospace industry. I want to \nexpose the unlimited assault that Europe and Airbus are leveling at \nAmerica's aerospace workers.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been troubled by Europe's market-\ndistorting actions in commercial aerospace for many years. I have \nraised my concern with Senators, with foreign leaders, and with \nadministrations of both parties.\n  Tonight, I am detailing my concerns before the full Senate because \nEADS and Airbus have launched a deceptive PR and lobbying campaign to \nconvince the U.S. Government that it is essentially an American \ncompany. The Airbus campaign of half-truths is on full display as the \ncompany works overtime in Washington, DC, to recreate a competition \nthey already lost to build the next generation refueling tanker for the \nAir Force.\n  I have come to the Senate floor tonight to set the record straight \nand to show how Europe's broader plan to dominate aerospace threatens \nour future.\n  Tonight, I am going to focus on five issues.\n  First, I want to explain why this is so important for our country.\n  Secondly, I want to explain how the European view of aerospace as a \nsocial program to create jobs is helping Europe beat out our more \ntraditional business perspective.\n  Third, I want to expose, in detail, the underhanded things that \nAirbus is doing to dismantle our aerospace industry, from providing \nsubsidies for launch aid, research, facilities and suppliers, to \nselling planes below cost, guaranteeing the future value of aircraft, \ntying sales to landing rights, and linking plane sales to other trade \nissues.\n  Fourth, I want to expose the deceptive lobbying and PR campaign \nAirbus is using to reopen a competition it lost and the dangers that \nposes for American security. Finally, I want to talk about the steps we \nmust take to retain our leadership of this critical industry.\n  Let me explain the title of my speech, ``Will the Last Aerospace \nWorker Leaving America Turn Out the\n\n[[Page S4924]]\n\nLights?'' I have the great honor of representing the State of \nWashington which is one of America's great aerospace centers. We are \nvery proud of our long history and our leadership. On July 15, 1916, \nBill Boeing started his airplane company in Seattle, WA. Since that \nday, Boeing and Washington State have shared the ups and downs of the \ncommercial aerospace industry. We have experienced extended periods of \nnearly full employment, and we have endured marked downturns that left \ntens of thousands unemployed.\n  In the early 1970s, there was a particularly bad downturn. It seemed \nas if everyone was leaving Seattle. So two Seattle businessmen decided \nto post a billboard to put a lighthearted spin on all the layoffs. Here \nis the photo that ran in the Seattle Times in 1971. It shows a \nbillboard with a light bulb and a string coming out of it. It says, \n``Will the last person leaving Seattle turn out the lights.''\n  Anyone who lived through this difficult period in Washington State \nknows this sign. Eventually Seattle recovered, and since the 1970s we \nhave experienced ups and downs. Today we are facing another severe \ndownturn in the aerospace industry. But today it is not just Seattle or \nWashington State that is hurting. We are hemorrhaging aerospace jobs in \nKansas, California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, Georgia, \nArizona, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Connecticut, Maryland, New Hampshire, \nMassachusetts, and Colorado. This is a national problem, and we are not \ntoo many years away from asking, will the last aerospace worker leaving \nAmerica turn off the lights? We have to take action before it is too \nlate. Sadly, we are approaching a point of no return.\n  Last week the top two executives of EADS revealed their plans to take \nover the global aerospace industry. According to a German newspaper on \nApril 27, 2004, CEO Rainer Hertrich said:\n\n       In ten years, we'll be number one, everywhere, worldwide.\n\n  His CEO Phillipe Camus said:\n\n       We're now ready for our final step: globalization.\n\n  Some of my colleagues may wonder why I am speaking at some length \ntonight about the future of our aerospace industry. It is because this \nindustry is critical for jobs, for our economy, for our security, and \nfor our future.\n  The commercial aerospace industry employs more than 2 million \nAmericans with an average salary of $47,000. But unfortunately, we are \nlosing these good-paying jobs at a rapid rate. In the past 15 years, we \nhave lost 700,000 American aerospace jobs. These are scientific and \ntechnical jobs; 700,000 high-skilled, high-wage jobs are gone. Unless \nwe wake up, we are about to lose more.\n  We spend a lot of time in the Senate talking about how American jobs \nare being shipped overseas in search of cheaper labor. Aerospace is a \nlittle different than some of the other industries we have discussed. \nAerospace jobs are not low-wage, low-skill jobs that move to where the \nlabor is cheapest. These are high-wage, high-skilled jobs we need to \nkeep in America. But we are being aggressively challenged by Europe for \nthose jobs.\n\n  Aerospace is also important for our overall economy. Our leadership \nin commercial aerospace has helped American industries, from health \ncare to automobiles, become safer, more efficient, and more productive.\n  According to John Douglas, president of the Aerospace Industries \nAssociation of America, the aerospace sector ``generates economic \nactivity equal to nearly 15 percent of the nation's gross domestic \nproduct and supports approximately 11 million American jobs.'' Mr. \nDouglas notes that aerospace also led the Nation in net exports with a \n$30 billion surplus in 2000.\n  The Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry found \nthat in 2001:\n\n       . . . more than 600 million passengers relied on U.S. \n     commercial air transportation and over 150 million people \n     were transported on general aviation aircraft. Over 40 \n     percent of the value of U.S. freight is transported by air. \n     Aerospace capabilities have enabled e-commerce to flourish \n     with overnight and parcel delivery and just in time \n     manufacturing.\n\n  Not only is this about jobs, it is also about security. It is \nirresponsible to let our country surrender our aerospace leadership. \nOnce our plants shut down, once our skilled workers move to other \nfields, once the infrastructure is gone, you can't recreate that \novernight. It took 100 years to build our aerospace leadership, and we \ncould lose it all in the next 10 years.\n  Finally, commercial aerospace is important for our future. Europe is \nworking hard to overtake our leadership of aerospace because they know \nit is the future, the future of the worldwide economy and the future of \nhuman exploration. Europe wants to lead the future. And if we stay on \nthis track, they will.\n  This industry is worth saving because it is important for our jobs, \nour economy, our security, and our future. I should explain by way of \nbackground there are only two companies in the world that make large \npassenger airplanes. One is the Boeing Company. Its commercial air \noperation is headquartered in Renton, WA. The other is Airbus which is \nheadquartered in Toulouse, France. Airbus is a division of the European \nAeronautics Defense and Space Company also known as EADS. Throughout my \nremarks tonight, I will refer to Airbus and EADS interchangeably. So it \nis one European company and one American company competing for control \nof the commercial aerospace industry.\n  Next I want to talk about how the United States and Europe view \ncommercial aerospace, because we have two very different visions. \nUnfortunately, their vision will allow them to overtake us unless we \nrealize what they are doing.\n   Let me start at home. For us in America, commercial aerospace is \nseen as private business. Some companies will win; some companies will \nlose. We will let the marketplace decide. But for Europe, aerospace is \na jobs program. The European governments will fund and support their \ndomestic industry because creating aerospace jobs in and of itself is \nconsidered a priority. They don't care if Airbus loses money. They \ndon't even require Airbus to pay back loans on failed products. They \ndon't care as long as they are creating jobs for Europeans.\n  Europe views aerospace as a long-term investment. They are \naggressively subsidizing the industry and pressuring and rewarding \ncustomers without regard to making a profit or following the business \nrules American workers must follow. Simply put: They are willing to pay \nany price to take over American leadership.\n  Don't take my word for it. Look at what EU leaders have said. Here is \nwhat British Prime Minister Tony Blair had to say last year:\n\n       As a result of over 500,000 pounds in launch aid, Airbus is \n     today in a position where it can take over the leadership of \n     the large aircraft market from Boeing in the United States. \n     That would be tremendous for British manufacturing and for \n     European industry.\n\n  It is not just Tony Blair. Here is what a 2001 report to the European \nCommission, titled ``European Aeronautics, a Vision for 2020'' states:\n\n       European aeronautics has grown and prospered with the \n     support of public funds, and this support must continue if we \n     are to achieve our objective of global leadership.\n\n  The same report goes on to say:\n\n       Total funding required from all public and private sources \n     over the next 20 years could go beyond 100 billion euros.\n\n  Simply put, Europe views aerospace jobs as a priority. According to \nthe European Aerospace Industry Association, there are at least 407,000 \ndirect jobs in Europe's aerospace sector, more than 1.2 million total \njobs supported by aerospace in Europe, and there are more than 80,000 \nfirms in the European aerospace supply chain.\n  Europe has maintained a $20 billion annual trade surplus in aerospace \ngoods since 1996. Europe has an aggressive investigation for the future \nof aerospace. It wants to use significant public investment to create \nand sustain jobs, largely at the expense of U.S. competitors and \nworkers.\n  Here is how the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace \nindustry put it in 2002:\n\n       Unfortunately, it appears that European officials intend to \n     continue directly subsidizing EU companies. The recently \n     unveiled EU aerospace policy strategy calls for an increase \n     in subsidies to continue building market share, largely at \n     the expense of U.S. companies.\n\n  So Europeans are willing to do anything to subsidize Airbus and \ndistort the market so it can beat Boeing. But here in the United \nStates, our Government is sitting on the sidelines. We are\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\nfollowing a normal business model, and we are getting creamed by the \nEuropeans, who are following a social welfare model, where it doesn't \nmatter if they lose money if their products fail. As long as they are \nemploying Europeans and taking over America's market share, they don't \ncare. That is not competition; that is subsidized slaughter.\n  We have to wake up before it is too late for America's aerospace \ncompanies and workers. This is not a truly competitive market. Private \nU.S. companies, responsible to their shareholders, are confronting \nsubsidized companies funded by governments who don't care if they make \na profit as long as they create jobs. Understanding how the Europeans \napproach aerospace is the first step to helping American workers \nsurvive this onslaught. The next step is to understand how the \nEuropeans are putting their vision into action, and that is what I want \nto focus on next.\n  Tonight, I want to explore the unprecedented means that Airbus and \nthe Europeans are using to overtake American workers. Europe is taking \nover America's aerospace industry through aggressive, unfair market-\ndistorting measures. Specifically, European governments are supporting \nAirbus on the development side, as Airbus creates new aircraft, and on \nthe sales side, as Airbus pressures airlines and foreign governments to \nbuy their aircraft.\n  Let's start with the development side, where we find massive market-\ndistorting subsidies at every stage. Let's remember that Airbus was \ncreated by European governments in 1967 specifically to challenge \nBoeing and U.S. aerospace dominance in the manufacture of large civil \naircraft. EADS gets subsidies at nearly every stage of aircraft \ndevelopment. They benefit from launch subsidies, research subsidies, \nfacility subsidies, and supplier subsidies. These aggressive subsidies \ngive Airbus virtually unlimited backing to overtake the American \naerospace industry. It is like an American worker stepping into a \nboxing ring only to find out that, instead of one opponent, he is up \nagainst the full force and power of the entire European Union. It is \nnot a fair fight.\n\n  Europe's abuses have been well documented by our own Government. Here \nis what the U.S. Trade Representative said about Airbus subsidies in \nits 2003 report on trade barriers:\n\n       Since the inception of Airbus in 1967, the governments of \n     France, Germany, Spain, and the UK have provided direct \n     subsidies to their respective Airbus member companies to aid \n     the development, production, and marketing of Airbus civil \n     aircraft. Airbus member governments have borne a large \n     portion of development costs for all Airbus aircraft modes \n     and provided other forms of support, debt rollovers, and \n     marketing assistance, including political and economic \n     pressure on purchasing governments.\n\n  These subsidies create an uneven playing field and allow Airbus to do \nthings that normal private companies cannot afford to do. Airbus has \ngrown without assuming any of the financial risk and accountability \nthat U.S. firms have to contend with every day. Here is how a top \naviation analyst put it:\n\n       Airbus cares a lot less about returning value to \n     shareholders. Boeing is the classic American shareholder-\n     driven corporation.\n\n  Europe's approach is working, too. Today, EADS is the second largest \naerospace company in the world. In the last decade, Boeing has seen its \nmarket position globally erode significantly. At one time, Boeing sold \n75 percent of the aircraft purchased worldwide. Airbus was in the \nteens. Today, Airbus claims to supply more than 50 percent of the \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, I have made the case with statistics, data, trade \nreports, and official Government findings. Let me put it a little more \nsimply: Airbus has a sugar daddy named Europe, who will keep forking \nover money until Airbus has demolished America's aerospace industry and \nput hundreds of thousands of skilled American workers on the \nunemployment lines.\n  We cannot sit back and continue to let that happen. But it is not \njust the support and development side in the form of subsidies for \nlaunching facilities, research, and suppliers. Europe's market \ndistortions go much further on the sales side. Tonight I want to expose \nsome of the ways that European governments are supporting Airbus sales.\n  Airbus uses a series of incentives and threats to steal customers \naway from Boeing--everything from bribes and landing rights, to \ndiscounts, value guarantees, and trade threats and rewards. Airbus has \na history of graft and corruption. But don't take my word for it. Look \nat what the Economist magazine, on June 14, 2003, said in a special \nreport, entitled ``Airbus's Secret Past; Aircraft and Bribery\":\n\n       Up until 2000, Airbus and other French companies were \n     allowed to take a tax deduction for bribes.\n\n  Imagine that--bribing someone to buy your airplane and then you take \na tax deduction for the bribe you paid. The Economist article details \nAirbus sales campaigns in India, Syria, and Canada that involved \ncorruption and bribes. The article notes that, in 2001, the Under \nSecretary for Commerce for International Trade testified before \nCongress on U.S. competitiveness in aircraft manufacturing. The Under \nSecretary warned that bribery remains a threat to U.S. competitiveness. \nHe said:\n\n       This is an industry where foreign corruption has a real \n     impact. Bribery by foreign companies can have important \n     consequences for U.S. competitiveness because of the critical \n     role governments play in selecting aircraft suppliers; and \n     because of the huge sums of money involved in aircraft \n     purchases, this sector has been especially vulnerable to \n     trade distortions involving bribery of foreign public \n     officials.\n\n  His remarks were directed squarely at Airbus and the European nations \nthat aggressively back Airbus sales campaigns throughout the world.\n  This article also notes that, according to a 2001 European Parliament \nreport, the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted faxes and phone \ncalls between Airbus, Saudi Arabian Airlines, and Saudi Government \nofficials in early 1994. The NSA found that Airbus agents were offering \nbribes to a Saudi official to ensure that Airbus received a $6 billion \norder to modernize the Saudi Arabian airlines fleet. Bribes and \ncorruption have long been a part of their standard operating procedure \nfor getting other countries to buy their airplanes.\n  Those are just a few of the many techniques they have used to beat \nout American workers. Let me turn to another one. Airbus purchases have \nlong been linked to landing rights at Europe's busiest airports; a very \nattractive incentive to offer them to buy their airplanes, but it is a \nvery questionable practice.\n  I want to share four documented examples. In 2002, an airline named \neasyJet placed a big Airbus order and then received favorable landing \nspots at Orly Airport in France. In 2002, Malaysia Airlines received \nlanding rights at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris 3 days after \nbuying 6 Airbus A 380s. Emirates Airlines and Qatar Airways both \nreceived extra landing rights after buying Airbus airplanes.\n  A source close to Emirates Airlines said:\n\n       It seems that Airbus leans on Air France, which has the \n     slots at Paris Charles de Gaulle and the slots are given to \n     the airline that has bought airbus. . . .This has been known \n     for years. Airbus sells one of its planes to a customer and \n     promises to do its best to get slots for that airline.\n\n  But landing rights are not the only trick Airbus uses to sell their \nplanes. Airbus also aggressively discounts the purchase price of its \nplanes, often at the last minute, and often below the cost of \nproduction.\n  Airbus regularly makes a late final offer to an airline after Boeing \nhas made its best offer. Time and again, Boeing has lost a commercial \nsale because Airbus doesn't have the same commercial accountability. \nAirbus regularly sells aircraft below the price of production simply to \ngain market share and to take customers away from Boeing.\n  The 2000 easyJet deal I just mentioned a moment ago is a prime \nexample of Airbus's willingness to discount airplanes to win sales \ncampaigns.\n  Airbus does not reveal its discounts or the particulars of a given \norder. However, it was widely reported that Easy Jet got a 50-percent \ndiscount on its Airbus purchase. Boeing said the deal was below the \ncost of production. Airbus sold its planes below cost. Airbus got the \norder at Boeing's expense, and the Europeans got at least 10,000 direct \njobs. It is a great deal for Europe; it is a horrible deal for American \nworkers. It happened because of all the financial backing, subsidies, \nand special deals that Airbus gets from its European sponsors.\n\n[[Page S4926]]\n\n  Let me share another way that Airbus distorts the marketplace. Buying \nnew aircraft is a big expense for any airline. Airlines want to make \nsure the planes they buy will hold their value for years after their \npurchase. Normally, the market price decides the value of a used \nairplane, just like the marketplace decides the value of a used car. \nBut Airbus uses its deep pockets to override the marketplace. When \nAirbus sells a plane to an airline, it often promises the airline that \nthe plane will hold its value in the future, and if it does not, Airbus \nwill pay the difference to the airline.\n  For example, Airbus will tell an airline that the plane it buys will \nbe worth $60 million in 10 years. The market only pays $40 million. \nAirbus will pay the difference to the airline. It is a very attractive \nincentive for an airline, but it is also unfair because it allows one \ncompany to completely distort the marketplace. These Airbus guarantees \nallow the company to use their government subsidies to buy market \nshare.\n  If this happened in another field such as cars, this Congress would \nbe up in arms. Imagine going to a Toyota dealer and a salesman makes \nyou a guarantee that in 10 years your car will be worth a certain \namount of money far above its actual value. As a car buyer, you love \nthat dealer. Airlines like Airbus's guarantee. But if a foreign \ncarmaker did that, every representative from U.S. carmakers, suppliers, \nand dealers would be here in Congress demanding fairness.\n  The same abuse is taking place today in the aircraft market, but \nCongress is not responding. That is why I am exposing all of these \ntechniques.\n  Let me share two specific cases where Airbus used these value \nguarantees to distort the market and take sales away from American \nworkers.\n  In 2003, Boeing and Airbus competed to sell planes to Iberia Airlines \nof Spain. At the last minute, Airbus stepped in and undercut Boeing's \nprice. It then offered Iberia a residual value guarantee on the future \nvalue of the aircraft. Airbus got the deal. An official with Iberia \nAirlines said Airbus got the deal because of the ``extraordinary \nconditions'' it offered at the last minute. Once again, because of its \ngovernment support, Airbus was able to do things that a private for-\nprofit company could not.\n  Airbus used that same market-distorting approach with easyJet, a low-\ncost carrier that had a fleet of all Boeing aircraft. In 2002, easyJet \nagreed to buy 120 planes from Airbus and take options on an additional \n120 planes. Airbus offered a significant price discount and a residual-\nvalue guarantee to win that deal.\n  These are just a few examples of how Airbus, backed by European \ngovernments, is taking jobs away from American workers through market-\ndistorting tactics. But it is not just the bribes, corruption, the \nlanding slots, the discounts, and the value guarantees Airbus is using \nto undermine American aerospace. Airbus also steals sales by making \nthreats and rewards on unrelated trade issues.\n\n  Airbus and European government officials regularly link Airbus sales \nto other trade issues. There is constant cooperation between Airbus and \nEuropean leaders to pressure foreign airlines and governments to buy \nAirbus aircraft. Let me share a few documented examples that span the \nglobe.\n  First, Europe gives special rewards to countries for buying Airbus \nplanes. It happened with Russia 2 years ago. After the Russian airline \nAeroflot bought Airbus planes, Russian exporters were given greater \naccess in the European market, and Russia was given use of the EU space \nlaunchsite.\n  It happened in Thailand as well. Following a 2002 Thai Airlines \nAirbus purchase, Airbus lobbied the EU to lower trade barriers to Thai \nchicken and shrimp exports.\n  Time and again, Airbus links their plane purchases to other trade \ndeals. But Airbus is not content to just use trade rewards. It also \nthreatens to punish other countries unless they buy Airbus planes. Let \nme share a couple examples that first involves Pakistan.\n  In April 2003, Pakistan media reported that EU retaliated in textile \nnegotiations against Pakistan following the Boeing 777 purchase. Airbus \nis not competing on the merits of its product. Instead, it uses threats \nof retaliation to pressure countries into going along.\n  Another example of these threats and pressure tactics involves \nTaiwan. During an aggressive 2002 competition between Boeing and Airbus \nfor an important Taiwan sale, the Government of France threatened to \nterminate its satellite cooperation with Taiwan if Airbus was turned \naway.\n  Let me share a final example of these trade tactics, and it is one of \nwhich I have personal knowledge.\n  European governments have linked Airbus purchases to EU accession. I \nsaw this myself on a trip to Central Europe that I took in 1998 when I \nvisited Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. One Central European \nairline told me pointblank that they are under pressure from the \nEuropeans to buy Airbus because it would ultimately make EU accession \neasier.\n  This is just a sampling of the very aggressive competitor that my \nconstituents and our aerospace workers confront every day in the global \nmarket. I note that this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have been \nbriefed by some of our Government intelligence agencies, and the \nexamples I shared are just a very small part of what is happening. I \nencourage all of my colleagues to be briefed by the appropriate \nagencies because it will shock you, just as it shocked me. Arrange a \nbriefing and find out for yourself.\n  I now want to turn to my fourth point. Airbus and EADS are now \nengaged in a slick campaign to market themselves as an American company \nto policymakers and to the general public. They are running a campaign \nof misinformation and half-truths to secure more U.S. business for \nEuropean workers. Their campaign is particularly evident in Washington, \nDC, where Airbus is seeking to influence both the administration and \nthis Congress. They have their lobbyists working to unravel the Boeing \ntanker contract, and their PR shop is making false claims about \nAirbus's impact on our economy. Simply put, they are trying to get us \nto see them as an American company.\n  Airbus and EADS have hired a small army of lobbyists. At least 18 \nlobbyists at multiple lobbying firms are registered to represent Airbus \nand EADS in Washington, DC. Their lobbyists include the current \nchairman of the Republican National Committee, former Members of \nCongress, former staffers to a previous Senate majority leader, a \nprevious House minority leader, and others heavily involved in \ncongressional campaigns. Lobbyists with ties to the administration are \nalso at work for Airbus, including former officials at the White House, \nDefense Department, Commerce Department, Transportation Department, \nExport-Import Bank, OPIC, and NASA.\n  Airbus and EADS have also hired prominent Americans to help them gain \nentry into the U.S. markets and to put an American face on this \nEuropean operation.\n  Ralph Crosby is the CEO of EADS North America. Mr. Crosby was a \nlongtime senior executive with the Northrup Grumman Corporation. EADS \nsaid Crosby's hiring was ``to enhance the access of EADS to all \nelements of the U.S. defense and aerospace marketplace.''\n  T. A. McArtor is the chairman of Airbus North America. He previously \nserved as the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. \nDavid Oliver is the executive vice president and chief operating \nofficer of EADS North America. Oliver was previously the principal \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. \nWith this team of lobbyists and former U.S. Government officials in \nplace, Airbus and EADS now want policymakers and the public to believe \nthat Airbus is actually an American company.\n  Here is what Airbus and EADS say in Washington, DC, and all over the \ncountry in speeches, in paid advertisements, and in other official \nmaterials: They say Airbus has created and supports 120,000 jobs in our \ncountry. They say Airbus subcontracts with as many as 800 U.S. firms in \nthe United States, and they say Airbus now does $6 billion in business \nannually in the United States.\n  For more than a year, I have called on Airbus to justify and document \nthese assertions, and they have refused. Last year, I wrote to the \nCommerce Department and asked them to investigate these claims, and I \nwant to share the results.\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\n  On jobs, Airbus used to claim they created 100,000 U.S. jobs. The \nU.S. Commerce Department could not find any justification for that \nclaim. Commerce asked Airbus to document these claims. Airbus refused. \nNow Airbus is inflating its bogus figures, saying it is responsible for \n120,000 American jobs.\n  Do my colleagues know what figure the Commerce Department came up \nwith? Five hundred. Not 120,000, not 100,000, but 500 jobs is what the \nCommerce Department came up with.\n  The truth is, Airbus in large part is responsible for the economic \nshock, consolidation, and dislocation that has hurt American aerospace \nworkers over the last decade. Thousands of small businesses have gone \nout of business. Consolidation in the industry has brought enormous \nchange, and hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost throughout the \nindustry. Let us set the record straight. Airbus does not create \nAmerican jobs; it kills them.\n  Airbus also makes false claims about the number of U.S. suppliers it \nuses. Airbus says it contracts with 800 U.S. firms. The Commerce \nDepartment, after looking into this request, can only come up with 250 \nfirms, not 800. After that, Airbus did something kind of fishy. They \nrevised their supplier figure down from 800 firms to 300 firms, but \nthey increased the alleged value of its contracts from $5 billion up to \n$6 billion annually. We just cannot trust Airbus' funny numbers.\n  When it comes to suppliers, Airbus deserves no credit for using U.S. \nsuppliers, and that is because commercial aerospace--the airlines, not \nthe manufacturers--select many of the suppliers. Clearly Airbus does \nnot deserve credit for the choices that its customers make. So again, \nAirbus does not help American firms; it hurts them.\n  Finally, Airbus claims it does $6 billion in business in the United \nStates each year. They say that every chance they get, but here is \nsomething they do not say. EADS alone has a $6 billion trade surplus \nwith the United States. I am not talking about another country; I am \ntalking about one company running a $6 billion trade surplus with the \nUnited States.\n  Airbus and EADS are not helping America's aerospace industry. They \nare destroying it. Already, 700,000 American workers have lost their \njobs while Europe keeps adding new workers to the Airbus payroll. It is \ntime for the Senate, for our Government, and for the American people to \ntake a real close look at Airbus' real impact on the United States.\n\n  The truth is that Airbus is a horrible investment for our country. \nAccording to EADS' documents, North America provides EADS with 35 \npercent of its revenues, about 10 billion euros, but North American \nworkers only make up 2 percent of the company's jobs--just 2,400 jobs \nout of 107,000 worldwide. We give them a third of their business. What \ndo we get in return? Two percent of their jobs. That is a bad deal.\n  The truth is, Airbus and EADS are exporting U.S. jobs, suppliers, and \ndollars to Europe as fast as they can. It is clear to me that Airbus is \nmaking phony claims about its impact on the U.S. economy, hiring \nlobbyists and mounting a PR campaign so it can position itself to steal \nthe tanker contract from American workers.\n  I will turn to that tanker contract and some disturbing developments. \nAs all of my colleagues know, I have been involved in the tanker \ncontract from the very beginning. I have been proud to work with many \nother Senators on it. There is no question our Air Force needs new air \nrefueling tankers. There is also no question that Airbus is trying to \nreopen a competition it lost 2 years ago.\n  I want to make sure American policymakers understand how Europe is \nhurting American aerospace workers and what Airbus has been doing \nbehind the scenes to undermine the Boeing tanker contract. If we allow \nAirbus to steal the tanker contract through its phony claims, we will \nbe helping Europe dismantle our domestic aerospace industry and asking \nU.S. taxpayers to foot that bill.\n  No one doubts the need for new tankers. Airborne refueling tankers \nallow our country to project military force around the globe. Most of \nour tankers are more than 40 years old. One-third of the fleet is unfit \nto fly at any given time due to mechanical failure. Each plane requires \na full year of maintenance for every 4 years spent on duty.\n  There is no question they must be replaced with new tankers. The only \nquestion is, who is going to build these tankers--American workers or \nFrench workers? If we give this contract to the French, we will be \nrewarding Europe's trade-distorting behavior, putting Americans out of \nwork, and helping Europe dismantle our aerospace industry.\n  Congress and the administration have wrestled with a variety of \nissues having to do with the tanker replacement program adopted by \nCongress and signed into law by the President 2 years ago. We are still \ntrying to sort through all of the issues. It has been a unique and, \nfrankly, at times a very frustrating process.\n  We are all aware of the impropriety of a few Boeing employees \nsurrounding this deal. There is no excuse for their behavior. I will \nnot defend it. I will not excuse it. They are being investigated and I \nexpect they will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. \nBut the actions of a few do not lessen the merits of a tanker deal. The \nAir Force needs this equipment, and Boeing is the best company to \nprovide it.\n  Let us remember that the Air Force looked at a proposal from Airbus \nin 2002 and rejected it on the merits. In fact, the Air Force gave very \ndetailed reasons why the Airbus proposal was inferior. Let me quote \nfrom the Air Force statement on March 28, 2002:\n\n       The EADS offering presents a higher risk technical approach \n     and a less preferred financial arrangement. First, EADS lacks \n     relevant tanker experience and needs to develop an air \n     refueling boom and operator station, making their approach a \n     significantly higher risk.\n       Second, a comparison of the net present values of the \n     aircraft recommended by Boeing and EADS establishes Boeing as \n     the preferred financial option.\n       Third, the size difference of the EADS' proposed KC-330 \n     results in an 81 percent larger ground footprint compared to \n     the KC-135E it would replace, whereas the Boeing 767 is only \n     29 percent larger.\n       The KC-330 increase in size does not bring with it a \n     commensurate increase in available air refueling offload.\n       Finally, the EADS aircraft would demand a greater \n     infrastructure investment and dramatically limits the \n     aircraft's ability to operate effectively in the worldwide \n     deployment.\n\n  Those are the detailed technical reasons why Airbus lost the tanker \ncontract. The Air Force essentially said that EADS and Airbus did not \nhave a real tanker or tanker technology; their proposed aircraft was so \nlarge it required a larger footprint on the ground and a significant \ninfrastructure investment.\n  Their proposal was ``significantly higher risk,'' for the Air Force, \nand, their proposed aircraft couldn't operate worldwide--limiting our \nability to project force.\n  Finally, the Air Force said that Boeing was the ``preferred financial \noption,'' meaning the Boeing proposal was the cheaper alternative for \ntaxpayers.\n  So in March 2002, Airbus lost. For most people, it would be over, but \nnot for a company like Airbus. Airbus continued its campaign to delay \nand if possible, kill the KC-767 tanker deal. Airbus lobbyists have \ncontinued to work on and off of Capitol Hill with tanker opponents.\n  Airbus lobbyists worked to convince Members of Congress that Airbus \nshould be recognized as an American Company. Airbus even used the \nUnited States Chamber of Commerce to sponsor trips to Paris and \nToulouse, France for Congressional staffers.\n  Airbus tried to derail the lease of four 737 aircraft to the Air \nForce for executive transport at the General Accounting Office. Airbus \ndidn't care about the four 737's. They were testing the system to see \nif they could use a bid protest at the GAO to block the tanker lease. \nThe GAO dismissed the Airbus bid protest.\n  As the tanker deal was scrutinized, criticized and delayed, Airbus \nwas regularly available to offer its tanker again to U.S. taxpayers and \nthe Air Force. During the delay, Airbus spent $90 million to develop a \nreal tanker. Now they are working as hard as they can to reopen the \ncompetition they lost.\n  For Airbus, the tanker competition is not over. We see that in Airbus \nmaterials--that are riddled with references to the tanker program. \nAgain and again, EADS and Airbus say they are prepared to bid for the \ntankers.\n\n[[Page S4928]]\n\nEADS even went to Wall Street earlier this year to pitch the company to \nU.S. financial interests.\n  As part of their pitch to U.S. investors, EADS says they still may \ncompete for tankers in the U.S.\n  Would they dare to say these things if they weren't hard at work to \ngive EADS another opportunity at tankers funded by U.S. taxpayers?\n  This week, EADS Joint Chief Executive Rainer Hertrich was quoted by \nReuters saying:\n\n       I see a realistic chance that the issue will be taken up \n     again by the administration after the election.\n\n  Mr. President, over the past few months, I have been very concerned \nabout what Airbus has been doing. In late March, I sent a letter to \nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld detailing my concerns with \nAirbus's campaign of distortion and misinformation to kill the tanker \nprogram.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Secretary Rumsfeld printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   U.S. Senate\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 2004.\n     Hon. Donald Rumsfeld,\n     Secretary, Department of Defense,\n     The Pentagon, Washington, DC\n       Dear Secretary Rumsfeld: I am deeply concerned about recent \n     comments by Secretary James Roche regarding re-opening \n     competition to supply aerial refueling tankers to the U.S. \n     Air Force.\n       The Air Force has already conducted a careful and open \n     competition to build the required tankers. As Secretary Roche \n     outlined in his testimony to the Senate Commerce Committee in \n     September, Boeing won that competition based on the \n     superiority of its design, technology, delivery schedule, and \n     overall risk reduction plan. Although Airbus demanded that \n     the General Accounting Office review that decision, the \n     review was dismissed almost immediately as lacking merit. \n     Rather than honorably accept the competition's outcome, \n     Airbus has resorted to a campaign of distortion and half-\n     truths in an effort to kill the proposed Air Force tanker \n     lease program.\n       I have fully supported thorough reviews of all aspects of \n     this program, and will continue to support constructive \n     modifications based on recommendations from those reviews. \n     However, I will not tolerate Airbus's attempts to undermine \n     the program itself by forcing the government to revisit \n     careful determinations about specific issues that have \n     already been made, reviewed, re-reviewed, and validated by \n     responsible government entities. The outcome of the initial \n     tanker competition is one such issue that has been clearly \n     and conclusively settled.\n       Airbus's corporate behavior on this matter cannot be \n     tolerated by the U.S. government. Its actions are further \n     delaying our ability to meet a key military requirement, and \n     if successful, will result in the outsourcing of thousands of \n     American manufacturing jobs to a foreign corporation that is \n     unfairly subsidized by European governments and that unfairly \n     competes with the only U.S. aircraft manufacturer. Such an \n     outcome represents ill-conceived public policy, and will also \n     unfairly punish the nearly 30,000 workers who will be \n     employed should the Air Force tanker lease program proceed \n     with a domestic manufacturer, as currently planned.\n       As you know, the average age of our existing tanker fleet \n     is 42 years and one-third of our tanker fleet is unfit to fly \n     at any given time due to mechanical and operational failure. \n     KC-135's spend 400 days in major depot maintenance for every \n     five years of service. Any unnecessary delay in replacing our \n     aging tanker fleet puts in jeopardy our ability to meet \n     critical air refueling and power projection requirements.\n       The Air Force's proposed tanker lease program is one of the \n     most closely scrutinized programs ever undertaken by the \n     Department of Defense. I support the DOD Inspector General's \n     current efforts to provide an independent assessment of \n     various aspects of this program. However, barring evidence of \n     wrongdoing, it is critical that we proceed without delay to \n     implement the Air Force tanker lease program and begin \n     production of those aircraft here in the United States.\n       I know how committed you are to replacing our aging tanker \n     fleet, and I know that meeting the demands of the critics of \n     this plan has taken a toll. But you and I both know that many \n     of these critics will not be satisfied until they stop this \n     contract with the only American airplane manufacturer capable \n     of producing a new generation tanker. We cannot allow that to \n     happen.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Patty Murray,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me read one passage from my letter. I wrote:\n\n       Airbus' corporate behavior on this matter cannot be \n     tolerated by the U.S. government.\n       Its actions are further delaying our ability to meet a key \n     military requirement, and if successful, will result in the \n     outsourcing of thousands of American manufacturing jobs to a \n     foreign corporation that is unfairly subsidized by European \n     governments and that unfairly competes with the only U.S. \n     aircraft manufacturer.\n       Such an outcome represents ill-conceived public policy, and \n     will also unfairly punish the nearly 30,000 workers who will \n     be employed should the Air Force tanker lease program proceed \n     with a domestic manufacturer, as currently planned.\n\n  I have not received a reply from Secretary Rumsfeld, but I did \nreceive a shocking reply from someone else. Two days after writing to \nSecretary Rumsfeld, I received a letter from Mr. Ralph Crosby, the \nChairman and CEO of EADS North America.\n  So I sent a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld, and I got a reply from the \nhead of Airbus. There's something very fishy about that. It got even \nmore outrageous as I read Mr. Crosby's letter. Mr. Crosby stated that \nEADS is committed to being a ``strong U.S. citizen,'' and he repeated \nthe same statistics that EADS refuses to verify to either me or to the \nDepartment of Commerce. I want to refute a few claims in Mr. Crosby's \nunsolicited letter.\n  First, Mr. Crosby had the gall to suggest that EADS is a ``strong \nU.S. citizen.'' Their history tells a much different story. Airbus and \nEADS have been willing suppliers to nations that the United States \nconsiders either rogue states or state sponsors of terrorism.\n  According to one news article dating back to 2001:\n\n       The Airbus Industrie Consortium views those countries \n     against which US or UN sanctions are in place--Libya, Iran, \n     Iraq and North Korea--as potentially representing major \n     opportunities, Noel Forgeard, CEO, indicated yesterday.\n\n  The same article quotes an Airbus Vice President as saying:\n\n       We might have been looking to place a total of 180 \n     aircraft--100 with Iran, 50 with Iraq and 30 with Libya--with \n     at least 140-150 orders feeding through.\n\n  It was widely reported that Airbus was in close contact with Iraqi \nairways during the period of UN sanctions following the 1991 Persian \nGulf War. Apparently, Airbus was in discussion with the state run--\nSaddam Hussein run--Iraqi airways to sell 20 Airbus aircraft. It was \nalso widely reported that personnel from Iraqi Airways were taken to \nJordan and Malaysia for three month training courses on Airbus \nequipment. Airbus still carries a five-plane deal with Saddam Hussein \non its order books and has said the deal is still valid. While American \ntroops are rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and trying to build a \npeaceful, democratic future for the Iraqi people, Airbus wants the new \nIraqi government to honor Saddam Hussein's plane deal.\n  To me, for so many reasons, EADS is not a ``strong U.S. citizen.''\n  Here is another claim from Mr. Crosby's letter that I must refute. He \nwrote:\n\n       Should decisions by the U.S. government open a competitive \n     procurement of aerial refueling tankers, EADS North America \n     will respond.\n       We will offer a superior, cost-effective aerial refueling \n     solution that will be completed by American workers, on \n     American soil, in the United States providing the Department \n     of Defense and the Air Force the opportunity to select the \n     product that provides the best capabilities to the U.S. armed \n     forces.\n\n  Let's remember that the Air Force already rejected Airbus's tanker \nproposal for the reasons I mentioned. The Air Force said Boeing was the \ncheaper option, and it deemed the A330 a ``significantly higher risk.'' \nBut in Mr. Crosby's world, these failures somehow translate into what \nhe calls a ``superior, cost-effective aerial refueling solution.''\n  There is another disturbing claim hidden in Mr. Crosby's statement \nthat should set off alarm bells. He said that Airbus tankers would be \n``completed'' in the U.S.\n  Mr. Crosby says the A330 refueling tanker for the Air Force would be \ncompleted by American workers on American soil. Translated that means \ntankers will be built in Europe by European workers at U.S. taxpayer \nexpense and then American workers can install the final components. \nOnce again, EADS and Airbus are trying to use their market-distorting \ntactics to shift aerospace jobs to Europe to the detriment of American \nworkers.\n  I have a simple reply to the Airbus's campaign to build tankers in \nEurope paid for by U.S. taxpayers.\n  No thank you. No thanks. Never.\n  I wrote back to Mr. Crosby, and I ask unanimous consent that my \nletter to him be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2004.\n     Ralph D. Crosby, Jr.,\n     EADS North America,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Crosby: Thank you for your letter of March 24, \n     2004. I appreciate your attempt to clarify your position. \n     Unfortunately, the vague and ambiguous language in your \n     letter has served to underscore my earlier concerns about \n     Airbus's efforts to undermine the Air Force Tanker \n     Modernization program. Additionally, I continue to seriously \n     question Airbus's unsubstantiated claims regarding its \n     employment and economic impact in the United States.\n       Your letter outlines, as you have stated publicly on \n     several occasions, Airbus's desire to compete for the Air \n     Force Tanker Modernization program. Your continued insistence \n     on Airbus's qualifications to compete in such a contest seems \n     to belie the fact that the tanker competition already took \n     place in 2002--a competition that Boeing won and Airbus lost \n     based on each company's proposed design, technology, delivery \n     schedule, and overall risk reduction plan.\n       As you know, the Air Force informed EADS on April 2, 2002 \n     that its platform was deemed high-risk for the Air Force's \n     operational requirements for the refueling tankers. I remain \n     puzzled by Airbus's continued effort to re-open the tanker \n     competition two years after its final conclusion.\n       To my knowledge, the Airbus 2002 proposal has never been \n     made public. Providing the public with a clear picture of \n     Airbus's capabilities at the time of the competition would \n     help to address concerns refuting the competitions outcome.\n       I continue to believe that Airbus has engaged in a campaign \n     of distortion and half-truths to discredit the Air Force, \n     Boeing and the KC-767 lease program. Your letter did not \n     dispel my concern that Airbus is engaged in a campaign to \n     undermine the tanker lease program. I would welcome a full \n     accounting of Airbus's continued involvement with the tanker \n     lease program on par with the various information subpoenaed \n     from both the Defense Department and Boeing. A full \n     accounting of Airbus's lobbying activities including support \n     given to tanker opponents would provide the public with a \n     full sense of this debate.\n       As enlightening as the examination of the facts may be, I \n     do not think Airbus is willing to be as transparent in \n     detailing its communications with the Congress, the \n     Administration, and others outside of government as the \n     Boeing Company has been. From my vantage point, Airbus's \n     involvement in the campaign to discredit Boeing and the \n     tanker program could not be clearer.\n        I am also troubled by your continued assertions regarding \n     Airbus's economic and employment presence in the U.S. Your \n     letter states that Airbus ``supports'' a certain number of \n     U.S. jobs, and that an Airbus tanker would be ``completed'' \n     by U.S. workers. In my view, an Airbus tanker ``completed'' \n     by U.S. workers is a tanker manufactured in Europe with the \n     overwhelming number of jobs also created in Europe.\n        I would appreciate any solid, verifiable, and straight-\n     forward information detailing the number of U.S. workers and \n     vendors that Airbus directly employs, as well as specific \n     direct employment and U.S. content relating to manufacturing \n     a national Airbus tanker aircraft.\n        As you know, I earlier challenged Airbus' many rhetorical \n     claims about jobs, suppliers and economic contributions in \n     this country. The Department of Commerce confirmed my \n     suspicions and almost entirely discredited Airbus' claims. To \n     date, despite vows to do so, Airbus has not provided the \n     Department of Commerce any additional credible information on \n     its contributions to U.S. workers and the U.S. economy. The \n     truth is Airbus continues to market itself to the Congress \n     and the American people with assertions that appear to be \n     untrue and dishonest. You are aware of my concerns, as well \n     as those raised by the Department of Commerce, and I \n     encourage you to provide justification for Airbus' direct \n     claims on jobs, suppliers and economic contribution.\n       Finally, to set the record straight, Airbus did file a bid \n     protest challenge regarding the leasing provisions contained \n     in the FY'03 DoD Appropriations Act (PL 107-248). The Air \n     Force executed the lease of four commercial Boeing 737 \n     special mission aircraft long before the Air Force attempted \n     to proceed with the KC-767 program. The Airbus bid protest \n     was specific to the four 737 aircraft but I must conclude \n     that the real Airbus target was the lease program itself and \n     ultimately the Air Force's ability to move forward with a 100 \n     plane KC-767 lease with the Boeing company. The Airbus bid \n     protest was dismissed by the General Accounting Office.\n        Again, thank you for your response to my letter. I look \n     forward to hearing from you.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                     Patty Murray,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I asked Mr. Crosby to again justify the claims regarding \nthe EADS and Airbus contributions to this country on jobs, suppliers \nand economic contributions. For more than a year, his company has \nrefused to answer my questions and the requests from the Department of \nCommerce. I asked Mr. Crosby to make public the EADS 2002 tanker \nproposal submitted to the Air Force.\n  We know the Air Force said the proposal was high risk, more expensive \nthan Boeing, and could limit U.S. force projection worldwide. For 2 \nyears, EADS and Airbus have been able to access Boeing proprietary \ninformation about its technology and pricing, that came available \nduring the tanker program review.\n  Now, after spending $90 million to develop a tanker it previously did \nnot have, Airbus wants to reopen the tanker contract after it has \nalready seen all of Boeing's cards. Airbus has learned an awful lot \nabout Boeing and tankers and it has used that new technology to best \nBoeing in a recent tanker competition for Australia. Mr. Crosby will \nnot talk about his 2002 proposal. He wants to compete with Boeing based \non everything Airbus has learned about Boeing over 2 years and an \nadditional $90 million investment in tankers.\n  Finally, I asked Mr. Crosby to provide a full accounting of Airbus' \ninvolvement with the tanker lease program on par with the various \ninformation subpoenaed from both the Department of Defense and Boeing.\n  I also asked Mr. Crosby to provide a full accounting of Airbus' \nlobbying activities, including support given to tanker opponents. I \nawait a reply from Mr. Crosby.\n  Let me say that given the tremendous damage Airbus has done to the \ncommercial aerospace industry in this country, and particularly in \nWashington State, I have real questions about the appropriateness of \nU.S. taxpayer dollars going to strengthen Europe's competitive position \nand hurting American aerospace workers.\n  I have talked in great detail tonight about why EADS and Airbus are \nthreats to the U.S. aerospace leadership and to American workers. \nEurope has a plan to take over global leadership in aerospace. Europe \nviews aerospace as a social program, a jobs program for the benefit of \nEuropeans. Airbus and EADS are the prime example of Europe's vision for \nits citizen and its aerospace industry.\n  There are real consequences for U.S. national security in what \nhappens here. We have to retain our supplier base, our skilled \nworkforce, and our technological advantages to project force and to \ndefend our Nation.\n  We have a decision to make in Washington, DC. U.S. policymakers on \nbehalf of the American people have to decide whether we want to sit \nidly by as Europe hopes we continue to do or whether we want to commit \nourselves to a future in global aerospace.\n  I conclude by talking briefly about a few things we must do to keep \nAmerican workers at the forefront of commercial aerospace. Let me offer \nthree specific suggestions.\n  First of all, we should hold Europe accountable for its market-\ndistorting actions. We have to look seriously at a trade case to \nchallenge Europe's failure to adhere to its treaty obligations. We have \nto recognize the future of aerospace is larger than a trade case or a \nBoeing dispute with Airbus. Only a determined Federal commitment to \naerospace will assure our children and our grandchildren opportunity to \ncompete for the high-skill, high-wage aerospace jobs of the future.\n  Second, we should not reward EADS and Airbus for their market-\ndistorting, job-killing behavior. Airbus wants U.S. policymakers and \nthe public to buy its campaign that it is a good U.S. citizen. That is \nbaloney. They are trying to mask the real harm they are posing to \nAmerican workers.\n  Europe wants to further weaken U.S. aerospace competitors by \naccessing U.S. taxpayer-funded defense programs. And, most offensively, \nAirbus is working to undermine both the Air Force and the Boeing \nCompany to kill the tanker program so it may ultimately outsource \ntanker manufacturing to Europe.\n\n  It is long past time to shine a very bright light on Airbus and its \nlobbying efforts in Washington, DC. If we reward their underhanded \nmethods, if we let them steal the tanker contract away from our \nAmerican workers, the American taxpayers will be paying Europe to help \nfinish off our aerospace industry.\n  I don't see how we can let a subsidized foreign company use our tax \ndollars to put Americans out of work.\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\nBut if they get away with their lobbying, their bogus claims, and their \nPR campaign, we will have bought Airbus a sledgehammer to whack away at \nour aerospace industry. That is outrageous. We cannot let it happen. We \nneed to hold Europe accountable for what it has done and we need to \nmake sure Airbus is not rewarded for its bad actions.\n  Finally, we should act boldly to embrace many of the recommendations \nfrom the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace \nIndustry.\n  The administration is acting on a number of fronts. Congress must do \nmore, as well. As a first step, Congress should create a Joint \nCommittee on Aerospace. I intend to introduce legislation to create \nthat joint committee. It will help Congress recognize our future is \nvery much tied to aerospace and commercial aerospace, in particular. A \ndedicated group of House and Senate Members with a targeted agenda can \nhelp the administration and the country recommit itself to the next \ncentury of global aerospace leadership.\n  I have sounded the alarm. No Member of Congress can claim they did \nnot know what European governments and Airbus are doing to American \nworkers. This is a critical industry. They are jobs worth fighting for.\n  I am not willing to surrender our leadership in the second century of \nflight. There is a battle for the future of the aerospace industry. \nEurope is putting its full support, subsidies, and power behind Airbus, \nand it is working. We have to get off the sidelines.\n  I am committed to working in the Senate to make sure American workers \nhave a fighting chance to lead the world in aerospace. I know if we \nfocus on the challenge before us, our country will recover from this, \njust as Seattle recovered from the downturn in the 1970s. We have a \nbright future ahead if we take the steps I have outlined and hold on to \nour leadership in commercial aerospace.\n  Aviation was born in America 100 years ago. Let's make sure Americans \nare leading it 100 years from now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/05/senate-section/article/S4930-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.
