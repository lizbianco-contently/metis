Mr. President, this morning there will be a period of \nmorning business until 11 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate \nwill then resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2207, the \nPregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act of 2004.\n  I remind my colleagues, on Friday of this past week I asked for \nconsent to proceed to S. 2207 to allow us to begin debate on this \nimportant medical liability issue, an issue which addresses a crisis \nwhich affects us all. There was an objection from the other side and it \nwas necessary to file a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to the \npregnancy and trauma care bill. Under the order, that vote will occur \nat 2:15 tomorrow afternoon. Members will debate that motion and the \nmerits of this underlying medical liability legislation throughout the \nday today. I do hope we are able to invoke cloture Wednesday afternoon \nso we may proceed to this very important measure.\n  I also remind Senators yesterday it became necessary for me to file a \nsecond cloture motion with respect to the JOBS bill, the bill known as \nthe FSC/ETI, or the Jumpstart JOBS bill. Consideration of this timely \nmeasure--timely because sanctions right now are in effect and the \nsanctions are affecting U.S. companies every day--consideration of this \ntimely measure has been slowed because of unrelated amendments, \namendments that have nothing to do with these manufacturing jobs and \ntrade issues.\n  I have had a number of discussions with the two managers of the bill \nin an effort to finish the bill in a reasonable amount of time with a \nreasonable number of amendments, but we have been unable to reach an \nagreement today. Due to the desire to offer these unrelated amendments \nnot relevant to the bill, and with no end to the number of amendments \nin sight, it became necessary for this second cloture vote.\n  I now ask consent that the vote on cloture on the motion to recommit \noccur tomorrow afternoon following the 2:15 vote, regardless of the \nprovisions of rule XXII.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S3736]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Yesterday, I also mentioned the need to act on the pension \nequity conference report. We would like to lock in agreement for a \nshort period of debate and a vote on the conference report prior to the \nend of this week. An important piece of legislation, the pension bill \nhad gone to conference; it has come out of conference; it is ready for \nfloor action. I know there are objections to this on the Democratic \nside at this time. However, I hope we will be able to reach a time \nagreement this week on this timely conference report as well.\n  Mr. President, as we look at the medical malpractice and medical \nliability bill, as we look at FSC/ETI or the JOBS bill, as we look at \nthe pension equity conference report, we have a lot to do over the next \n4 days. We have a short amount of time to do it. It is important we \nstay focused on these important bills for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3736-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on the 5th of April, the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, appearing before the Brookings \nInstitute, delivered what Larry King described as a blistering attack \non the Bush administration. Last night, Larry King and Senator Kennedy \nhad a conversation about the speech and Senator Kennedy's comments that \nis worthy of comment and reaction in the Senate.\n  First, let me make this observation. Senator Kennedy earlier in this \ncampaign made personal attacks on the President which I felt compelled \nto respond to in the Senate.\n  I am happy to report in his conversations with Larry King, Senator \nKennedy backed away from that degree of personal attack on the \nPresident, and I salute him for that. I think it important for us to \nrecognize how much we can get carried away with election-year rhetoric \nand how personal we can get in our attacks sometimes. I salute Senator \nKennedy, in spite of the vigorousness of his attack on the \nadministration, for his decision to back away from personal attacks on \nthe President. I would hope other members of his party would follow his \nlead.\n  We have seen the former Vice President of the United States attack \nthe President of the United States in language reminiscent of that \nwhich Joe McCarthy used to use to attack Harry Truman. We should back \naway from that kind of personal hatred, even though historically it has \nbeen part of our election tradition.\n  There has probably not been a President more personally hated than \nFranklin Roosevelt in my lifetime. I remember the things that were said \nabout him. I remember the things that were said about Harry Truman. I \nremember some of the things that were said about Richard Nixon, about \nBill Clinton. We should back away from those kinds of personal attacks. \nUnfortunately, this election year has seen them come back to the point \nwhere one could almost say the basis of the campaign against the \nPresident is, in fact, personal hatred.\n  Former Governor Dean certainly went into that direction in his \nattacks against the President. We have seen Senator Kerry, in an \nunguarded moment, refer to his opponents as a bunch of lying crooks. I \nwould hope we could back down from hatred as the primary theme of this \ncampaign.\n  But there is another theme in this campaign which did come out in \nSenator Kennedy's speech I would like to respond to and comment on. It \nis the theme of fear. There is an underlying sense of fear that \npervades the rhetoric of the President's opponents here. It is \ninteresting to me, because the founder of the modern Democratic Party, \nFranklin D. Roosevelt, is perhaps best remembered for his statement in \nhis first inaugural when he said: We have nothing to fear but fear \nitself.\n  It would seem in this campaign there are those who have nothing to \noffer but fear itself--fear and its handmaiden, indeed, its standard \nderivative, which is pessimism. We have great fear, and we are \nconvinced nothing is going to work. That, if I may, Mr. President, is \nwhat pervaded Senator Kennedy's speech before the Brookings Institute, \na conviction that nothing is going to work, that nothing is going to \nsave this country except the personal replacement of the President. But \nnone of the policies the President has put in place can possibly work, \nand we are in such a terrible morass and difficulty that we live in \nfear.\n  I was tempted to go through Senator Kennedy's speech point by point \nand rebut it one at a time. I believe I could do that. It would take a \ngreat deal of time, and it would probably bore everybody. It is the \nkind of thing lawyers do in courtrooms where it is essential to build a \nrecord. But, as you know, Mr. President, I am unburdened with a legal \neducation. I would like to step back from the point-by-point kind of \nrefutation that would be called for in a courtroom and have an overall \nview of what Senator Kennedy was saying. I refer to him personally, but \nI think this speech, in fact, is a distillation of the position \nthe Democratic Party will take in the upcoming election. So I think we \nshould step back from the point-by-point situation and look at the \noverall message of what they are trying to tell us. That is what I \nwould like to address today.\n\n  Basically, as I say, it is rooted in fear and its derivative, \npessimism. That is what they are offering the American people: fear and \npessimism. This is the fundamental position Senator Kennedy's speech \ntakes: If it is bad, and it happened on President Bush's watch, he is \nresponsible for it. If it is good, and it happened on President Bush's \nwatch, it was coincidence or anybody could have done it, and he does \nnot deserve any of the credit.\n  Let's go down the history of what has happened on President Bush's \nwatch and see if, in fact, that pattern I have just described did play \nitself out.\n  Turn to today's headline where we have a Commission examining what \nhappened prior to 9/11 in the year 2001. Well, we are being told \nrepeatedly it was Bush's fault. He is responsible for 9/11 because he \ndid not do enough to prevent it. 9/11 was his fault. Then the \nCommission goes on to detail what he did. Basically what he did was \nwhat the Clinton administration did. They kept track of al-Qaida. They \nmonitored what was happening. They did their best to find out what was \nhappening, but they did not do enough. In other words, they did not \ninvade Afghanistan.\n  It is interesting to me that the people who are now saying President \nBush did not do enough prior to 9/11 are the same people who are saying \nhe did too much in Iraq. He acted before Iraq became a threat. That is \nin Senator Kennedy's speech--he should have waited until Iraq became a \nthreat. But, of course, the same critics are saying he should have \nacted before al-Qaida became a threat. You cannot have it both ways. \nEither he was prudent in doing what the Clinton administration did \nprior to 9/11, and watched the situation carefully to see how it would \nplay out, or he was too timid. And if he was too timid and should have \ntaken more forceful action prior to 9/11, he learned that lesson and \ntook more forceful action with respect to Iraq. You cannot attack him \nfor doing the one in the one situation and then the other in the other; \nyou must be consistent. But the President's critics are not.\n  As I say, he is responsible for 9/11, according to his critics, \nbecause he did basically what the Clinton administration did, but he \nshould have seen it coming and done more. Then when he did do more--\nthat is, when the President led us into Afghanistan--the President's \ncritics were outraged. What did we hear over and over again? Maybe the \nmedia has short memories, but I do not. We heard lessons from history: \nThe British went into Afghanistan, they got bogged down, and they\n\n[[Page S3737]]\n\ncould not accomplish anything. The Soviets went into Afghanistan; they \ngot bogged down and ultimately humiliated. We are going to get bogged \ndown, and we are going to get humiliated. And going into Afghanistan is \na terrible mistake.\n  Then suddenly the battlefield situation changed, and now we hear the \nPresident's actions in Afghanistan were brilliantly planned and \nbrilliantly executed. We see Afghanistan on the verge of a new \nconstitution. We see women back in the Afghanistan economy, women going \nto school, women now being allowed rights they did not have under the \nTaliban. But we do not give President Bush any credit for that. No. As \nI say, the mantra is: If it is bad, and it happened on Bush's watch, he \nis responsible. But if something good comes out of what happened on \nPresident Bush's watch, that was coincidence, and he has no right to \nclaim any credit for it.\n  I am interested in a comment Senator Kennedy did make in his speech, \nand I will go to the speech for this one. He said, referring to our \ndecision to go to war in Iraq:\n\n      . . . President Bush gave al Qaeda two years--two whole \n     years--to regroup and recover in the border regions of \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  I find that an incredible statement--incredible in the true meaning \nof that word: incredible, not credible, not to be accepted.\n  Afghanistan, prior to the time we went in--Afghanistan, during the \nperiod of the Clinton administration--was a haven for al-Qaida. It was \na training ground for al-Qaida. President Clinton ordered the lobbing \nof cruise missiles into some of those training grounds but did nothing \nmore.\n  Now, in response to 9/11, President Bush led the world into cleaning \nout the al-Qaida training camps in Afghanistan. The al-Qaida leadership \nhas been disrupted. A large percentage of their leadership has been \neither killed or arrested. Assets, totaling in the tens if not hundreds \nof millions of dollars, of al-Qaida have been discovered and frozen, \nand yet the Senator says: ``President Bush gave al Qaeda two years . . \n. to regroup and recover in the border regions of Afghanistan.''\n  Al-Qaida has been on the run. Al-Qaida has been disrupted. Al-Qaida \nhas seen its assets destroyed in the 2 years we have been at war with \nal-Qaida and Afghanistan has been freed. Those are solid \naccomplishments for which the President's enemies give him no credit \nwhatsoever.\n  Let's talk about Iraq. That is the core of most of the criticism of \nthe President. There are those who suggest Iraq was created by George \nW. Bush; that is, the crisis was created by George W. Bush. There are \nthose who suggest--and Senator Kennedy comes very close to it--that \nGeorge W. Bush was the first one to indicate there might have been \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Again, the media may not have any \nmemory on these issues, but I have a clear memory. Sitting in this \nbody, I remember who it was who first convinced me al-Qaida had weapons \nof mass destruction. That was Madeleine Albright, President Clinton's \nSecretary of State.\n  We all went to 407, the room in the Capitol where we receive \nbriefings on confidential and top secret information, classified \ninformation. Madeleine Albright laid out in chilling fashion all of the \nevidence to tell us there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. In \nresponse to that evidence, President Clinton went to war against Iraq. \nWe forget that. We pretend that never happened. President Clinton, \nusing his powers as Commander in Chief and acting under the authority \nof the U.N. resolutions that had condemned Iraq following the first \ngulf war, launched a heavy bombing attack upon Iraq for the sole \npurpose of destroying their weapons of mass destruction. And to his \ncredit, during the current political debate, President Clinton has made \nit clear we did not know whether or not that bombing attack destroyed \nall of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. President Clinton has made \nit clear we had no way of knowing how successful that bombing attack \nwas.\n  Yes, the difference between President Bush and President Clinton is \nPresident Clinton bombed. He carried on the war from the air. President \nBush decided to carry on the war at ground level. I do not suggest that \nis a trivial difference. It is a very significant difference. But if we \nare going to talk about who went to war in Iraq over the issue of \nweapons of mass destruction, we have to say the answer is President \nClinton. If we are going to talk about Secretaries of State who \ninformed the Congress about Iraq's program of weapons of mass \ndestruction, we have to say the first one who did it was Madeleine \nAlbright.\n  I am one who believed Madeleine Albright. I am one who believed and \nsupported President Clinton. I find it a little disheartening to have \nthose who agreed with us then now suggesting it was President Bush who \nfirst brought up the issue of weapons of mass destruction, and it was \nPresident Bush who first said we had to deal with those weapons by acts \nof war. Memories should be longer than that.\n  When President Bush decided to go ahead in Iraq, what did his critics \nhave to say? It will never work--fear, pessimism; we can't succeed. On \nthe floor of this Senate, we heard over and over again: There will be \nthousands and thousands of body bags coming back as Saddam Hussein uses \nchemical weapons against our troops. We cannot send our troops there to \nbe exposed to these weapons.\n  These are the same voices now who are saying: There were no weapons. \nBut certainly they believed there were, as they warned us that our \ntroops would be gassed, that they would be killed with chemical \nweapons, and we could not run that risk.\n\n  Then when the action started, these same voices said: Bogged down on \nthe road; held down by the resistance of the Iraqis. We are in a \nquagmire; we will never succeed.\n  Then when Baghdad fell within a matter of weeks from those prophesies \nand predictions, now we are being told: Anybody could have done it. No \nbig deal. We can't give Bush any credit for having gone into Iraq and \nwinning the war. It was a piece of cake.\n  Before the fact, fear and pessimism; after the fact, blame, no credit \nfor success, determination that it is not going to work in the long \nterm.\n  I could go on about Iraq in that regard, but there will be many more \ndebates. Let me go into the other substance of Senator Kennedy's speech \nand demonstrate the same pattern: fear and pessimism.\n  The Senator talks about education, talks about No Child Left Behind. \nHe takes credit for having helped write No Child Left Behind, \nappropriately. One of the reasons I voted against No Child Left Behind \nis because I thought the things the Senator from Massachusetts \nsucceeded in getting into that bill would be too heavy handed in terms \nof the Federal pressure on State boards of education. In that, I feel \nvindicated because State board after State board has complained that \nthis represents entirely too much Federal control on education.\n  Now Senator Kennedy says: No money for education; lots of promises \nout of the administration but no money.\n  The facts are that under President Bush's leadership, this Congress \nhas increased Federal spending on education to higher actual levels and \nat a higher percentage increase than any other administration in \nhistory. This administration has spent more on education than the \nClinton administration did and has accelerated that spending at a \nhigher rate than the Clinton administration did.\n  Yet we are being told: No, they are holding back on education \nspending. They are being too stingy on education spending--as they \nspend more than any other administration and Congress in history.\n  In advance, can't work; after the fact, pessimism that we can't get \nthere--fear and pessimism.\n  The Senator talks about cost estimates with respect to the Medicare \nbill. Here we have to get into a little inside baseball so people can \nunderstand exactly what happened. Senator Kennedy quotes the fact that \nwe used the figure in the Senate of $400 billion as the cost of this \nbill and that an official in the Department of Health and Human \nServices said it is going to be closer to 500, that it is going to be \nover 500. And he was told not to make that estimate public. Senator \nKennedy berates the administration for selling the $400 billion number \nwhen it knew $500 billion was the correct one.\n  Now let's get into the facts. A number of us on this side of the \naisle were\n\n[[Page S3738]]\n\nequally disturbed by this gap between numbers. We assaulted the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, to ask him: How did \nthis happen? How did we get trapped with a low estimate when there was \na higher estimate out there?\n  He pointed out this fact that doesn't get into the public \nconsciousness and that the media does not take the time to understand \nand explain: By law, we in the Congress, as we are adopting a budget, \ncan use only one source for our estimate of costs. By law we have to \ntake the estimate or score--to use the word we all understand around \nhere--of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  As Senator Nickles pointed out to us, during the debate, the \nCongressional Budget Office said: This will cost $400 billion.\n  That is where it was scored. After the estimate came out of the \nadministration that it was going to be higher, the Congressional Budget \nOffice said: The number is still $400 billion, according to our \nestimates.\n  By law, we could not have used the higher estimate in writing the \nbudget because it came from a source outside of the Congressional \nBudget Office. Now, the one thing I know about the $400 billion number \noffered by the CBO and the $500 billion-plus number offered by OMB is \nthat both of them are wrong. I cannot tell you whether either one of \nthem are too high or too low. I can only make my own estimate.\n  But stop and think about it for a moment. We are talking about a \nprogram, spread over 5 years, that is not working yet, and we are \nmaking guesses as to what it would cost. You feed into your computer \ncertain assumptions and you get a number; you change the assumptions in \nthe computer and it will give you another number. The question is not, \nIs the number correct? The question is, Are the assumptions correct? \nThe answer is, all of the assumptions are guesses--whether CBO is \nmaking the guess or whether HHS is making the guess or whether it is \nOMB. Everybody is making the guess.\n  But in terms of the debate on the floor of the Senate, we had no \nchoice but to accept the CBO number as the controlling number. That is \nthe law. So Senator Kennedy is attacking the Republicans and the \ndecisions in this Senate with respect to the budget for following the \nlaw. He is attacking us for not accepting estimates which, by law, we \ncannot use. I think it is important to understand that as we go through \nthis debate, and talk about what is going to happen in the election.\n  In summary, as we look ahead to the election, I think we should pay \nattention to the details, but we should also understand the overall \nthrust of the two campaigns. I do believe that the campaign mounted on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle has begun out of personal hatred of \nPresident Bush, and now more into a litany of fear and pessimism. They \nare afraid the economy is not coming back. They tell us pessimistically \nthat we are never going to get any jobs.\n  Once again, before this last Friday, we were told, well, the \nunemployment rate might be coming down, but that isn't the rate we \nshould look at; we should look at the number of jobs created. On \nFriday, it was announced that 308,000 jobs were created in March. Now \nwe are told, no, don't look at that, look at the unemployment figure; \nit is not coming down fast enough. Don't pay attention to the number of \njobs created.\n  We are told this is the worst economy in 50 years. I have heard that \nrhetoric on the floor. According to the blue-chip economists who are \nlooking at this recovery, they are projecting for 2004--another guess, \nI make that clear--the highest growth rates in 40 years. If that is the \nexample of the kind of economy we are getting from George W. Bush, I \nsay give us more. The highest growth rate in 40 years is what the \nexperts on Wall Street are projecting.\n  And the pessimists are complaining about that. The pessimists are \ntelling us we cannot get there. Look at Iraq. Of course, things are bad \nin the Sunni Triangle in Iraq. The deaths of Americans and the deaths \nof Iraqis are tragic, and we should mourn them and do everything we can \nto try to prevent them, but let us not focus solely on those deaths.\n  Let us look at the fact that Iraq is on its way--however haltingly or \nhowever slowly, and with whatever difficulty--toward establishing a \nconstitution and, one hopes, a democracy. The pessimists say we can \nnever get there. The pessimists are filled with fear and are saying we \nwill fail and when we fail al-Qaida will destroy our cities. But George \nW. Bush is not a pessimist. He is an optimist and he does not peddle \nfear.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue \nfor an additional 4 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is the core of this election. Do we face the future \nwith fear and pessimism and a conviction that we cannot do it or do we \nface the future with a clear, realistic understanding of how difficult \nit will be, but with a confidence and an optimism that we can do it, \nthat we can succeed in implanting a democracy in Iraq, in bringing \nfreedom into that part of the world in a way that it has never known \nbefore?\n  We see signs that we are succeeding already. We see India and \nPakistan, two nuclear powers that have been on the verge of war, now \nlooking out over the world of George W. Bush and American resolve and \nsaying maybe we should talk and try to resolve our differences short of \nwar. We see Qadhafi in Libya saying: Maybe it is not a good idea to \nhave weapons of mass destruction and I will voluntarily surrender them \nand dismantle them in this new situation that George W. Bush has \ncreated.\n  I believe the American people will respond more actively to hope and \noptimism than they will to fear and pessimism. For that reason, I look \nforward to this election season with some relish about debating the \ndetails of the issues raised by the Senator from Massachusetts and, at \nthe same time, some confidence in the wisdom of the American people and \ntheir willingness to embrace hope and optimism and put aside the fears \nand pessimism that are being peddled by the President's opponents.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed for \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to talk about the approach being \ntaken by the other side of the aisle toward a lot of issues in the \nSenate but specifically two dealing with jobs; that is, this attitude \nof obstruction for the purpose of basically stopping legislation and \nnot allowing this body to move forward and do the business of the \npeople.\n  There are two bills pending in this body. One is the JOBS bill, which \ndeals with correcting the tax structure of the United States so we are \nno longer out of compliance with a ruling made by the WTO, which \nruling, if it is allowed to stand, will have the practical effect of \nraising duties on American products sold overseas rather significantly. \nIn fact, they could raise as high as 18 percent, as I understand it.\n  The effect of those duties, of course, which have now been ruled \nlegal under this international tribunal that we subscribe to as a \nmember state, will be that those American goods are not as competitive \nas they should be, and therefore those American goods will not be able \nto be effectively sold into\n\n[[Page S3739]]\n\nthose markets overseas. The practical effect of that will be that jobs \nwill be lost here in the U.S.\n  The other side of the aisle continues to filibuster that bill. The \neffect of the filibuster will be that these duties will go into place \nand jobs will be lost. This bill which is called the JOBS bill is just \nthat, a jobs bill. Yet we hear from the other side of the aisle what \nappears to be and must be crocodile tears on the issue of creating more \njobs, because they have the opportunity to pass a piece of legislation \nthat will clearly impact the creation and maintenance of jobs in the \nUnited States, and they are obstructing it and filibustering it.\n  We hear from the other side a great deal about outsourcing, American \njobs being moved overseas. The practical effect of objecting to this \nbill, obstructing this bill and of filibustering this bill, is that \nthose jobs will probably move overseas because those manufacturers, in \norder to avoid the duty, are going to have to move overseas in order to \nbe competitive with the products in those nations where they are \nselling them. So the effect of the filibuster and obstruction we are \nseeing on the other side on the issue of the JOBS bill is to basically \nenergize the loss of jobs in the U.S. and the outsourcing of jobs \noverseas.\n  Therefore, when we hear all this discussion and concern about the \ncreation of jobs in this country today from the other side of the aisle \nin the context of the Presidential election, one wonders how serious \nthey are, because clearly if they are serious they would pass this \nbill which, by the way, is supported by a majority of the Senate. The \nobjection to this bill is not the underlying law. It is not the \ncorrection to the tax law which will allow these jobs to be retained in \nthe United States. It is, rather, they wish to bring forward extraneous \nlegislation and put it on this bill, legislation which we voted on a \ncouple of times before in committee and which we voted on at least once \non the floor of the Senate.\n\n  Therefore, it is a tangential idea and a desire to make a political \npoint, and their willingness to pursue that tangential idea and desire \nat the expense of these jobs, I find, is cynical and clearly \ninappropriate. That is the first bill being stopped.\n  The second bill is a bill I managed and which just came out of \nconference, and it is the pension reform bill. It did not have \neverything in it that I wanted. It did not have everything in it the \nHouse wanted. But it has key pieces of legislation in it which will \nhave a direct impact on jobs. I called this pensions bill the ultimate \njobs bill because, quite honestly, that is exactly what it is.\n  If this pensions bill is not passed and passed promptly, the \npractical effect is there will be a misallocation of up to $80 billion \nof resources within the investment community and in the small and large \nbusiness communities of this country. What has happened today is that \ncompanies fund what is known as a defined benefits plan under rules \nwhich they say, in order to determine how much they are going to pay to \nthe plan each year, they have to look at the rate of return on the 30-\nyear Treasury bond.\n  The 30-year Treasury bond is a vehicle which does not exist anymore. \nWe do not sell it, basically, as a country. Therefore, the price of a \n30-year Treasury bond has been moved to an artificially low number, and \nthe practical effect of that is that companies, businesses, and unions \nwhich must see their pension funds funded for these defined benefits \nplans are going to see those payments to those defined benefits plans \nincreased at an arbitrary rate based on a nonexistent bond vehicle, the \n30-year bond. It is technical, but it is an important point.\n  This pensions bill corrects that situation. It sets up a new \nstructure for defining how much must be contributed to a defined \nbenefits plan for a period of 2 years based on a bond rate which does \nactually exist, which is a market basket of corporate bonds. The \npractical effect of that will be an appropriate allocation of money \ninto these defined benefits plans, leaving dollars available to invest \nin new plant, new equipment, and expansion of business in the United \nStates, which leads directly to jobs.\n  Thus, if this pensions bill is not enacted in the next week, we will \nhave these arbitrary reallocations of funds occurring by April 15. This \npensions bill will have a direct and proximate effect on the ability of \nbusiness in the United States to be competitive, to create investment, \nand, in return, to create jobs.\n  Yet, once again, we were told by the leadership on the other side of \nthe aisle--at least the leadership in the committees, Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Baucus--that they oppose this bill and they are going to \nuse all their means available to them to stop it.\n  They can stop this bill. There is no question about it. They can stop \nit for at least 2 or 3 weeks, and the practical effect of that will be \nthat we will go beyond the April 15 funding date, and this rather \nhorrific misallocation of resources will kick in, the practical effect \nof which will be instead of investing to create jobs, they will be \ninvesting arbitrarily in these defined benefits funds at a rate which \nis not reflective of what the actual return rate on those funds would \nbe if they had an appropriate market basket of corporate bonds on which \nthey were basing their yield rates.\n\n  Yes, they can hold this bill up. And, yes, I guess they intend to \nhold this bill up. What is the effect of that? It is going to cost \nAmericans jobs. It is going to mean jobs will not be created. It is \ngoing to mean investment will not be made. It will mean dollars will be \narbitrarily allocated rather than flowing where they can most \neffectively be used through investment in new plant and equipment and \nthe resulting jobs that occur from that.\n  So, once again, we see from the other side of the aisle an attitude \nthat says: We are going to obstruct you; we are going to stop business \nin the Senate. We don't care that in the process of doing that we are \ngoing to create an atmosphere where jobs are lost, as in the case of \nthe JOBS bill where the duties are increased against American \nmanufacturers and maybe as a result jobs have to be outsourced. In any \nevent, we will certainly have our products being less competitive, \nwhich means probably fewer jobs will be created in those businesses and \nmaybe jobs will be lost in those businesses in the area of the pensions \nbill. They do not care. They are going to obstruct, and they are going \nto stop this bill because they are tweaked about the issue of how far \nit went and, as a result, what is going to be the impact. Jobs will be \nlost because the dollars for investing in plant and equipment will not \nbe available. It is a rather cynical strategy from the other side of \nthe aisle. First, they go out to the public in the Presidential \ncampaign and say: Why don't we have more jobs? Then, on the floor of \nthe Senate, they are aggressively pursuing strategies which stop us \nfrom creating more jobs. It is a lot like the kids who killed their \nparents and then go to the court and claim they should receive special \ntreatment because they are orphans.\n  These folks on the other side of the aisle are shooting the programs \nwhich would create jobs, and then they are going out in the \nPresidential politics arena and saying: Why aren't we creating more \njobs?\n  The cynicism of it is rather extreme. From my standpoint, I certainly \nhope they are not going to continue this practice because, in the end, \nit means people in America will not have jobs and will have fewer \nopportunities to work. For me, that is not right.\n  I hope we can pass this pensions bill this week, and I hope we can \npass this JOBS bill this week, but it certainly doesn't look like that \nis going to occur.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to comments \nof some of my colleagues, especially on this issue of obstructionism as \nit relates to jobs. It is true there is a JOBS bill, as it is called, \non the floor of the Senate that has been delayed. This JOBS bill is a \nbill that gives tax breaks to U.S. manufacturers, and it has, in fact, \nbeen delayed. Let me explain why it has been delayed and why the \nobstructionism on the part of the majority party in Congress exists.\n  When that bill came to the floor of the Senate, someone on this side \nof the aisle offered a very important amendment. It also had to do with \njobs, so it had to do with the subject of the bill.\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\nBecause the majority party did not want to vote on the amendment, they \ntook all their marbles, walked off the floor, and went home and accused \nour side of being obstructionist. Let me describe the circumstances.\n  Senator Harkin offered an amendment on overtime pay. Why did he do \nthat? Because the Department of Labor is about to produce new \nregulations that, for the first time in 60 years, will obliterate the \n40-hour workweek and tell workers, Oh, by the way, if your employer \ndecides to work you more than 40 hours, anywhere from 6 to 8 million \nAmericans who now receive overtime will not be able to receive overtime \npay. The employer will be able to say: You work overtime, you work 50 \nhours; if you don't like it, tough luck, and I am not going to pay you \novertime. For the first time in 60 years, the 40-hour workweek will be \ngone for about 6 to 8 million people.\n  These new rules are touted as worker-friendly rules, but, of course, \nwe know that is not the case at all because there are consulting \ncompanies--and the Department of Labor itself--putting out information \nto businesses to say: Here is the way you structure your company to \navoid paying your workers overtime under these new rules.\n  Senator Harkin offered an amendment on this important JOBS bill. Why \nis it germane to this JOBS bill? Because if employers are able to say \nto workers, You work overtime for no extra pay, instead of creating new \njobs which ought to be created, they will say to existing workers: You \nwork overtime; we are not going to pay you extra.\n  This new rule from the Department of Labor is an approach that will \ndiminish jobs, that will retard the creation of new jobs. Yet, when \nSenator Harkin offered that amendment, the majority party had some kind \nof an apoplectic seizure.\n  According to the majority party, Senator Harkin is apparently \nobstructing things because he offers an amendment dealing directly with \njobs. No, it is not Senator Harkin who is obstructing. What is \nobstructing the business of this Chamber is the majority party. Senator \nHarkin offered an amendment that deals directly with jobs and they \nrefused to have a vote on it, and they are going to take their marbles \nand just go home. They are going to go home and accuse someone else of \nobstructing.\n  The obstruction in this Chamber is by the majority party that refuses \nto allow votes on issues that are important and that are relevant to \nthe matters at hand. That is the obstruction. It is a curious strategy \nto know the majority party would obstruct its own agenda, but obstruct \nthey do. Then they rush out to the microphones to accuse others of \nobstructing.\n  There is a very simple way to remove all of these issues. We do not \nhave to have any obstruction by anybody. Bring the bills to the floor \nand let us try to deal with them in a thoughtful way. When someone \noffers an amendment, like Senator Harkin, give us an opportunity to \nhave a vote on it. Let's move ahead. That is not the case these days. \nIt is just a little bizarre to hear these charges of obstructionism.\n  I would also say to those who came to the floor this morning to say \nwhat they really want to see is a positive campaign for the Presidency, \nI say amen to that. But there is a large, well-oiled attack machine in \nthis town. In fact, I watched the television commercials last evening \nby the administration, which represent Senator Kerry's position on \ntaxation. It is a wholly negative television commercial.\n  I agree with my colleague who said, let's be positive. How about \nmaybe we see the other side, maybe see the White House take some of \nthose commercials off the air and then let us talk about being \npositive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3740-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FOREIGN COMPANIES MUST PAY TAXES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor not to talk about the \nobstruction by the majority party; I came instead to talk about a new \nreport that is just out. It is a report by the GAO, and it says \nsomething important about fiscal policy in this country.\n  The GAO report, which Senator Carl Levin and I asked for, compares \nthe reported tax liabilities of some of the biggest companies that do \nbusiness in this country, both domestic companies and foreign \ncompanies.\n  This report studied a period of time when we had robust economic \ngrowth in our economy, 1996-2000. On the summary page, it says that an \naverage of 71 percent of all foreign corporations doing business in the \nUnited States of America pay no income tax at all. These are names \nalmost all Americans would easily recognize. Obviously, this report \ndoes not provide these names. But when one talks about the major \nforeign corporations selling products in this country, earning billions \nof dollars from those sales and paying zero to the Federal Government \nin tax liability, it raises very serious questions about gaping holes \nin this country's tax system.\n  We are nearing April 15, when Americans will march off to the post \noffice and pay their taxes. They will pay their taxes because they do \nnot have any alternative or any flexibility. They understand the \nobligation in this country to pay taxes.\n  Now, 71 percent of the foreign corporations that do business and make \nmoney in this country have decided they want to participate in our \ncountry and market system, but they do not want to participate in \npaying taxes on those profits. There is something fundamentally wrong \nwith that. Once again, it demonstrates the gaping holes in our tax \nsystem. No, not for ordinary people, just for the big interests who do \na lot of business, make a lot of money and pay no taxes. Shame on them.\n  This report also found that 61 percent of domestic companies during \nthis period of economic growth paid no income taxes in this country.\n  We know the stories about companies that have decided they want to \nrun their company out of a mailbox in Bermuda or the Bahamas. Why? \nBecause they do not want to pay taxes to the United States. I say this \nto companies that want to do that: If they want to run their company \nout of a mailbox in the Bahamas, the next time they get in trouble, \ncall the Bahamian Navy. I understand they have 21 sailors. Call them to \nget their company out of trouble.\n  These foreign corporations that do business and make profits in this \ncountry have an obligation to pay taxes in this country. Domestic \ncompanies that make profits in this country have an obligation as well. \nThat obligation is to participate with ordinary Americans who \nunderstand that part of the cost of citizenship in this country is to \nhelp fund schools, pay for defense and pay for the social services that \nmake this a great country. That is part of the obligation.\n  We have some of the biggest economic interests who have decided they \nwant to participate in every way of being an American except paying \ntaxes. That has to stop. I hope this Congress will begin to take this \nseriously.\n  This is the second GAO report we have done in the last 6 years on \nthis subject. The tax avoidance problem is not getting better, it is \ngetting worse. Tax loopholes are not getting narrower, they are getting \nwider.\n  Again, as we near April 15, when Americans think about the obligation \nto pay taxes into this Government, I think it is shameful to get a \nreport like this that says so many big economic interests that make so \nmuch money have decided they want all of the advantages America has to \noffer, but they do not want to pay taxes to the United States of \nAmerica. That is a shameful situation and one we ought to fix.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3740-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3740-S3741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE JOBS BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, when we return to the JOBS Act, the bill \nthat the majority party pulled from the Senate floor because Senator \nHarkin offered an amendment on overtime, Senator Mikulski and I are \ngoing to offer an amendment. The amendment is very simple. It says \nthis: We are going to end that provision in our Tax Code that says to \nAmerican companies, if they will just pack up all of their belongings, \nfire all of their workers and move somewhere else offshore, make the \nsame product and ship it back into our country, we will give them a tax \nbreak. Talk about perversity, that is perverse, offering a tax break to \nsomeone who moves their American jobs\n\n[[Page S3741]]\n\noverseas. Yet, that is exactly what exists in the Tax Code. We have \nvoted on this before because I offered a similar amendment a number of \nyears ago.\n  Let me describe exactly how this tax break works. Let's say there are \ntwo companies in this country with manufacturing plants. Each company \nproduces garage door openers and these companies do a good job. They \nemploy American workers, they produce garage door openers for sale in \nthe U.S. marketplace and they earn some profit. But one company decides \nwhat it really wants to do is move overseas because it does not have to \npay $11 an hour for a manufacturing worker. The company can go to Sri \nLanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia or China and hire a 16 year-old-kid or a \n12-year-old kid and pay them 12 cents an hour, working them 12 hours a \nday 7 days a week.\n  So one of the companies that makes garage door openers leaves, makes \nexactly the same garage door opener now in Sri Lanka and ships it back \ninto this country.\n  The other company that makes garage door openers stays in America. \nThe difference is that the company that left this country does not have \nto pay income taxes on their profits any longer because we have \nsomething called tax deferral. Until and unless they repatriate those \nearnings, those earnings are tax free in this country.\n  Our amendment is very simple. It says this: If a company leaves this \ncountry and moves its jobs overseas to produce a product to ship back \ninto this marketplace, the company loses tax deferral that now \nperversely incentivizes companies to leave this country. It is one \nthing to have companies leave because of bad trade agreements, because \nthey can avoid the things we have fought for for years in this \ncountry--safe workplaces, fair labor standards, and decent wages. It is \nquite another thing for them to leave because in part we say we will \ngive them a tax break if they leave our country. What a nutty idea and \none that we ought to change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3741-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3741-S3742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REIMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will make one additional point on \nanother subject. Last week, I went to see the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, Tommy Thompson, and made a presentation in support of a \npilot project I want him to approve which would allow the reimportation \nof prescription drugs from Canada. My pilot project is very simple. It \nsets up a 2-year pilot project for North Dakota that would allow North \nDakota pharmacists to access FDA-approved drugs from pharmacists in \nCanada.\n  As you know, the administration has been fighting this notion of \nreimporting prescription drugs. The pharmaceutical industry is fighting \nit. The administration is fighting it.\n  This is why it is important: In every case--the drug Lipitor, \nPrevacid, Zocor, Celebrex--it is the same drug put in the same bottle \nmade by the same company sold in two countries, but the charges are \nmuch higher to the U.S. consumer. It is not just true with Canada; it \nis true for every country in the world because the U.S. consumer is \ncharged the highest prices in the world for FDA-approved prescription \ndrugs, and that is not fair.\n  Let me ask consent to show two pill bottles on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. These are bottles of a drug called Lipitor. This, I \nbelieve, is one of the fastest selling, most popular drugs in the \nUnited States. It is used for the lowering of cholesterol. By all \naccounts, it is a very successful drug and it sells rapidly and is \nprescribed often.\n  As you can see, these two bottles of Lipitor are identical. These are \nboth bottles that have 10 milligram tablets of Lipitor in them. They \nare made in the same plant. These are FDA-approved drugs made in an \nFDA-approved plant. The same pill is put in the same bottle made by the \nsame company. There is one difference. This one is sold to Canadians at \n$1.01 per tablet. This one is sold to Americans at $1.81 per tablet. It \nis the same pill, the same bottle, same company, FDA approved, but \nnearly twice as much money is charged to the American consumer than the \nCanadian consumer.\n  I could have used Germany as an example, Italy, England, France, \nSpain--almost anyone. I could have used almost any country and come up \nwith nearly the same result.\n  In Europe, they have something called parallel trading. If you are in \nSpain and want to buy a drug from Germany, there is no problem, you go \nthrough the parallel trading system. If you are in Italy and want to \nbuy a drug from France, no problem, parallel trading. In this country \nwe are told by FDA and others that there would be a huge safety problem \nif we purchased drugs from Canada--total nonsense. The Canadians have \nvirtually the same chain of custody as we do. The Canadian drug supply \nis safe. Even our health authorities will admit that. So having \nlicensed U.S. pharmacists acquire from licensed pharmacists or licensed \ndistributors in Canada the identical drug and passing the savings along \nto the American consumer makes good sense and poses no--I repeat no--\nsafety issues for citizens of this country.\n  I have asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services for a waiver \nto allow this pilot program to go forward. We will continue on the \nfloor of the Senate to pass legislation. I believe we will soon pass \nlegislation that deals with this issue, but, in the meantime, I am \nasking the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a decision on \nthis waiver request. He is now studying that. I assume it will be some \nweeks. But my hope is he will understand that the issue, which is a \nsafety issue that they have described, simply does not, cannot, and \nwill not exist with respect to this matter.\n  The question is, Who is going to stand up for the American consumer? \nWill somebody stand up and say, on behalf of the American consumers, \nthat what is happening here is not fair? I hope so.\n  This proposal is called Prairie Prescriptions. It is a 2-year pilot \nproject I put together. My hope is my State can be a pilot project that \nwill demonstrate for everyone that the issue of safety in the \nreimportation of drugs with Canada, which has a nearly identical chain \nof custody, will always be a bogus issue. The issue is whether the \nAmerican people will continue to pay the highest prices in the world \nfor prescription drugs.\n\n  Miracle drugs offer no miracle for those who cannot afford them. Our \nsenior citizens of this country are 12 percent of America's population \nand they take one-third of the prescription drugs. They are often the \npeople least able to afford these prices. Yet day after day, month \nafter month in this country we have senior citizens going down to their \ngrocery store, and finding out how much their prescription drugs are \ngoing to cost so they know how much they have left to buy their \ngroceries.\n  I notice my colleague Senator Harkin is waiting to speak. I am sure \nin Iowa, as we have in North Dakota, when you go to a meeting someplace \nyou often have somebody 80 years old touch you on the elbow and say: \nCan you help me? You say: What is it? And the tears well up in their \neyes and their chin begins to quiver and they say: I have heart disease \nand diabetes and I am supposed to take this medicine and I can't afford \nit. Can you help me?\n  The fact is, we pay too much for prescription drugs. We pay the \nhighest prices in the world, and it is just not fair.\n  Obviously, my interest is at some point to force a repricing in this \ncountry, but in the absence of that, I believe reimportation is the way \nto let the market system even out these prices. I believe that can, \nshould, and will be done without any safety issues whatsoever.\n  I await anxiously the decision by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices and the administration. The Prairie Prescriptions Pilot \nProject is a solid project, one that will benefit, in my judgment, the \nentire country by demonstrating once and for all this phony issue that \nhas been raised by the former head of FDA, Dr. McClellan, and so many \nothers. The issue of safety is just not an issue at all. The issue \nreally is will the American people finally be treated fairly with \nrespect to prescription drug pricing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes fifty seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand that the Senate will then resume \nconsideration of the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent, since \nI had 15 minutes--I am going to ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 5 minutes as in morning business and then the Senate would \nthen interrupt my presentation to return to the motion to proceed and \nthat I be recognized to finish my statement then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, might I ask--reserving the right to \nobject, may I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Iowa be given \n15 minutes in morning business?\n  Mr. HARKIN. We will just go to the motion to proceed. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Which one?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Your request that you be allowed 5 minutes \nnow, then we go to the bill, and then you be recognized to speak for an \nadditional 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague from North \nDakota. We might as well go on with the motion to proceed. I can make \nmy presentation then, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3742-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is no secret that there is a great \nfrustration in the American workplace today. There is a great anxiety \namong American working families. You can sense it, you can feel it, you \ncan hear it no matter where you go in America, whether it is in Iowa or \nWyoming or New York or wherever it is. Something is happening out \nthere. You get it all the time from people who have been working, maybe \nhave lost their jobs, maybe they took another job, they are not making \nends meet. They see the economy doing much better. They read this in \nthe paper all the time--the economy is getting better, tax cuts are \ngoing into effect, foreign car sales, the big cars, the Mercedes and \nall those, are up. We see all the higher end items being purchased and \nsold.\n  For example, over the recent Christmas holidays, the Sharper Image, I \nbelieve, which sells high end electronics stuff, and Neiman Marcus had \ngreat sales. But Wal-Mart was down.\n  There is a great sense among American working people that something \nis not quite right with what is going on in this country. Maybe most \nAmericans don't have degrees in economics; they haven't studied it, but \nthey sense something is going wrong.\n  In his recent book, ``Wealth and Democracy,'' Kevin Phillips pointed \nout that there is a trend that different countries go through at \nvarious stages of their growth. One of those stages is where more and \nmore of the output of a country accumulates to capital and less and \nless accumulates to labor, to the working people.\n  It is with great interest I note that, after I had read Kevin \nPhillips' book, yesterday in the New York Times an article by Bob \nHerbert brought it home. The title of the piece was ``We're More \nProductive. Who Gets the Money?'' As Mr. Herbert wrote yesterday in the \nNew York Times:\n\n       It's like running on a treadmill that keeps increasing its \n     speed. You have to go faster and faster just to stay in \n     place. Or, as a factory worker said many years ago, ``You can \n     work 'til you drop dead, but you won't get ahead.''\n       American workers have been remarkably productive in recent \n     years, but they are getting fewer and fewer of the benefits \n     of this increased productivity. While the economy, as \n     measured by the gross domestic product, has been strong for \n     some time now, ordinary workers have gotten little more than \n     the back of the hand from employers who have pocketed an \n     unprecedented share of the case from this burst of economic \n     growth.\n       What is happening is nothing short of historic. The \n     American workers' share of the increase in national income \n     since November 2001, the end of the last recession, is the \n     lowest on record. Employers took the money and ran. This is \n     extraordinary, but very few people are talking about it, \n     which tells you something about the hold that corporate \n     interests have on the national conversation.\n       The situation is summed up in the long, unwieldy but very \n     revealing title of a new study from the Center of Labor \n     Market Studies at Northeastern University: ``The \n     Unprecedented Rising Tide of Corporate Profits and the \n     Simultaneous Ebbing of Labor Compensation--Gainers and Losers \n     from the National Economic Recovery in 2002 and 2003.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 11 a.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to \nproceed to the consideration of S. 2207, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2207) to improve women's access to health care \n     services, and the access of all individuals to emergency and \n     trauma care services, by reducing the excessive burden the \n     liability system places on the delivery of such service.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIowa is recognized for an additional 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I did not \nunderstand I was under a time limit. I had asked to continue to proceed \nafter morning business on the motion to proceed, but I didn't recognize \nthere was a time limit there. I did not ask consent for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has been granted 10 minutes to \nspeak on any subject he wishes. But the total is 15 minutes under the \nrequest.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the record will show that I asked for consent to \ncontinue to speak in morning business, to yield the floor, to then \nreturn to the motion to proceed, and that I be recognized to continue \nto speak on the motion to proceed. That does not have a time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized to speak on the \nmotion to proceed or on whatever subject he wishes to speak for 10 \nminutes and thereafter on the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand that. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure.\n  Mr. GREGG. At the end of the Senator's 10 minutes, does the Senator \ncome back and retain the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was my understanding that the time under \nthe request was that he was going to have a total of 15 minutes. \nOtherwise, there would have been an objection.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will be seeking the floor at the \nconclusion of the 10 minutes as the manager of the bill, for \neverybody's knowledge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the normal procedure, the manager of the \nbill may speak as soon as a bill is brought up, with the exception of \nthe 10 minutes as a continuation of the total of 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Iowa may proceed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not mean to take more than 15 minutes. I might go \ninto 18 or 20 minutes. I wasn't going to take a long time. I wanted to \nfinish my statement without being constrained with the 15 minutes I had \nunder morning business. That is why I went on the motion to proceed. I \nwill speak on that for an additional few minutes. But I will take \nwhatever time I can now. If I am cut off, I will be back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Mr. Herbert further said:\n\n       Andrew Sum, the center's director and lead author of the \n     study, said: ``This is the first time we've ever had a case \n     where two years into a recovery, corporate profits got a \n     larger share of the growth of national income than labor did. \n     Normally labor gets about 65 percent and corporate profits \n     about 15 to 18 percent. This time profits got 41 percent and \n     labor [meaning all forms of employee compensation, including \n     wages, benefits, salaries and the percentage of payroll taxes \n     paid by employers] got 38 percent.''\n       The study said: ``In no other recovery from a post-World \n     War II recession did corporate profits ever account for as \n     much as 20 percent of the growth in national income. And\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\n     at no time did corporate profits ever increase by a greater \n     amount than labor compensation.''\n       In other words, an awful lot American workers have been \n     had. Fleeced. Taken to the cleaners.\n       The recent productivity gains have been widely \n     acknowledged. But workers are not being compensated for this. \n     During the past two years, increases in wages and benefits \n     have been very weak, or nonexistent. And despite the growth \n     of jobs in March that had the Bush crowd dancing in the White \n     House halls last Friday, there has been no net increase in \n     formal payroll employment since the end of the recession. We \n     have lost jobs. There are fewer payroll jobs now than there \n     were when the recession ended in November 2001.\n       So if employers were not hiring workers, and if they were \n     miserly when it came to increases in wages and benefits for \n     existing employees, what happened to all the money from the \n     strong economic growth?\n       The study is very clear on this point. The bulk of the \n     gains did not go to workers, ``but instead were used to boost \n     profits, lower prices, or increase C.E.O. compensation.''\n       This is a radical transformation of the way the bounty of \n     this country has been distributed since World War II. Workers \n     are being treated more and more like patrons in a rigged \n     casino. They can't win.\n       Corporate profits go up. The stock market goes up. \n     Executive compensation skyrockets. But workers, for the most \n     part, remain on the treadmill.\n       The study found that the amount of income growth devoured \n     by corporate profits in this recovery is ``historically \n     unprecedented,'' as is the ``low share . . .  accruing to the \n     nation's workers in the form of labor compensation.''\n\n  I thought Mr. Herbert wound up his statement quite adequately when he \nsaid:\n\n       I have to laugh when I hear conservatives complaining about \n     class warfare. They know this terrain better than anyone. \n     They launched the war. They're waging it. And they're winning \n     it.\n\n  One of the reasons they are winning it is because workers no longer \nhave organized labor. Organized labor has been weakened to the point \nwhere workers are told: Take what you got or go get something else or \nwe will take your job and we will take it to China or we will take your \njob and move it to India or South Africa or some other place. You have \nno recourse as a worker.\n  I have tried for years in this Senate and in this Congress to try to \nget a bill passed called the striker replacement bill which says if you \nare on strike you can't be replaced with a replacement worker. That one \nthing alone has broken the back of organized labor to the point where \nworkers no longer have the power to withhold their labor, the only tool \nwith which they have to bargain.\n  So here we have more and more of the earnings from increased \nproductivity going to capital and less going to workers. What do we do \nabout it? We say now we are going to take away your time-and-a-half \novertime. That is the next assault on the time-and-a-half overtime. For \nour workers who are working more and more in this country and working \nlonger hours than any other industrialized country, we are going to say \nto workers we will take away your right to overtime.\n  That issue was brought up on the bill that was before us earlier. \nThat was my amendment, to say these proposed rules by the Department of \nLabor that would deny up to 8 million Americans their right to time-\nand-a-half overtime could not go into effect. Now we find that not only \nis the administration trying to push through new rules to eliminate \novertime pay; at the same time, many employers are illegally pushing \nthe same thing. They are doctoring their employee time records in order \nto avoid paying overtime. This practice is shaving time. It is easy to \ndo, it is hard to detect, and is done in a matter of a few keystrokes.\n  According to the New York Times article on Sunday by Steven \nGreenhouse:\n\n       Workers have sued Family Dollar and Pep Boys, the auto \n     parts and repair chain, accusing managers of deleting hours. \n     A jury found the Taco Bell managers in Oregon had routinely \n     erased workers' time. More than a dozen former Wal-Mart \n     employees said in interviews and depositions that managers \n     had altered time records and shortchanged employees.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of the New York Times article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 4, 2004]\n\n      Altering of Worker Time Cards Spurs Growing Number of Suits\n\n                         (By Steven Greenhouse)\n\n       As a former member of the Air Force military police, as a \n     play-by-the-rules guy, Drew Pooters said he was stunned by \n     what he found his manager doing in the Toys ``R'' Us store in \n     Albuquerque.\n       Inside a cramped office, he said, his manager was sitting \n     at a computer and altering workers' time records, secretly \n     deleting hours to cut their paychecks and fatten his store's \n     bottom line.\n       ``I told him, `That's not exactly legal,' '' said Mr. \n     Pooters, who ran the store's electronics department. ``Then \n     he out-and-out threatened me not to talk about what I saw.''\n       Mr. Pooters quit, landing a job in 2002 managing a Family \n     Dollar store, one of 5,100 in that discount chain. Top \n     managers there ordered him not to let employees' total hours \n     exceed a certain amount each week, and one day, he said, his \n     district manager told him to use a trick to cut payroll: \n     delete some employee hours electronically.\n       ``I told her, `I'm not going to get involved in this,' '' \n     Mr. Pooters recalled, saying that when he refused, the \n     district manager erased the hours herself.\n       Experts on compensation say that the illegal doctoring of \n     hourly employees' time records is far more prevalent than \n     most Americans believe. The practice, commonly called shaving \n     time, is easily done and hard to detect--a simple matter of \n     computer keystrokes--and has spurred a growing number of \n     lawsuits and settlements against a wide range of businesses.\n       Workers have sued Family Dollar and Pep Boys, the auto \n     parts and repair chain, accusing managers of deleting hours. \n     A jury found that Taco Bell managers in Oregon had routinely \n     erased workers' time. More than a dozen former Wal-Mart \n     employees said in interviews and depositions that managers \n     had altered time records to shortchange employees. The \n     Department of Labor recently reached two back-pay settlements \n     with Kinko's photocopy centers, totaling $56,600, after \n     finding that managers in Ithaca, NY, and Hyannis, MA, had \n     erased time for 13 employees.\n       ``There are a lot of incentives for store managers to cut \n     costs in illegal ways,'' said David Lewin, a professor of \n     management who teaches a course on compensation at the \n     University of California, Los Angeles. ``You hope that would \n     be contrary to company practices, but sometimes these \n     practices become so ingrained that they become the dominant \n     practice.''\n       Officials at Toys ``R'' Us, Family Dollar, Pep Boys, Wal-\n     Mart and Taco Bell say they prohibit manipulation of time \n     records, but many acknowledge that it sometimes happens.\n       ``Our policy is to pay hourly associates for every minute \n     they work,'' said Mona Williams, vice president for \n     communications at Wal-Mart. ``With a company this large, \n     there will inevitably be instances of managers doing the \n     wrong thing. Our policy is if a manager deliberately deletes \n     time, they're dismissed.''\n       Compensation experts say that many managers, whether at \n     discount stores or fast-food restaurants, fear losing their \n     jobs if they fail to keep costs down.\n       ``A lot of this is that district managers might fire you as \n     soon as look at you,'' said William Rutzick, a lawyer who \n     reached a $1.5 million settlement with Taco Bell last year \n     after a jury found the chain's managers guilty of erasing \n     time and requiring off-the-clock work. ``The store managers \n     have a toehold in the lower middle class. They're being paid \n     $20,000, $30,000. They're in management. They get medical. \n     They have no job security at all, and they want to keep their \n     toehold in the lower middle class, and they'll often do \n     whatever is necessary to do it.''\n       Another reason managers shave time, experts say, is that an \n     increasing part of their compensation comes in bonuses based \n     on minimizing costs or maximizing profits.\n       ``The pressures are just unbelievable to control costs and \n     improve productivity,'' said George Milkovich, a long time \n     Cornell University professor of industrial relations and co-\n     author of the leading textbook on compensation. ``All this \n     manipulation of payroll may be the unintended consequence of \n     increasing the emphasis on bonuses.''\n       Beth Terrell, a Seattle lawyer who has sued Wal-Mart, \n     accusing its managers of doctoring time records, said: ``Many \n     of these employees are making $8 an hour. These employees can \n     scarcely afford to have time deleted. They're barely paying \n     their bills already.''\n       In the punch-card era, managers would have had to conspire \n     with payroll clerks or accountants to manipulate records. But \n     now it is far easier for individual managers to accomplish \n     this secretly with computers, payroll experts say.\n       Mr. Pooters, a father of five who left the Air Force in \n     1997 for a career in retailing, talks with disgust about \n     photocopied Toys ``R'' Us records that he said showed how his \n     manager made it appear that he had clocked out much earlier \n     than he had.\n       ``Unless you keep track of your time and keep records of \n     when you punch in and punch out, there's no way to stop \n     this,'' he said.\n       After leaving Toys ``R'' Us and Family Dollar, Mr. Potters \n     moved to Indiana and took a job as an account manager with \n     Rentway, a chain that leases furniture and electronics. \n     There, he and a co-worker, William Coombs, said, the workload \n     was so intense that they typically missed four lunch breaks a \n     week. Nonetheless, they said, their\n\n[[Page S3744]]\n\n     manager inserted a half-hour for lunch into their time \n     records every day, reducing their pay accordingly.\n       ``They told us to sign the payroll printouts to confirm it \n     was right,'' Mr. Pooters said, describing a confrontation \n     last November. ``When we protested about what happened with \n     our lunch hours, the manager said, `If you don't sign, you're \n     not going to get paid.' ''\n       Mr. Coombs said: ``They removed our lunch hours all the \n     time. We were told if we didn't sign the payroll sheets, we'd \n     be terminated.''\n       Larry Gorski, Rentway's vice president for human resources, \n     said his company strictly prohibited erasing time. ``As soon \n     as we hear this is going on, we jump all over it,'' he \n     said.\n       Shannon Priller, who worked at a Family Dollar store in Rio \n     Rancho, N.M., sheepishly acknowledged that she sometimes \n     watched her district manager erase her hours. ``The manager \n     and I would sit there and go over everybody's time cards,'' \n     she said. ``We were told not to go over payroll, or we would \n     lose our jobs. If we were over, my hours would get shaved.''\n       Some weeks, she said, she lost 10 or 15 hours, and her 6 \n     a.m. clock-in time became 9 a.m. Patricia Bauer, a clerk at \n     the store, said her paycheck was sometimes cut to under 30 \n     hours on weeks when she worked 40.\n       Like Mr. Pooters, these women have joined a lawsuit that \n     accuses Family Dollar of erasing time and requiring off-the-\n     clock work. ``It needs to stop,'' said Ms. Priller, who now \n     cleans houses.\n       Kim Danner said that when she ran a Family Dollar store \n     with eight employees in Minneapolis, her district manager \n     urged her to erase hours so that she never paid overtime or \n     exceeded her allotted payroll. Federal law generally requires \n     paying time-and-a-half to nonmanagerial employees who work \n     more than 40 hours a week.\n       Ms. Danner said her employees could not do all the \n     unloading, stocking, cashier work and pricing of merchandise \n     in the hours allotted. ``The message from the district \n     manager was, basically, `I don't care how you do it, just get \n     it done,' '' she said.\n       So she altered clock-out times and inserted half-hour lunch \n     breaks even when employees had worked through them. ``I felt \n     horrible that I was doing this,'' she said. ``I felt \n     pressured, absolutely. If I refused, I would have been \n     terminated easily.''\n       After five months, she quit.\n       Sandra Wilkenloh, Family Dollar's communications director, \n     declined to respond to the lawsuit, but said, ``Family \n     Dollar's policy is to fully comply with all wage and hour \n     laws and to take appropriate disciplinary action in any case \n     where we determine that such policy has been violated.''\n       She said Family Dollar maintained a hot line that employees \n     could call anonymously to report wage violations.\n       Rosann Wilks, who was an assistant manager at a Pep Boys in \n     Nashville, said she was fired in 2001 after refusing to \n     delete time. She said her district manager told her, ``Under \n     no circumstances at all is overtime allowed, and if so, then \n     you need to shave time.''\n       At first, she bowed to orders and erased hours. Some \n     employees began asking questions, she said, but they refused \n     to confront management. ``They took it lying down,'' she \n     said. ``They didn't want to lose their job. Jobs are hard to \n     find.''\n       When she started feeling guilty and confronted her district \n     manager, she said, ``It all came to a boil. He fired me.''\n       Bill Furtkevic, Pep Boys' spokesman, said his company did \n     not tolerate deleting time.\n       ``Pep Boys' policy dictates, and record demonstrates, that \n     any store manager found to have shaved any amount of employee \n     time be terminated,'' he said. He added that the company's \n     investigation ``revealed no more than 21 instances over the \n     past five years where time shaving'' had occurred.\n       More than a dozen former Wal-Mart employees said time \n     records were altered in numerous ways. Some said that when \n     they clocked more than 40 hours a week, managers transferred \n     extra hours to the following week, to avoid paying overtime. \n     Federal law bars moving hours from one week to another.\n       Wal-Mart executives acknowledged that one common practice, \n     the ``one-minute clock-out,'' had cheated employees for \n     years. It involved workers who clocked our for lunch and \n     forgot to clock back in before finishing the day. In such \n     situations, many managers altered records to show such \n     workers clocking out for the day one minute after their lunch \n     breaks began--at 12:01 p.m., for example. That way a worker's \n     day was often three hours and one minute, instead of seven \n     hours.\n       Ms. Williams, the Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said Wal-Mart had \n     broadcast a video to store managers last April telling them \n     to halt all one-minute clock-outs. Under the new policy, when \n     workers fail to clock in after lunch, managers must do their \n     best to determine what their true workday was.\n       In interviews, five former Wal-Mart managers acknowledged \n     erasing time to cut costs. Victor Mitchell said that as an \n     assistant manager in Hazlehurst, Miss., in 1997, he \n     frequently shaved time.\n       ``We were told we can't have any overtime,'' he said. \n     ``It's what the other assistant managers were doing, and I \n     went along with it.''\n       Mr. Mitchell said the store's manager ordered them to stop. \n     But he said that in 2002, after becoming manager of a Wal-\n     Mart in Bogalusa, La., a new district ordered him to erase \n     overtime. He said he refused.\n       Ms. Williams said Wal-Mart had increased efforts to stop \n     managers from shaving time or allowing off-the-clock work.\n       Wal-Mart has circulated a ``payroll integrity'' memo, \n     saying that any worker, ``hourly or salaried, who knowingly \n     falsifies payroll records is subject to disciplinary action \n     up to an including termination.''\n       Employees at Wal-Mart and other companies complain that \n     they receive no paper time records, making it hard to \n     challenge management when their paychecks are inexplicably \n     low.\n       Ms. Danner, the former Family Dollar manager, praised the \n     system at the McDonald's restaurant she managed for seven \n     years. At day's end, she said, employees received a printout \n     detailing total hours worked and when they clocked in and \n     out.\n       ``We never had any problems like this at McDonald's,'' she \n     said.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I also ask unanimous consent that yesterday's article by \nBob Herbert be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 5, 2004]\n\n               We're More Productive. Who Gets the Money?\n\n                            (By Bob Herbert)\n\n       It's like running on a treadmill that keeps increasing its \n     speed. You have to go faster and faster just to stay in \n     place. Or, as a factory worker said many years ago, ``You can \n     work 'til you drop dead, but you won't get ahead.''\n       American workers have been remarkably productive in recent \n     years, but they are getting fewer and fewer of the benefits \n     of this increased productivity. While the economy, as \n     measured by the gross domestic product, has been strong for \n     some time now, ordinary workers have gotten little more than \n     the back of the hand from employers who have pocketed an \n     unprecedented share of the cash from this burst of economic \n     growth.\n       What is happening is nothing short of historic. The \n     American workers' share of the increase in national income \n     since November 2001, the end of the last recession, is the \n     lowest on record. Employers took the money and ran. This is \n     extraordinary, but very few people are talking about it, \n     which tells you something about the hold that corporate \n     interests have on the national conversation.\n       The situation is summed up in the long, unwieldy but very \n     revealing title of a new study from the Center for Labor \n     Market Studies at Northeastern University: ``The \n     Unprecedented Rising Tide of Corporate Profits and the \n     Simultaneous Ebbing of Labor Compensation--Gainers and Losers \n     from the National Economic Recovery in 2002 and 2003.''\n       Andrew Sum, the center's director and lead author of the \n     study said: ``This is the first time we've ever had a case \n     where two years into a recovery, corporate profits got a \n     larger share of the growth of national income than labor did. \n     Normally labor gets about 65 percent and corporate profits \n     about 15 to 18 percent. This time profits got 41 percent and \n     labor [meaning all forms of employee compensation, including \n     wages, benefits, salaries and the percentage of payroll taxes \n     paid by employers] got 38 percent.''\n       The study said: ``In no other recovery from a post-World \n     War II recession did corporate profits ever account for as \n     much as 20 percent of the growth in national income. And at \n     no time did corporate profits ever increase by a greater \n     amount than labor compensation.''\n       In other words, an awful lot of American workers have been \n     had. Fleeced. Taken to the cleaners.\n       The recent productivity gains have been widely \n     acknowledged. But workers are not being compensated for this. \n     During the past two years, increases in wages and benefits \n     have been very weak, or nonexistent. And despite the growth \n     of jobs in March that had the Bush crowd dancing in the White \n     House halls last Friday, there has been no net increase in \n     formal payroll employment since the end of the recession. We \n     have lost jobs. There are fewer payroll jobs now than there \n     were when the recession ended in November 2001.\n       So if employers were not hiring workers, and if they were \n     miserly when it came to increases in wages and benefits for \n     existing employees, what happened to all the money from the \n     strong economic growth?\n       The study is very clear on this point. The bulk of the \n     gains did not go to workers, ``but instead were used to boost \n     profits, lower prices, or increase C.E.O. compensation.''\n       This is a radical transformation of the way the bounty of \n     this country has been distributed since World War II. Workers \n     are being treated more and more like patrons in a rigged \n     casino. They can't win.\n       Corporate profits go up. The stock market goes up. \n     Executive compensation skyrockets. But workers, for the most \n     part, remain on the treadmill.\n       When you look at corporate profits versus employee \n     compensation in this recovery, and then compare that, as Mr. \n     Sum and his colleagues did, with the eight previous \n     recoveries since World War II, it's like turning a chart \n     upside down.\n       The study found that the amount of income growth devoured \n     by corporate profits in this recovery is ``historically \n     unprecedented,'' as is the ``low share . . . accruing to\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\n     the nation's workers in the form of labor compensation.''\n       I have to laugh when I hear conservatives complaining about \n     class warfare. They know this terrain better than anyone. \n     They launched the war. They're waging it. And they're winning \n     it.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the article went on to point out that Kim \nDanner used to manage a Family Dollar store with eight employees in \nMinneapolis. She says:\n\n     . . . her district manager urged her to erase hours so she \n     never paid overtime or exceeded her allotted payroll.\n\n  She said her employees could not do all of the unloading, stocking, \ncashier work, and pricing in the hours allotted, so she altered clock-\nout times and inserted half-hour lunch breaks, even when employees \nworked through lunch. She says:\n\n       I felt horrible that I was doing this. I felt pressured, \n     absolutely. If I refused, I would have been terminated \n     easily.\n\n  Instead of issuing new rules to officially eliminate overtime for \nmillions of Americans, the Department of Labor ought to be cracking \ndown on these unscrupulous companies. The Department of Labor ought to \nbe enforcing the overtime laws so American workers are not gouged and \ncheated out of their hard-earned pay.\n  Now we see clearly where the increased productivity is coming from. \nAmerican workers are working longer hours, they are working through \ntheir lunchtimes, but their hours are being shaved. Their time is taken \naway from them. Sometimes they clock out and they are made to come back \nto work. Rather than making an example of these companies and going \nafter them, the Department of Labor is coming around the other side and \nsaying, well, that may be illegal, but what we are going to do is make \nit legal to take away the overtime rights of up to 8 million workers. \nIn fact, even in the proposed rules, the Department offered employers \nhelpful tips on how to avoid paying overtime to the lowest paid \nworkers, the very workers, of course, supposedly helped by the new \nrules.\n  For example, the Department of Labor, in their own writing, suggests \ncutting a worker's hourly wage so any new overtime payments will not \nresult in a net gain to the employee. The Department of Labor also \nrecommends raising a worker's salary slightly to meet the threshold at \nwhich eligibility for time-and-a-half pay ends.\n  Again, American workers face a double-barreled threat to their \novertime rights. They face a threat from unscrupulous employers who \ndeny overtime illegally and now they face a threat from the Department \nof Labor which wants to deny overtime legally. But the result is the \nsame: an assault on the American worker's right to time-and-a-half pay \nfor hours worked in excess of 40 hours a week.\n  We are going to continue to try to offer this amendment and to try to \nget a vote on it. In Rollcall today there is an article saying ``Will \n`Obstructionist' Label Stick?'' Evidently, our majority leader last \nweek said: Obstruction, obstruction, obstruction--every bill. That is \naccording to Majority Leader Frist, at least according to the article \nin Rollcall.\n  I have the greatest respect for Senator Frist. He knows that. I like \nhim as a friend. But quite frankly, that will not wash. The first \nruling on FSC was in 2002.\n  Mr. President, I will continue my remarks later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the motion to proceed has been reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are now moving on to the issue of how we give the \nAmerican people better access to doctors, especially women who are \nhaving children, people who have experienced a traumatic event and have \ngone to the emergency room.\n  Regrettably, in our society today we are seeing a lot of highly \nqualified people in the medical professions--not only doctors, but \nnurse midwives and ambulance professionals, EMT professionals--giving \nup the practice which they love; in the case of an OB doctor, \ndelivering a baby, and in the case of emergency room personnel, \nespecially the doctor, trying to save lives--having given up those \nprofessions or significantly curtailed the extent to which they \npractice their profession because the cost of their liability insurance \ndue to lawsuits has gotten so high there is no way they can earn enough \nmoney to cover the premiums they have to pay to purchase the liability \ncoverage. Of course, there is no hospital in America today which allows \na doctor to practice unless that doctor has adequate liability \ncoverage.\n  This is a crisis. It is a crisis in a lot of States in this country. \nIt is soon to be a crisis in even more States. There are 19 States \nwhich the American Medical Association has identified as in crisis. \nThere is another group, I think 23, the American Medical Association \nhas said moving toward crisis. The red States on the chart are in \ncrisis and the yellow States are the States moving toward crisis. There \nare 11 States which are doing pretty good, which have their medical \nliability issues under control.\n  This bill attempts to create a national response to this problem so \nwomen who are having children or want to have children can see a \ndoctor. If you are in a car accident and you have a serious injury, or \nyou are walking down the road and you slip and fall and have a serious \ninjury, or you have any other type of physical injury and you go to \nyour emergency room, you will see a doctor who is capable of taking \ncare of you. That is what this bill tries to address.\n  The issue, of course, is these doctors want to deliver these \nservices. It is not as if they want to get out of the business or out \nof the activity for which they have trained all their lives, such as \ndelivering a baby. I have had meetings with doctors in my home State. I \nremember distinctly a doctor from Dover, a woman who loves to deliver \nbabies. This is what really excites her about being a doctor. It is why \nshe went to medical school. It is why she went to graduate school \nafterwards. But she has actually had to stop delivering babies. The \nonly babies she now delivers are members of her own family. She has to \nget special dispensation from the hospital to do that because as an OB/\nGYN she cannot afford the insurance necessary to cover her costs of \ndelivering those children.\n  We have regions in our State, and it is true in every State that has \nany sort of rural atmosphere, where we literally do not have any \ncoverage at all, where a woman in northern New Hampshire who has \ndecided to have a child has to drive 10 miles--10 would be \nconservative--20, 30, 40 miles or more in order to see an obstetric \ndoctor, in order to get care during her pregnancy.\n  It is darn dangerous in New Hampshire in the middle of the winter to \ndrive those miles, especially if you are pregnant or, Lord forbid, you \nhappen to actually be in labor. The local hospitals do not have doctors \non call, do not have doctors, period, who are willing to practice \ndelivering babies. So these women find themselves placed on the road in \norder to see a doctor.\n  This is true across the country in our urban areas. A lot of \nhospitals are finding it very hard to get coverage in their emergency \nrooms--emergency room closed. In Phoenix Memorial Hospital--emergency \nroom closed.\n\n  Why was it closed? It was closed because the doctors who covered the \nemergency room could not afford the cost of the insurance they had to \npay to meet the demands of the trial bar which has been suing the \ndoctors. They had to back out of the business or out of the activity of \ncovering the emergency room, so the emergency room got closed.\n  You talk to hospitals across this country, and they are finding it \nvery difficult to get doctors to do the call, to do their period where \nthey have to come in and do their coverage responsibilities because of \nthe fact the local doctors do not want to put at risk their insurance \npremiums as a result of going into the emergency room and practicing 1 \nday a week or 2 days a week, as has been the tradition.\n  I know in the town I grew up in, Nashua, NH, the medical community, \nthe physicians, would take turns. They would come on rotation into the \nemergency room and cover the emergency room. They were not all trauma \nspecialists, but that was sort of their responsibility as being part of \nthe medical community in the city of Nashua, and they were proud of it.\n  Today it is very hard to get doctors who are not trauma specialists \ninto the emergency room because of the fact\n\n[[Page S3746]]\n\nthese insurance premiums have gotten so out of control, and the trauma \nspecialists themselves cannot afford the premiums because it is a low-\npaying area of the medical profession. As a result, they cannot work \nlong enough hours; and they work outrageous hours already. There are \nnot enough hours in the day for them to work in order to cover the cost \nof their insurance. This is a crisis.\n  The same is true of baby doctors. I had a doctor in Laconia tell us--\nLaconia, NH; a great town on Lake Winnipesaukee. I hope everybody will \ngo up and visit this summer. It is a beautiful place to take your \nsummer vacation. He told us he has to work 5\\1/2\\ months of the year to \npay the premiums on his insurance because he delivers babies, and they \nare down to two doctors who do this in his area. That makes it \neconomically unviable for him to practice obstetrics. When it takes \n5\\1/2\\ months to pay your premiums and 6 months to pay your taxes, you \nonly have 2 weeks of the year you earn for yourself, and you still have \nto send your kids to college and maybe even buy your wife something for \nChristmas--you cannot do it--or your husband. A lot of the OB doctors \nare, obviously, women. So it is serious.\n  Yet we have in this institution tried time and again to raise the \nissue, and what has happened? We have been stonewalled by the other \nside. Why would the other side not even be willing to allow us to \nproceed to these bills? This is the third time we have tried this, to \nget to these bills to discuss how we are going to relieve the pressure \non doctors who deliver babies and doctors who take care of emergency \nrooms. We are not even expecting it necessarily to pass. We would like \nit to pass, but we at least want to be able to debate it. Yet time and \nagain the Democratic leadership of this institution has said: No, you \nare not even going to be allowed to proceed to the bill. That is what \nwe are trying to get to today with the motion to proceed. It is a \ntechnical motion, meaning it is a way to try to get the bill to the \nfloor so it is up for action.\n  I heard the Senator from Iowa out here railing about a rule at the \nLabor Department, and he cannot get his amendment up. Well, one of the \nreasons he cannot get his amendment up is because we cannot move to \nthis bill. If we could move to this bill, he could offer his amendment. \nSo why is he voting against moving to this bill? Because it appears he \nis more inclined to support the position of the trial lawyers, who are \nresisting, in a manner of extreme intensity, any action in this area to \ntry to improve the ability of doctors to deliver care, by making more \ndoctors available to women specifically, or more doctors available in \nthe emergency room, and who are resisting that so aggressively they \nhave told the leadership of the other side, the Democratic leadership: \nYou shall not, if you expect to continue to get our support--the trial \nlawyers' support--allow this bill to be debated on the floor of the \nSenate. You shall not allow a motion to proceed. So it is an ironic \nsituation, to say the least.\n\n  We hear the Members of the other side saying they want to offer \namendments, they want to get this issue up and that issue up. Yet they \nare filibustering a motion to proceed to a bill which, if we did \nproceed to it, would allow them to offer the exact amendments they \nclaim they cannot raise. But it appears there is a countervailing force \nhere which is, maybe they do not want to offer that amendment so much \nthey would affront the trial lawyers by allowing this bill to proceed. \nThat appears to be the case.\n  But in the end, who is the loser? Who is the loser? Well, the loser \nis, obviously, the doctors who cannot practice what they have been \ntrained to do. We are about to hear from one member of that profession \nwho is an extraordinary example of that profession in quality and \nability. And, secondly, the most important, the women, especially in \nrural areas, who cannot see a doctor if they are having a baby; and \npeople who walk into that emergency room under extreme stress and \ntrauma and suddenly find there is nobody there to take care of them.\n  Mr. President, I will reserve my further comments because I do see \nthe leader is on the floor. Of course, this is an issue which he has an \nintimate knowledge of and an intense desire to move forward. I \ncongratulate him for his efforts in this area, and thank him for making \nthis time available to us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will take a few moments to comment on a \nbill that deserves to be debated on this floor and brought to this \nfloor because, as the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire said, \nthe patients--not the doctors and not the system; all of them are \ndisadvantaged--but it is the patients who suffer.\n  When people hear of patients, they say: That is somebody in a \nhospital somewhere who is suffering. No, it is you and your children, \nand everybody who is listening to me. Who knows? You could be driving \nhome today from work, and you might have an accident and have to go to \nthe emergency room or the trauma room. Or after you pick up your kids \nfrom school--or maybe they are taking the bus home from school today--\nif they are struck by a car, or fall down and break a bone, they have \nto go to the emergency room. Or if you are one of the millions of women \nwho anticipate the joy of having a baby in the near future, it is you \nwho will suffer as you look for an obstetrician, as you look for an \nobstetrician who will be with you during that prenatal period or over \nthe whole 9-month period.\n  All of this comes down to a fundamental issue. Our medical litigation \nsystem is broken. It is failing. It is failing the American people. It \nis failing our communities. It is failing our hospitals. It is failing \nour doctors. It is failing our families. And, most importantly, it is \nfailing our patients.\n  The medical litigation system should be strong. Its purpose is to \npromote the common good, first and foremost; and, second, to improve \nhealth care for all Americans through the fair and efficient resolution \nof meritorious medical negligence claims. Indeed, those two purposes--\nto promote the common good and to improve health care through the fair \nand efficient resolution of meritorious medical negligence claims--are \nnoble goals.\n  But instead of achieving these noble goals, our litigation system is \nout of control and patients are being hurt. Due to this broken system \nof medical justice, medical liability premiums today are unnecessarily \nskyrocketing. You will hear the words ``skyrocketing'' and ``runaway'' \nbecause that is what is happening. The ultimate victims are the \npatients--the potential patients, the future patients--and that means \nall of us, our families and future generations.\n  The ultimate victims are patients who see their access to care--to \nthat obstetrician, to that emergency room, to that trauma center--\nthreatened and, in some cases, totally disappearing. The American \nMedical Association now lists 19 States where access to care is \nthreatened. The situation is a crisis that is getting worse day by day \nby day. That is why as majority leader, in terms of scheduling in the \nSenate, we are going to keep bringing this issue back because the \ncrisis is getting worse. If we are not successful, we will come back \nagain and again.\n  While the crisis does affect all people who will need or who need \nappropriate access to care, it affects those who are seeking help from \nspecialists in particular. When we say ``high-risk specialist \nphysicians,'' they are the ones who are responding to a trauma accident \nor the neurosurgeon who has to be highly trained to respond to a brain \ninjury, a contusion, a head injury. When we say ``high-risk medical \nspecialist,'' we mean the cardiac surgeon, a high-risk specialty \nphysician who is called in if trauma comes into an emergency room.\n  These patients who seek the high-risk medical specialist indeed are \namong the most sick and the ones who most desperately need urgent \nattention. But our litigation system is increasingly forcing these \nmedical specialists, such as neurosurgeons and obstetricians, to drop \ntheir services altogether and not do those higher risk responses; to \nlimit those services maybe to certain hours to not provide those \nservices; not to offer those services in the emergency setting but do \nthem in a much more controlled environment.\n  It is even causing these high-risk medical specialists to pick up \ntheir practices and move from one State,\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\nsay, from cities such as Philadelphia, where premiums are skyrocketing, \nto a city in California that has done a much better job and that is not \nin crisis because they have legislated appropriately in terms of \naddressing what was 20 years ago a crisis in California in medical \nliability. It causes these neurosurgeons and obstetricians--the two \nareas we are addressing in part with the legislation we are doing our \nbest to bring to the floor over the next 24 hours--to retire from the \npractice of medicine altogether. They are saying: It is too much, \n$400,000 as a neurosurgeon in some cities, just for liability premiums. \nI can't afford that. I am going to leave the whole practice of \nneurosurgery. It does not make sense for me anymore.\n  That is the reality today. It is a reality that is getting worse. And \nwhen we say it is a crisis, it is a crisis getting worse. And that \ndemands a response by this body. As the services these specialists \nprovide become harder and harder to find, who is hurt? Everybody, yes, \nbut the sickest and, indeed, the most vulnerable are the ones hurt the \nworst; again, demonstrating the perverse and unintended consequences of \na failing medical litigation system. That is why this week we are \nbringing to the floor this medical liability reform. It is for the \npatients.\n  The Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act focuses liability \nreform on two areas: Emergency and trauma care, and obstetrical \nservices, where the services are provided right before, during, and \nafter the delivery of babies. It is these two critical areas that are \nliterally under siege today because they rely on medical specialists \nwho are suffering the most from this lawsuit abuse.\n\n  Of course, the true victims are those who need to go to the emergency \nroom, as the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire said. It is not \nthe physicians themselves. It is the people who have to go to the \nemergency rooms and wait longer for a specialist to be called in \nbecause they are not in the hospital, or there is nobody in the region. \nIt is the expectant mother who is having difficulty even finding an \nobstetrician. And it is the stories that are increasingly occurring of \nonce you get an obstetrician, right after you become pregnant, that \nobstetrician leaves and moves and another obstetrician comes in, and \nmaybe that obstetrician stays a few months and then another \nobstetrician. So we have a huge medical problem. It is our \nresponsibility to respond.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I spent 20 years both training and \npracticing as a thoracic surgeon, a chest surgeon, which is heart, \nlungs, trachea--really everything between the diaphragm and the neck. \nThat is what I did. As a member of the thoracic surgical team at \nVanderbilt University Medical Center, we handled all of the trauma to \nthe chest, the lungs, the heart. That is what I did every day.\n  At that level I trauma center, which covered throughout the middle \nsection of Tennessee, if somebody came in with a knife wound to the \nchest, they would call Dr. Frist, and I would go down and repair the \nknife wound to the chest or to the heart, as a medical specialist. \nBased on that experience, I can tell you that emergency care and trauma \ncare is an absolutely necessary and critical component of our overall \nhealth care system.\n  Each year, there are 110 million visits to the emergency room, and 90 \npercent of these visits require urgent attention, emergency attention \nwithin 2 hours. These are emergencies. As I implied earlier, no one can \npredict when you are going to need that care. Driving home today, will \nyou be in an accident, or will your child fall down and break a bone \nclimbing a tree this afternoon? That is emergency care that you want a \nresponse to immediately.\n  The Alliance of Specialty Medicine has documented the important \ndetails of this critical care. Approximately 28 million Americans visit \nthe emergency room each year due to an accident. Ninety-nine percent \nwill recover after receiving care; in many cases, lifesaving care. Over \n3.5 million emergency room visits are related to bone fractures or to \nbroken bones. Of these, 888,000 require hospitalization, and delays in \ntreatment can result in loss of the use of that limb, amputation of \nthat limb, or indeed permanent disability. Over 1.5 million people \nsuffer traumatic head injury with damage to the brain itself.\n  Neurosurgeons, a focus in the legislation we are debating, perform \nover 36,000 emergency brain operations on head-injured patients each \nyear. They place little intracranial monitoring devices to control \nbrain swelling in another 8,000 patients each year. Trauma frequently \ninflicts damage to the spinal cord which runs through the body. Indeed, \nover 70,000 Americans are hospitalized because of spinal injuries each \nyear. Another 26,000 are hospitalized with acute or emergency or sudden \nneck injuries.\n  And, as we all know, nerve tissue heels in a very slow, different \nway. You cut off blood supply to the spinal cord or to the brain and \nthere is not an immediate response. That tissue pretty much dies \nforever; very slow recovery. Thus that time of response becomes \ncritical. Delay in treating any sort of injuries to the spinal cord can \ncause paresthesia or tingling, paralysis, can cause permanent \ndisability, and, of course, can cause death.\n  My own specialty was the chest and was cardiothoracic, \ncardiovascular, the heart itself. When you look at emergencies coming \nin because of heart attack or cardiovascular disease or stroke, the \nblood vessel is huge. Sixty-five million Americans have some form of \nheart and blood vessel, or cardiovascular disease, which could lead to \na heart attack or stroke; and each year over 1 million Americans suffer \na myocardial infarction, or a heart attack. You want to take them to \nthe emergency room because today, as cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, \nheart specialists--and it is very different today than 30 or 40 years \nago--there are medicines you can give and procedures you can do that \ncan open up the blood supply when you have a heart attack and get blood \nto the heart before the millions of cells die. Every moment counts. It \nis important to get that blood supply opened by heart specialists.\n  Unfortunately, our broken litigation system is stretching those \nmoments--if those specialists are not available to respond--into hours. \nIt is stretching them longer and longer, and that causes death of that \nheart muscle.\n  Of course, patients and most people listening today expect, if they \nhave an emergency and are going to be rushed to the emergency room, \nthat there will be people to treat them, including heart specialists \nwho can rush down and open the blood vessels; or if they have a brain \ninjury or a concussion or a contusion to the head, they expect there \nwill be somebody there to respond appropriately.\n  However, that assumption is getting to be less and less true, due in \nlarge part to our broken medical malpractice litigation system. Because \nof runaway medical malpractice costs, many medical specialists have \nbeen forced to stop treating patients in the emergency room--the \nneurosurgeons; the orthopedics, or bone surgeons; the heart and lung \nsurgeons; the obstetricians; the cardiologists; and the list goes on in \nterms of specialists we have to respond in the emergency room. They are \nsimply saying: I will practice my specialty, but I am not going to do \nit in the emergency setting. I will not sign up for what we call ``on-\ncall'' for the emergency room or for the trauma team because if I do, \nmy own insurance premiums will skyrocket, or I cannot get the insurance \nat all. So fewer and fewer specialists are volunteering for this ``on-\ncall'' in emergency rooms.\n  Because of the high-risk operations they are called upon to perform \nin these emergency situations, neurosurgeons, the specialty of the \nbrain and spine, have been particularly hit hard by the litigation \nprocess. According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons \nand the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, between the years 2000 and \n2004, that 4-year period, the national average, of medical liability \npremiums for neurosurgeons increased 100 percent. It literally \npractically doubled, from $45,915 up to $91,848.\n  As I mentioned a few minutes ago, in some States, neurosurgeons are \nnow paying insurance premiums of almost $400,000 per year. That is not \nthe cost of doing the medicine or delivering the care or of the \npractice or being in the operating room or paying the nurses to help \nyou or the cost of the equipment or the cost of the drugs or the cost \nof your training; that is just a tax of $400,000 placed on top of all \nthose expenses that the physicians pay to have\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\nthe opportunity to treat you if you come into the emergency room. It \ndoesn't make sense.\n  It is a crisis. It is getting worse. It should be no surprise that \nthis medical malpractice liability crisis is having a negative effect \non the way these much needed specialists practice medicine. In fact, a \nrecent survey--a fascinating survey--showed that 70 percent of \nneurosurgeons responding said they have had to make at least one of \nfive practice changes. So if 100 responded, 70 said they have had to do \none of these following things to narrow down or change their practice \nin response to the medical malpractice crisis: referred complex cases, \nclosed their practice, moved to a different state, stopped providing \npatient care or retired.\n\n  Runaway lawsuits are forcing neurosurgeons and other specialists to \nlimit emergency services. Again, it is not the doctor who is being \nhurt, it is the patients who are being hurt, and it is future patients, \nand that means potentially everybody listening to me now.\n  Many patients are rushed to these trauma centers. When I was on call \nat Vanderbilt Trauma Center as a thoracic surgeon, we had somebody \nactually in the hospital, or very close to the hospital, practically \nall the time. For heart disease, heart attacks, you need somebody there \nalmost all the time. Why is that? Because you have a golden hour, \nespecially for spinal disease and heart disease. Every second that goes \nby that you have the blood supply cut off, especially when you can open \nthat blood supply up, the patient is being hurt.\n  Unfortunately, patients are having to endure longer and longer waits \nas these precious lifesaving minutes tick by. If you have a broken \nbone, a gunshot wound, frequently you might be diverted from one \nfacility to another because of the lack of availability of a specialist \nor the resources in one of the hospitals. Then you have this frantic \nsearch of finding a needed specialist for that broken bone, or that \ngunshot wound to the heart, or that stab wound.\n  According to a recent study--because people say that could not be \nwhat is happening today, but it is what is happening--76 percent of \nemergency departments recently have diverted patients to another \nfacility because of a lack of specialty physician coverage. Of these, \nover 33 percent diverted patients 6 or more times a month, and an \nadditional 28 percent have diverted patients to other facilities 3 to 5 \ntimes a month. Over a quarter of hospitals report that the reason they \nhave lost specialty coverage is because of medical liability concerns. \nThese concerns simply discourage specialists from offering their \nservices or volunteering their services for this on-call emergency \ncoverage.\n  The medical litigation crisis is affecting health care, patient care, \nall across the country. The consequences are obvious--the consequences \nof death. Here is an example. According to the Palm Beach Post, a \nFlorida woman, Mildred McRoy, suffered a hemorrhagic stroke in \nFebruary. That is where you actually bleed into the brain itself, and \nbecause the skull is a fixed cavity, when you bleed into the brain, it \nswells and it requires an emergency response. She was rushed to JFK \nMedical Center in Atlantis for treatment, but JFK stopped providing \naround-the-clock neurosurgical coverage in July because of the medical \nliability crisis. In fact, there wasn't a single neurosurgeon on call \nin all of Palm Beach County when this occurred. Again, that shows how \npervasive the impact is if you don't have specialists signing up \nbecause of high medical liability premiums. Ms. McRoy was then \ntransported 40 miles away to North Broward Medical Center. More than 8 \nhours later she was operated on by a neurosurgeon but died after being \nin a coma for several days.\n  That is the story. That is why we must act. We know there is a \nproblem, a crisis, and we know the crisis is getting worse. We know it \nis going to take action on this floor to reverse it. Florida is one of \nthe 19 States the AMA considers in crisis.\n  In a few cases, trauma centers and emergency rooms have been actually \nforced to shut down--as we saw on the chart that was behind me a while \nago, which the Senator from New Hampshire had shown--because either the \nemergency department physicians or the on-call specialists could not \nobtain medical liability insurance at any price whatsoever. The most \ninfamous example occurred in the summer of 2002 when Las Vegas lost its \nonly level I trauma center. When I use that term, level I, that is the \nhighest level. They can take anything that comes. Level I is the most \nsophisticated, most prepared, most responsive level of trauma center \nthat we have. Las Vegas lost their level I trauma center which, by the \nway, was one of the 10 most busiest in the country for several days, \nforcing residents from that major city of Las Vegas to travel over 100 \nmiles to seek urgent care.\n\n  For me as a physician who has gone through 4 years of medical school \nand 8 years of medical training, what is sad and tragic is we are not \ngetting rid of a few bad doctors. Right now we have highly qualified, \nhighly committed physicians, women and men, who have chosen to dedicate \ntheir lives to helping their fellow man--really mankind, humanity \nbroadly--through neurosurgery or obstetrics or heart surgery, and we \nare literally forcing them to leave the field they cherish, that they \nspent years working to become so they can help other people. These are \npeople who are devoting their professional lives to healing others, and \nwe are saying because of this medical litigation system, which is out \nof control: You are no longer going to be able to do that.\n  They do not want to drop these specialized services. They do not want \nto make themselves unavailable for emergency care. Indeed, that is why \nthey got into the business. Tragically, and all too often, the medical \nlitigation system, with these skyrocketing, out-of-control costs simply \nleaves them no choice. In the end, our health care system suffers, but \nit is the patients who really suffer.\n  The story is the same for obstetricians. Right now we know women are \nhaving a harder time finding an obstetrician. As I said earlier, one \nmight have two or three obstetricians over one pregnancy period today \nbecause obstetricians are having to move. A few weeks ago, we brought \nthe Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act to the floor \nof the Senate. That bill specifically addressed the medical liability \nchallenges we have focusing on OB/GYNs and women and the babies they \nserve. We did that because all across the country, indeed in my home \nState of Tennessee, the current medical litigation system is forcing \nmany OB/GYNs to simply stop delivering babies.\n  Floor discussions at that time several weeks ago demonstrated the \ncrisis. It showed the extent of the crisis. There is no reason at this \njuncture to restate all of the arguments, but the doctor drain has \ngotten so bad that it is clear that women are having a harder time \nfinding doctors to give them prenatal care and to deliver their babies.\n  What happened several weeks ago? Unfortunately, opponents to this \nneeded medical liability reform filibustered the mere consideration of \nthe bill on the floor of the Senate. We simply cannot allow people to \nkeep their heads in the sand any longer. The crisis is real. It is time \nfor us to act.\n  The crisis is getting worse every day. As a physician and as a \npolicymaker, as someone who has had the opportunity, a real blessing, \nto take care of patients in the setting of trauma, the emergency room, \nand responding to their needs, I am simply not, as majority leader, \ngoing to sit back and allow this crisis to continue to explode.\n  The legislation itself we are considering, the Pregnancy and Trauma \nCare Access Protection Act, addresses these two areas--delivering \nbabies and responding to emergency care. Why? Because these areas have \nbeen hit the hardest. It is common sense in medical litigation reform \nthat will protect our patients, our families from medical negligence \nwith fair compensation. If somebody has been negligently injured, they \ndeserve just and fair compensation. If there are bad doctors, they need \nto be punished accordingly.\n  The problem is the overall system is broken. The overall system has \nthese frivolous lawsuits with these runaway costs. The legislation is \nbased on sound models that have worked in States, that have a \ndemonstrated track record, such as California. It is supported by \nnumerous medical specialty societies and speciality groups. The \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Association of \nNeurological Surgeons, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons all \nsupport this legislation and, of course, the list goes on.\n\n  I hope opponents of reform do not make excuses. They seem to put the \nblame of the crisis everywhere except where it belongs--our medical \nlitigation system. It is time to face that simple fact that we need to \nreform our medical litigation system. It is in desperate need of \nreform. It is hurting all patients. It is hurting our vulnerable \npatients the most.\n  In addition, I should add that all of this has a huge, unnecessary \ncost in the practice of defensive medicine, the reaction of our medical \nsystem to frivolous lawsuits. These are your health care dollars that \nare being wasted. These are your health care dollars that are taken \nfrom you and not being channeled back into better health care for you.\n  Congress should act now. I am very hopeful we will be allowed to act \nnow by putting patients first rather than the special interests who \nhave been so vocal in obstructing this bill.\n  For the sake of all Americans who will be forced to go to the \nemergency room this year and for the sake of all expectant mothers, I \nask my colleagues to allow this debate to move forward tomorrow by \nvoting to proceed to this critical medical litigation reform bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors of S. 2207, the Pregnancy and Trauma \nCare Access Protection Act: Senator Fitzgerald, Senator Cornyn, and \nSenator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  I wish to express my gratitude to the majority leader for his \nimportant comments. He brings an expertise to this debate no one else \nin this body can offer by virtue of his training, education, and \nextensive practice as a medical doctor in Tennessee. I am not going to \nspeak from the perspective of a doctor because I am not one. I am going \nto speak from the perspective of a patient because, like it or not, I \nwill be one at some point in my life, and from the standpoint of other \nprospective patients which would include not only my family and loved \nones, but literally everyone within the sound of my voice.\n  I want to express again my appreciation that the majority leader \nwould bring this issue back up. This is our third attempt in recent \nmonths to enact significant medical liability reform. The reason why it \nis so important to bring this issue back up is to ask our colleagues \nacross the aisle who have obstructed our ability to go to a vote on \nthis important issue to reconsider because the truth is their \nobstruction of our ability to get meaningful medical liability reform \nis not hurting doctors only, it is not hurting insurance companies \nonly, it is hurting everyone who has been or will be a patient in a \nmedical care facility or at the hands of a doctor.\n  We have had the opportunity to discuss these issues before, as I \nsaid, but before I get into what I consider the meat of this issue--and \nthat is access to good quality health care for all Americans--let me \nsay on other issues that affect American competitiveness in terms of \nour ability to compete in a global economy, the ability of employers to \nprovide health insurance for their employees, which is diminishing day \nby day because the costs of health care continue to go up in part \nbecause of our broken medical liability system, that, in turn, puts \npressure on the uninsured in our society. Where employers are unable to \ncarry medical insurance on their employees, that means that too many \npeople who cannot afford health care coverage are forced to emergency \nrooms where they know they can and will be treated. In the vast \nmajority of those cases, they could be more efficiently, more humanely, \nand more cost-effectively treated in a primary care setting in a \ndoctor's office or in a clinic, but because of the pressures being put \non our health care system by a broken liability component, it is \nhurting us in so many different ways.\n\n  As I said, I want to talk about access, but it also hurts us in terms \nof our global competitiveness, in terms of job creation and job growth, \nand in terms of diminished access to health care because people have \nnowhere else to turn if they do not have medical insurance, except the \nemergency room where they know they can and will be treated but in a \nway that is insufficient, inhumane, and certainly not cost effective \nand causes a host of other problems in all of our big cities and \neverywhere else where emergency rooms are frequently put on divert \nstatus because they are so clogged up with cases that probably, in a \nmedical sense, should not be there because they could be treated more \ncost effectively and more humanely in another setting, but they are \nthere and then the true emergencies are diverted to emergency rooms \nthat are farther away.\n  The majority leader, Dr. Frist, talked about the medical consequences \nof delayed treatment when people have to travel sometimes many miles \njust to get treated, what complications can occur because of a \ntraumatic injury or because a baby that is delivered because the mother \ncannot find a hospital that can take her nearby. My point is, it \ncreates a cascading of problems that are not just limited to medical \nliability but which have a lot of ramifications and a huge ripple \neffect.\n  Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \noffering no solutions but are merely trying to score political points, \ntrying to divert the attention to other nonissues and will not allow us \nto do what we have been sent here by the American people to do and that \nis to pass legislation that will meaningfully and significantly improve \nthe quality of their lives.\n  We have had a chance to deal with this medical liability problem \nbefore and, unfortunately, we have not done so. My hope is that our \ncolleagues will reconsider and we will do so today. If those on the \nother side of the aisle are truly serious about their concern for the \nAmerican people and the quality of health care they receive, I hope \nthey will join us in passing the bill we are discussing today.\n  The solutions to their professed concerns are right before us. They \njust need to allow an up-or-down vote. I hope the American people are \npaying close attention to what is happening, because if we do not get \nan up-or-down vote it is they who will pay the price for those who \nwould prefer to score political points over actually producing results.\n  The bill offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, the distinguished \nchairman of the HELP Committee, the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, is designed to improve access to health care, both \nfor women who need obstetrical and gynecological care and for patients \nwho need emergency care.\n  As I am sure every Member of this body has, I have heard complaints \nfrom our constituents about how badly the system is broken.\n  There are those on the other side of the aisle who would say that, \nbecause we have been rejected twice before, by bringing it up a third \ntime this is somehow just a political exercise. I assure them that is \nnot true. We were not allowed to vote before, despite support from a \nbipartisan majority.\n  The bottom line is, we are simply unwilling to put up with or to \naccept, without a fight, the kind of obstruction we have seen on this \nand so many other important issues.\n  This bill would provide desperately needed relief to a health care \nsystem that is in crisis, focusing especially on emergency room doctors \nand obstetrics, baby doctors, to critical areas that deserve our \nsupport.\n  This chart has been seen before, and my colleagues will notice that \nthis chart reflects in red States that are in crisis because of the \ndifficulty of purchasing medical liability insurance, the huge \nincreases in cost which have simply caused medical doctors either to \nretire early or to move to States that have provided some commonsense \nreform or just discouraging people from getting into the medical \nprofession at all.\n  The States in red, including my State of Texas, are indicated as \nStates in crisis. The ones in yellow are the States showing problem \nsigns but do not yet qualify as a crisis State, and\n\n[[Page S3750]]\n\nthe ones in white are States that are currently considered to be OK. I \nwould not suggest by saying that they are currently OK that they have \nno problems. It is just that they have not gotten to the point that \nconditions have in my State and other States indicated in red.\n  The truth is, this crisis is not something that just popped up this \nweek. It is a crisis that we had last fall when we were blocked from \nbringing up comprehensive medical liability reform for an up-or-down \nvote. It was a crisis that existed a month ago when we were blocked \nfrom having an up-or-down vote for legislation that offered immediate \nhelp for mothers and their babies, and it remains a crisis today even \nas we attempt to debate this legislation and bring it up for another \nvote.\n  The fact is, frivolous lawsuits are causing escalating medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums which are driving doctors out of \npractice. We can debate what the cause of that is, but we cannot debate \nthe result. It is a fact. Indeed, opponents of this legislation do not \nappear to debate the fact of the result--that is, doctors leaving, \nretiring, not going into practice, access being denied. They just want \nto say there may be other causes, but they do not want to deal with \nthis cause because, unfortunately, an important constituency, the \npersonal injury trial lawyers, simply are unwilling to agree that any \nchange in this current broken system can be made.\n  The problem is that those who are preventing us from taking up this \nlegislation are simply caving in to the demands of this narrow special \ninterest group that are prospering mightily, that are getting rich off \nthe current system, at the same time that the rest of America is \ngetting hurt.\n  This is a picture of a doctor formerly who practiced in Fort Worth, \nTX, representing medical specialists, especially neurosurgeons, \northopedic surgeons, obstetricians, and emergency physicians, who are \nbeing forced to retire early or move their practices to States where \neffective liability reforms are in place.\n  For example, Dr. Malone comes from my home State. He is an orthopedic \nsurgeon who has practiced more than 20 years in Fort Worth, TX. He \nreluctantly was forced to leave his practice, citing the extreme costs \nof liability insurance for physicians as being too much of a financial \nburden for him to bear.\n  We simply cannot expect physicians to practice their chosen \nprofession after their lengthy education and training and not be able \nto provide for their families. We don't expect them to do it at a loss \nto themselves and their families. I don't think we can blame them, when \nthe costs of doing business exceed what comes in the door such that \nthey simply have no choice but to leave.\n\n  In the State of Texas, this crisis, particularly as it regards baby \ndoctors, obstetrician-gynecologists, means that out of 254 counties of \nTexas, 154 of them have no OB/GYN specialist. In other words, a woman \nwho is pregnant and perhaps needs prenatal care, so increasing the \nchances her baby will be delivered healthy, must travel to another \ncounty in order to get that prenatal care from a specialist; or once \nshe goes into labor, she must travel to another county to have the \ndoctor, medical specialist in obstetrics, deliver that baby. This means \nalmost 6 out of the 10 counties in my home State alone have no doctor \nspecializing in obstetrics, representing approximately 2 million Texans \nin my State.\n  Let me talk about another story, another case that is worth referring \nto also in my State. Just last year a pregnant woman showed up at Dr. \nLloyd Van Winkle's Castroville office in south Texas. She showed up in \nDr. Van Winkle's Castroville office less than 10 minutes from delivery \nof her baby. Her family doctor in Uvalde, another Texas town, had \nrecently stopped delivering babies altogether, citing medical liability \nconcerns, and this pregnant woman was trying to drive the 80 miles to \nher San Antonio doctor from her home in Uvalde.\n  Let me give another story about a woman by the name of Denise Payne. \nDenise Payne walked into an emergency room recently. The doctors there \ndid not want to treat her. She said, ``They didn't want to touch me \nbecause I was pregnant,'' this 38-year-old pregnant woman, who was 6 \nweeks along in her pregnancy at that time.\n  Luckily for Denise Payne the delay getting treatment didn't kill her. \nAlthough she couldn't get a kidney biopsy in Corpus Christi on the gulf \ncoast of Texas, she was able to get one about 150 miles away in San \nAntonio, but she doesn't blame the doctors. ``I would say it's because \nof all the lawyers scaring the doctors,'' she said. ``They are scared \nto death to treat you.''\n  Indeed, that reminds me of other situations where I have heard \ndoctors, concerned about their patients, but saying because of the \nbroken liability system, every time you walk into an examining room, \nevery time you walk into the emergency room, every time you walk into \nthe delivery room, you are putting at risk everything that you have \nworked a lifetime to build for yourself and your family. Physicians and \nothers are simply not able to put up with it, resulting in a crisis \nthat even Ms. Payne, who no doubt was frustrated by her inability to \nget doctors to treat her in Corpus Christi, had to drive 150 miles away \nto get treated because she was pregnant and she needed a kidney biopsy. \nBut because she was a higher risk patient who is at a higher risk of \nmedical complications but also a higher risk of litigation, the doctors \nwere scared to death to treat her, so she had to travel a long way to \nget that treatment.\n  These stories are not unique to Texas. Let me tell you about Linda \nSallard of Arizona. At 2 a.m. on the morning of March 20, 2002, 22-\nyear-old Melinda Sallard woke up with labor pains. She and her husband \nhopped into their car and started driving the 45 miles to Sierra Vista, \nwhich housed the only hospital within a 6000-square-mile area with \nobstetricians able to deliver babies. En route, they passed the Copper \nQueen Community Hospital, which was forced to close its maternity unit \njust 2 months earlier because all the practitioners able to deliver \nbabies had lost their medical liability coverage.\n  Just 3 miles past Copper Queen, which is where they had a hospital \nthat could have delivered her baby but had since closed its delivery \nfacilities because of medical liability concerns, just 3 miles past \nthis hospital, while her husband continued to drive their car, Melinda \ndelivered her own baby girl, who you can see here in this picture in \nher lap. She gave birth on a desert highway to her daughter, Susanna. \nWhile Susanna, as you can tell from this picture, looks healthy and \nthriving today, when she was born she was not breathing. So Melinda, \nafter she had the baby by herself, unassisted, without a physician--\nbecause she couldn't get to a hospital that had obstetrical services in \ntime--Melinda, after she had her baby, cleared the baby's breathing \npassage and started CPR. Fortunately, the baby started breathing and \nMelinda wrapped her newborn in a sweater and held her to her chest as \nher husband drove them all the way to Sierra Vista Hospital, where the \nER staff cut the umbilical cord in the parking lot.\n\n  As a result of the medical liability crisis, Sierra Vista is now the \nonly hospital in a county of 140,000 residents that actually delivers \nbabies. All high-risk patients are sent to Tucson, an hour and a half \naway, in a neighboring county. I shudder to think what could have \nhappened in Melinda's case. Thankfully, as I said, Susanna Sallard is a \nhealthy young girl--no thanks to a medical liability system that almost \nleft her as a casualty.\n  The skyrocketing liability insurance premiums have also affected \nemergency and trauma services for patients. This is where the severity \nof the crisis becomes even more apparent.\n  Let me tell you about Jim Lawson. This is a picture of Jim Lawson, \nMary Rasar's father. Mary lost her father in 2002 when Nevada's only \nlevel I trauma center was forced to close because of skyrocketing \nmedical liability costs. The majority leader, Dr. Frist, told us \nearlier that level I trauma centers are the ones that handle the most \nserious trauma cases. But Nevada's only level I trauma center was \nforced to close in 2002 because of skyrocketing medical liability \ncosts.\n  Jim Lawson was injured in a car accident in Las Vegas, where he \nsuffered multiple injuries and required immediate care. The State's \nonly level I trauma center, the University of Nevada's medical center, \nwhere Mr.\n\n[[Page S3751]]\n\nLawson should have been taken, was forced to shut its doors just days \nbefore this accident because rising liability costs had forced insurers \nto drop coverage on high-risk specialists, high-risk specialists like \nneurosurgeons, like emergency room physicians, and others who handle \nthe most seriously injured patients.\n  Unfortunately, as I indicated at the outset, this story does not have \na happy ending. Mr. Lawson was rushed to Desert Springs Hospital, where \nhe died while awaiting air transport to the next nearest level I trauma \ncenter facility, more than an hour away, at Salt Lake City, UT. So this \ngentleman, who was in a car accident in Las Vegas, who could have been \ntreated at the University of Nevada's medical center but for the fact \nit had to shut down because it lost its medical liability coverage, \ndied because the only facility that could treat him was more than an \nhour away in Salt Lake City.\n  Let me tell you about Leanne and Tony Dyess. Leanne is a 48-year-old \nwife and mother of two from Mississippi. This is Leanne and her family. \nOn July 5, 2002, Leanne's husband Tony was involved in a car accident \nin Gulf Port, MS, and suffered serious head injuries. After removing \nhim from the car, paramedics rushed Tony to Garden Park Hospital in \nGulfport, MS. But there were no neurosurgeons there available to treat \nTony because rising medical liability costs forced doctors in that \ncommunity to abandon their practice. Six critical hours passed before \nTony could be airlifted to University Medical Center. As a result of \nthe inability to locate a specialist to provide him immediate care, \ntoday Tony is permanently brain damaged, mentally incompetent, and \nunable to care for himself or his children.\n\n  In addition to this tragedy and the others I have mentioned, there \nare numerous other examples from my home State of Texas of tragedies, \nor near tragedies, or worse than injuries as a result of the inability \nto get medical care close by because of this crisis.\n  Another couple of stories: George Kuempe, who recently retired as a \nreporter for the Dallas Morning News not too long ago, fell from an oak \ntree and broke his back on a Sunday afternoon in the Austin area. He \nhad to be flown to Scott & White Clinic in Temple, TX, because there \nwere no neurosurgeons available in Austin, TX. There was a long delay \nin the amount of time necessary to treat his injuries in order to \ntravel just 60 miles up the road. There were hours of delay. Dr. Path \nCrocker, chief of emergency medicine at Brackenridge Hospital in \nAustin, where he could have been and should have been treated had a \nneurosurgeon been available, said this is a warning flag to the \ncitizens of Texas that a major problem is brewing.\n  In 2002, an elderly man was taken to an emergency hospital room in \nMcAllen, TX, in south Texas in the Rio Grand Valley after falling and \ninjuring his head. After 7 hours, the emergency room could still not \nlocate a neurosurgeon to treat this elderly man's head injury, even \nthough they searched in Corpus Christi, in San Antonio, and Austin. \nUnfortunately, this elderly man, with a head injury, died because he \ncould not get timely medical treatment for that condition.\n  There are even more stories that illustrate the lengths to which \npatients must go just to receive desperately needed care.\n  Neurosurgeons in Houston, TX, are bombarded with trauma and emergency \ncases from around the State because doctors have dropped emergency \nservices in efforts to lower their professional liability premiums just \nso they can earn a living.\n  You can see Houston, TX, located in the southeast part of our State \nwhere patients, let us say, down in the Rio Grand Valley--this shows \nHarlingen, a distance of 330 miles, which is close to McAllen where \nthat elderly man had a head injury and where he would have to be \nairlifted to Houston to receive those treatments by a qualified \nneurosurgeon or other specialist. The time it takes to travel 330 miles \nfrom the Rio Grand Valley to Houston, the time it takes to travel from \nthe Rio Grand Valley to San Antonio, or San Antonio to Houston, or El \nPaso to Houston, obviously, has medical consequences which means people \nwho are injured and suffer more serious injuries and people whose lives \ncould have been saved lose their lives because of this medical \nliability crisis with which our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle simply refuse to deal.\n  Houston neurosurgeon Bruce Ehni described it like this. He said:\n\n       We are the recipient of much more serious and risky cases \n     that would have otherwise been cared for locally. Here at our \n     hospital in Houston we are receiving hemorrhages, traumas \n     and other dire emergencies from as far away as El Paso on \n     the opposite side of the State, and Brownsville, which is \n     down near Harlingen in the southern part of the State--\n     sometimes up to 600 miles or more away.\n\n  Some of the examples include a patient with head trauma and a blown \npupil flown in from Harlingen to Houston, more than 300 miles away; an \nintracranial hemorrhage flown in from Laredo on the United States-\nMexico border 300 miles away; and a brain tumor causing an abrupt \nparalysis flown in from San Antonio, 200 miles away.\n  Dr. Ehni continued:\n\n       All of these communities have neurosurgeons. The ``bad'' \n     cases end up in Houston despite the presence of neurosurgeons \n     locally because everyone is trying to avoid being sued. It is \n     bad for patients and it is bad for us. We are being dumped on \n     endlessly.\n\n  For the rest of this body, and perhaps others listening, let me put \nall of this in perspective geographically. For a medical transfer from \nEl Paso to Houston, it would be as if a patient was hurt in Washington, \nDC, and because he could not find a surgeon, he had to be flown farther \nthan Chicago, IL, for surgery. For a transfer from Harlingen to \nHouston, it would be like forcing a patient to fly from Washington \nalmost to Buffalo, NY. For a transfer from San Antonio to Houston, it \nis as if a patient were forced to fly from Washington to New York City.\n  Can anyone in this body state they would be content to have their \nfamily or loved one suffer those sorts of delays in treatment if they \nreally needed a medical specialist and couldn't find one? Of course, \nthey wouldn't accept that. Neither should the American people. But that \nis what they are being forced to do because of the inaction and \nobstruction of those on the other side of the aisle who will not allow \nus to have a true debate and an up-or-down vote on this reform to our \nbroken medical liability system.\n  The chief obstacle to making our health care system the best in the \nworld is our liability lottery. In the liability lottery, people aren't \nfree to act because doctors simply can't meet the demand, and Americans \nend up paying more for health care and suffering medical complications \nbecause of it.\n  It is not all bad news, I must say. I am glad to say, in response to \nmany of the concerns which I have raised that pertain to my State of \nTexas, the legislature and the people of my State have acted. Last \nSeptember voters took to the ballot and passed Proposition 12, an \namendment to the Texas Constitution providing caps on noneconomic \ndamages and paving the way for the full implementation of important \nmedical liability reform.\n  We already have, even though this passed just last September, some of \nthe early signs of beneficial results. One medical liability insurance \ncarrier has reduced their medical liability premiums by 12 percent, and \nanother medical liability insurance company has canceled their planned \n19-percent rate increase because of these reforms.\n  My home State of Texas recognizes the need for government to step in \nand help address this urgent problem. But more needs to be done, and \nthere is still too little recourse for patients in States without \nreform.\n  Let me mention briefly some of those States. In Illinois, more than \n15 percent of the neurosurgeons have left the State in the last 2 \nyears. That is according to the American Association of Neurological \nSurgeons. There are currently no hospitals in the northwest suburbs of \nChicago that have 24/7 neurosurgery coverage. Most patients in need of \ncare are transferred either to Rockford, which is 60 miles away, or to \nthe University of Illinois in Chicago, 45 miles away--not quite the \ndistances we talked about in my State but still nevertheless \nconsequential distances in terms of the delay in treatment of serious \ncases.\n  In the State of Massachusetts, the home State of Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Kerry, a third of the State's hospital beds have closed in the \npast\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\ndecade, and 32 percent of physicians say they plan to leave the State \nif the practice environment fails to improve. In the 1990s in \nMassachusetts the number of practicing obstetrician/gynecologists \ndeclined by more than 20 percent. In New York, record numbers of people \nseeking emergency care are overwhelming emergency departments across \nthe State in areas including Long Island, Syracuse, Rochester, and \nBuffalo. Many doctors and higher risk specialties are eliminating \nservices, retiring early, or contemplating leaving. The exodus of 4,000 \ndoctors in New York alone from 2000 to 2002 has been attributed to a \nlitigious atmosphere in that State.\n  In North Carolina, in 2002 alone, medical liability rates increased \nby 50 percent and high-risk specialists are facing increases between 50 \npercent and 100 percent. Physicians are simply going out of business, \nleaving a State, or substantially increasing prices as they pass along \ncosts, as they can, to their patients. But the problem is especially \nacute for obstetricians, neurosurgeons, and emergency physicians.\n  Finally, the last State I will mention is the State of Washington. \nSince 1998, Washington State has seen a 31-percent increase in its \nphysicians moving out of the State, and between 1996 and 2001 the \nnumber of retirements increased 50 percent with the average age of \nthose retirees dropping from age 63 to age 58.\n  We know this liability reform can have a beneficial impact on \nreducing costs and improving access because some States have done it \nfor a while. My State has done it since September and has not yet seen \nthe full benefit although we have seen some very hopeful early signs. \nCalifornia has adopted something called MICRA, which has been the \nmedical liability tort reform package. With MICRA, California has \nachieved a more stable marketplace and lower premium increases over the \nyears than have other States without the kind of medical liability \nreform we are advocating today. According to the data, California \nmedical liability premiums grew 167 percent over the past 25 years \ncompared to 505 percent for States without medical liability reform.\n  I have taken more time than perhaps I should, but I thought it was \nimportant to go over in detail what the problem is, what we think the \nsolution may be, at least in part, and demonstrate for our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, if they would allow an up-or-down vote \non this legislation, we could see some very real, substantial benefits, \nnot just to physicians.\n  I like physicians. I respect physicians. But this is not something we \nought to do to help members of the medical profession. The reason we \nought to do it is to help patients. Like it or not, all of us will be \npatients at some future point in our lives. The best way we can ensure \nthe good quality health care is available for us and our loved ones, \nshould we need it in the future, is to pass this meaningful reform.\n  I ask our colleagues to seriously reconsider and not to obstruct this \nimportant reform. We know it can help. If they have other ideas they \nthink will add to the substantial beneficial effect of this \nlegislation, let them come to the floor and talk about it. We will be \nwilling to talk to them and engage them on it. If a consensus develops \nthat an even better package can be produced as a result of the kind of \ndebate and negotiations and compromise that characterize this body and \nwhich this body is so good at when it works properly, I say, bring it \non.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Nation's medical \nlitigation crisis. I begin by explaining where we are in this process. \nIt is the right of the majority leader to bring a bill up for debate. \nOn the Senate side, it requires unanimous consent to have that debate. \nWe have been denied unanimous consent to debate the medical litigation \nsolution.\n  What are the options? We can have a cloture vote. We will have that \ntomorrow afternoon. The cloture vote requires 60 votes of approval in \norder to debate the medical litigation crisis solution. On most of the \nbills we see brought up, the unanimous consent is almost automatic. \nHowever, on this particular bill, we are not even able to debate the \nbill. We can debate it, but it has no effect. There can be no \namendments. There can be no votes until the filibuster is broken.\n  What happens when the filibuster is broken? Technically there can be \n30 hours of debate on that particular right to debate before the actual \ndebate begins. Then when we actually do get to the debate, every single \namendment can be filibustered and the bill can be filibustered. \nSupposing we make it past those roadblocks and the House passes the \nbill and there are differences between the two, there has to be a \nconference committee. At that point, there can be three more \nfilibusters.\n  Our Founding Fathers intended for the Senate to be the cooling saucer \nfor legislation. I don't think they intended it to become a stagnant \npond. I do think they intended the bills would be debated and \nconclusions reached, there would be some time taken, but not all time \ntaken.\n  We have a medical litigation crisis in this country. The system is \nbroken. We need to start working to fix it. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for cloture on the Gregg-Ensign bill. It is time to stop \nfilibustering and to start working. We should not be having this \nfilibuster on whether to debate. We need to pass the motion to proceed \nand get into amendments on the bill if amendments are needed.\n  This is the third time in this Congress we have brought a medical \nlitigation reform bill to the Senate. We need to pass this legislation. \nWe need to pass some legislation that deals with this crisis. Passing \nthis bill would be the best thing we can do to stabilize medical \nliability premiums in the short term, which will allow us to retain \ndoctors in states like Wyoming, which will allow people to have access \nto doctors.\n  I proposed legislation aimed at solving this problem over the long \nterm and I will speak to that later. But right now, we need to vote in \nfavor of ending this filibuster against this bill so we can begin to \ndebate the bill. I am willing to consider any amendments my colleagues \nin the minority might have, but we cannot consider any of their \namendments until they agree to end this filibuster and begin debate on \nthe bill.\n  I understand some Senators are concerned this bill would limit the \nability of an injured patient to get fair compensation. This bill would \ndo no such thing. This bill will not limit the ability of an injured \npatient to get fair compensation. This bill would permit full and fair \ncompensation to patients for their economic losses. This is an \nimportant point for everyone to keep in mind. If a judge and jury were \nto decide a person suffered an injury due to a doctor's mistake or a \nhospital's negligence, that person would still be entitled, under this \nbill, to receive full compensation for their economic loss, including \neverything from rehabilitation to lost wages resulting from their \ninjury.\n  I cannot stress this point strongly enough. This bill would not limit \nawards for economic losses. What the bill would do is place a ceiling \non noneconomic damages. The bill would limit the maximum award for \nnoneconomic damages to $250,000 in States that do not have their own \nlimits on such awards. Noneconomic damages are those for pain and \nsuffering.\n  I want to ask, How much pain and suffering do you have if you cannot \neven see a doctor? And if you cannot see a doctor, and you die, who do \nyou sue? The trial lawyers? Maybe so. They are a part of the problem. I \nam not going to try to cover all of the parts of the problem. We are \ntrying to fix one specific part of the problem. This bill will not take \ncare of the whole thing.\n  But I want to ask you, How much pain and suffering do you have if you \ncannot even see a doctor? This is not primarily a city problem. You can \nhave the problem in the city, and doctors are leaving cities as well. \nBut in cities it gets glossed over a bit because there are so many \ndoctors. There are so many doctors everybody anticipates they can find \na doctor. Well, there are also more people in cities, so there are\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\nmore people waiting in lines to see the doctors. There is a limit to \nhow long you want to wait in line to see a doctor, particularly if you \nare having an emergency.\n  This bill only covers two categories; one is emergency medical \nservices, and the other is people who deliver babies. So I ask again: \nhow long do you want to wait in the emergency room?\n  Is this proposal for a limit of $250,000 for noneconomic damages way \nout of line? I do not know. I do know California passed this limit. \nCalifornia put a limit of $250,000 on noneconomic damages, and it has \nmade a difference. They are one of the few States in the Nation that is \nnot having the problem.\n  Now, California, viewed by Wyoming folks, where I am from, is \nconsidered to be very liberal. So if they did it, this could not be a \nconservative move. If California can have a $250,000 limit, why \nshouldn't other places be able to? You may say: Well, States could pass \ntheir own. California did. States can. It is a very long procedure for \nsome States. Wyoming has very limited legislative time, and then a \nlengthy procedure for having votes of the people before it then comes \nback to the legislature for additional work. So there are limitations \nin the States.\n  This can be handled on a national basis. If you hear this bill would \nlimit an injured patient to receiving $250,000 in compensation, though, \nyou can say that is simply false. There is no other way to put it. That \ncontention is false.\n  This bill would also only apply, as I mentioned, to obstetrical \nservices and emergency medical services. These are two of the areas of \nmedicine where patients are in the most danger of losing their access \nto these services.\n  Once more, I ask, how many will be harmed by not getting to see a \ndoctor? What do you do if you are a woman and you cannot see a doctor \nto deliver your baby? Baby doctors are particularly hard hit because \nthe child can sue when the child reaches age, so the tail on their \ninsurance is extremely long, and that provides additional opportunities \nto sue, which means additional cost for the insurance.\n\n  But we are also talking about the emergency medical services. In an \nemergency, as Senator Frist, the doctor of the Senate, pointed out, \nevery single moment counts. There is, at most, a ``golden hour'' in \nemergency treatment. So if you have to spend that golden hour traveling \n750 miles--as the Senator from Texas showed on his chart of Texas \nshowing how far some people have to travel for specialized care--it \ncould be too late.\n  Physicians are being hit with six-figure annual premiums in the \nmedical specialties of obstetrics and trauma care. As a result, they \nare curtailing their practices, retiring early, or moving to States \nwith better legal environments, because a better legal environment \nmeans lower insurance premiums.\n  In Wyoming, we have one of those bad legal environments. We do not \nhave limits on noneconomic damage awards. We do not have limits, \ndespite evidence that shows reasonable limits on noneconomic damage \nawards have helped control the rising cost of medical liability \ninsurance premiums in other States.\n  As a result, people in Wyoming are losing access to affordable health \ncare in their communities. The rising cost of medical liability \ninsurance in my State of Wyoming is forcing doctors to curtail their \npractices or close them entirely. We have a shortage of doctors in \nWyoming as it is, and the cost of medical liability insurance is making \na bad problem even worse.\n  I want my colleagues to know we have a full-fledged medical liability \ncrisis on our hands in this country, and particularly in Wyoming. Just \nlast month, the largest of the three insurers in Wyoming announced they \nwould be leaving the Wyoming market later this year. As a result, 381 \ndoctors and 7 hospitals are going to have to find new insurance \ncoverage. Of the two companies that are left, one of them is not \nwriting new policies for emergency and trauma care physicians. So the \nfew emergency room specialists we have in Wyoming soon will have only \none company to choose from for their professional insurance.\n  These insurance company executives are not dumb people. Just as \ndoctors are moving to States with better legal environments, so are the \ninsurance companies.\n  As I mentioned, some have left Wyoming. People say, well, yes, there \ngo those rich insurance companies. They are going to move somewhere \nelse where they can make a lot more money. Did you know some of them \nare going broke? If the profit is all that prolific, why are some going \nbroke?\n  One of the doctors in Wyoming was doing his calculation about whether \nto stay in business or not, whether to deliver babies anymore or not. \nHe ran a calculation based on the rise in insurance premium costs he \nhad, despite that he has not been sued at all. He found out $25 of each \ndoctor visit goes to pay the insurance. If you are paying $100 for a \ndoctor visit, $25 of that is going to pay for the insurance. The other \n$75 is not all profit either. It has to go to pay for the nurses, the \nsupplies, the building--all of those things. But $25 of each visit goes \nto insurance.\n  I do not care which insurance companies are writing policies in my \nState, as long as there are some. But I do care when good doctors leave \nthe State. Wyoming is a big State with a lot of small communities. In \nfact, people out here in the East cannot even comprehend the small \ncommunities we have. If you grew up in a small town, you probably got \nto know your family doctor pretty well. Doctors are part of the fabric \nof life in the small towns that dot the map of my State. It is not easy \nfor them to pick up and leave, but that is what is happening. As hard \nas it is for the doctors to leave, it is even harder on the families \nthey serve--the families who have grown comfortable with the care these \ndoctors provide.\n  I commend Senators Gregg and Ensign and our majority leader, Dr. \nFrist, for trying again to pass a sensible short-term solution to this \nNation's crisis. They have developed a bill that is focused on \nproviding relief to the doctors who serve mothers and their babies, and \nthe doctors who save lives in our Nation's emergency rooms.\n  Every day, thousands of patients depend on these doctors when it \ncomes time to bring a new life into the world or to save a life that is \nalready here.\n  I hope we can all agree to support this short-term solution that will \nmaintain access to the services these doctors provide.\n  I have noticed something interesting during the debate on the issue \nof medical liability reform. While we have been debating the pros and \ncons of reform, no one is standing up to defend our current system of \nmedical litigation. I have yet to hear a rousing defense of our medical \nlitigation system. Even some of the lawyers in this body have agreed \nthat frivolous lawsuits are a problem and that our medical liability \nsystem needs reform. Why aren't we hearing anyone defend the merits of \nour current medical litigation system? It is because it is \nindefensible. Our system does not work. It does not work for patients, \nnor does it work for their doctors.\n  The bill we are debating today is a good bill. It will help us \nstabilize insurance premiums and preserve access to critical medical \nservices. But even the sponsors would probably admit it is a short-term \nmeasure that does not address the fundamental problems with our medical \nlitigation system. This is an important bill, but it is just a \ntourniquet to stop the bleeding. It is not going to heal our broken \nsystem.\n  It reminds me of the town that lived on the edge of a cliff. The town \nhad a tremendous problem because kids fell off of this cliff, and the \nfall killed a lot of them. They decided they needed to do something \nabout it. After extensive meetings and committee work, they purchased \nthe finest ambulance that could be found, and they put that ambulance \nat the base of the cliff. They hired the best EMTs they could get so \nthe person could be loaded on to the ambulance and served while they \ngot to the nearest hospital. Somebody then suggested: Why don't you \njust put a fence on the cliff. And they said: No, we don't do fences.\n  That is what we are doing with this medical litigation crisis. We are \navoiding putting up the fence for the short-term solution and we are \nletting people fall off the cliff; then we are trying to provide them \nwith the best possible service we can after they fall. What are we \ngoing to do when they use this fine ambulance and these great EMTs and \nthey get to the hospital and there is no emergency room doctor? We need \nthe fence and the emergency room doctors\n\n[[Page S3754]]\n\ntoo. This bill is designed to make sure there is medical liability \ninsurance so the doctors can continue to operate.\n  We like to say that justice is blind. With respect to our medical \nlitigation system, I would say that justice is absent and nowhere to be \nfound.\n  Every Member of this body wants to make sure that someone who is \ntruly injured by a medical error gets the compensation they deserve. \nBut a number of studies have shown that many patients who were hurt by \nnegligent actions received no compensation at all for their losses.\n  I have also seen studies that suggest that those who receive \ncompensation end up with about 40 cents on every dollar in insurance \npremiums, once the lawyers' fees and their courtroom costs are \nsubtracted. So the victim gets 40 cents on the dollar. Somebody else is \ngetting the other 60 cents. I don't think that sounds fair.\n  What is more, studies have demonstrated the likelihood of a doctor or \nhospital being sued, and the result of such a suit, bears little \nrelation to whether the doctor or hospital was at fault.\n  These facts led the congressionally chartered Institute of Medicine \nto issue a report in 2002. That report called upon Congress to create \ndemonstration projects to encourage States to evaluate alternatives to \ncurrent medical tort litigation.\n  In response, I have introduced a bill that would turn these expert \nrecommendations into action. My bill, the Reliable Medical Justice Act, \nwould authorize funding for States to create alternatives to current \ntort litigation. The funding would cover the costs of planning and \ninitiating proposals. My bill would require participating States and \nthe Federal Government to work together in evaluating the results of \nthe alternatives as compared to the traditional tort litigation. This \nway all States and the Federal Government could learn from new \napproaches. We could see if there is not a way to get people fairly and \njustly compensated, compensated more quickly, and to actually receive \nthe majority of the money, not just a small pittance.\n\n  The bill outlines some model approaches States could employ. For \ninstance, one State might want to evaluate the idea of health care \ncourts where judges with special expertise could hear medical cases. \nThis concept is similar to the special courts we have for taxes, \ndomestic violence, drugs, and other complex and emotional issues. That \nway we would get some fairness between cases. One person with the same \nkind of hurt would get compensated the same way, approximately, that \nsomebody else with that same hurt had, not based on who picked the best \nlawyer or who picked the best injury--with fairness, quickness, and the \nvictim receiving the money.\n  Another State might want to test an administrative approach. For \ninstance, a State could set up classes of avoidable injuries and a \nschedule of compensation for them and then establish an administrative \nboard to resolve claims related to those injuries. A scientific process \nof identifying preventable injuries and setting appropriate \ncompensation for them might offer better results than the randomness of \nthe court system.\n  Another State might want to provide health care providers and \norganizations with immunity from lawsuits if they make a timely offer \nto compensate an injured patient for his or her losses. This could give \na health care provider who makes an honest mistake the chance to make \namends financially with a patient without the provider fearing that \ntheir honesty would land them in a lawsuit.\n  The point of my bill is there are plenty of ideas for better ways to \nresolve medical disputes. One of the best ways Congress can help fix \nthe flawed litigation system in the long term is by encouraging States \nto test alternatives and to learn from them.\n  As I speak, some States are already looking into alternatives. My \nState of Wyoming is one of them. Another is Massachusetts, where the \nGovernor is working with Harvard University on an innovative project. \nAnother is Florida, where the Governor's task force recommended \nprojects for which my bill could provide support.\n  Believe it or not, both Newt Gingrich and the editors of the New York \nTimes have endorsed this idea. If Newt Gingrich and the New York Times \ncan agree on something, maybe we can find enough support for it in this \nChamber as well.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that I support the Gregg-Ensign bill. \nIt will provide some short-term relief for this medical liability \ncrisis. We don't have time just for testing at the moment. We are \nlosing the doctors who provide emergency care and the doctors who \ndeliver babies. In my own State, several of the doctors have quit \ndelivering babies because they can't afford the insurance. Others have \nhad to cut back on the number of babies they deliver to be able to \nafford the insurance. That means ladies having babies are not able to \nget doctors with the necessary expertise.\n  We need short-term relief from the medical liability crisis, and I \nknow many of my colleagues will join me in voting for it. But I know \nthat some will vote against it. Regardless of whether you feel this is \nthe right solution for the short term, let's acknowledge that our \nmedical litigation system is failing us and that we must work together \nto find a long-term solution.\n  Medical lawsuits are supposed to compensate people fairly and deter \nfuture errors, but most patients don't get fair and timely \ncompensation. There is nothing to show that lawsuits are deterring \nmedical errors or making patients safer.\n  I urge Members to vote for the Gregg-Ensign bill. I also ask that \nMembers take a serious look at S. 1518. My basic reason for introducing \nS. 1518 is that most patients don't want to sue their doctors. If their \ndoctor made a mistake, they want an apology. They want to be \ncompensated for their loss. They want the situation to be resolved \nquickly and fairly. I believe most physicians want the same thing. They \nwant to apologize. They want to make amends financially.\n  If patients and their doctors want the same thing, what stands in the \nway? Our legal system, that is what.\n  Our legal system pits doctors against their patients. Doctors cannot \napologize to their patients because admitting a mistake might end a \ndoctor up in court, and probably would. As a result, doctors order more \nexpensive tests and spend less time getting to know their patients--\nanything to protect against a career-threatening lawsuit.\n  Patients feel this distrust, and they respond in kind. If a patient \nhas a bad medical outcome, they assume their doctor was at fault, even \nif there was nothing their doctor would or could have done differently.\n  Sometimes bad outcomes happen in health care, and no one is at fault. \nBut if a doctor doesn't feel free to say ``I am sorry'' when he or she \nmakes a mistake, how will a patient know whether their doctor is at \nfault? It is hard to blame the patient for assuming the worst.\n  This is a fundamental flaw in the way we resolve medical disputes \ntoday. The courtroom stands between the people who matter most--the \npatient and the doctor. The courtroom ought to be the last resort for \nresolving disputes, not the only resort. Patients and doctors ought to \nbe on the same side, working together; but fear of the legal system \nputs them in opposite corners and pits them against one another.\n  There has to be a better way. My bill would be another step toward \nreplacing the medical lawsuits with a better and fairer system for \ncompensating and protecting patients. But it is a long-term solution, \nand we do have a short-term solution, the Gregg-Ensign bill. I hope we \ncan work together to find the long-term solution, but that we will do \nthe short-term solution now.\n  Again, our debate now is whether we get to the debate the bill. \nUnless we have cloture tomorrow, we won't actually get to debate the \nshort-term solution.\n  I want to recap and remind you that this bill doesn't limit economic \ndamages. It will assure that we can have emergency care, that doctors \nwho deliver babies can continue to deliver babies.\n  If you don't get care at all, how much pain and suffering will you \nhave? How much injury can be caused if you cannot go to a doctor in \nyour community and you have to travel extensively to do it?\n\n[[Page S3755]]\n\n  This bill is a limit on noneconomic damages, similar to the limit in \nCalifornia, where the crisis has been averted. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport cloture on the motion to proceed so we can proceed to pass the \nGregg-Ensign bill, so we will have a short-term solution to the medical \nliability crisis we face in our country, which keeps us from getting \nthe medical treatment we need, when we need it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 2207, \nthe Pregnancy and Trauma Care Protection Act of 2004. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to vote for this very important legislation.\n  This is the third time in the 108th Congress that I have come to the \nfloor to argue for medical liability reform. It should not be this \ndifficult to pass a piece of legislation that will improve access of \nall Americans to timely and efficient medical care, reduce the cost of \nhospitalization insurance and health insurance, and do something about \nthe enormous cost of defensive medicine being practiced today by \nphysicians throughout the country, which is contributing also to the \nhigh cost of health insurance premiums.\n  I start off today by telling a story of the Schweiterman family in \nOhio's rural west-central Mercer County. Doctors Jim and Tom \nSchweiterman are brothers who, along with their father, who is retired, \nhave delivered about 5,700 babies over the years. The family has a 113-\nyear history of bringing babies into the world. Their great-grandfather \nstarted the current medical practice in 1896. They have never been sued \nfor a delivery.\n  Yet this family is giving up delivering babies because of escalating \nmalpractice insurance costs. Their insurance rates rose from $32,000 6 \nyears ago to this year's quote of $78,000. Dr. Jim Schweiterman stated \nhe would continue to deliver babies if he could just break even, but \nunfortunately, because of insurance costs, he cannot. Their last \ndelivery will take place this September.\n  This is happening all over the United States. This legislation is a \nmust. It is important because the effects of medical liability crises \ncan be felt most acutely by obstetricians/gynecologists and emergency \nroom physicians.\n  Data from the American Medical Association indicates that 19 States \ncurrently face a medical liability ``crisis'' and 25 States show \n``problem signs.'' That is 44 States out of our 50. The doctors in \nthese 44 States will either leave the practice of medicine entirely or \nmove their practice to a neighboring State with better malpractice \ninsurance rates. This phenomenon cries for national legislation.\n  One category of patients impacted greatly by this crisis and who we \nare trying to help with this legislation is women of childbearing age. \nOne out of every 11 obstetricians nationwide has stopped delivering \nbabies and, instead, scaled back their practices to gynecology only. In \naddition, one in six has begun to refuse high-risk cases. Most alarming \nis recent data showing that for a third year in a row, the number of \nobstetrics/gynecology residency training slots filled by U.S. medical \nstudents declined by 65.1 percent--the lowest level ever. People are \nnot going into residencies in OB/GYN and in ER.\n  How does this affect a woman's access to care? As premiums increase, \na woman's access to general care, including regular screenings for \nreproductive cancers, high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and \nother serious health risks, will decrease.\n  With fewer health care providers offering full services, the workload \nhas increased significantly for those who still do. Wait time \nincreases, putting women at risk.\n  Women receive less prenatal care in our current environment. Improved \naccess to prenatal care has resulted in low infant mortality rates, an \nadvance now threatened as OB/GYNs drop obstetrics. As you may have \nread, for the first time since 1958, the U.S. infant mortality rate is \nup. According to the preliminary data released this month by the \nstatisticians for the CDC, the Nation's infant mortality rate in 2002 \nwas 7 per 1,000 births. That is up from 6.8 in 2001, and some experts \nare attributing that to poor access to quality prenatal care.\n  Another group of physicians that has been significantly affected by \nthe medical liability crisis, and that we are trying to help out with \nthis legislation, is emergency room physicians. When patients rush to \nthe ER, they assume the hospital will be open and doctors will be there \nto treat them. However, to secure affordable medical liability \ninsurance, or to minimize their risks of lawsuits, many physicians, \nincluding neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, cardiothoracic surgeons, \nobstetricians, and cardiologists, are no longer able to serve on-call \nto hospital emergency departments. In extreme cases--for example, \nNevada, Florida, and Pennsylvania--emergency departments and trauma \ncenters have been forced to shut down completely because the physicians \nhave been unable to secure medical liability insurance at any price. It \nis not available.\n  In fact, in the past 10 years, hundreds of emergency departments have \nclosed in the United States in such States including Arizona, Florida, \nMaryland, Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West \nVirginia. Over the same period, the number of visits in the Nation's \nemergency departments climbed over 20 percent. While more Americans are \nseeking emergency medical care, emergency departments continue to lose \nstaff and resources and are almost at the breaking point.\n  In addition, three in four of emergency departments diverted \nambulances in the last 12 months. I will repeat that. Three of four \nemergency departments diverted ambulances in the last 12 months in part \nbecause no specialists were available.\n  Of these, one-third diverted patients six or more times a month, and \nan additional 28 percent diverted patients three to five times a month.\n  This is devastating, especially in light of the volume of patients \ntreated by emergency room physicians. Each year there are 110 million \nvisits to emergency rooms in the United States. Over 3.5 million ER \nvisits are related to bone fractures. Of these, some 885,000 people \nhave such severe fractures which can cut off or reduce blood flow to a \nlimb or lead to shock. Patients cannot afford delays in treatment which \ncan lead to death, amputation of a limb, loss of use of a limb, or \npermanent disability.\n  Each year, over 1 million Americans suffer a heart attack. \nApproximately 20 percent of heart attack victims will die. \nCardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons can perform lifesaving \ntreatments and, in some cases, can even reverse heart damage if the \npatients are treated promptly. Stroke patients treated within 90 \nminutes of the onset of their symptoms show the most improvements.\n  We need this legislation to keep these ERs open and fully staffed and \nto make sure there are no delays in treatment that can result in death \nor permanent injury.\n  How does this affect a person's access to care in the emergency room \nor the trauma care center? Today, in many hospitals, there is no \nneurosurgeon available to treat patients with major head trauma or no \northopedic surgeon to care for patients with open fractures.\n  According to a recent study, over 70 percent of the Nation's \nhospitals, again, were forced to divert patients in the past month. \nThat is a startling statistic. According to a recent study, over 70 \npercent of this Nation's hospitals were forced to divert patients in \nthis past month, in part because of lack of specialists on call.\n  Neurosurgeon Thomas Hawk of Columbus stopped providing trauma and \nemergency care in an effort to reduce his liability premiums. He also \nwrites to me:\n\n       I see lots of patients each week from West Virginia who \n     cannot find neurosurgical care and are coming all the way to \n     Columbus, OH, to get care.\n\n  This is another problem, the transferring of patients. Because of the \ngrowing scarcity of oncall specialists, patients now wait longer for \ncare in emergency departments. As I mentioned, many are being \ntransferred to other facilities. This can be deadly for elderly \npatients experiencing heart attacks or strokes which require immediate \nmedical attention.\n  In fact, the emergency physicians at Akron's two level I trauma \ncenters--Akron is fortunate; they have two\n\n[[Page S3756]]\n\ntrauma centers, Akron General Medical and Akron City Hospital--often \ntreat patients from other areas of the State, including Youngstown and \nCleveland. Youngstown is, I think, an hour away, and Cleveland is 45 \nminutes away. I do not see how my colleagues can claim we are not in \nthe middle of a crisis.\n  When I have given speeches in the past, I have given testimonials \nfrom dozens upon dozens of physicians in Ohio who have been affected by \nthis crisis. Every week I see many of them. But this time instead I \nwould like to talk about some other States to show that this crisis \ndoes not just affect my home State of Ohio or States such as Nevada or \nPennsylvania, but it is widespread throughout the country and should \ncause many of my colleagues from other States to support this \nlegislation or explain why they cannot.\n\n  In Illinois, according to the American College of Emergency \nPhysicians, fewer inpatient beds and staffing shortages are \ncontributing to severe overcrowding and ambulance diversion. A 2003 \nreport from the Metropolitan Chicago Health Care Council indicated the \ncity's hospitals are unprepared to meet the future health care needs of \ntheir patients. According to the American Association of Neurological \nSurgeons, more than 15 percent of Illinois neurosurgeons have left the \nState in the past 2 years.\n  In addition, since January of 2003, 59 doctors have left the St. \nClair-Madison County area. Just since October 2003, as premium renewals \nare considered at the end of the year, over 10 physicians have left, \nincluding 3 orthopedic surgeons.\n  Also in Illinois, according to a November 2002 survey, 63.5 percent \nof responding Illinois OB/GYNs have been forced to make changes in \ntheir practice, such as quitting obstetrics, retiring, relocating, \ndecreasing gynecologic procedures, and no longer performing major \nsurgery. Almost 50 Illinois OBs stopped practicing obstetrics recently, \nforcing 7,776 pregnant Illinois women to find new OB/GYNs to provide \nobstetrics care.\n  I don't know how we can take this situation. I have six \ngrandchildren, and I cannot think of a worst situation than if one of \nthem had a problem pregnancy and were told by their OB/GYN: I am sorry, \nI can't handle it because if I do, my insurance premiums are going to \nskyrocket. And yet in Illinois, 50 stopped practicing.\n  An orthopedic surgeon in Oakbrook Terrace, IL, told the story of a 5-\nyear-old child who was struck by a car and sustained a fracture of the \nfemur and small skull fracture with minimal underlying brain contusion. \nHe stated:\n\n       Such injuries would typically be treated by . . . an \n     orthopaedic surgeon and then a neurosurgeon. . . . In this \n     case, the neurosurgeon on call would not see any patient \n     under 18. A pediatric orthopaedic surgeon was in attendance . \n     . . but without a neurosurgeon . . . a transfer to Loyola had \n     to be arranged. At Loyola, no pediatric orthopaedic surgeon \n     was available, so the adult orthopaedic trauma surgeon had \n     the child's leg placed in traction, inserting a pin just \n     above the knee in order to hang the weights which pulled on \n     the leg. The plan was to keep the child in traction for a few \n     weeks, and then place the child in a cast. The family, after \n     2 days at Loyola, desired transfer of care back to their home \n     town. The liability crisis has created a situation where this \n     patient had to endure two useless ambulance rides with a \n     broken femur, several extra days of hospitalization, and \n     insertion and removal of a traction pin. This waste of \n     resources and interference with medical care is repeated \n     endlessly across the nation.\n\n  In New Jersey, according to the State Hospital Association, hospital \nliability premiums jumped 50 percent on average in 2003, and the \naverage annual hospital premium increased to $1.4 million.\n  In addition, a survey of more than 1,000 obstetricians found 23 \npercent had left their practices last year because they could not \nafford liability coverage, and only one pediatric surgeon is left in \neach of Ocean and Monmouth Counties, according to the State medical \nsociety. Some hospitals do not even have obstetricians on call.\n  Also in New Jersey, in January of 2002, there were 85 practicing \nneurosurgeons in the State. A little more than a year later, an \nestimated 20 have been forced to stop practicing. Warren County \nresidents, including its 200-bed hospital, saw its only two \nneurosurgeons leave in September 2002. The closest neurosurgery center \nis now more than 1 hour away from these residents.\n  In North Carolina, the average size of liability claims increased by \napproximately 80 percent over 10 years. Some physicians are going out \nof business, leaving the State or substantially increasing prices as \nthey pass on costs to their patients. The Senator from North Carolina, \nwho was a Presidential candidate, should be very familiar with those \nstatistics. The problem is especially acute for obstetricians, \nneurosurgeons, and emergency physicians.\n  In fact, in nine counties in the rural southern region, there has \nbeen a 3-percent decrease in specialty physicians, despite a nearly 8-\npercent increase in population between 1999 and 2002. At the same time, \nspecialty physicians in all rural counties have increased only 1 \npercent, while the general population in those counties grew by 7 \npercent.\n  Neurosurgeons have been particularly affected by the medical \nliability crisis and many are stopping or limiting their trauma and \nemergency care in an effort to obtain affordable liability insurance. \nAs a result, many hospitals, including Moore Regional Hospital in \nPinehurst, NC, no longer have 24-hour neurosurgery coverage. Patients \nwho suffer injuries during the wrong time are transferred to Chapel \nHill sometimes after waiting for hours.\n  What about Florida? In Florida, liability premiums increased 75 \npercent in 2002. The average premium per physician was 55 percent \nhigher than the national average. Emergency departments across the \nState are transferring patients to other hospitals because of shortages \nof cardiologists.\n  Between 1998 and 2002, 30 professional liability insurers left \nFlorida. That is, the insurance companies have just left Florida \nbecause of the multiplicity of medical lawsuits that have been filed. \nThirty-four percent of Florida physicians have stopped or reduced their \nemergency care coverage.\n  At Orlando Regional Medical Center, where Disney World is located, is \none of only six level I trauma centers in the State. Think about this. \nThis is the State of Florida, one of the fastest growing States in the \nUnited States. They have six level I trauma centers in the State. For \nthose people who travel to Florida, I am sure that one of these days \nthey are going to start taking that into consideration about going to \nthe State of Florida because of the fact they do not have the trauma \ncenters they need to take care of the people who come down from all \nover the country.\n  All of the neurosurgeons on staff at the Orlando Regional Medical \nCenter, which is one of the six level I, have what they call ``gone \nbare'' and no longer have any professional liability insurance. So what \nhas the hospital done to take care of the situation? Listen to this. \nThe hospital has resorted to paying the doctors $4,000 per day to cover \nthe call schedule and enable them to keep their door open to traumas.\n  In addition, Orlando Regional Sand Lake Hospital has had to eliminate \nboth of its on-call orthopedics and urology coverage in its emergency \ndepartment due to a lack of physician availability.\n  The stories from Florida are particularly egregious, so much so that \nI cannot understand how my colleagues from that State are not \nsupportive of this legislation. I cannot figure it out. With what is \ngoing on in Florida, I cannot understand why the two Senators from that \nState cannot be supportive of this legislation.\n  Dr. Richard Foltz from Fort Lauderdale, FL, writes:\n\n       There are no neurosurgeons in Palm Beach to do brain \n     surgeries or take ER call. They try to transfer patients \n     across county lines all the time. I have no insurance and \n     have gone bare. My last premium notice was over $400,000 a \n     year.\n\n  According to neurosurgeon Troy Tippett, there are no longer any \nneurosurgeons in the Pensacola, FL, area who treat pediatric patients \nwho are often considered high risk in liability terms. Children \nsuffering from head and spinal injuries are airlifted more than 200 \nmiles away. Think about that, airlifted 200 miles away to get treatment \nthey ought to be able to get in their own community.\n  A Winter Park OB/GYN dropped his obstetric practice after his \npremiums rose from $48,000 to $100,000. At that rate, he would have to \nwork 6 months\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\nof the year just to pay his liability premiums. Instead he, along with \nfour other obstetricians, gave up obstetrics altogether.\n  I could go on and on with one story after another about the fact we \nare losing surgeons and we are losing obstetricians all over this \ncountry. We are just talking about two of the specialties right now. We \nare concentrating on these two right now because we know they are the \nmost in need and the shortage is most acute.\n  The legislation we are debating today gets us on our way to turning \nthese statistics around. It provides a commonsense approach to our \nlitigation problems that will keep consumers from bearing the costs of \ncostly and unnecessary litigation while making sure those with \nlegitimate grievances have recourse through the courts.\n  I would like to point out the argument that the insurance industry is \nripping off doctors--and we hear that all the time on this floor--and \nraising rates to make up for investment losses is preposterous. I would \nagain invite those Members who believe this to read the article I \nsubmitted for the Record during our last debate in February entitled \n``Did Investments Affect Medical Malpractice Premiums,'' where it is \nconcluded that asset allocation and investments returns have had \nlittle, if any, correlation to the development of the current \nmalpractice problem.\n  I am not going to bore my colleagues today with statistic after \nstatistic about what has happened to medical malpractice insurance \ncompanies in this country, but most of them are out of business. Most \nof them are limiting what they make available to doctors based on the \ntype of medicine the doctor practices.\n  I would also like to point out testimony given to the Ohio Medical \nMalpractice Commission by a man by the name of James Hurley of the \nAmerican Academy of Actuaries. In his testimony, Mr. Hurley tried to \ndebunk a few misconceptions about the insurance industry and medical \nmalpractice, one of which is the idea that insurers are increasing \nrates because of investment losses, particularly their losses in the \nstock market.\n  In response to this, Mr. Hurley states unequivocally, that in \nestablishing rates insurers do not recoup investment losses.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of March 26, 2004, from James \nHurley be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  American Academy\n\n\n                                                 of Actuaries,\n\n                                                   March 26, 2004.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: On behalf of the American Academy of \n     Actuaries' Medical Malpractice Subcommittee, I appreciate the \n     opportunity to provide an actuarial perspective on the issues \n     related to patient access to health care and, in particular, \n     the availability and pricing of medical malpractice \n     insurance. As Congress considers medical malpractice \n     liability reform (include S. 2207, the Pregnancy and Trauma \n     Care Access Protection Act of 2004), the subcommittee feels \n     it is important to highlight certain misconceptions in the \n     current debate so Congress can more effectively address \n     problems related to the availability and affordability of \n     this insurance.\n       Determining Rates.--Ratemaking is the term used to describe \n     the process by which companies determine what premium is \n     indicated for a coverage. In the insurance transaction, the \n     company assumes the financial risk associated with a future, \n     contingent event in exchange for a fixed premium before it \n     knows what the true cost of the event is, if any. The company \n     must estimate those costs, determine a price for it and be \n     willing to assume the risk that the costs may differ, perhaps \n     substantially, from those estimates. A general principle of \n     ratemaking is that the rate charged reflects the expected \n     costs for the coverage to be provided, not what has been paid \n     or is going to be paid on past coverage. It does not reflect \n     money lost on prior investments. In short, a rate is a \n     reflection of future costs.\n       In general, the actuarial process used in making these \n     estimations for medical malpractice insurance starts with \n     historical loss experience for the specific coverage and, \n     usually, for a specific jurisdiction. Rates are determined \n     for this coverage, jurisdiction, and a fixed time period. To \n     the appropriately projected loss experience, a company must \n     incorporate consideration of all expenses, the time value of \n     money and an appropriate provision for risk and profit \n     associated with the insurance transaction.\n       Some lines of insurance coverage are more predictable than \n     other lines. The unpredictability of coverage reflects its \n     inherent risk characteristics. Most companies would agree \n     that costs and, therefore, rates for automobile physical \n     damage coverage, for example, are more predictable than for \n     medical malpractice insurance because automobile insurance is \n     relatively high frequency/low severity coverage compared to \n     medical malpractice insurance. In the case of auto physical \n     damage, one has a large number of similar claims for \n     relatively small amounts that fall in a fairly narrow \n     range. In medical malpractice insurance one has a small \n     number of claims that have a much higher average value and \n     a significantly wider range of possible outcomes. There \n     also is significantly longer delay for medical malpractice \n     insurance between the occurrence of an event giving rise \n     to a claim, the reporting of the claim, and the final \n     disposition of the claim. This longer delay adds to the \n     uncertainty inherent in projecting the ultimate value of \n     losses, and consequently premiums.\n       Rates Don't Recoup Past Investment Losses.-- The ratemaking \n     process is forward looking. In establishing rates, both state \n     insurance laws and actuarial standards of practice prohibit \n     recoupment of past investment losses. Instead of trying to \n     make up for past losses, the general ratemaking practice is \n     to choose an expected prospective investment yield and \n     calculate a discount factor based on historical payout \n     patterns. For medical malpractice, the insurer often expects \n     to have an underwriting loss that will be offset by \n     investment income. Since interest yields drive this process, \n     when interest yields decrease, rates will increase.\n       Insurers are restricted in their investment activity due to \n     state insurance regulation and competition in the market. The \n     majority of invested assets are fixed-income instruments. \n     Generally, these are purchased in maturities that are \n     reasonably consistent with the anticipated future payment of \n     claims. Losses from this portion of the invested asset base \n     have been minimal, although the rate of return available has \n     declined.\n       Tort Reforms.--Tort reform has been proposed as a solution \n     to higher loss costs and surging rates. Reforms modeled after \n     California's Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act, or \n     MICRA, are proposed to alleviate some of the financial \n     pressure on the medical malpractice insurance system. The \n     Subcommittee, which takes no position for or against tort \n     reforms, observes the following:\n       A coordinated package of tort reforms is more likely to \n     achieve savings in malpractice losses and insurance premiums \n     than an individual reform, like a cap on pain and suffering \n     or non economic damages only.\n       While a cap on non economic awards could substantially \n     reduce claim losses (on a per-event basis and at some level \n     low enough to have an effect; such as MICRA's $250,000) other \n     tort reform elements, such as a mandatory collateral source \n     offset rule, are also important.\n       Such reforms may not assure immediate rate reductions, \n     particularly given the size of some rate increases being \n     implemented currently. The actual effect, including whether \n     the reforms are applied as intended, will not be immediately \n     known.\n       These reforms are unlikely to eliminate claim severity (or \n     frequency) changes but they may mitigate them. The economic \n     portion of claims is not affected if a non-economic cap is \n     enacted. Thus, rate increases are still likely to be needed.\n       Such reforms should reduce concerns about large dollar \n     awards containing significant subjective non-economic damage \n     components and make the loss environment more predictable.\n       Thank you very much for your consideration. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact me or Greg Vass, the Academy's Senior \n     Casualty Policy Analyst, at 202-223-8196 if you have any \n     questions or would like additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                     James Hurley, ACAS, MAAA,\n\n                                                      Chairperson,\n                                 Medical Malpractice Subcommittee.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Throughout my career in public service, health care \nhas been one of my top legislative priorities and certainly was a high \npriority while I was Governor of the State of Ohio and mayor of the \ncity of Cleveland. All of us want access to quality, affordable health \ncare. When the quality is not there, when people die or are truly sick \ndue to negligence or other medical error, they should be compensated.\n  When healthy plaintiffs file meaningless lawsuits to coerce \nsettlements or to shake the money tree to get as much as they can get, \nthere is a snowball effect and all of us pay the price. For the system \nto work, we must strike a delicate balance between the rights of \naggrieved parties to bring lawsuits and the rights of society to be \nprotected against frivolous lawsuits and outrageous judgments that are \ndisproportionate to compensating the injured and made at the expense of \nsociety as a whole.\n  I repeat that again. For the system to work, we must strike a \ndelicate balance between the rights of the aggrieved parties to bring \nlawsuits and\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\nthe rights of society to be protected against frivolous lawsuits and \noutrageous judgments that are disproportionate to compensating the \ninjured and made at the expense of society as a whole.\n  I have been concerned about this issue since my days as Governor, as \nI mentioned. In 1996, I essentially had to pull teeth in the Ohio \nlegislature to pass my tort reform bill which would have placed caps on \nnoneconomic and punitive damages, established proportional liability, \nand created a rebuttable presumption that a hospital was not negligent \nregarding negligent credentialing, among other provisions.\n  I signed the bill into law in October of 1996. Three years later, the \nOhio Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. Had that law withstood \nthe supreme court scrutiny--and I think today it would because we have \na different supreme court--Ohioans would not be facing the medical \naccess problems they are facing today--doctors leaving their practice, \npatients unable to receive the care they need, and cost of health \ninsurance going through the roof.\n  Next to the economy and jobs, the most important issue facing America \ntoday is health care. In fact, it is a part of the reason why our \neconomy is in trouble. We have too many uninsured, and those who have \ninsurance face soaring premiums every year, making it less likely they \ncan continue to pay for them.\n  In addition, employers face spiraling costs and in some cases do not \neven provide insurance, and those that do have been forced to increase \ntheir premiums and pass on the added costs to their employees, whose \nfamily budgets are often already stretched razor thin.\n  In other words, I see people in business every day who say, Senator, \nI want to provide health care for my employees but the cost of it has \ngone up to the point where I cannot afford to provide it for them. Or, \nin the alternative, Senator, I am going to provide it for them, but I \nam going to ask them to pay for more of their premiums. And, Senator, \nin so many instances my employees cannot pay the additional premiums, \nand because they cannot pay the additional premiums, they lose their \nhealth insurance.\n  I believe that providing the sort of commonsense approach found in \nthe Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act of 2004 is one way \nto deal with this escalating cost of health insurance in the United \nStates. The bill will give patients greater access to care. It will \nprovide medical liability for those physicians who provide prenatal \ndelivery and postpartum care to mothers and babies. Patients would not \nhave to give away large portions of their judgment to their attorneys. \nTruly injured parties can recover 100 percent of their economic \ndamages. Punitive damages are reserved for those cases where they are \ntruly justified. Doctors and hospitals would not be held liable for \nharm they do not cause and physicians can focus on doing what they do \nbest, practicing medicine and providing health care.\n  I, again, urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we can debate \nthis issue and have an up-or-down vote on this legislation. We owe it \nto the people of this country to have a robust debate of this on the \nSenate floor.\n  I close my remarks this afternoon by reading a letter from Laurence \nE. Stempel, an MD from Columbus, OH. This is from the letter he sent to \nhis patients on June 23, 2003:\n\n       On June 17, 2003, I received my professional liability \n     insurance rate quote for the upcoming year, and it is 64 \n     percent higher than last year. I have seen my premiums almost \n     triple during the past 2 years, despite never having had a \n     single penny paid out on my behalf in 27 years as a \n     physician. Even worse, during this time the insurance company \n     has reduced the amount of coverage that I can purchase from \n     $5 million to only $1 million . . .\n\n  In other words, his insurance has gone up astronomically and he is \ngetting about 80 percent less coverage than he had before. He said:\n\n     while jury verdicts have skyrocketed, often exceeding $3.4 \n     million. If I were to purchase this policy, I would be \n     putting all of my family's personal assets at risk every time \n     that I delivered a baby, or performed surgery. I refuse to do \n     that.\n       I have therefore decided to retire from private practice. . \n     . .[T]he final day of my current liability insurance policy \n     [is when that will happen.]\n       This is not a decision I have taken lightly, but \n     unfortunately it has become necessary. For many of you, I \n     have been part of your life for years. I have delivered your \n     babies and helped you through some of life's most difficult \n     challenges. It has truly been an honor.\n\n  We have to stop this from happening in this country. We have the \npower to do something about it on the floor of the Senate, and it is \nabout time we faced up to our responsibility and did something about \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Laurence E. Stempel, M.D.,\n\n                                                    June 23, 2003.\n       Dear Friends, As you know, our country is in the midst of \n     its worst medical liability crisis ever. Hardly a day passes \n     without a mention of the ``malpractice crisis'' in the \n     newspapers or on the nightly news. In fact, just a couple of \n     weeks ago, it was Time Magazine's cover story. This is a \n     national problem, and a truly frightening one. For example, \n     Las Vegas had 130 obstetricians a year ago. There are now 75, \n     and by the end of the year, there will probably only be 40 \n     left to care for the 23,000 women who deliver there each \n     year. Women are driving to Utah and California for prenatal \n     care. Closer to home, there were nine obstetricians in \n     Athens, Ohio, a year ago. There are now four, and soon there \n     will only be the two who teach at the medical school. Some \n     hospitals around the nation have closed their obstetric \n     units.\n       On June 17, 2003, I received my professional liability \n     insurance rate quote for the upcoming year, and it is 64% \n     higher than last year's rate. I have seen my premiums almost \n     triple during the past two years, despite never having had a \n     single penny paid out on my behalf in twenty-seven years as a \n     physician. Even worse, during this time the insurance company \n     has reduced the amount of coverage that I can purchase from \n     $5 million to only $1 million, while jury verdicts have \n     skyrocketed, often exceeding $3-4 million. If I were to \n     purchase this policy, I would be putting all of my family's \n     personal assets at risk every time that I delivered a baby or \n     performed surgery. I refuse to do that.\n       I have therefore decided to retire from private practice on \n     July 31, 2003, the final day of may current liability \n     insurance policy. This is not a decision that I have taken \n     lightly, but unfortunately it has become necessary. For many \n     of you, I have been part of your life for years. I have \n     delivered your babies, and helped you through some of life's \n     most difficult challenges. It has truly been an honor.\n       There is always a silver lining in every cloud. I am \n     looking forward to being able to devote more time to teaching \n     medical students and obstetric residents, a pursuit that has \n     occupied about a third of my professional time during recent \n     years. I will also be able to spend more time with my wife \n     and family, whom I have often neglected during the past years \n     due to the responsibility of my practice.\n       I know that these changes will be a serious inconvenience \n     for many of you. For those of you who are currently pregnant, \n     I will try to find each and every one you a competent and \n     caring obstetrician to help you through the rest of your \n     pregnancy and delivery. For those patients who have a \n     gynecology appointment schedule after July 31, it will be \n     necessary for you to reschedule with another physician. I \n     would like to recommend the physicians of Associates in \n     Central Ohio Obstetrics & Gynecology (phone 889-6117). This \n     group has an office in Suite A of my building, as well as a \n     couple of other offices around town. I have known all of \n     these physicians for years, and I taught most of them when \n     they were medical students or obstetric residents. \n     Furthermore, I have traded call with this group for a number \n     of years. They have agreed to be the custodian of my \n     patients' charts, and to see my patients if they would like. \n     If you would prefer to see another physician, they have \n     agreed to forward the pertinent information upon receipt of a \n     signed request.\n       Thank you again for the honor of being your physician. I \n     will miss each and every one of you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Laurence E. Stempel, M.D.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Extending Trade Adjustment Assistance\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, software programmers in Beaverton, OR, \nevery day have to compete with those in Beijing. I think it is very \nimportant for the Senate to set in place bipartisan policies that are \ngoing to finally give a fair shake to our workers who are competing in \ntough global markets.\n  I come to the floor this afternoon because I have developed, with the \nsupport of Senator Coleman, our colleague from Minnesota, a bipartisan \nproposal that would give the Senate a chance to help hundreds of \nthousands of laid-off\n\n[[Page S3759]]\n\nhigh tech workers and service employees by extending trade adjustment \nassistance benefits to them so they can receive job training, income \nsupport, and health insurance tax credits.\n  So often these workers have lost their jobs through no fault of their \nown, and we know--especially the distinguished Presiding Officer of the \nSenate--these high tech workers have been the envy of our American \nworkforce. There is extraordinary ingenuity among these hundreds of \nthousands of programmers and engineers and designers who have helped \ndrive our economy in this century. Their creativity has generated an \nexceptional wave of economic prosperity, and trade agreements on \nservices and intellectual property helped carry the fruits of the work \nof our workers around the globe.\n  Information technology developed by American workers transformed the \nworld and the way business is done. Overseas cable costs have dropped \nby as much as 80 percent in the last 5 years which, as the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer knows, has spread the Internet far and \nwide. The Internet has made it a lot cheaper to send work through a \nphone line than to ship a bulky package on an airplane.\n  Globalization of technology has globalized the technology workforce. \nSo, in fact, the workers I am honored to represent in Beaverton, OR, do \nhave to compete against workers in Beijing, and certainly geography is \nincreasingly less important in determining where a job can be done.\n  But the transformation from an economy built on smokestacks to one \nbuilt on packages of light has come at a heavy price. So often trade \nagreements in the past considered these high technology and service \nworkers as an afterthought. The irony is now some of the very same \nworkers who launched the technology revolution have actually become its \nvictims. Hardly a day goes by without a front-page story in our country \nabout an American programmer on his way out who is having to train a \nforeign worker who will replace him.\n  Senator Coleman and I have been working with a number of colleagues. \nSenator Baucus on this side of the aisle has been exceptionally \nhelpful. We talked with a number of colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. Senator Coleman and I have developed a bipartisan proposal to \nmake sure these workers, who have not gotten a fair shake in the past, \ndo have an opportunity to get back into our marketplace economy.\n  It is not a moment too soon. The American Electronics Association \n2003 Cyberstates report found unemployment among computer programmers \njumped from 4.5 percent in 2001 to 6.2 percent in 2003. High tech \nemployment fell by 540,000 jobs to 6 million in 2002 and a further loss \nof 234,000 jobs was expected in 2003.\n  The average American may think the Federal Government is helping \nthose technology workers and service workers whose jobs have been \ndisplaced by trade. But the reality is that assistance is not available \nbecause the trade assistance law, which was authored in 1962 for \ndisplaced manufacturing workers, did not contemplate the tremendous \nnumber of jobs we now have in the technology sector, with all of those \nsoftware programmers and engineers and designers. The U.S. trade \nassistance laws were designed for the manufacturing era.\n  Since 1962, when workers lost their jobs in a manufacturing plant as \na result of trade, they could get help through the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Act has, in fact, \nhelped hundreds of thousands of those displaced workers. But workers in \nthe technology and the services sector, which now accounts for four-\nfifths of the U.S. workforce, have not been eligible for trade \nadjustment assistance. Time after time when a displaced software \ndeveloper, accountant, or someone who has worked in the telemedicine \nfield has gone knocking on the doors of the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram, they have been turned away. The bipartisan amendment I have \ndeveloped with Senator Coleman will open the doors of the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Act to the hundreds of thousands of displaced \ntechnology and service sector workers.\n  All of these workers who have been displaced by trade and by global \nmarketplace forces deserve the same kinds of benefits. All of them have \na chance to use these programs as a trampoline back into the private \neconomy, so they can capture the jobs for which their skills have \nblessed them. Our amendment will establish equity in the program \nbetween manufacturing and service workers.\n  The Wyden-Coleman amendment will cover three categories of trade-\nimpacted service workers: those who lose their jobs when their employer \ncloses or lays off because of import competition; public and private \nsector service workers who lose their jobs when their facility moves \noverseas; and secondary service workers who provide services to a \nprimary firm where workers are eligible for trade adjustment assistance \nand where a closure has caused a layoff or closure at a secondary firm.\n  This is an extraordinarily important statute because it provides \nretraining, income support, health insurance tax credits, and other \nbenefits to workers who lose their jobs. It can also help secondary \nworkers or individuals who supply parts or services and who may have \nlost their jobs because their facilities shut down due to import \ncompetition or they move overseas. This is exactly the type of trade-\ndisplaced service worker opportunity that our citizens need.\n\n  A self-described ``newly employed software engineer'' from Hillsboro, \nOR, wrote in December that ``my job was moved to India where the \ncompany can pay Indians a fifth of what they pay Americans.''\n  Another wrote:\n\n       [A]s a 50-year-old high-tech manufacturing engineer with 26 \n     years' experience, I was laid off in December 2002. I am sure \n     the new factory the company is building in China will prevent \n     my ever returning. I can't even get hired into an entry level \n     position anywhere because I am over-qualified.\n\n  These unemployed Oregonians and the hundreds of thousands of other \ninformation technology professionals who have lost their jobs deserve \nan opportunity to get the training, health care, and income assistance \nso they can get back on their feet and use their skills in the private \nmarketplace. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Act would target these \nkinds of workers who have been hurt by unfair competition.\n  Globalization of information technology hardware production from 1995 \nthrough 2002 cut information technology hardware costs 10 to 30 \npercent, translating into higher productivity growth and adding $230 \nbillion to our gross domestic product. Information technology became \naffordable to business sectors that were previously bypassed by the \nproductivity boom.\n  We are now talking about the small and midsized companies in health \ncare, construction, and a host of related fields. But as information \ntechnology hardware prices declined, the importance of information \ntechnology services and software increased to almost 70 percent of \ninformation technology spending in 2001. With the growth in software \nand services outpacing hardware spending by almost two to one, the \ndemand for cheaper information technology services has lent strength to \nthis whole trend to move these jobs offshore. No one appears to have \nanticipated the extraordinary speed in which all of this has taken \nplace or the scale of jobs moving offshore.\n  The workers who lost their jobs and their livelihoods from jobs that \nhave gone overseas cannot afford to wait for the higher skilled jobs \nthat economists keep telling them is right around the corner. Higher \nvalue and higher paid systems integration jobs may come along, but in \nthis period unemployed information technology professionals seem to \nfeel they are more likely to see Elvis than a sudden proliferation of \nnew highly skilled information technology jobs.\n  At the end of the day, what I am saying, along with the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota, is it should be irrelevant whether an \nindividual works in today's economy in the services and technology \nsector or whether they work in the manufacturing area. Each of our \nworkers who has been displaced by trade should be eligible for the same \nbenefits. That is what our bipartisan proposal would do. The hundreds \nof thousands of workers who have been laid off in every part of our \ncountry in the technology sector and in the service sector are looking \nto whether the\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\nSenate will modernize the trade adjustment laws so they finally can get \na fair shake and so they can pick up the skills and the health care and \nthe income support that is going to let them get back on their feet, \nuse their ingenuity, and use their work ethic to have a chance for a \nhigh-skill, high-wage job once again.\n\n  I call on the Senate in a time of discussion about gridlock and the \ninability to move forward on important legislation. This is an example \nof two Senators who have worked with colleagues from both political \nparties to come up with a proposal that can help hundreds of thousands \nof workers in an economic crunch today that is sure to continue. We \nhope the Senate will move expeditiously on our legislation.\n  It seems to me, to put it in the context of my home State, that when \na worker who is a software programmer in Beaverton, OR, works hard and \nplays by the rules, it ought to be the job of the Senate to say when \nthat worker is up against a software programmer in Beijing and the \nBeijing worker works for a fraction of the wages of the worker in \nBeaverton we create policies which are going to make it possible for \nour workers to move ahead to have the kind of quality of life that will \nallow them to support a family and participate in the community.\n  I call on the Senate to pass our bipartisan proposal as soon as \npossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation? Are we \nback on the motion to proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to speak in support of S. \n2207, the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act of 2004.\n  This bill helps to remedy the exploding medical liability and \nlitigation crisis in our country, which is preventing patients from \nreceiving high-quality health care--or, in some cases, any care at \nall--because doctors are being driven out of practice. In fact, this \ncrisis hits us on two fronts, preventing many Americans from getting \nthe vital health care they need, and raising the overall costs of \nhealth care for nearly all Americans.\n  As you will recall, this legislation is not our first attempt to \nrelieve this crisis in access to care. Most recently, we debated S. \n2061, which failed to receive the 60 votes necessary to invoke cloture \nin February, and we debated S. 11 prior to that. We can ill afford to \nignore the many Americans whose doctors are retiring early or \nrestricting their practices because of rising malpractice costs.\n  This health care crisis is jeopardizing access to health care in my \nhome State of Utah and around the country.\n  The medical liability crisis is also inhibiting efforts to improve \npatient safety and stifling medical innovation. Excessive litigation is \nadding billions of dollars in increased costs. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that total savings to Medicare, Medicaid and the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Program would be $15 billion in direct \nhealth care costs by passing medical liability reform. A Department of \nHealth and Human Services report estimates that we could save $70 \nbillion to $126 billion in defensive medicine costs. And they are \nreally on the conservative side. I said 20 years ago, as a former \nmedical liability defense lawyer defending doctors, health care \nproviders, nurses, and so forth, knowing that most of those suits were \nfrivolous to begin with, that there was at least $300 billion in \nunnecessary defensive medicine. Now we all want defensive medicine. We \nwant doctors to do everything they can to help. But I am talking about \nunnecessary defensive medicine, unnecessary tests, unnecessary costs, \nunnecessary x-rays, unnecessary MRIs, unnecessary CAT scans, \nunnecessary cardiovascular tests, unnecessary respiratory tests and \nother types of tests that are not needed but are insisted upon by \ndoctors because they want to have in their history every possible \nprotection.\n\n  Even the American Medical Association admits there are at least $65 \nbillion in unnecessary defensive medicine costs. When you get the AMA \nto admit that, you know it probably is a lot higher. In fact, it is \ncosting every American, because we will not do anything about getting \nthese frivolous suits under control. It is wrecking our health care \nprofession in this country.\n  The liability crisis is also reducing access to high-quality health \ncare. The 2004 survey by Medical Group Management Association of almost \n13,000 physicians found that 15.6 percent of responding groups reported \nthat their physicians plan to retire, relocate or restrict their \nservices over the next three years.\n  These numbers have been consistent in large studies done in New York, \nCalifornia, Colorado and my home state of Utah.\n  However, the equally troubling statistics are that only two percent \nof cases with actual negligent injuries result in claims and less than \none-fifth--17 percent--of claims filed actually involve a negligent \ninjury. In other words, the deserving injured are going uncompensated, \nwhile a great deal of litigants with spurious claims tie up our court \nsystem and cost all of us unnecessary billions of dollars.\n  This situation has been likened to a traffic cop who regularly gives \nout more tickets to drivers who go through green lights than to those \nwho run red lights. That is clearly no way to ensure traffic safety, \nand we should not accept such an inefficient and inequitable method of \nensuring patient safety.\n  These numbers are a searing indictment of the current medical \nliability system. I believe we can do better for the American people \nand the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act is an important \nstep along that path. We must do better.\n  Today's proposed legislation addresses two areas in dire need of \nrelief: trauma care and obstetrical care.\n\n  Many physician groups are no longer able to be oncall for hospital \nemergency departments. As medical care to trauma victims, especially \nchildren, is by its nature high risk, many doctors can no longer afford \nto treat pediatric trauma patients. The problem is also acute for women \nwho need obstetrical and gynecological care because OB/GYN is among the \ntop three specialties with the highest professional liability insurance \npremiums. This has led to many doctors leaving their practice and to a \nshortage of doctors in many States, including my own home State of \nUtah. For example, Utah physician Dr. Catherine Wheeler would have to \ndeliver more than 60 babies each year just to pay for her medical \nliability insurance, which is over $70,000. Although she works 80 hours \nper week, after she pays her malpractice premiums and other costs, she \ntakes home money for only 2\\1/2\\ months of the year.\n  Utah Medical Association data show that medical liability insurance \npremiums continue to increase rapidly, creating pressure on doctors to \nrestrict service in Utah. In 2002, there was a 30-percent rise. Last \nyear, premiums rose 20 percent. This year, they are projected to \nincrease 15 percent in Utah.\n  Studies by both the Utah Medical Association and the Utah Chapter of \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, ACOG, \nunderscore the problem in my State.\n  Utah Medical Association data show that over half of the family \npractitioners in Utah have already given up obstetrical services or \nhave never practiced obstetrics even though they were trained to do so. \nOf the remaining practitioners who still deliver babies, nearly one-\nthird say they plan to stop providing OB services within the next \ndecade--most within 5 years. A Utah ACOG survey found that 15 of the \n106 members polled had already stopped practicing obstetrics, and 21 of \nthe remaining 91 plan to stop within 5 years. These changes in \npractice, such as retiring, relocating, or dropping obstetrics because \nof the medical liability reform crisis, leaves almost 1,500 pregnant \nwomen in Utah without OB/GYN care.\n  The medical liability crisis, while affecting all medical specialties \nand practices, hits OB/GYN practices especially hard. Astonishingly, \nover three-fourths--76.5 percent--of obstetrician/gynecologists report \nbeing sued at least once in their individual careers. Indeed, over one-\nfourth of OB/GYN doctors will be sued for care given during their \nresidency. These numbers have discouraged Americans finishing medical \nschool from choosing this vital specialty.\n  Currently, one-third of OB-GYN residency slots are filled by foreign \nmedical graduates, compared to only 14\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n\npercent one decade ago. OB/GYN doctors are particularly vulnerable to \nunjustified lawsuits because of the tendency to blame the doctor for \nbrain-injured infants, although research has proven that physician \nerror is responsible for less than 4 percent of all neurologically \nimpaired babies.\n  Jury awards have been escalating at an alarming rate. Data from Jury \nVerdict Research show that the average liability award increased 176 \npercent from 1994 to 2001. The average jury award is $3.9 million. Over \nhalf of all awards are $1 million or more. This crisis is threatening \nAmericans' confidence in our health care system to take care of their \nmedical needs. Over three-fourths of Americans fear that skyrocketing \nmedical liability costs could limit their access to care, and indeed \nthat is already happening. AMA, the American Medical Association, data \nshow that 19 States--19 States--have serious patient access problems, \nand 25 more, including my own home State of Utah, are nearing crisis.\n  An August 2003 GAO report concluded that actions taken by health \nproviders as a result of skyrocketing malpractice premiums have \ncontributed to health care access problems. These problems include \nreduced access to hospital-based services for deliveries, especially in \nrural areas.\n\n  In addition, the report indicated that States that have enacted tort \nreform laws with caps on noneconomic damages have slower growth rates \nin medical malpractice premiums and claims payments. From 2001 to 2002, \nthe average premiums for medical malpractice insurance increased about \n10 percent in States with caps on noneconomic damages. In comparison, \nStates with more limited reforms experienced an increase of 29 percent \nin medical malpractice premiums each year.\n  Medical liability litigation directly and dramatically increases \nhealth care costs for all Americans. In addition, skyrocketing medical \nlitigation costs indirectly increase health care costs by changing the \nway doctors practice medicine.\n  ``Defensive medicine'' is defined as medical care that is primarily \nor solely motivated by fear of malpractice claims and not by the \npatient's medical condition. According to a survey of 1,800 doctors \npublished in the journal entitled Medical Economics, more than three-\nfourths of doctors felt they must practice defensive medicine. A 1998 \nstudy of defensive medicine by Dr. Mark McClellan, using national \nhealth expenditure data, found that medical liability reform had the \npotential to reduce defensive medicine expenses by $69 billion to $124 \nbillion in the year 2001. You can imagine what that number is today.\n  I remember, as a medical malpractice defense lawyer, I would tell \ndoctors: You are just pigeons in a shooting gallery. The fact is, \nphysicians have to have a history of treatments they have provided to \ntheir patients so they can prove that they did everything possible to \nprevent any real problems with their respective patients. Consequently, \ndoctors have had to do that over the years because of the skyrocketing \nmedical liability claims being made, a good 90 percent of which are, \nfor the most part, spurious and frivolous.\n  The financial toll of defensive medicine is great, and especially \nsignificant for reform purposes, as it does not produce any positive \nhealth benefits. Not only does defensive medicine increase health care \ncosts, it also puts Americans at avoidable risk. Nearly every test and \nevery treatment has possible side effects; thus, every unnecessary \ntest, procedure, and treatment potentially puts a patient in harm's \nway. Seventy-six percent of physicians are concerned that malpractice \nlitigation has hurt their ability to provide quality care to patients.\n  What can we do to address this crisis? The answer is, plenty; and \nthere are excellent examples of what works. Last March, HHS released a \nreport describing how reasonable reforms in some States have reduced \nhealth care costs and improved access to quality health care. More \nspecifically, over the last 2 years, in States with limits of $250,000 \nto $350,000 on noneconomic damages, premiums have increased at an \naverage of just 18 percent compared to 45 percent in States without \nsuch limits.\n  California enacted the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act, also \nknown as MICRA, more than a quarter century ago. MICRA slowed the rate \nof increase in medical liability premiums dramatically without \naffecting negatively the quality of health care received by California \nState residents. As a result, doctors are not leaving California.\n  Furthermore, between 1976 and the year 2000, premiums increased by \n167 percent in California, while they increased three times as much--\n505 percent--in the rest of the country. Now, both percentage increases \nare high, but 505 percent is extremely high in comparison to a very \nlitigious State like California. Consequently, Californians were saved \nbillions of dollars in health care costs and Federal taxpayers were \nsaved billion of dollars in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs because \nof the California restraint on medical malpractice claims, especially \nthose that are not proper claims.\n  No one in this body, perhaps with the exception of our colleague from \nTennessee, Dr. Bill Frist, our majority leader, is more keenly aware of \nthe defects in this system than I am. I used to try these cases, and I \ncan say from a practical standpoint that a lot of lawyers bring cases \nthat really are frivolous, because the cost of defending these cases \ncan be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  Many insurance companies will pay off those defense costs to get rid \nof the case rather than take the chance a runaway jury will cost them \neven more. That is what is happening. It is happening in hundreds, \nperhaps thousands, of cases throughout the country. Most of these cases \nshould have never been filed, however, there are a small number of \ncases that are very serious and it is appropriate for our judicial \nsystem to take care of them.\n  Before coming to Congress, I litigated several medical liability \ncases. I have seen heart-wrenching cases in which mistakes were made, \nwhere there was negligence. But more often, I have seen heart-wrenching \ncases in which mistakes were not made. Doctors were forced to spend \nvaluable time and resources defending themselves against these \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  A recent Institute of Medicine report, ``To Err is Human,'' concluded \nthat:\n\n       The majority of medical errors do not result from \n     individual recklessness or the actions of a particular group. \n     This is not a bad apple problem. More commonly, errors are \n     caused by faulty systems, processes, and conditions that lead \n     people to make mistakes or fail to prevent them.\n\n  We need reform to improve the health care system and processes that \nallow errors to occur and to identify better when real medical \nliability has occurred. The reform I envision would address litigation \nabuses in order to provide swift and appropriate compensation for \nmalpractice victims, redress for serious problems, and ensure medical \nliability costs do not prevent patients from accessing the care they \nreally need. So we need to move ahead with legislation to improve \npatient safety and reduce medical errors, and we need to urgently \naddress the medical liability crisis so more women are not denied \naccess to quality medical care because it has become too expensive for \ntheir OB/GYN doctors to continue their practice, and so we do not \njeopardize trauma patients' access to urgently needed medical \nattention.\n  The Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act of 2004 will \nallow us to begin ensuring that women, babies, and trauma patients get \nthe medical care they need and deserve.\n  Without tort reform, juries are awarding astounding and unreasonable \nsums for pain and suffering. A sizable portion of those awards goes to \nthe attorney rather than the patient. It is often estimated as high as \n50 percent. The result is doctors cannot get insurance and patients \ncannot get the care they need.\n  All Americans deserve the access to care, the cost savings, and the \nlegal protections States like California provide their residents. \nToday's bill will allow us to begin to address this crisis in our \nhealth care system. It will give trauma patients and women and their \nbabies access to their doctors, and it will enable doctors to provide \nhigh quality, cost-effective medical care.\n  America's medical liability system is broken. It is not ensuring \npatient safety, and it is causing shortages of vital health care \nthroughout the country. Congressional action to pass medical\n\n[[Page S3762]]\n\nliability reform legislation is imperative. I strongly support this \nlegislation and I urge my colleagues to support cloture and end this \nfilibuster that will now be the third time effective changes in these \nlaws is being attempted. Our pregnant women deserve better. They \ndeserve the best quality care the medical system can provide. Our \ntrauma victims deserve better. We are finding all over the country \ntrauma centers are either starting to shut down or severely cutting \nback because they can no longer afford to fight these frivolous cases. \nThey can't function in a health care system that doesn't work. That is \na tragedy, especially for those who suffer from trauma-related \ninjuries.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote for cloture on this bill. I hope we \ncan proceed and pass medical liability reform which is long overdue. I \nstrongly support S. 2207 and urge my colleagues to do what is in the \nbest interest of patients and health care providers throughout the \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is remarkable that in 29 years here in \nthe Senate--several times the Senate under the control of Democrats, \nseveral times the Senate under the control of Republicans--I have never \nseen so little accomplished and I have never seen so much political \nposturing on the Senate floor which then gets put into fundraising \nletters and fundraising appeals. I have never seen so much special \ninterest legislation. But the bottom line is I have never seen so \nlittle accomplished. Probably there is a corollary.\n  Instead of doing the people's business, we seem to be doing political \naction committee business. And that is why, of course, nothing gets \ndone.\n  Let's talk about this. If there were ever a piece of legislation on \nwhich politics is being played, it is the medical malpractice bill. It \nis a one-size-fits-all bill for a problem that is really different from \nState to State. Basically we are telling the 50 State legislatures and \nGovernors that the Members of the U.S. Senate know a lot more about \ntheir States' needs than they do and that the U.S. Senate will dictate \na change. We will override their courts and their legislatures. We will \noverride their laws and we will make life better for them. But when we \ndo, of course, we yank away the rights of the States and the people \nthere. Whenever we target the rights of the public and we try to figure \nout ways to run roughshod over a State, we ought to be pretty careful \nhow we do it.\n  Normally you would think we would have committee hearings. We would \ntry to have a bipartisan bill. We would have something that would \ndemonstrate to the States, as we take away their rights, that such a \nmove has been considered by all 100 Senators and there is a consensus. \nInstead, we have a piece of legislation written by lobbyists and \nspecial interests that is so bad nobody even dares send it to a \ncommittee--not even friendly committees. They send it right to the \nfloor.\n  This is the third time the Republicans have taken this partisan \napproach. Last July they employed this partisan tactic and failed to \npass legislation. Earlier this year, they tried to rush through the \nSenate a bill to limit the legal rights of the most vulnerable \npatients--mothers and infants--and they failed. Now they are again \nrushing an extreme bill overriding the laws of each of the 50 States. \nThis time, however, the bill is not limited to obstetrical and \ngynecological care. Now they want to extend the restrictions on legal \nrights to trauma and emergency care. The third time for this partisan \napproach is no charm. Republicans' mad dash to push through this \nproposal in this election year under the guise of reducing health care \ncosts is a blatant attempt not to reduce health care costs, which we \nwould all support, but to exploit their own political agenda.\n  I remember the article last year in Washington Monthly, titled \n``Malpractice Makes Perfect: How the GOP Milks a Phony Doctors' \nInsurance Crisis.'' This article was so good, it was nominated for a \nNational Magazine Award. It shows how Republicans launched a \nsophisticated lobbying campaign with business interests to manipulate \nthe medical malpractice debate and change it from one about medical \nerrors and fair compensation, pitting one political constituency \nagainst another.\n  I commend to my colleagues the article to which I referred from the \nWashington Monthly of October 1, 2003, by Stephanie Mencimer.\n  Mr. President, the article points out clearly that even if we passed \nthis legislation, insurance rates would not have come down. There is no \none who with a straight face can say that if we pass this legislation, \nthen insurance rates will come down. Insurance companies would not be \nspending so much money trying to get this passed if they thought so.\n  Once again, Republicans have proposed a plan that would cap non-\neconomic damages across the Nation at $250,000--whether you live in \nCalifornia, Ohio, Vermont, or anywhere else; no matter what the injury, \nthat is the cap.\n  The so-called medical malpractice reform debate too often ignores the \nmen, women and children whose lives have been dramatically--and often \npermanently--altered by medical errors.\n  I will give you a real-life example in my State of Vermont. On April \n7, 2000, Diana Winn Levine had a severe migraine headache. That is \nsomething that has probably happened to most of us at one time or \nanother. She went to a health center in Plainfield, VT. She was a \nmusician. She received a painkiller and an injection of a mild \nsedative, Phenergan. This combination was injected into her artery \nrather than her vein, and resulting circulatory problems led to this \nmusician having to have two amputation surgeries on her right arm.\n  Ms. Levine sued the corporate giant, Wyeth, for improper instructions \nfor using its drug, Phenergan. As she said:\n\n       I never expected to sue anyone in my life; I'm not the \n     suing type.\n\n  Sometimes it takes something like this to make it known when a drug \nis not being used right.\n  There was a full trial. I remember reading the account of the trial. \nWhen they went to swear Ms. Levine in for her testimony, the bailiff \nasked her to raise her right hand. Of course, she had no right hand. \nThat jury in Vermont--and our juries are pretty careful--found that Ms. \nLevine deserved $2.4 million for her past and future medical expenses, \nand $5 million for the ``daily pain she does suffer and for the loss of \nenjoyment of her life.'' Of course, most of that would have been \nslashed by this legislation. Crowds of the children Ms. Levine had \nworked with on musical projects--children she'd brought joy to as a \nmusician--sat in the courtroom of the Montpelier Superior Court. She \nsaid:\n\n       That was the day they actually showed pictures of my dead \n     hand . . . before amputation, with the gangrene. I worried \n     about how the kids would react to my disfigurement. I told \n     the mom to cover her eyes. But afterward she came up to me \n     and said, ``We just didn't know what you have been through.''\n\n  Now, Wyeth, of course, was well represented. They had a team of six \nlawyers--two from Vermont and four from Washington, DC. They did, after \nall, have 2003 revenues of $15.8 billion and keep a $1.3 billion \nreserve fund because of the ongoing litigation over their diet drugs.\n  Again I say: This musician would have been cut out entirely if the \nU.S. Senate were to overwrite the laws of our State.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the \nBurlington Free Press be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Mar. 16, 2004]\n\n                      Vt. Woman Wins $7.4M Lawsuit\n\n                          (By Stephen Klernan)\n\n       A Marshfield musician who lost an arm to a medical error \n     has won one of the largest lawsuit awards in Vermont history.\n       Diana Winn Levine, owner and creative director of Rebop \n     Records, had sued the multinational health products company \n     Wyeth for having improper guidelines for the drug that \n     damaged her hand and forearm and led to amputation.\n       A Montpelier jury on Friday awarded Levine $7.4 million.\n       ``Sometimes it takes something like this to make it known, \n     when a drug is not being used right,'' Levine said Monday.\n       The weeklong trial, pitting a central Vermont bass player \n     and guitarist against one of the world's largest health \n     products companies, featured testimony by family\n\n[[Page S3763]]\n\n     members and well-known Vermont musicians, as well as gallery \n     crowds of children involved in Rebop recordings.\n\n\n                           not the suing type\n\n       Levine was suffering from a migraine April 7, 2000, when \n     she went to the Health Center in Plainfield. She received a \n     painkiller, and an injection of a mild sedative, Phenergan.\n       In what she called ``a medical blunder,'' the drug entered \n     her artery rather than her vein. Resulting circulatory \n     problems led to two amputation surgeries on her right arm.\n       The case against Wyeth pertained to the company's \n     instructions for using the drug, Levine said.\n       ``I never expected to sue anybody in my life; I'm not the \n     suing type,'' she said. Then she learned that ``Phenergan, \n     which is toxic, can be given in three ways. The other two are \n     fine. What happened to me can happen, it is foreseeable.''\n       The trial, in which she was represented by Richard Rubin, \n     David Kidney and Kerry DeWolfe, featured considerable drama.\n\n\n                          importance of music\n\n       ``We played a lot of music for the jury,'' Rubin said, ``We \n     showed videotapes of her performing.''\n       Folksinger Jonathan Gailmor testified on Levine's behalf.\n       ``Jon expressed it so amazingly, how important music is in \n     life, and how he couldn't even imagine losing the ability to \n     play,'' she said.\n       Crowds of the children Levine has worked with on musical \n     projects, such as Rebop's latest CD ``Even Kids Get the \n     Blues,'' sat in the courtroom in Monptelier Superior Court.\n       ``That was the day they actually showed pictures of my dead \n     hand,'' before amputation, with the gangrene,'' Levine said. \n     ``I worried about how the kids would react to my \n     disfigurement. I told the mom to cover her eyes. But \n     afterward she came up to me and said, `We just didn't know \n     what you have been through.' ''\n\n\n                             public airing\n\n       Rubin said one powerful moment in the trial came \n     accidentally.\n       ``We'd spent all this time establishing what it is like to \n     lose your right hand, even if you're not a musician. When \n     someone offers to shake your hand, what do you do? When \n     someone is handing you change at the cash register, what do \n     you do?''\n       Then Levine's turn on the witness stand arrived. The baliff \n     came to swear her in, asking her to raise her right hand.\n       ``We looked at each other, and it hit me first,'' Levine \n     said. ``Then we cracked up. There's my prosthesis, so I said, \n     ``You mean this?''\n       ``She laughed,'' Rubin said, ``but it was a poignant \n     moment.''\n       She was afraid to testify, Levine said, and publicly relive \n     the experience of losing her arm, ``but once you get up \n     there, it just comes out.''\n       Levine became comfortable enough, Rubin said, she showed \n     the jury how her prosthesis works.\n       Levine said the ``ultimate'' was when her 21-year-old \n     daughter testified. ``What mother gets a chance to have her \n     daughter up there, basically saying all these things about \n     how much she appreciated me, and her upbringing in a house \n     full of music?''\n\n\n                           david vs. goliath\n\n       Wyeth had a team of six lawyers, Rubin said, two from \n     Vermont and four from Washington, D.C. The company, with 2003 \n     revenues of $15.8 billion, makes Robitussin, Advil, Centrum \n     and many other health products. The company also has a $1.3 \n     billion reserve fund for ongoing litigation over its diet \n     drugs.\n       Attorneys for Wyeth did not return calls seeking comment.\n       ``But we did not make this case anti-drug company, or anti-\n     out-of-state company,'' Rubin said. ``This case was really \n     about Diana's loss of her ability to play and write music.''\n       ``Music is my way of healing and processing everything that \n     happens to me,'' Levine said. ``The right hand is just the \n     core of your playing. And so much of writing comes not from \n     your head but from what your hands do.''\n       Rubin said the suit sought $2.4 million for Levine's past \n     and foreseeable medical expenses, plus $5 million ``for the \n     daily pain she does suffer and for the lost employment of her \n     life.''\n       The amount of money seems large, he said, but is actually \n     based on ``an hourly rate. We asked the jury to award $25 per \n     hour for her pain and suffering, 16 hours a day, for the next \n     20 years.''\n       The jury deliberated about four hours before awarding her \n     the entire $7.4 million.\n       ``The jury came in, and I'm like, `Prop me up,' my knees \n     were so weak,'' Levine said.\n       State Court Administrator Lee Suskin, said he could only \n     recall one larger financial result from a suit. ``We don't \n     keep track of these things, but it seems an usually large \n     award.''\n       ``That's just on paper,'' Levine said. ``It's almost \n     certain that they will appeal. My bank account is no fuller \n     than it was a month ago.''\n       Wyeth did make one strategic error, Rubin said.\n       ``There was nobody here from Wyeth who knew about the drug \n     and was prepared to defend it from the corporate \n     perspective,'' he said. ``The jury never saw anyone from \n     Wyeth but their lawyers.''\n       Even if there is an appeal, Levine said, ``There's \n     something about retelling that helps you to finish it. And to \n     move on.''\n\n\n                             cracking eggs\n\n       Levine said phantom pain, in which her mind thinks she \n     still has an arm, remains a daily problem. ``You look down \n     there and you see, there is no arm there, kiddo. But the \n     brain thinks there is a giant Mickey Mouse hand that always \n     feels like pins and needles, and as the day goes on it gets \n     worse.''\n       Her salvation is the children she works with, she said, \n     ``They take my mind off it; they have become my healing \n     partners.''\n       Otherwise her life continues to be ``an improvisation. I \n     rode a bike the other day. . . .  It was like being six years \n     old all over again, I've gone from feeling like I was \n     battling one-handed, to feeling like I'm conducting one-\n     handed. . . . \n       ``It has become pretty easy to crack an egg one-handed even \n     if I do wind up with little bits of shell in my eggs.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. We know a lot of our health care system is in crisis. We \nknow some of the giants of our health care system would probably like \nthis legislation to go through so they can make higher profits. Much of \nour health care system is in crisis. That is what we ought to attack.\n  Dramatically rising medical malpractice insurance rates are forcing \nsome doctors to abandon their practices or to cross State lines to find \nmore affordable situations. Patients who need care in high-risk \nspecialties, such as obstetrics, and patients in areas already \nunderserved by health care providers, such as many rural communities, \nare too often left without adequate care.\n  But this bill does nothing to actually reduce medical malpractice \ninsurance rates. Of course, each State has a different experience. \nInsurance remains largely a State-regulated industry because the States \nfound that is the way it works best. But each State ought to look at \nand be left to solve their own unique problems. We should not tell \ntheir Governors and legislatures we are not going to let them solve \ntheir own problems because we will take it over for them.\n  We don't have the kind of crisis in Vermont that others do. We have \nworked very well with our legislature, and we are still working hard to \nfind answers, as other States have. You know, it is funny. We hear so \nmany speeches that we want to get power out of Washington. We want \nStates to be able to do what they want. We don't want Washington \ndictating everything. Well, not exactly. When you get some very wealthy \ncontributors and very powerful PACs and say, Yes, but if you don't let \nWashington take care of our special interests, nobody will--suddenly it \nchanges.\n  This is an attempt to tally points on some election year political \nscoreboard for powerful special interests at the public's expense. I am \nlooking at the big picture.\n  Some States, such as my own, Vermont, while experiencing problems, do \nnot face as great a crisis as others. Vermont's legislature is \nconsidering legislation to find the right answers for our State, and \nthe same process is underway now in other States. In contrast, in \nStates such as West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Florida, and New Jersey, \ndoctors have walked out of work in protest over the exorbitant rates \nbeing extracted from them by their insurance carriers.\n  Instead of letting States find solutions that are best for their \ncitizens, the Republicans prefer this attempt to tally points on some \nelection year political scoreboard for powerful special interests, at \nthe public's expense. Instead of looking at the big picture--at overly \nbroad antitrust immunity, ways to reduce medical errors, and at other \nreal issues that could make a real difference--the majority has chosen \nto coddle big insurance companies instead of to cure the problem.\n  Instead of letting the States continue to find solutions that are \nbest for their citizens, they would take a chainsaw to the legal rights \nof the American people and to the prerogatives of each of the 50 States \nwe represent here in the United States Senate.\n  Thoughful solutions to the situation will require creative thinking, \na genuine effort to rectify the problem, and bipartisan consensus to \nachieve real reform. Unfortunately, these are not the characteristics \nof the bill before us. Indeed, S. 2207 is a partisan bill that was \nintroduced only a few days ago without any committee consideration.\n  Ignoring the central truth of this crisis--that it is a problem in \nthe insurance industry, not the tort system--the\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\nmajority has proposed a plan that would cap noneconomic damages across \nthe Nation at $250,000 in medical malpractice cases.\n  The notion that such a one-size-fits-all scheme is the answer runs \ncounter to the factual experience of the States. Most importantly, the \nmajority's proposal does nothing to protect true victims of medical \nmalpractice and nothing to prevent malpractice in the first place.\n  We are fortunate in this Nation to have many highly qualified medical \nprofessionals, and this is especially true in my own home State of \nVermont. Unfortunately, good doctors sometimes make errors. It is also \nunfortunate that some not-so-good doctors manage to make their way into \nthe health care system as well. While we must do all that we can to \nsupport the men and women who commit their professional lives to caring \nfor others, we must also ensure that patients have access to adequate \nremedies should they receive inadequate care.\n  High malpractice insurance premiums are not the direct result of \nmalpractice lawsuit verdicts. They are the result of investment \ndecisions by the insurance companies and of business models geared \ntoward ever-increasing profits as well as the cyclical hardening of the \nliability insurance market. In cases where an insurer has made a bad \ninvestment, or has experienced the same disappointments from Wall \nStreet that so many Americans have, it should not be able to recoup its \nlosses from the doctors it insures.\n  The insurance company should have to bear the burdens of its own \nbusiness model, just as the other businesses in the economy do. And a \nnationwide arbitrary capping of awards available to victims--as the \nmajority has proposed again and again--should not be the first and only \nsolution turned to in a tough medical malpractice insurance market.\n  The problem at hand deserves thoughtful and collaborative \nconsideration in committee to achieve a sensible solution that is fair \nto patients and that supports our medical professionals in their \nability to practice quality health care. One aspect of the insurance \nindustry's business model requires a legislative correction: Its \nblanket exemption from Federal antitrust laws. Insurers have for \nyears--too many years--enjoyed a benefit that is novel in our \nmarketplace. The McCarran-Ferguson Act permits insurance companies to \noperate without being subject to most of the Federal antitrust laws, \nand our Nation's physicians and their patients have been the worse off \nfor it.\n  Using their exemption, insurers can collude to set rates, resulting \nin higher premiums than true competition would achieve--and because of \nthis exemption, enforcement officials cannot investigate any such \ncollusion. If Congress is serious about controlling rising premiums, we \nmust objectively limit this overly broad exemption in the McCarran-\nFerguson Act.\n  More than a year ago, I introduced the ``Medical Malpractice \nInsurance Antitrust Act of 2003,'' S. 352. I want to thank Senators \nReid, Kennedy, Durbin, Edwards, Rockefeller, Feingold, Boxer and \nCorzine for cosponsoring this essential and straightforward \nlegislation.\n  Our bill modifies the McCarran-Ferguson Act with respect to medical \nmalpractice insurance, and only for the most pernicious antitrust \noffenses: price fixing, bid rigging, and market allocations. Only those \nanticompetitive practices that most certainly will affect premiums are \naddressed. I am hard-pressed to imagine that anyone could object to a \nprohibition on insurance carriers' fixing prices or dividing \nterritories. After all, the rest of our Nation's industries manage \neither to abide by these laws or pay the consequences.\n  Many State insurance commissioners police the industry well within \nthe power they are accorded in their own laws, and some States have \nantitrust laws of their own that could cover some anticompetitive \nactivities in the insurance industry. Our legislation is a scalpel, not \na chainsaw. It would not affect regulation of insurance by State \ninsurance commissioners and other State regulators. But there is no \nreason to continue, unexamined, a system in which the Federal enforcers \nare precluded from prosecuting the most harmful antitrust violations \njust because they are committed by insurance companies.\n  Our legislation is a carefully tailored solution to one critical \naspect of the problem of excessive medical malpractice insurance rates. \nI had hoped for quick action by the Judiciary Committee and then by the \nfull Senate to ensure that this important step on the road to genuine \nreform is taken before too much more damage is done to the physicians \nof this country and to the patients they care for. But our legislation \nto narrow this loophole in the Nation's anti-trust laws for medical \nmalpractice insurers has languished for more than a year in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Instead of conducting hearings and a markup on our bill, the majority \nnow rushes a ``tort reform'' agenda item to the floor without any \ncommittee consideration.\n  If Congress is serious about controlling rising medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums, then we must limit the broad exemption to Federal \nantitrust law and promote real competition in the insurance industry, \nas well as attack this problem at its core by reducing medical errors \nacross our health care system. Unfortunately, the partisan bill before \nus is not designed for creating a solution to a serious problem. \nInstead, it is designed purely for politics, and that is not only a \nwaste of the Senate's time and of the public's trust; it is also a \nshame.\n  Overly broad antitrust immunity, which the insurance companies have, \nallows them to fix prices any way they want, whether it is justifiable \nor not. Antitrust immunity allows them to take their failed investments \nand try to make it up by charging doctors higher malpractice insurance. \nWe ought to find ways to reduce medical errors. But the big thing is we \nend up coddling these insurance companies. We don't call them to task. \nWe don't get them to say whether they are spending out this money on \nmalpractice awards. Of course, they are not. A lot of their losses came \nbecause they speculated wrong in the stock market. Suddenly, we have to \nbail them out. Get rid of their antitrust immunity, something that \nmakes no sense in today's day and age with conglomerates. Make them \nactually say what they base it on. You will find that they are not \nbeginning to pay out the amounts their malpractice claims say they are.\n  We are fortunate in this Nation to have so many highly qualified \nmedical professionals. This is especially true in Vermont. But you have \nto know sometimes good doctors make mistakes, just as sometimes a good \nengineer will make a mistake. But it is also unfortunate that sometimes \nnot-so-good doctors manage to make their way into the health care \nsystem. I think we should do all we can to support the men and women \nwho commit their professional lives to caring for others, but we also \nought to have some way of responding when somebody gets highly \ninadequate medical attention.\n  When you have a case, as I said before, like the Levine case in \nVermont, when you have somebody whose livelihood was playing musical \ninstruments and they lose an arm because Wyeth Pharmaceuticals made a \nmistake, then there should be some way to respond. Under this \nlegislation, they would not be able to.\n\n  The bottom line is, we have a piece of legislation that is designed \nto be introduced not to improve the question of medical malpractice \ninsurance, it is designed not to make hospitals safer, it is designed \nnot to make patients safer, it is designed not to save money. It is \ndesigned to raise money. I guarantee you after the vote on this issue, \nall the fundraising letters will go out: Isn't it terrible, isn't it \nterrible, the Senate is standing in the way of much-needed malpractice \nreform?\n  It will not say: There were some in the Senate who were willing to \nstand up and not let the Senate run roughshod over our State \nlegislatures.\n  It will not say: There are some in the Senate who were willing to \nstand up and say the insurance companies are not telling the truth on \nthis issue.\n  It will not say: Some in the Senate were saying the very powerful \ncontributors to the Republican Party with their $1 million ads are \nwrong and somebody had to say no. It won't say that.\n\n[[Page S3765]]\n\n  But what it will say is the Senate would have wasted another week and \na whole lot of fundraising letters will go out.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the thought occurred to me, even though we \nhave not done much here in the last few days, the last few months, or \nso, we see a number of people come to the floor and say we have to have \nimmediate votes on the handful of the remaining judicial nominations. \nThey say there is a handful out there we have to have. Interestingly, \nthey are ignoring that 173 judges have already been confirmed, ignoring \nthe fact that when Democrats were in control of the Senate we moved \nPresident Bush's judges through a lot faster than Republicans have. But \nI suppose if they talk enough about it, people will not realize the \nRepublicans have moved far slower on President Bush's nominees than the \nDemocrats did. But there is another point.\n  What they are really saying is that we have to give $163,000 a year \nlifetime jobs to three of the most controversial judicial nominees \nsubmitted by President Bush. To hear them talk, one would think this is \nthe number one priority on the part of the American people: is giving \nthree judges--highly controversial, highly political, highly \nideological--a lifetime job paying $150,000, $160,000, $170,000 a year.\n  Frankly, I think a lot more people are worried about the millions of \nAmericans who have lost their jobs and the millions more who worry they \nare going to be the next victims of outsourcing. I think that is really \nwhat is on the mind of the American public, not three more highly paid \nlifetime judicial appointments. They are far more worried about the \nmillions of Americans who are out of jobs, millions of Americans who \nare seeing their jobs go to India and everywhere else, and millions of \nAmerican families where both mother and father bringing in paychecks \nare barely making the mortgage. They are not the ones getting the \n$160,000 a year lifetime jobs.\n  For the public and for the Democratic Members of the Senate, our \nhigher priorities right now have to do with the millions of Americans \nwho are trying to find or keep their jobs. Our higher priorities have \nto do with securing adequate health care for the members of our \nNational Guard and Reserves. Our priorities have to do with getting \ndecent health care for our veterans and our service men and women who \nhave brought the injuries home from service in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n  To be charitable, these crocodile tears about judicial nominations \nare just a tad disingenuous. Let's review the record.\n  The earlier Democratic-led Senate confirmed more Bush judicial \nnominees than the Republican-led Senate has. We confirmed 100 of the \n173 Bush judicial nominees. Democrats actually did better for the \nPresident than the Republicans have.\n  So 173 have been confirmed. Six of the most controversial have been \nblocked. Two of them have been unilaterally appointed by the President \nduring Senate recesses. One has withdrawn to rejoin a lucrative job \nwith a law firm. So three were blocked. I have never heard so many \ntears shed for these three. I don't see any tears shed for the millions \nof Americans out of work. I don't see any tears shed for the millions \nof Americans whose jobs are being outsourced, but one would think that, \nwith these three, the whole Nation is collapsing.\n  The irony is the same people coming down here to the floor and crying \nabout these three, sobbing about these three, did not say one word when \nthey blocked 61 of President Clinton's nominees. They blocked 61, and \nyou would think the sky is falling because we stopped three. Oh, give \nme a break.\n  Let's look at what they do not want to do. During the past two weeks, \nwe have wasted so many hours in quorum calls and cloture votes to serve \nthe Republican leadership's goal of avoiding votes on votes that will \nhelp American families. The Republican leadership is blocking a vote on \nraising the minimum wage. They are blocking a vote on extending \nunemployment benefits. They are blocking a vote on protecting people \nfrom the new overtime regulations of the Department of Labor. Why?\n  During these past two wasted weeks, 687,000 more Americans filed \nfirst-time claims for unemployment insurance, yet Republicans are only \ntalking about three jobs. Give me a break. I suspect the reason they \nare talking about these three is because they do not want the American \npeople to know they blocked unemployment benefits, they blocked raising \nminimum wage, they blocked protecting overtime compensation. These are \nthe people who actually have to go out and pay their mortgages. These \nare the people who actually try to figure out how they are going to pay \nto send their children to school. These are the people who live from \npaycheck to paycheck.\n  I say they blocked the Senate from extending unemployment benefits. \nAccording to figures recently released by the Labor Department, the \nunemployment rate held steady at 5.6 percent because hundreds of \nthousands of people stopped looking for work. They could not find work. \nThis has left too many unemployed Americans without benefits for \nmonths.\n  They call it an economic recovery. It is a jobless economic recovery \nif it is an economic recovery at all because millions of Americans \nstill cannot find jobs. Our law gives them 26 weeks of unemployment \nbenefits, and up until the last day of 2003, if you were still looking \nfor a job, our law would offer a 13-week extension. We tried to make a \n13-week extension. Can we do it? No. Do you know why? Because the \nRepublican leadership will not even allow us to vote on it. Are they \nafraid that maybe some of their own Members might now be feeling more \ncompassion for these millions of Americans who are out of work than \nthey do for three lifetime appointments?\n  Which priorities are they serving? Apparently not most working \nAmericans. They would not even allow a vote on the Cantwell amendment.\n  Then we tried to raise the minimum wage. Why now? The last minimum \nwage was signed into law by President Clinton almost eight years ago. \nWhile they are caterwauling about a $160,000 lifetime job for three \nnominees, do they really believe that families could meet their basic \nneeds on a minimum wage of just $5.15 an hour? The people who are \nmaking $5.15 an hour are real Americans, and the Republicans will not \neven allow us to vote for the first time in eight years to raise the \nminimum wage. The purchasing power of today's minimum wage is already \nbelow that of the minimum wage before 1996. To save the same purchasing \npower as it had in 1968, the minimum wage would need to be $8. Even in \nVermont, where our state leaders have helped working Vermonters earn \nwages that are somewhat more livable, the minimum wage is still worth \nless than it was 35 years ago.\n  More people are out of work, underemployed, and struggling to keep \nroofs over their family's heads and food on the table than at any time \nsince the administration of Herbert Hoover. Today there are more \neconomic pressures squeezing them, with health care costs becoming \nunaffordable and gasoline prices reaching the highest level in my age. \nDespite the millions of American families with children who would \ndirectly benefit from a raise in the Federal minimum wage, Senate \nRepublicans blocked a vote on the Boxer-Kennedy amendment to the \nwelfare bill that would raise the minimum wage to $7 an hour in three \nsteps over a 2-year period.\n  The Republican leadership is also blocking the Senate from making \nsure hard-working Americans are fairly compensated for working \novertime. The Bush administration will soon be releasing final \nregulations changing the Federal rules on overtime pay. They will cut \neight million middle-class Americans out of the ability to earn \novertime pay.\n  We give tens of thousands of dollars in tax breaks to the people who \ngo to these large fundraisers, but we take away overtime for eight \nmillion Americans who are barely making it? In fact, the regulations \nare so slanted against American workers that they will include a list \nof cost-cutting suggestions for big businesses to show them precisely \nhow they can avoid paying overtime compensation to workers not singled \nout in the rules.\n  Bipartisan majorities in both the Senate and in the other body oppose \nwhat the Bush administration wants to do in taking away overtime pay \nfrom eight million Americans, but this year\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\nthe President threatened to veto the Omnibus appropriations bill if it \nincluded provisions to overturn the overtime regulations. After all, \ntoo many people who attend these large fundraisers have been told we \nwill find a way for them to take those eight million workers off the \novertime rolls. And unfortunately the Republican leadership in this and \nthe other body said, yes, Mr. President, if you want to take those \neight million off, we will go along with you, we will take them off.\n  Of course, we want to have another vote, a vote on the Harkin \namendment, to express our disapproval of the labor regulations, either \nvote it up or down. After all, the Republicans are in the majority in \nthis body. If they want to approve of the move of the administration of \nPresident Bush to deny overtime pay to eight million Americans, then \nthey can vote and say they agree with it. We want a vote one way or the \nother, but they will not allow the vote. They are blocking that vote.\n  So I think we ought to talk about real people, people who live from \npaycheck to paycheck. We ought to talk about the votes that are being \nblocked to extend unemployment insurance, the votes that are being \nblocked to raise the minimum wage, the votes that are being blocked \nthat might allow them to collect overtime pay for overtime work. One \ncan imagine in the corporate boardroom they suddenly say, wait a \nminute, we could just have somebody work another 20 hours and we do not \nhave to pay any overtime, we do not have to hire extra people, man, \nthis is wonderful for us. And they can talk about it when they go out \nto the golf club.\n\n  We ought to ask, where are the priorities of the American people? \nWhere are the Democratic priorities in the Senate? Where are the \nRepublican priorities in the Senate? Should our top priority be right \nnow to find good six-figure jobs for a handful of the President's most \ncontroversial activist judicial nominees, or should we give our time \nand attention to the millions of Americans living paycheck to paycheck \nwho need help, the eight million Americans who are suddenly going to \nfind they cannot earn overtime pay, and millions of Americans who have \nnot had a raise in the minimum wage for eight years?\n  I think the priorities of the Democratic Members of the Senate are \nthe people's priorities. Unfortunately, the priorities of my friends on \nthe other side seem to be the priorities of the very privileged few.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we all know we are likely to pass only a \nfew major tax bills this election year, and we know one of the most \nimportant tax bills is the jobs in manufacturing bill that comes up for \na cloture vote tomorrow. We know the only way the JOBS in manufacturing \nbill can pass is a ``yes'' vote on the motion to stop debate or, as we \ncall it in the Senate, cloture. That vote will be tomorrow.\n  Once again, we must ask, will the Democrats say no to cloture? Will \nthey say no to stopping debate? Will they refuse to allow us to get to \nfinality on this very important bipartisan legislation that when it \ncomes to a final vote will overwhelmingly pass in the Senate? Will they \ngo on record opposing the provisions that are in this bill? Democrats \nshould not because this is a bipartisan bill. This is a bill that every \nDemocrat member of the Senate Finance Committee voted yes on to report \nit from committee.\n  Keep in mind that the jobs in manufacturing bill could be the last \ntrain out of town this year. It has to get done if we are going to end \nthe sanctions and tariffs that have been put on U.S. exports to Europe \nas a result of the United States not following our own trade \nagreements.\n  Each time a Member votes against stopping debate, it lessens the \nchance that this bill is going to go forward. In fact, it kills off \nmany good measures in the jobs in manufacturing bill. From the very \nbeginning, this bill was overwhelmingly bipartisan. In fact, there was \na bipartisan agreement that we need to pass this bill because there is \na bipartisan agreement of long standing that the United States agrees \nto international trade agreements, and we have an obligation to do our \npart and live up to those agreements.\n  A ``no'' vote on this motion tomorrow is an obstruction to the \nbipartisanship that is expressed in the language of this bill.\n  I would like to briefly go through some of the measures that are in \nthis jobs in manufacturing bill. What I am going to refer to is what a \nlot of Members of both political parties have asked for the \nconsideration of by my committee and for inclusion in the language of \nthis bill. I will go over what is in this bill and sincerely ask why \nthe Democrat leadership is willing to tell its members to kill the bill \nby voting no to stopping debate.\n  This bill will end $4 billion a year of sanctions against the United \nStates and our exports. As of March 1, those sanctions are being \nimposed against U.S. exports of grain, timber, paper, and manufactured \ngoods.\n  You will later hear my comments on the products that are being hit \nright now by sanctions. I think each Member ought to know how this is \naffecting the economy of their district.\n  First, manufacturing jobs are good jobs in America. They pay 15 \npercent above the national average. If jobs are related to exports, \nthere is a tariff on your exports in another country and we aren't \ncompetitive, those jobs aren't going to exist very long.\n  Think about what that would do in Waterloo, IA, for one-fifth of the \ntractors that come off the assembly line being exported. We couldn't \nafford to lose one-fifth of the jobs at John Deere in Waterloo, IA, \nbecause of these tariffs.\n  We can end the sanctions that are in this bill, but will the \nDemocrats say no to cloture so we don't end sanctions?\n  This bill provides $75 billion of tax relief to our U.S.-based \nmanufacturing sector to promote factory hiring here in the United \nStates. It is not going to benefit corporations for that portion of \ntheir manufacturing overseas.\n  Will the Democrats say no to $75 billion worth of help, and help \ncreate jobs in factories in America, particularly considering the fact \nthat every day you hear comments about outsourcing, and they expect us \nto do something about outsourcing? This bill will do something about \noutsourcing.\n  The jobs in manufacturing bill extends the research and development \ntax credit through next year. This is a domestic tax benefit that \ngenerates research and development in the United States. That \ntranslates into good high-paying jobs for workers in the United \nStates--not overseas. The amendment we had on research and development \npassed overwhelmingly with a bipartisan vote.\n  Why would Democrats say no to a bipartisan provision in this bill? \nWill they? I hope not.\n  The jobs in manufacturing bill extends for 2 years many tax \nprovisions that expired either last year or are going to expire this \nyear. This would include items such as a work opportunity tax credit \nand the welfare-to-work tax credit and make the merger of those credits \npermanent. Senator Bayh and Senator Santorum asked for these \nprovisions, and we included them. Will these Senators vote for cloture? \nThey should.\n  Senator Breaux and Senator Snowe asked for a provision that allows \nnaval shipbuilders to use a method of accounting which results in more \nfavorable income tax credit treatment. We included that provision in \nthis bill for Senator Breaux and Senator Snowe. They each have reasons \nto vote for cloture to get these amendments to the President for his \nsignature.\n\n  There are enhanced depreciation provisions to help the ailing airline \nindustry. Senator Lincoln, Senator Brownback, and Senator Roberts asked \nfor these provisions. I hope they will vote to stop debate tomorrow so \nwe can get to finality on this legislation.\n  There are what is referred to as new homestead provisions. These were \nrequested by Senator Dorgan, Senator Baucus, Senator Thomas, Senator \nEnzi, and Senator Crapo. I hope these Senators will vote to stop debate \nso\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\nwhat they have asked me to do can get to the President for his \nsignature.\n  There are rural development provisions to create businesses in \ncounties that are losing population. For example, they provide \nincentives for starting or expanding rural businesses in a rural \noutmigration county when it hits a certain percentage of outmigration.\n  At the request of Senator Dorgan, we also included a new market tax \ncredit for high outmigration counties. These credits help economic \ndevelopment in rural counties that have lost over 10 percent of their \npopulation.\n  There is only one way this homestead and the new market provisions \ncan become law; that is, to have the Senate stop debate. That takes 60 \nvotes.\n  For Senators we have tried to work with to get their provisions \nincluded, if they aren't willing to help stop debate and move this bill \nalong, why would they even ask me to include provisions in the bill if \nthey do not want this bill to move along?\n  The jobs in manufacturing bill includes brownfields revitalization \nwhich was requested by Senators Lautenberg, Dole, and Inhofe. The bill \nhelps tax-exempt investors that invest in the cleanup and remediation \nof qualified brownfields sites.\n  I hope those Senators who asked me to include their provisions in my \nbill will decide they should vote to stop debate. Without getting over \nthat hurdle, you never get to final passage.\n  Senators Bob Graham, Breaux, and Hatch asked us to include the \nmortgage bonds revenue measure. It would repeal the current rule that \ndoesn't allow revenue bond payments to be used for issuing new \nmortgages.\n  There are 70 cosponsors of this bill. The 70 Members who took time to \nstudy this provision on mortgage revenue bonds and signed it surely \nwant this bill to become law. Otherwise, why would they put their \nsignature on it? That means that tomorrow those 70 Senators ought to be \nstopping debate so we can move on to finality.\n  Another provision is allowing a deduction for private mortgage \ninsurance. This was asked for by Senator Lincoln and Senator Smith. It \nbenefits people struggling to afford a home. I hope no one votes \nagainst their idea. Home ownership is the dream of all Americans. It is \nthe American dream. This provision helps that along a little bit.\n  Some might say we have the highest percentage of home ownership this \ncountry has ever seen at 68 percent. Yes. But what about the other 32 \npercent? This might help some of those people who might not otherwise \nbe able to afford a home.\n  In most cases, you have to buy mortgage insurance. If you buy \nmortgage insurance, it costs money for lower income people who are on \nthe edge of owning a home or not owning a home. This might just help \nthem get their loan through. But a vote against cloture would be a vote \nagainst this deduction that might bring the American dream to a few \nmore young people.\n  Our bill includes the tax credit for employers for wages paid to \nreservists who have been called to active duty. Senator Landrieu and \nSenator Allen asked for this provision. I hope we will have their vote \ntomorrow, if they are serious about helping our guardsmen and \nreservists who have been called to action because of the war on \nterrorism. Otherwise, what is the point of asking me to put this in the \nbill if they are not helping us to move it to finality?\n  At the request of Senator Schumer and Senator Clinton, we have \nextended and enhanced the Liberty Zone bonds provided for the \nrebuilding of Lower Manhattan. We also included $200 million in new tax \ncredits to be used for rail infrastructure projects in the New York \nLiberty Zone; again, responding to the needs of the people in New York \nbecause of what happened on September 11. These two Senators came to me \nand asked for consideration of these provisions in this bill, and in a \nbipartisan way, we try to do things and we have responded accordingly.\n  Are they serious about getting these provisions into law for their \nNew York constituents? If so, then they ought to vote for cloture and \nmove this bill to finality.\n  We even included the renewable communities provisions requested by \nSenators Clinton and Schumer.\n  Will the Senate Democratic leadership ask their members to vote \nagainst Liberty Zone funding for meeting the needs of the people of New \nYork by voting no on cloture? We should not deny funding for the \nLiberty Zone just to prove a political point on a proposed labor \nregulation that may never be finalized in the first place. Even if it \nis finalized, Congress can always overturn it under the Congressional \nReview Act.\n\n  Hundreds of regulations are proposed in Washington every week. Very \nfew make it to the finish line. So why is the Democrat leadership \nholding up funding for the Liberty Zone over a proposed regulation? \nThis is not responsible governance. This is not responsible opposition. \nThere is a legitimacy in our form of government, one party being in the \nopposition and the other party being in the majority. They play a very \nimportant role in making people responsible. Do we hold up every piece \nof legislation because it is an election year and Members think next \nyear they might be in a majority, so they can do what they want to do?\n  All of these requests that are made to me, why not hold them up until \nnext year? Then I would not have to be considering them at this point. \nIf they are important, we ought to move this legislation along. In \nother words, we should have responsible opposition in the process of \neverybody making their points.\n  The Liberty Zone needs our help, and we need to behave as adults and \nget this bill completed.\n  In the jobs in manufacturing act we increase small business \nindustrial development bonds to spur economic development in rural \nareas. This was requested by Senator Pryor and Senator Thomas. I hope \nthey will vote for cloture tomorrow.\n  We have bonds for rebuilding school infrastructure. These were \nrequested by Senator Conrad.\n  We have included tribal bonds in the jobs in manufacturing bill, \nrequested by Senator Campbell and Senator Johnson. I am sure this is \nsupported by Senator Daschle, as well, because he has a record of \nsupporting Native American projects. These bonds allow the same rules \nthat apply to tax-exempt bonds for State and local governments to apply \nto Native American tribes issuing tax-exempt bonds to finance \nfacilities on their reservations. That is just an explanation, not \nsomething new. In other words, if it is good for one State and local \ngovernment, why shouldn't it be good for the governance of our tribes?\n  We have included tribal school bonds, again, as requested by Senator \nJohnson and Senator Campbell. Under current law, there is no class of \nbonds designated for the purpose of encouraging school construction on \nIndian reservations. This provision fills that void. We have a tribal \nnew markets tax credit which was added at the request of Senator \nDaschle and Senator Campbell. This amendment adds $50 million a year to \neconomic development on reservation land.\n  Will the Democrat leadership tell Democrats to vote against closing \ndebate and kill these Native American measures? Again, if they do not \nwant to get it done, why did they come to me and ask for me to include \nthese things?\n  We have also included the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act. This is at \nthe request of Senator Bingaman and Senator Collins. This is very \nimportant.\n  We have Senator Conrad and Senator Santorum and Senator Bunning \nasking we add a change in section 815 of the Tax Code. The provision \nsuspends applicable rules imposing income tax on certain distributions \nto shareholders from the policyholder's surplus account of a life \ninsurance company. This is included in the bill.\n\n  We have a special dividend allocation rule that benefits farmers' \ncooperatives. Senator Lincoln and Senator Coleman asked it be included.\n  We have other farm provisions that give cattlemen tax-free treatment \nif they replace livestock because of something beyond their own \ncontrol, such as drought, floods, or weather-related conditions. \nSenator Daschle and Senator Thomas asked for that.\n  At the request of Senator Cantwell and Senator Thomas, we included a \nprovision that allows payments under the National Health Service Corps \nloan repayment program to be exempt from tax. This is an important \nmeasure to enhance the delivery of medical services in rural America.\n  We included the passenger rail infrastructure tax credits at the \nrequest of\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\nSenator Carper. It provides $500 million for intercity passenger rail \ncapital projects. We also included the short-line credits requested by \nSenator Smith and Senator Brownback.\n  At the request of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hatch, we added a \nprovision to allow taxpayers to apply their bonus depreciation against \nthe alternative minimum tax credits. This measure is very important to \nthe steel mills of West Virginia; hence, Senator Rockefeller.\n  A provision benefiting Oldsmobile dealers was included at the request \nof Senator Baucus and Senator Bingaman. The proposal provides tax-free \ntreatment for Oldsmobile dealers because their franchise is being \nterminated.\n  How many times have we heard Members talk about the need to make \nbroadband available in rural communities? We know it is essential to \nthe economic competitiveness of rural America, particularly since we \nsee so many Asian companies, so far in advance of the United States in \nbroadband. To keep our economy competitive, it ought to be here. But we \nalso know many Democratic Senators support this. It is, likewise, in \nthe bill.\n  Senator Murray and Senator Smith asked for the forest industry bond \nprovisions in this bill. That allows nonprofits to use tax-exempt bond \nfinancing to acquire forest land, to achieve better balance between the \ngoals of conservationists and the timber industry. Up to $1.5 billion \nin bonds may be issued under this program. That, sir, is a lot of \nconservation money.\n  At the request of Senator Boxer, we have included a proposal that \nwould allow employers to take a 50-percent tax credit against the FICA \ntaxes for wages paid to the first responders who are called to active \nduty. We added a second measure at Senator Boxer's request. This \nproposal would allow farmers and ranchers to take a 30-percent credit \nfor the installation of irrigation equipment which reduces water use. \nThe credit would be limited to land that has received drought \nassistance during the past 3 years.\n  Anyone who votes against cloture is voting to kill all the items I \njust listed. Why would people come to me as chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee and ask me to include provisions in the bill if they \ndo not want to get this bill to the President for signature? Tomorrow, \nthey have their chance.\n  We had debate extended on this bill 2 weeks ago, and we had a vote to \nstop debate. Debate was not stopped. So tomorrow we vote again. We have \nto get over this hurdle to get all these provisions that have been \nrequested in this bill and to get it to the President for his \nsignature.\n  I hope Members are sincere about all this legislation that is \nintroduced. I hope Members are sincere in telling me how important \ntheir amendments are to this bill. I hope Members will show that \nsincerity tomorrow when we have a chance to stop debate and complete \nthis bill.\n  All the beneficial provisions I have just discussed are being held \nhostage this minute because the Democratic leadership is pushing for a \nvote on an issue that is not even in this bill. The vote is an attempt \nto embarrass the administration in an election year about a proposed \nlabor regulation on overtime. The Democrats said the regulation was \ngoing final, and they had to add it to the jobs in manufacturing bill; \notherwise, they would block this bill. That was 2 weeks ago. The \nregulation is still not final. And who knows, the way bureaucracy \nmoves, it may never be final but continue to tilt at windmills, and \nwhat will come.\n  But it seems to me that it is politics all the time. It is politics \nfrom the Democrat leadership, and it is obstructing an important piece \nof legislation. More importantly, right now, it is obstructing \nlegislation that most of the members of the other party have asked me \nto include in this bill. Now, why do you ask me to include it in the \nbill if you are not going to vote to get the bill to the President? \nThis sort of obstructionism is inexcusable because we have worked hard \nthroughout this process to make sure that everyone's concerns--both \nRepublican and Democrat--were incorporated into this bill. Why? Because \nI know you do not get anything done in this body that is not \nbipartisan.\n  People who want to be partisan can be partisan, but they are not \ngoing to get done what they want done either. So you bring the Senate \nto a standstill. We have tried, in the spirit of bipartisanship, to \nrespond. This legislation and all these amendments included are \nresponding to that bipartisanship. You see that effort in the \namendments I just listed.\n  But if it were not overtime, it would be something else to obstruct \nthis bill. It could be the minimum wage; it could be trade adjustment \nassistance for services; it could be some kind of health care issue--\nanything to block the jobs in manufacturing bill at the very same time \npeople on the other side of the aisle are complaining because we are \nnot doing enough to stop outsourcing. This bill will help do that.\n  It is all about the Democratic leadership keeping the European Union \nsanctions in place to drive down the economy, because if the economy is \nnot very good this fall, they think they have a better chance of \nelecting their people. This is outrageous when you consider the \nbipartisan history of this jobs in manufacturing bill.\n  The JOBS bill is a completely bipartisan bill. Construction of the \nbill began when Senator Baucus was chairman of the Finance Committee in \n2002. Senator Baucus and I have always worked with our Finance \nCommittee colleagues on the bipartisan development of this Foreign \nSales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income Act repeal and also the \ninternational tax reform provisions of this bill.\n  Let me emphasize, there is not one provision in this JOBS bill that \nwas not agreed to by both Republicans and Democrats. I have already \nsaid, every Democrat in the committee--all 10 of them--voted for this \nbill to be reported out of committee. We have acted in good faith to \nproduce a bill that protects American manufacturing jobs and to make \nour companies globally competitive--the same thing you hear Senator \nKerry speaking about on the campaign trail, about making our \ncorporations competitive. In fact, he even has a proposal that would \nreduce corporate taxes the same way we do.\n  Let's get on with the business at hand and finish this bill; vote for \ncloture tomorrow, stop debate, put this bipartisan jobs in \nmanufacturing bill ahead of partisan politics. Then we can show the \npeople of this country that the adults are in charge of the Senate, and \nwe can get the JOBS bill--creating jobs in manufacturing--out of the \nSenate and eventually to the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's comments on the \nneed to move this legislation forward.\n  Mr. President, let me just inquire in terms of parliamentary \nprocedure, are we open for general debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed. There are no \nlimits on debate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I did come to the floor last week and speak to the need to move this \nvery important jobs growth, FSC/ETI issue and not have a filibuster and \ncomplete our work. If we do not, we are going to see that we are going \nto be hit by a continuing increase in fines by the European Union \nbecause we are not complying with the World Trade Organization ruling \nof over a year ago.\n  I also said we stand to benefit from the tax proposals in this \nlegislation, and I urged that we complete this work. In fact, I said we \nhave no alternative but to complete this work. I am glad the leadership \nis going to continue to push this issue because we must get it done.\n  I do want to say now that I understand that perhaps a decision was \nmade to attach tax provisions from the Energy bill to this bill, and I \nthink that was a mistake. I am going to have to review what that means \nin terms of my own vote. Instead of helping move this legislation, and \nother legislation, it may have complicated both of them. But I hope we \ncan find a way to get this done.\n  Mr. President, the reason I came to the floor this afternoon, though, \nwas to speak in support of S. 2207, the Pregnancy and Trauma Care \nAccess Protection Act of 2004. We have a health care crisis in America. \nHealth care is becoming more and more difficult to obtain, to afford, \nand to be assured that it is the quality that you might need. In rural \nStates such as mine and Senator Grassley's State of Iowa, the\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\nissues of access and distance, or being able to get trauma care or care \nfrom obstetricians and gynecologists, present real problems.\n  I also think we have to acknowledge that the cost is becoming more \nand more difficult and more and more prohibitive. The cost of health \ncare insurance continues to go up. The cost of medical liability \ninsurance continues to go up. When you talk to trauma emergency care \ndoctors, when you talk to OB/GYNs, they are paying $85,000, $100,000, \n$125,000 for medical liability coverage. How much will it be? There is \nno limit?\n  There is no question, in my mind, many of these doctors are now \npracticing what we would describe as defensive medicine. They are \nprescribing additional procedures. They are taking extra precautions to \nmake sure they do not get sued. That, by the way, continues to drive up \nthe cost of health care. So it has become a big problem in this \ncountry.\n  Escalating jury awards and the high cost of defending lawsuits, even \nthe frivolous ones, are increasing medical liability premiums \nnationwide, and they are having devastating effects on the health care \nof millions of Americans. Medical specialists, including neurosurgeons, \nobstetricians, and emergency physicians, are being forced to cut \nservices, retire early, or move their practices to other States.\n  This past Saturday night, I was in Augusta, GA, for an event for \nCongressman Norwood, a Congressman who has been very much involved in \npatients' rights and health care issues. I was informed that one of the \nneurosurgeons in Augusta recently moved from my State of Mississippi. \nIt is not an isolated incident. It is a pattern. Augusta has several \nneurosurgeons. Mississippi has a declining number, even in places where \nthey are needed to provide trauma care services in larger metropolitan \nareas.\n  Nineteen States are in full-blown medical liability crisis now, and \n25 States are showing signs of crisis. Only 6 States are considered \nstable, each of which has instituted reforms.\n\n  Ninety-eight percent of osteopathic students acknowledged in a recent \nsurvey that medical liability issues will influence their future career \ndecisions. Seventy-three percent say medical liability issues will \n``significantly'' influence their decisions--in other words, where they \npractice, whether they practice, and what kind of medicine they \npractice.\n  Medical liability costs the Federal Government well over $50 billion \nper year. The source of that information is the Department of Health \nand Human Services. I have heard the discussions over the years: Well, \nyou guys from Mississippi, and other similar States, have always talked \nabout the States should deal with these issues. This is a States rights \nissue. It is a State problem.\n  Let me tell you what: When it costs the Federal Treasury $50 billion, \nthis is a national problem. This is not just a problem in Mississippi, \nAlabama, Arkansas, or Iowa; it is a nationwide problem. Very few \nStates--even those that have passed medical liability reforms--have \nbeen able to stem this tide of abuse and costs that are really causing \ndifficulties in a number of States and in the health care of this \ncountry. So we have to do something.\n  Here we are in the Senate with this crisis looming out there that \naffects children, babies, mothers, elderly, emergency care needs; all \nof them have been held up while the Senate cannot even proceed to \ndebate the legislation. That is what we have here, the motion to \nproceed. That is indefensible. How could we not at least take this \nissue up and have a full discussion about its dire consequences?\n  Let's talk a little bit about what the bill does. This is not \nsomething that just popped out of a committee or hasn't been thought \nthrough clearly. This issue has been pending for a long time. Some of \nthe legitimate concerns have been addressed.\n  The bill provides reasonable guidelines to govern liability claims \nrelated to the provision of obstetrical, gynecological, emergency and \ntrauma care goods and services. I want to emphasize, this is a limited \nbill. This is not all medical professions. This is targeted to those \npeople who treat us when we are in the greatest need of health care, \nwhen we are going into an emergency room or a trauma facility as a \nresult of an automobile accident, or doctors who deliver and look after \nour children and the mothers of those children. Can we not at least \nprovide some medical liability reform and protection there so we can \nkeep these doctors in the practice?\n  More and more in my State and all across the country doctors who have \nin the past practiced obstetrical and gynecological work are dropping \nthe obstetrician part because they are being sued. The insurance is \nbecoming prohibitively expensive in terms of the cost it is putting on \nthese doctors.\n  The bill sets a statute of limitation of 3 years after the date of \nmanifestation of an injury or 1 year after the claimant discovers or \nshould have discovered the injury. That is reasonable. You can't say 5 \nyears later: I had a problem back there. It says you have to exercise \nyour right within 3 years or 1 year after you discovered it.\n  It allows recovery of unlimited economic damages, but it limits \nnoneconomic pain and suffering damages to $250,000. This is obviously a \nplace where some restraint needs to be employed. This is where certain \njuries in certain counties in certain States, mine included, have been \nrendering multimillion dollar decisions for pain and suffering. I think \nsome reasonable limits there clearly would be appropriate.\n  This bill allows the court to restrict the payment of attorney \ncontingency fees by applying a percentage scale based on the amount of \nthe judgment. These lawsuits should not be about attorneys' fees. The \nlawsuits should be about medical costs and medical liability. What is a \nreasonable recovery when you do in fact have some legitimate claims?\n  Don't get me wrong. I do think in the American system of \njurisprudence, you have a right to take your grievance to court. I \nwould defend that. I am an attorney. But I do think the system is being \nabused, and it has become more about attorneys' fees than it has the \ninjuries that were incurred.\n  The bill sets out qualifications for expert witnesses. Again, that is \nan area where there have been some abuses I am personally familiar \nwith. It permits courts to reduce damages received by the amount of \ncollateral source benefits to which a claimant is entitled; in other \nwords, money paid by another entity such as a health insurance \nprovider.\n  It authorizes the award of punitive damages only where a high \nstandard is met of clear and convincing evidence that a defendant acted \nwith malicious intent to injure or deliberately failed to prevent \ninjury that was certain to occur.\n  This is very good legislation. It is targeted. It is limited in the \nimpact it would have on restricting the coverage, but also it is \nlimited to these particular areas of specialty I have noted.\n  Let me go to my own State of Mississippi, since our State is really \nbeing adversely affected by these medical liability cases. It is one of \nthose States which has been described as a judicial hellhole. I don't \nlike to hear that. When various entities identify my State in that sort \nof way, I resent it. Even if they are right, I don't like to hear it. \nBut there is no question we have had lots of problems in my State of \nMississippi. We have had a tremendous explosion of lawsuits in this \nhealth care area, very large verdicts. Physicians who are practicing in \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and West Virginia can clearly \ndemonstrate how medical lawsuits have hurt our health care system. The \ndoctors will tell you about that.\n  A recent survey that was done by the American Tort Reform \nAssociation, in cooperation with other groups such as the Mississippi \nState Medical Association, points out 84 percent of the physicians \nsurveyed report they are very concerned about the effect of medical \nlitigation on the practice of medicine. Eighty-one percent report they \nhave changed the way they practice medicine because of litigation \nconcerns. That means more cost. That is what I was referring to at the \nbeginning. They have been requiring and prescribing more and more \nprocedures to protect themselves against these lawsuits. And by the \nway, in many instances, the procedures are not necessary and not \nrequired medically. They are required to defend yourself against a \nfrivolous lawsuit.\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\n  Eighty-six percent of the physicians believe states with a liability \ncrisis like Mississippi increase medical malpractice insurance costs. \nAnd the list goes on. There is no question it is creating a real \nproblem.\n  Again, specifics: Half of my State's 82 counties now have fewer \nphysicians to treat patients than were available in 2001. Mississippi \nhas fewer physicians per capita than 48 other States. So when we lose a \nphysician, it really hurts because we already are in dire straits. In \n16 Mississippi counties, the numbers of physicians remained unchanged \nfrom 2000 to 2002, but the population in those counties increased \nduring the same period. The population growth in 62 percent of \nMississippi counties outpaced a stagnant or decreasing base of \nphysicians to treat those patients. The source of this information is \nthe Mississippi State Medical Association.\n  Approximately 100 doctors have left or plan to leave the State of \nMississippi. The source of that information is a Time magazine article \nof June 9, 2003.\n  Mississippi had a net loss of 73 physicians in 2002. The number of \nphysicians licensed in the State in 2001 was 5,710. But in 2002, this \nnumber had dropped to 5,637. Since the population is increasing, since \nwe have certain areas of the State that have experienced tremendous \ngrowth, you would think we would be increasing the number of physicians \nper capita. The numbers are going in the wrong direction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that other statistics I have about what is \nhappening in my own State be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       This net loss of 73 physicians is all the more disturbing \n     because the total number of physicians licensed in 2002 \n     actually includes 414 newly licensed doctors--meaning that \n     there were approximately 500 doctors practicing in the state \n     in 2001 who were not practicing in the state by 2002. The \n     source of my information is a Mississippi State Medical \n     Association news release of August 14, 2002.\n       Furthermore, another disturbing trend is the decrease in \n     the number of medical licenses that are being issued each \n     year. In 2000, the medical board issued 470 new licenses; in \n     2001 the number was 456; and in 2002 the number was 414. The \n     number of new licenses dropped steadily by 39 percent from \n     1997-2002. The source of my information is a Mississippi \n     State Medical Association news release of August 14, 2002.\n       Mississippi can't afford to lose doctors when the state's \n     population increased by 271,442--or 10.5 percent--\n     between 1990 and 2000. The State population of 2,573,216 \n     in 1990 grew to 2,844,658 in 2000. The source of this \n     information is the U.S. Census Bureau.\n       Only two neurosurgeons remain in practice on the \n     Mississippi Gulf Coast, and general surgeons are in short \n     supply because of the state's medical liability crisis. \n     ``Everybody is reduced to the same low level of trauma care \n     that we had 20 years ago,'' said Steve Delahousey, vice \n     president of operations at American Medical Response \n     ambulance service. My source is the Biloxi Sun Herald, Jan. \n     29, 2003.\n       Increasing costs of medical liability insurance has reduced \n     the number of neurosurgeons in the State by one-third, \n     creating holes in the State's trauma system. My source is the \n     Greenwood Commonwealth, April 25, 2003.\n       One major medical liability insurer, St. Paul Cos., has \n     withdrawn from the Mississippi market, forcing as many as \n     1,000 physicians to find other insurers. My source is the New \n     Orleans Times Picayune, February 2, 2003.\n       In Cleveland, MS, three of the town's six OB-GYNs have \n     stopped delivering babies. Yazoo City's 14,500 residents have \n     no OB-GYNs. According to the Mississippi State Medical \n     Association, insurance rates for OB-GYNs have increased \n     from 20-400 percent in the previous year. My source is the \n     Mississippi State Medical Society.\n       Loss of doctors at Gulfport-Memorial: As of summer 2003, \n     Gulfport-Memorial had 24 hour neurosurgery coverage, and now \n     they have no neurosurgery coverage at all; had 6 \n     neurologists, and now have 1; had 6 orthopaedic surgeons, and \n     now have 3; had 3 vascular surgeons, and now have 2; had 9 \n     OB-GYNs, but 2 retired due to malpractice insurance crisis, \n     and now have 7. The source of my information is Dr. Arthur \n     Matthews.\n       ``Nursing homes in Mississippi have been faced with \n     increases in total premiums as great as 900 percent in the \n     past two years. Since Medicare and Medicaid pay most of the \n     costs of nursing home care, these increased costs are borne \n     by taxpayers, and consumer resources that could otherwise be \n     used to expand health (or other) programs.'' The source of \n     this information is a HHS medical litigation report, March 3, \n     2003.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to make this point. We used to have several, then we \nhad three, now we have one insurance company that is providing medical \nliability insurance in my State of Mississippi. This is a problem that \nis of great concern to leaders in the State of both parties, in the \nmedical profession, in the business world, and those of us who are \ntrying desperately to advance the State economically and have had some \nsuccess bringing major industries into the State. While a major \nindustry may want to know, do you have a good interstate system, do you \nhave international airports, good schools, can you provide affordable \nhousing, they don't always immediately ask about the accessibility of \nhospitals and do you have the doctors who are needed, but that is a \nquestion that eventually they come to. It is one that will affect us in \nthe future if we don't do something about it.\n  Let me tell you what it means when you don't have the doctors you \nneed. I want to give some specific examples.\n  Tony Dyess of Vicksburg, MS, received serious head injuries in a car \naccident on July 5, 2002. Since a specialist in brain injuries, or \nneurosurgery services, was not available in Gulfport, MS, he had to be \nairlifted to another hospital which led to Tony having permanent brain \ndamage and no longer having the ability to care for himself or to have \na job. The source of that is the American Medical News, May 26, 2003.\n  Fortunately for Elmoe Kee III of Woodville, the withdrawal of \ninsurance coverage by St. Paul malpractice insurance provider from the \nState of Mississippi did not occur before he was attacked by a bank \nrobber in a small rural county at Wilkinson County Savings Bank where \nhe served as president. He would have most certainly died if he had not \nbeen able to get doctors to treat him almost immediately at Catchings \nClinic in Woodville, MS. With the withdrawal of St. Paul as a \nmalpractice provider, seven of the eight doctors in the area, including \nthose at Catchings Clinic, Field Clinic in Centreville, and Gloster \nClinic were left without a malpractice insurance provider beginning on \nJune 30, 2002. The source of this information is the Jackson Clarion-\nLedger of June 27, 2002.\n  On April 18, 2003, John Fair Lucas IV of Greenwood received a severe \nhead injury due to a one-person car accident. Since the Delta Regional \nMedical Center no longer has around-the-clock neurosurgery services \nbecause of the impact of the medical malpractice insurance crisis and \nthe loss of that coverage, John had to be airlifted to Jackson, losing \nvaluable time because the distance from that area of Greenwood, MS, \ndown to Jackson is about a 2-hour drive, or certainly a 30-minute \nhelicopter ride, and he lost valuable time for the surgical procedure \nneeded to reduce pressure on the brain. Sadly, John passed away on May \n28, 2003. The source for that is the Greenwood Commonwealth newspaper, \nApril 25, 2003.\n  ``Jill Mahaffey says she got lucky. She and her husband are here, \nthey live in the Delta, too. She got lucky. She heard she's pregnant. \nShe's getting there, getting ready. She goes to the doctor, he says, \nI've got to leave--OB/GYN getting ready to leave because of lawsuits, \nbecause of the threats. Because even if you're a doctor who practices \ngood medicine, you're going to get sued in this State and in other \nStates. Believe this or not, fortunately, she was getting toxic and the \ndoc induced labor before he quit his practice. She says she was lucky. \nAnd she was.'' This is a quote from President Bush's address to Madison \nHigh School in Madison, MS August 7, 2002.\n  Amber Peterson's obstetrician in Cleveland, Mississippi stopped \npracticing 3 weeks before her due date, and she had to drive out of \nState, over a hundred miles, to Memphis, Tennessee, to get the care she \nneeded. The source of this information is the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services, from a report dated July 24, 2002.\n  Marine Hawkins, 20, of Boyle, Mississippi, was shocked to hear from \nher obstetrician that he was closing his practice--just 2 weeks before \nher due date of July 21. The nearest doctor is 30 minutes away. She \ndoesn't have a car and will have to rely on relatives to get there. \n``This isn't what I needed now,'' she said. The source of this \ninformation is the Houston Chronicle, July 20, 2002.\n  In February 2003, Sharkey-Issaquena Community Hospital in Rolling \nFork,\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\nMS saw its insurance premiums rise from $163,000 to $223,000. Because \nof this rise, the hospital was forced to close its doors for 3 weeks \nwhile the hospital looked for an alternative insurance policy after \nbeing discontinued by its previous insurer. During these 3 weeks, \nSharkey-Issaquena had to contract paramedics to treat patients while \nthey were being transported by ambulance to the closest hospital. The \nsource of this information is the American Medical News May 26, 2003.\n  In 2002, 10 physicians left Greenwood Leflore Hospital because of the \nState's problems with medical liability insurance. Also during 2002, \nthe hospital's liability insurance premium increased from $150,000 per \nyear to $1.3 million. The source of this information is The Greenwood \nCommonwealth, June 26, 2003.\n  On Sept. 30, 2002, officials at Forest General Hospital announced \nthey are eliminating nearly 300 positions--200 of which were already \nvacant--to save an estimated $7.6 million in the new fiscal budget. \nCiting causative factors that prompted the cuts, hospital president \nBill Oliver stated that Forrest General was hit last year with a \ndramatic increase--about $4 million--in medical malpractice insurance. \nThe source of this information is the Hattiesburg American Oct. 2, \n2002.\n  Mr. President, let me talk a little about exactly what is happening \nwith the doctors in my State.\n  In February 2003, 14 doctors in the Oxford area in various medical \nfields were left without malpractice insurance and were forced to close \ntheir doors because their insurer, Doctors Insurance Reciprocal, went \ninto receivership on February 13. Doctors are slowly, surely leaving \nthe area to go to bigger areas, or even to other States.\n  I was in my hometown area, Pascagoula and Moss Point, MS, on the Gulf \nCoast, and met a new impressive doctor in the community. He was also \ninvolved in the trauma unit because he was an orthopedic surgeon. He \nmoved to Mississippi from the State of Missouri. He is an African-\nAmerican doctor. He was doing a great job. He told me because of the \ninsurance coverage situation, even though his family wanted to stay on \nthe Mississippi Gulf Coast, it looked as if they might have to return \nto Missouri. Other doctors have been either leaving the State or \ngetting out of the practice of obstetrics.\n  In the case of Dr. Don Gaddy, as well as four other obstetricians and \nthree nurse-midwives, they filed notice to take a 1-year leave of \nabsence from Memorial Hospital at Gulfport, MS, because of extreme \nincreases in medical malpractice insurance coverage. The source of this \ninformation is the Biloxi Sun-Herald, April 18, 2003.\n  Dr. Gregory Patton, an OB-GYN with the Oxford Obstetrics and \nGynecology Associates PA in Oxford MS, reports that his malpractice \ninsurance premiums have gone up 60 percent--with each doctor paying \n$67,000. The source of this information is The Daily Mississippian June \n10, 2003.\n  Drs. Blackwood and Baugh's temporary departure left no OBs in \nCleveland for about 10 days. Only one family physician continues to \ndeliver babies at the local hospital. But the malpractice insurance \nproviders that are protecting them are only ``Band-Aid insurance.'' The \nsource of this information is American Medical News Sept. 9, 2002.\n  Dr. Kurt Kooyer left the small town of Rolling Fork after getting fed \nup with lawyers filing suit against him without even the patients' \nknowledge that they were filing suit against their physician. Dr. \nKooyer was the only pediatrician among three physicians in town who \nlowered the infant mortality rate from an average of 10 deaths per \n1,000 live births to 3.34 deaths per 1,000. Dr. Kooyer now lives in \nNorth Dakota. The source of this information is The Clarion-Ledger Aug. \n23, 2002.\n  ``Dr. Frothingham, you talk about a man with heart. You think Kooyer \nhas a heart? Wait until you hear Frothingham. He's a great \nMississippian; grew up here; thought he might try to live in South \nCarolina, realized what he was missing, came back to Mississippi. He's \na neurosurgeon. He talked with deep compassion about a man who suffered \na trauma, a fellow he was with--Johnny was with us today. He's a guy \nwho understands that practicing medicine is more than just technology. \nIt's concern and care. They're running him out of business. There's too \nmany frivolous lawsuits. And that hurts the state and it hurts the \ncountry. It hurts the people.'' This quote is from President Bush's \naddress to Madison High School in Madison, MS, August 7, 2002.\n  On July 15, 2003, Drs. Derveloy and Gilmore, the only two heart \nsurgeons in Oxford, are closing their practice. They contribute their \nrelocation to a shortage of key elements: facilities, cardiologists, \naffordable medical malpractice insurance and regional referrals. Dr. \nDerverloy is joining an existing group off heart surgeons who are \npracticing in Tupelo, and Dr. Gilmore recently accepted an offer to set \nup a heart surgery program in Decatur, Ala. The source of this \ninformation is The Oxford Eagle June 8, 2003.\n  Also in Oxford, the two cardiologists with the Oxford Heart Clinic, \nDr. Nelson Little and Dr. Timothy Wright, are merging their practices \nwith a Tupelo office, but will keep their local office open, which \nfollowed the loss of Oxford's only two heart surgeons, Drs. Derveloy \nand Gilmore. The source of my information is The Oxford Eagle, June 8, \n2003.\n  Five doctors at the Family Practice/After Hours Clinic on U.S. 98 \nWest have posted a sign on their doors informing patients that no \nappointments are being scheduled for 2003. The physicians are also \nfilling out applications for licensing in Alabama and Louisiana. The \ndoctors explain the possible departure from Mississippi by the clinic's \nmalpractice insurer informing them recently that their premiums will \nincrease 45 percent on Jan. 1, 2003. The source of my information is \nthe Hattiesburg American, Oct. 2, 2003.\n  OB/GYN Mark Blackwood of Cleveland has seen his practice load nearly \ndouble since three physicians quit delivering babies in the area. His \ninsurance lapsed in July, forcing him to close his clinic for ten days \nleaving dozens of patients without a physician to deliver their babies. \nHe and his partner have seen an increase in the number of suits filed \nagainst them since the new legislation passed. The source of this \ninformation is the Mississippi State Medical Association Dec. 1, 2002.\n\n  Radiologist Ken Duff was able to get coverage less than twenty-four \nhours before his old policy expired. He and his eleven partners cover \ntwo hospitals in Hattiesburg, facilities ion Columbia, Collins and \nTylertown, as well as two large outpatient facilities. Without \ndiagnostic radiology services patients have to wait longer to get test \nresults, and other physicians will have to find new specialists to \nconsult. The group desperately needs new recruits to cover demand. The \nsource of this information is the Mississippi State Medical \nAssociation, Dec. 1, 2002.\n  General Surgeon Brian Anthony of Bay St. Louis practices more \ndefensive medicine and no longer does vascular work. He plans to retire \n10 years early because of the litigious environment. He says other \nphysicians often consult him in order to document their cases and to \nreduce their exposure. He and the remaining surgeon in the area are \nconsidering whether they will continue to provide trauma services. The \nsource of this information is the Mississippi State Medical Association \nDec. 1, 2002.\n  Neurosurgeon Terry Smith has not had a vacation in five years because \nthere is not enough neurosurgery coverage to take care of his patients. \nHe is one of only three neurosurgeons covering trauma cases for seven \nhospitals on the Gulf Coast. When he lost his insurance in August 2002 \nhe had to go on staff with a hospital in order to continue to practice \nin the area. The source of this information is the Mississippi State \nMedical Association, Dec. 1, 2002.\n  Otolaryngologist Gene Hesdorffer of Hinds County had to close his \npractice on December 31 and was forced into full-retirement because he \ncould no longer afford insurance. His insurance carrier informed him \nthey were doubling his rates despite the fact that he has never been \nsued. The source of this information is the Mississippi State Medical \nAssociation, Dec. 1, 2002.\n  OB/GYN Al Diaz of Ocean Springs has insurance until December 2002. He \nhas lived on the Coast for 20 years but is now looking at practice in \nMobile, Alabama, and Slidell, Louisiana. Both his son and daughter-in-\nlaw are training in Louisiana but will not return to practice in \nMississippi. The entire group of\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\nfour OB/GYNs just renovated their clinic in Ocean Springs and opened an \noffice in Biloxi when they were told their insurance carrier would no \nlonger be doing business in the State. The source of this information \nis the Mississippi State Medical Association, Dec. 1, 2002.\n  Surgeon Cecil Johnson of Lauderdale County plans to retire soon. \nUntil then he will continue to order more tests, x-rays and \nconsultations in order to back up diagnoses. He also plans to drop \nvascular surgery in hopes that he will be able to find more affordable \ninsurance. The source of this information is the Mississippi State \nMedical Association, Dec. 1, 2002.\n  Internist Bob Lewis of Wilkinson County spent a week treating \npatients at the local emergency room while his clinic was closed. The \ngroup could not find coverage and the only quote they could get was \n$355,000. The four-man group paid $67,000 last year. Family Practice \nphysician Jennings Owens and his group serve nearly 40,000 patients. He \nis upset that the hospital had to hire physicians in order to insure \nthem. The source of this information is the Mississippi State Medical \nAssociation, Dec. 1, 2002.\n  ER physician Bob Corken had to find insurance from Lloyd's of London \nfor this ER group which services a hospital in Washington County and \nthree others in the Delta and Central Mississippi. Corken found \ninsurance at the eleventh hour in order to avoid work stoppages and \ntemporary closure of at least one emergency room. The source of this \ninformation is the Mississippi State Medical Association, Dec. 1, 2002.\n  Orthopaedic Surgeon Alan Swayze, MD of McComb took on more patients \nlast year than ever before--partly because there are few orthopaedic \nsurgeons in the area. Now he is leaving Mississippi and opening a \npractice in Georgia because his liability insurance to practice in \nMississippi skyrocketed to $125,000 per year. His premium in Georgia \nwill be $14,000 annually. The hospital administrator in McComb said the \nprospects of recruiting replacement physicians to McComb is ``bleak.'' \nThe source of this information is the Enterprise Journal, June 12, \n2003.\n  In April 2002, State Commissioner George Dale said, ``It's just a \nmatter of time until insurance companies will say they're not going to \ncover medical providers in Mississippi.'' That time has arrived. Dozens \nof insurers have either discontinued writing medical malpractice in \nMississippi or raised their premiums to such a level that doctors--like \nthose at the Family Practice/After Hour Clinic--are being forced to \nconsider relocating out of state. According to a survey conducted \nrecently by the Rating Division at the Mississippi Insurance \nDepartment, 36 companies offered medical malpractice insurance in all \ncategories in 2000. As of Sept. 10, there are only two licensed \nregulated, companies still providing medical malpractice insurance to \nphysicians and surgeons in Mississippi. The main reason insurance \ncompanies give for hiking premiums and/or leaving the state is their \nconcern about Mississippi's civil justice system, which has generated \nover 100 verdicts of $1 million in the last 6 years. The source of this \ninformation is the Hattiesburg American, Oct. 2, 2002.\n  Fifteen medical malpractice insurers have withdrawn from offering \ncoverage in Mississippi in the past five years. The source of this \ninformation is an HHS medical litigation report, March 3, 2003.\n  ``We've had trouble recruiting and had physicians say they are not \ninterested in coming to Mississippi because of the malpractice \ninsurance rates,'' according to Dean Griffin, executive officer of \nBaptist Memorial-Golden Triangle Hospital.

Mr. President, this is not a short list. This is a lengthy \nlist, with probably as many as 40 counties listed. In Adams County, \nthey lost three physicians who had been delivering babies. Attala \nCounty, in the center of the State, lost four family practice \nphysicians who had been doing deliveries; they got out of the practice. \nIn Harrison County, one of our more metropolitan areas on the Gulf \nCoast, three doctors got out of delivering babies. The list goes on and \non.\n  Pretty soon it is going to be hard to have a baby delivered in my \nState. That causes me a great deal of concern.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can get the votes tomorrow to proceed on \nthis issue and have a full debate and a vote. This is not some massive \ntort reform, although I think we need it. I hope we will later visit \nthe issue of class action reform.\n  This is very targeted legislation that will address a serious problem \nin many States--the majority of States across this country, where we \nare losing the services of these physicians in these critical areas. I \nwould hate to have to explain to my State how I would not even vote to \nproceed, let alone not vote to have some limits on medical liability \nfor doctors who deliver babies and treat their mothers and who care for \nus when we have accidents and go to the emergency room.\n  I think this is very carefully drafted legislation, very thoughtful. \nI certainly hope the Senate will see fit to proceed to a full debate \nand vote on this critical legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n\n                       Pension Funding Equity Act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to briefly address a conference \nreport that we will hopefully be voting on in the Senate this week; \nthat is, the conference report called the Pension Funding Equity Act.\n  The House of Representatives passed this bill overwhelmingly last \nweek. This is a bill that addresses the urgent need to establish an \nappropriate interest rate for determining pension plan liabilities. The \nconference agreement provides for a temporary replacement only for the \n30-year Treasury bond in determining the pension plan's liabilities.\n  The Government stopped issuing this bond in 2001, and continuing to \nuse this outdated interest rate would require companies to make \nunnecessarily large contributions to the pension plans.\n  If this change is not made, the administration estimates it will cost \nAmerican companies $80 billion over the next 2 years. This is $80 \nbillion over the next 2 years, not the standard 10 years by which we \nusually measure legislation.\n  This is $80 billion that companies could put to better use creating \njobs, purchasing equipment, providing raises to workers, or pursuing \nany number of worthwhile business activities.\n  This is legislation that cannot wait. It needs to be passed this \nweek. A previous temporary replacement rate expired January 1 of this \nyear, 2004. Unless the Senate acts prior to the recess, by the end of \nthis week, companies will be required to make the first of their \ninflated contributions based on the flawed interest rate on April 15, \nwhile we are not here. So this is it; the last opportunity to address \nthis great inequity is this week. Again, these are funds that companies \ncould otherwise use to create jobs, invest in new equipment, and \nprovide raises to workers.\n  I believe I am safe in saying that every Member of the body has heard \nfrom his or her constituents about the need to solve this problem \nbefore April 15. The House recognized the urgency of this matter and \npassed this conference agreement on a bipartisan vote of 336 to 69 last \nFriday. That was an overwhelming bipartisan recognition that this \nconference report needs to become law and needs to become law now. It \nis critically important that the Senate do the same and send this to \nthe President for his signature before April 15.\n  We spend a lot of time talking about jobs and job security on the \nSenate floor, and we should be talking about jobs and job security. \nThis pensions conference report is an opportunity to stop talking and \nstart acting. We ought to seize this opportunity and pass this very \nmuch needed legislation this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE LADY VOLS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Tennessee in the \nChamber. I know shortly he will be addressing the issue under \nconsideration, that of medical liability. In seeing him, I did want to, \nfor a couple of minutes, talk about a very important event that will \noccur later this evening.\n  The State of Tennessee, which both he and I represent, is once again \nat the height of March Madness. Congratulations to the University of \nTennessee Lady Vols, who will play for their seventh NCAA title tonight \nagainst a familiar foe, the University of Connecticut Huskies.\n  Coach Pat Summitt has maintained a championship basketball program at \nthe University of Tennessee for three decades. This upcoming matchup, \nto be played in a few hours, will be the Tennessee native's 102nd NCAA \ntournament game. Coach Pat Summitt has led the team to an overall \nrecord of 851 wins and 166 losses in 30 seasons.\n  Under the watchful eye of the winningest coach in women's basketball \nhistory, the Lady Vols have advanced to the NCAA Sweet 16 and the Elite \nEight in 19 of the last 23 years. Tennessee is making its third \nstraight Final Four appearance, setting a new NCAA record with 15 such \nappearances. The win over Stanford in the 2004 Midwest Regional final \ngave the Lady Vols their 14th 30-win season in Coach Pat Summitt's 30-\nyear career at Tennessee.\n  This is an especially big game for the Lady Vols seniors. During \ntheir 4-year stint at Tennessee, they have yet to clinch a national \nchampionship. They did garner a No. 1 seed for a nation leading 16th \ntime in 2004.\n\n  It is the seniors' outstanding play that has blazed the trail to the \n2004 NCAA championship game. Senior Tasha Butts scored the winning \nbasket at the buzzer in both games of the Midwest regional. Senior \nLaToya Davis scored with 1.6 seconds left in Sunday night's Final 4 \nmatchup to keep Tennessee's national championship hopes alive.\n  Butts, Davis, and fellow senior Ashley Robinson accounted for one-\nthird of the team's total production in the 2004 NCAA Tournament. They \nhave attributed 47 percent of Tennessee's points, 77 percent of its \nassists, and 39 percent of its three-pointers. Together these \nexceptional student athletes have produced 30 points, 21 rebounds, 10 \nassists, 4 steals, and 3 blocked shots per game.\n  Tennessee, although a perennial powerhouse, has not won a national \ntitle since 1998. Under the tutelage of a basketball living legend, \ncombined with the heart of the Lady Vols' seniors, Tennessee hopes to \nbring the glory of women's basketball back to Rocky Top.\n  I wish both teams good luck tonight, and I hope to join the Tennessee \nLady Vols at a White House victory celebration later this year. Go \nVols.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not. The Senate is considering a motion \nto proceed.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the majority \nleader's comments, if I may. I, as a great many Americans, am going to \nbe watching the Connecticut-Tennessee basketball game tonight at 8:30 \neastern time.\n  Connecticut has a wonderful tradition, a terrific coach, and great \nplayers. They have won the last couple of years. But the Naismith Coach \nof the Year this year is Pat Summitt. For those of us in Tennessee, she \nis the coach of the year every year.\n  Senator Frist has mentioned her achievements as a coach, which I \nthink we must take for granted in Tennessee. We expect Pat Summitt to \nbe in the Final Four. We expect her team to be in the finals. We expect \nher often to win, and we sometimes forget how hard that is.\n  Twenty-five years ago, it might have been easy when women's \nbasketball\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\nwas starting. Today, there is a lot of parity. There are a good many \ngreat coaches. There are many teams inspired by Pat Summitt. It is an \nenormous accomplishment for Coach Summitt to have this team in the \nfinals once again. One day, when she is finished--and I hope that is no \ntime soon--I will look back and say how could that have happened, and \nhow much could one woman build this game and make such a difference?\n  She does one other thing that I think is important to hear. This is a \ntime when we hear about athletes, which we wish we hadn't heard, young \nmen and women suddenly exposed to fame, money, and television with bad \nresults. You do not hear about many of Pat Summit's young women. It was \ntrue a few years ago when I was president of the University of \nTennessee that every single young woman who completed her eligibility \nat Tennessee on a Pat Summitt team has received her degree or is in the \nprocess of completing her degree requirements--every single one. That \nwas true 10 years ago. I suspect it is still true today.\n\n  If you watch those young women when they are interviewed, before, \nafter the game, or any other time, they look like future coaches. They \nspeak well. They conduct themselves well. They are graceful toward \ntheir opponents. They make us proud to be Tennesseans when we see them. \nSo this team not only wins, its coach and players conduct themselves \nbrilliantly as scholars and as competitors, and they bring out the best \nin our country.\n  Pat Summitt, I suppose, is not for every young woman who wants to \nplay college basketball. She is a tough competitor. I think that is one \nreason why she is such a good coach and why she gets many of the \ngreatest players. She and her staff bring out the best in players, and \nthey want to play for Pat Summitt. There are little girls around this \ncountry who play basketball in sixth, seventh, and eighth grade who \ndream of growing up to play for Pat Summitt.\n  One other thing I would add. Pat Summitt has kept her coaching team \ntogether for a long time. Mickie DeMoss, her assistant, left for the \nUniversity of Kentucky to take a well-deserved head coaching position \nthere. Mickie DeMoss is a great recruiter and will be a great head \ncoach, I believe. Many people thought when Mickey went to Kentucky, Pat \nwould not be able to recruit as well. I am sure the competitive urge in \nPat Summitt caused her to go out and recruit what is already being \ncalled the ``Fabulous 6,'' the All America player of the year for the \nlast 2 years and five other young women who are coming to the \nUniversity of Tennessee next year on scholarships. Many basketball \nanalysts say it is the best women's recruiting class ever.\n  Senator Frist and I salute Coach Pat Summitt, not just for being \nCoach of the Year this year, but, in our book, for being coach every \nyear and for effort in the incredible graduation rate of the young \nwomen who have played for her and helping them grow into womanhood and \nto represent our State and our country in that sport very well.\n  Mr. President, if I may speak on another subject, I come to the floor \ntoday to express my concern, once again, with the rising cost of \nmedical liability insurance and what this means for patient access to \nmedical care in Tennessee. This is a subject we have talked about many \ntimes on this floor, and it is a subject I hear about often when I am \nin Tennessee.\n  Last February, we debated this issue right here and, unfortunately, \nwe were not even able to get to a vote on it. We were not able to \ninvoke cloture, we were not able to vote on the issue of medical \nliability insurance.\n  Today we are limiting our debate to just this issue: the care for \nmothers and babies and for anyone with an emergency medical condition. \nThat is all we are talking about in this legislation--mothers and \nbabies and anyone of any age with an emergency medical condition.\n  These are the individuals who have the highest need for medical care \nin our country, and the lack of access to that care can prove deadly.\n  The increasing cost of medical liability insurance is creating a \npatient access crisis because doctors are leaving the practice of \nmedicine rather than pay the high cost of medical malpractice \ninsurance.\n  For example, in the Hardin County General Hospital in Savannah, in \nwest Tennessee, the only OB/GYN doctor left the hospital to practice in \nanother State because Tennessee's insurance premiums were too high. \nHigh medical liability insurance is one more reason it is difficult to \nrecruit specialists to rural areas.\n  We need to make certain we ensure access to good care in emergency \nrooms for all Americans, all Tennesseans. Yet neurosurgeon Rick Boop of \nMemphis, TN, wrote me to say:\n\n       I have seen three children die recently of shunt \n     malfunctions in emergency rooms which did not have a \n     neurosurgeon who could perform procedures on children. All \n     neurosurgeons can provide a simple shunt revision, but many \n     are being forced to stop caring for children in order to \n     retain or reduce their liability premiums.\n\n  All three of these children died awaiting helicopter transport to a \nchildren's hospital--\n  Where there was a specialist who could perform that type of \nprocedure.\n  More and more Americans are seeking emergency room care. In \nTennessee, for example, the number of emergency room visits increased \nby almost one-third, 31 percent, over a 3-year period. The largest \nincrease in usage was among individuals in our TennCare program, our \nMedicaid program. These are the people who need the most help, our \npoorest people in Tennessee. We need to make sure specialists are \navailable in the emergency rooms of this country and Tennessee to care \nfor these patients.\n  In 2002, the average net medical liability premium for an OB/GYN in \nTennessee was $33,600. In 2003, the premium was up to $41,980. In 2004, \nit increased again to $49,408. This is a 47-percent increase in medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums over the past 3 years. This is not \nsustainable over time if we expect to have doctors, specialists in the \nhospitals, in the emergency rooms, to care for mothers and babies and \nthe most vulnerable in our society.\n  Two years ago, I met a young woman who had just graduated from the \nUniversity of Tennessee Medical School. She was looking forward to \ngoing into her OB/GYN practice in a rural area of Tennessee. She told \nme her medical malpractice insurance premium 2 years ago was $70,000 a \nyear and she had never delivered a baby in her practice.\n  I believe S. 2207, the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection \nAct, will help protect access to care for mothers and babies and \nTennesseans in emergency medical conditions. This bill will still allow \nunlimited economic damages, but it places a sensible cap on non-\neconomic damages. I hope we can agree to have a vote to reach cloture \non this important legislation.\n  I often express my concern for federalism, for the importance of \nallowing States and local governments to exercise their rights and \nresponsibilities and not be overridden by the Federal Government except \nwhen it is absolutely necessary. In this case, this legislation allows \nStates to set their own caps if they prefer a lower cap or if they \nprefer a higher cap. In this case, we ought to act because Americans \nshould have an equal opportunity to health care, particularly if they \nare mothers, children and the most vulnerable and poor in our society.\n  I ask that the full Senate agree that we vote--be it up, or down, and \nI will vote yes--on this important legislation to help those who need \nhelp the most.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to continue to speak about the \nForeign Sales Corporation Extraterritorial Income Act that is before \nCongress that we call the JOBS and manufacturing act. I wish to bring \nthe Senate up to date on the status of this not just as a jobs bill but \nas a major economic policy legislation.\n  This, of course, is bipartisan legislation. This is legislation that \nwas designed to respond to the World Trade Organization's adverse \nruling on a benefit under the old law for U.S. exporters and to bring \nour law into conformity with that World Trade Organization ruling, but \nto do it in a way that\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\nactually creates jobs in America and emphasizes domestic manufacturing \nso American manufacturers are going to benefit from this legislation on \nwhat they do in the United States, not what they do overseas.\n  Foreign corporations that come into the United States are going to \nbenefit under this legislation as long as they set up plants and \nmanufacture in the United States. This bill has an acronym, J-O-B-S, \nand it is truly jobs-creating legislation.\n  We have problems with this now because some people who even support \nthis legislation want to stall it so they can use it as a vehicle for \ngetting some of their pet projects through the Senate. When everybody \nis saying, and rightly so, that we have not created enough jobs in \nmanufacturing and we have a bill before the Senate that will do it, I \ndo not know why anybody would want to hold this bill up, but there is a \nplaying of politics and, in my view, then when one plays politics, the \npeople's business is neglected.\n  First, there is a lot in this bill on which we all agree: The tax \nbenefit I refer to is the foreign sales corporation extraterritorial \nincome benefit. That benefit provides a roughly 5-percent corporate \nrate tax cut for U.S. exporters of manufactured products.\n  As everyone knows, there is a disturbing economic statistic about \nU.S. manufacturing and that was that there was a downturn in the \nmanufacturing index starting March of 2000. I emphasize that because \neverybody thinks this recession started under President Bush, but if \none looks at the manufacturing index, they would find the manufacturing \nindex started to turn down March of 2000. It just now has bottomed out \nand it is just now that it looks as if there is going to be an increase \nin hiring in manufacturing.\n  Fortunately, with the tax relief in place in this bill and with other \nstimulative measures that have been passed last year, manufacturing has \ncome back. Unfortunately, manufacturing employment has not come back to \nprevious levels, and that is what this bill deals with. Both sides, \nmeaning both Democrat and Republican, agree there is a problem with the \nloss of manufacturing jobs. Both sides also agree that the loss of this \nprevious benefit will result in a tax increase on U.S. manufacturers. \nFollowing the simple rules of Economics 101, if something is taxed \nhigher, there is less of it.\n  There is some dissent on my side of the aisle, the Republican side, \nwhich I want to mention so that I am candid in not everybody who \nopposes this bill is on the Democrat side.\n  We have Senator Kyl and Senator Nickles, as an example. They are \nRepublicans. They question the wisdom of the current law benefit.\n  I was also surprised to hear last week that one Member from the other \nside--quite a liberal Member, as a matter of fact--in effect agreed \nwith Senator Kyl and Senator Nickles. That Member questioned the wisdom \nof the foundation of this bill--the tax deduction for domestic \nmanufacturers. That Member took to task, as he said, the authors of the \nlegislation.\n  I wonder if that Member bothered to check to see the authors were \nalso Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee. In \nfact, every member of the Senate Finance Committee who is a Democrat \nvoted for this bill to come out of committee.\n  In any event, with the exceptions noted--meaning one Democrat plus \nSenator Kyl and Senator Nickles, also--there is general agreement on \nboth sides that we need to replace current law with a manufacturing \nbenefit which will agree with the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade, the international agreement that decides the rules of trade.\n  Conversely, I have not heard anyone say it is wise to sit idly by \nwhile our exports get hit with tariffs put on our products in a legal \nway by Europe, causing our products to be uncompetitive.\n  In general, both sides agree we need to deal with this tariff \nproblem. We need to deal with this adverse World Trade Organization \nruling. Both sides agree we have a responsibility to remove the tariffs \nagainst our exports. But yet there doesn't seem to be agreement it \nshould have been done yesterday. It is OK if it is done down the road \nin another 6 months when we have another 6 percent tariff put on. At \nleast that appears to me to be the way some people are acting.\n  If we agree on the problem and on the substance of this bill, why \ncan't the job be done? Why can't this bill get to the President? It \nappears to me the two sides disagree on the outcome for this bill.\n  I think dealing with this bill goes to the heart of our \nresponsibility as a Senate. We take an oath to uphold the Constitution. \nThe Constitution provides Senators with a unique power somewhat \ndifferent than in the House of Representatives. That unique power also \ncarries unique responsibilities. Where there is a compelling public \npolicy problem and there is a consensus around the legislation that \nsolves that problem, it is our responsibility as Senators to do \neverything in our power to make it happen.\n  Said another way: If we have a bill before the Senate that is going \nto pass the Senate 90-10, or by a wider margin than that, and there is \nan agreement it ought to be done, why doesn't it get done?\n  We all know the Senate is an institution that renders easily to \ngridlock and to delay. I suppose we would have to blame our Founding \nFathers because they contemplated a Senate where the majority would set \nthe agenda and the minority defines its agenda with amendments and \ndebate. Those powers of delay and obstruction are properly resorted to \nwhen the majority is ramming something through on a partisan agenda. \nThere is, however, a reflective responsibility on the part of the \nminority leadership and its members where the legislative item is a \nbipartisan product. That seems to me to be a responsibility to \nbe constructive. It is irresponsible then for minority leadership and \nmembers of the minority to obstruct a consensus item.\n\n  It is the height of irresponsibility to obstruct and delay when the \nitem is a bipartisan compelling matter such as this bill is. It is \nsimple. Is the United States going to abide by international agreements \nwe have already approved in this Senate?\n  It is our responsibility to set an example for the rest of the world \nbecause we are outstanding in exemplifying the rule of law and the \nprotection of individual freedoms. Some people might say we ought to \ngive that notoriety to England because our law comes from England. But \nI think you would all agree when it comes to individual freedom we have \neven advanced beyond England.\n  Are we going to have a constructive approach to this legislation? I \nhave to say to my fellow Senators: It is in our hands. Either we can \ncontinue to play these political games or we can do the job we were \nelected to do.\n  Some have said something such as we will take a limited time on \namendments. That misses the point. The point is the majority is led by \nSenator Frist. We have all played this game straight. The majority \namendments to this bill have improved the bill in ways that will get \neven more votes for it. All those amendments we have offered have been \nbipartisan.\n  For example, the Hatch-Murray amendment on research and development \ncredit and the Bunning-Stabenow amendment on accelerating the \nmanufacturing deduction--you recognize those Senators' names \nimmediately and know there is one Democrat and one Republican. That is \nthe way things get done in the Senate.\n  The Democratic leadership has taken this bipartisan bill and turned \nit into a political football.\n  We have an amendment on overtime that was previously voted on and \nthat is a sticking point.\n  There are other showstoppers planned by the Democratic leadership. In \nthis case, you have one side--the majority--using the power of setting \nthe agenda in a constructive way. I define that constructive way as \nbipartisan because nothing gets done in the Senate that is not \nbipartisan.\n  Then you have the other side--the Democratic side--using its power of \namendments and the power of delay solely for politically destructive \npurposes.\n  That imbalance can't last for long. If it does last for long, the \nSenate is brought to a halt. It is kind of like the law of physics. For \nevery action there is a reaction.\n  There shouldn't be this kind of tension on a must-do--in other words, \na\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\nmust-pass--bipartisan bill. When it is this way on a must-pass \nbipartisan bill, something is out of whack. Republicans will eventually \nbe fed up with the gamesmanship on the other side. It will mean the \nRepublican political amendments--those which the Democrats do not \nlike--are going to be brought up because for every action there is a \nreaction. That is going to lead to a vicious circle and this bipartisan \nbill will be more bogged down than it is presently.\n  Another route Republicans could take is to switch to an agenda item \nthat is not like this one. It would be a bill that has heavy political \novertones. It would not be as compelling as this bill. It probably \nwouldn't necessarily be a must-pass bill.\n  Again, if we were to do that, the victim would be this very good \nmust-pass bipartisan bill.\n  From the Republican side, let me say to every Democrat, we don't want \nto go that way. We will do everything we can to avoid going that way.\n  Maybe the Democratic leadership thinks a designed plan to deter us \nfrom taking care of the people's business is good politics. Blame the \nRepublicans, they may be thinking. They may be thinking: We have a \nliberal press, we can get away with it. They will protect us. They do \nall the time, anyway. It is kind of an encouragement. Maybe they think \nit is more important than actually helping the workers which this bill \nwill help; and the U.S. businesses that are at risk because of this \nEuro tax; in other words, the European tariff on our products going \nfrom the United States to Europe.\n  It isn't that simple. There will be accountability. There has always \nbeen in the case of cloture votes. We don't want to go the route of a \ncloture vote. None of us want to go there again. But we could go there \nagain. There is a petition on file. The American people expect us to do \nour jobs and not play politics.\n\n  I have talked about our responsibility as Senators. Let me put it in \nthe context in my role as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. \nThanks to the good people of Iowa, I have seniority to chair the oldest \nstanding committee in the Senate, the Finance Committee. I am pleased \nto work with my friend, our ranking Democratic member, Senator Baucus. \nNot to toot our horns too much, but I am proud of our committee. We \nrespond to big, tough issues in a businesslike, professional manner. We \ndo not always agree, but most of the time we do agree.\n  From my view, this foreign sales corporation replacement bill has \nbeen handled in the best bipartisan tradition of our Finance Committee. \nSenator Baucus and I developed this bill as partners. All Democrats, \neven Senators Daschle and Kerry, participated in and supported this \nbill out of the Finance Committee. They are Members of this committee. \nAll of the amendments I put up for this bill have been bipartisan \namendments. They are amendments that have improved the bill.\n  Who can argue with the domestic job benefit extended by the research \nand development credit? That was a bipartisan bill. Who can argue with \nenhancing the manufacturing deduction? That was a bipartisan amendment. \nDemocratic Members were accommodated in the committee and on the floor \nwith a managers' package. Senator Baucus and I developed that package \nshoulder to shoulder.\n  The latest version includes the bipartisan package of energy tax \nincentives approved by the Senate Finance Committee last year for \nfarmers in the Midwest, the South, timber harvesters in the Northwest, \nor wind farms across the country. This package is going to produce and \ncreate jobs. This package has twice passed the Senate without dissent.\n  For all the Senators from my region and other places who said they \ncould not support cloture on the Energy bill last winter because of the \nMTBE issue, here is your chance to vote for an energy bill that does \nnot have anything to do with MTBE. Members do not have to worry about \nyour personal injury lawyer friends calling upon you to fight the MTBE \nthing because they want to protect their own income. Members do not \nhave to worry about offending them. That is not in this bill. Members \ngot a chance to vote an energy bill they wanted.\n  This maneuvering bothers me. So I brought along a chart that draws \nfrom a favorite activity in the Midwest. I am talking about a game of \nfootball. The gridiron does not necessarily have anything to do with \nthe gridlock that is occurring on this bill, but it illustrates the \nproblems we have.\n  This JOBS bill is very near the Senate goalline. Unfortunately, \npolitics is driving the Democratic leadership to move the goalposts. \nWhen we came into session in January, Senator Frist was criticized by \nthe Democratic leadership for not moving to the JOBS bill right away. \nAt that time, the goalpost was very clear, very close, right there \nwhere it always is on the football field. That was in January.\n  After we finished the highway bill and a couple of other things, \nSenator Frist attempted to move the jobs in manufacturing bill. Much to \nmy surprise, we were ambushed by the Democratic leadership with \nunrelated amendments. I thought I had an understanding as floor \nmanager. That understanding was we were going to do amendments first \nthat were related to the bill and then move to other amendments. That \nagreement was not carried out.\n\n  From my standpoint, this was an unfortunate event. In budget \ndiscussions, I made clear I opposed putting this JOBS bill in the \nreconciliation package because I had assurances that the Democratic \nleadership wanted the bill passed. In fact, my ranking Member, Senator \nBaucus, 2 days before Republicans went to Philadelphia for our retreat \nin January to make our plans for this year, told me. I want to move \nthis JOBS bill; do not let the Republicans include this JOBS bill in \nthe reconciliation because reconciliation is obnoxious to the \nbipartisanship of the Senate. It is obnoxious to the minority.\n  When we were making our plans in Philadelphia, my colleagues \nresponded to that request from my Democrat ranking Member and we did \nnot include this bill in the process of reconciliation. It happens that \nmy view was not shared by the House leadership or even by the Senate \nleadership or by the White House. I took the position in leadership \nmeetings and in the Senate Budget Committee Republican caucus \ndeliberations that the Democratic leadership would not politicize this \nbill; we would get it passed.\n  I was ambushed on March 3rd. In fact, it looks like I was wrong and \nothers were right.\n  So we have a second goalpost here. It was the amendment of my \ncolleague from Iowa on overtime. It did not matter that we had voted on \nthat amendment previously. It did not matter that the amendment dealt \nwith proposed--not final, proposed--Department of Labor regulations. \nNo, none of that mattered. That amendment was and still is a \nshowstopper to this bipartisan bill that everyone agrees ought to pass \nthe Senate. When it comes to a final vote, it will pass overwhelmingly.\n  We are now at that second goalpost. The demands of the Democratic \nleadership still change. We were talking about a single-digit list of \namendments. Not anymore. Now that it looks like an overtime vote may be \nin the picture, there is a goalpost yet farther away. For the first \ntime, we are hearing of other amendments not even in the jurisdiction \nof the Finance Committee, such as an increase in the minimum wage, \nanother showstopper. We cannot finish the bill, we are told, even \nthough we are told the substance is great. This is the greatest bill \nsince sliced bread is the opinion of people all over the Senate. But we \ncannot finish the bill because of this new goalpost.\n  Heaven help us how that might turn out.\n  There is a final goalpost out there. It is way, way out there, as you \ncan see. It is getting to conference. We may move through all of these \ngoalposts but then be blocked from going to conference because the \nDemocrats have decided they should never agree to go to conference on a \nbill unless they can dictate the outcome. Effectively, that does not \njust shut down the Senate; that shuts down the whole Congress.\n  Now, let me ask you: Is this any way to legislate? Is this a proper \nexercise of leadership? Is this right when jobs are on the line and \npeople back home expect us to move consensus legislation? You have to \nwonder: Is all this obstruction really worth it?\n  Now, my sense is, the political imperative of stopping this \nbipartisan bill is\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\nvery strong. It seems the Democratic leadership is so fearful or \nresistant to getting a bipartisan JOBS bill to the President's desk \nthat they are going to do anything to block it. Just keep moving the \ngoalposts; pretty soon you will not see them. I think the record \nreflects this view I have that somehow there can be no JOBS bill that \ngets to the President of the United States.\n  Now, do you know what I would be willing to do? If there is something \nwith the title of this bill, called a JOBS bill, that is obnoxious to \nthe minority, because it might make a Republican President look good, \nwell, I will change the name of it. You guys name this bill. It is OK \nwith me. The title has nothing to do with the substance of it in the \nsense of legislative dominance, but we try to say, in the title of a \nbill, what we are intending to accomplish. What we are intending to \naccomplish in this jobs in manufacturing bill is to stop this \noutsourcing that you hear so much about, to create jobs in \nmanufacturing in America, and not just jobs but good jobs, because \nmanufacturing jobs that are related to exports pay 15 percent above the \nnational average. They are good jobs.\n  I have predicted they cannot let this bill get to the President of \nthe United States for political reasons. I hope I am proven wrong in \nthe next few days. But I can say this: It is time to get the job done. \nIn a few days, I hope we can move back and pass this jobs in \nmanufacturing legislation. It is, in fact, a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. It is, in fact, a piece of legislation that deserves \nbetter treatment than it has received so far.\n  So tomorrow I hope, for all these reasons, particularly the reasons I \ngave earlier this afternoon--that there are so many amendments that \nhave been added to this bill at the request of Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, but I emphasize the Democrats--they have something \nin this bill they have asked for. They have asked for me to consider \nit. If they do not vote to stop debate tomorrow, to move on this \nlegislation, get it to the President, why did they come to me in the \nfirst place and ask me to put their favorite piece of legislation in \nthis bill?\n  It is all good legislation. I do not find fault with the people who \nhave asked me to do it. It is all good public policy. But, also, it was \nnot something real pertinent to the primary purpose of this \nlegislation. But we are helping them get their bill passed by \ncooperating with them. I would like a little cooperation in return. I \nwould like to have all the Members who we have tried to accommodate--\nboth Republican and Democrat--vote to stop debate and move on to final \npassage of this bill, so we can create jobs in manufacturing.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as \nin morning business for not to exceed 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 2288 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on introduced bills \nand joint resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business, and I further ask consent that \nimmediately after my remarks Senator Harkin be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Voice Over Internet Protocol Regulatory Relief Act\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I rise to speak today on legislation I \nintroduced this week called the VOIP Regulatory Freedom Act of 2004. \nThis is legislation that deals with the issue of voice communications \nsent using Internet protocol that many Members of this body may not be \nfamiliar with or may not have heard a great deal about; but it is a new \ntechnology that takes advantage of the growing broadband networks that \nare in place in this country to send voice messages, much the same as \none might send an e-mail or an instant message. It is a growing area of \ntechnology and innovation, but it is one where there is not a very \nclear path regarding regulatory and taxing jurisdiction, and there are \nnot a lot of laws on the books that clearly address this new \ntechnology.\n  In order to encourage continued investment in and continued use of \nthis application and this system for sending voice traffic and in order \nto make sure consumers continue to have the benefits of lower costs, \nnew features, and better service that is the potential of this \ntechnology, I have introduced legislation this week.\n  First and foremost, S. 2281 declares this is a technology that uses \nnational and global broadband data networks, the Internet, that we have \nall read and heard so much about by this point in time. It recognizes \nthese are international networks, global networks, and therefore we \nshould have Federal jurisdiction in this area.\n  Second, it takes the step of preempting States from regulating in \nthis area, the area related to voice-over-Internet-protocol \napplications, because what we do not need is a patchwork of 50 \ndifferent sets of regulations that would stifle the innovation, the \ninvestment, and the productivity we all hope will come from this \ntechnology.\n  Even worse, the regulations some States have already begun to try to \napply are not regulations developed for the Internet, broadband, or a \nvoice-over-Internet-protocol application. They are really designed for \na copper wire circuit switch telephone network that was invented 100 \nyears ago and for which most of these State regulations were developed \nin the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. It is an outdated system and we should \nnot be trying to force old regulatory structures on this new \ntechnology.\n  Third, the VOIP Regulatory Freedom Act of 2004 that I have introduced \nwill clarify the definition for information services, for VOIP \napplications, in a way that can be easily understood given new and \nemerging technologies.\n  I was not in Congress at the time, but Congress wrote the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act that talked about information services and \ntelecommunications. Quite frankly, it did not envision these kinds of \nvoice applications being offered over the public Internet or over \nprivate networks. So as a result, we have had lawsuits, not \nsurprisingly. In America, if one is unsure of what is happening, if one \ndoes not like the law, get a lawyer and sue, but we have had lawsuits \nbecause of the lack of clarity in some of these definitions. My bill \nwould clarify the definition of voice-over-Internet-protocol. It states \nclearly what it is and what it is not from a regulatory perspective, \nand then treats it much like we would any other information service \nthat uses Internet protocol, whether it is an e-mail, an instant \nmessage, or sending other data over the Internet.\n  This bill does address a lot of key concerns regarding \ntelecommunications and the old telephone circuit switch telephone \nnetwork. The bill makes sure that voice-over-Internet-protocol \nproviders participate in existing Federal universal service programs. \nIn other areas, such as E-911 emergency calling, and disability access, \nthe bill calls for an industry group to work out the implementation of \nthese important features for the new technology. S. 2281 will make sure \nwe do not apply the old access charges to this new technology. We put \nforward a requirement for the FCC to work out a new system for \nintercarrier compensation and, of course, we recognize law enforcement \nwill need access to these new voice-over-Internet-protocol applications \nand state it has to be the same or better access but no less than the \naccess available for information services that currently exist today.\n  Finally, the bill protects consumers by ensuring that this new \nservice won't be taxed at the State level. Everyone knows the more you \ntax something the less you get. If you want to discourage investment, \ninnovation, and capital from moving into important new services like \nthis, then raise the taxes and discourage that investment. From my \nperspective, this would be the wrong direction.\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\n  I think this bill provides for enormous opportunity for consumers, \nincluding robust features and functions, more options, and lower \nprices.\n  It is important to note that we have narrowly tailored this bill to \ndeal with the voice-over-Internet-protocol applications. It should be \nclear that is not an effort to rewrite the 1996 Telecommunications Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at the legislation and step \nforward. Let me know your views and thoughts. We are likely to have \nhearings on this bill in the Commerce Committee in the coming months. I \nlook forward to a vigorous and substantive debate.\n\n\n                          Economic Malpractice\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before us right now is a motion to proceed \nto what is called the medical malpractice bill, for short. In fact, \nthat is what it is--to change the tort system in America to take away \nthe right of any person who has been injured to seek redress in court \nfor noneconomic damages and also for punitive damages. It is called the \nmedical malpractice bill. We have had it here a number of times before. \nIt is not going anywhere because it is not a true compromise. There may \nbe a compromise that could be worked out on this issue, but this bill \nrepresents a one-sided view. It is not going anywhere. The Republicans \nknow this. They know it is not going anywhere, but they brought it up.\n  I thought the FSC bill--the JOBS bill--which they brought up earlier \nwas a must-do bill. There was a jobs bill. They are going to put people \nto work. Yet it languishes somewhere.\n  In the meantime, we brought up the TANF bill. Now we brought up the \nmedical malpractice bill.\n  It makes you wonder what the priorities are of the majority party in \nthe Senate. There is a lot of talk about who is obstructing what around \nhere. But I think it is clear to any casual observer that the majority \nis basically kind of filibustering their own bills, obstructing their \nown bills. And sometimes, as in the case of the gun bill that was up \nbefore us a few weeks ago, the Republican majority even voted against \nits own bill. But it chews up a lot of time. It takes up a lot of time \non the Senate floor, but nothing goes anywhere.\n  That is what we are facing again with this so-called medical \nmalpractice bill, or the motion to proceed to it. The majority party \nknows it is not going anywhere. So they want to talk about medical \nmalpractice. There has been a few speakers on the floor today on the \nRepublican side talking about medical malpractice.\n  I think what the country wants us to focus on and wants to hear us \ndebate and discuss and vote on is the economic malpractice of the Bush \nadministration. That is right, the economic malpractice of the Bush \nadministration.\n  I mean by that the fact we have had a loss in jobs in this country \nover the last 3 years unlike anything we have seen in 70 years.\n  This chart shows that not since the Great Depression have we had a \nloss of jobs for any President during his first term--some more than \nothers, but we have always had a positive indication of job creation.\n  It is interesting to note that most of these took place under \nDemocratic administrations--Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower had a \nlittle bit but still had some; Kennedy, we had good job creation; \nJohnson, very healthy job creation; even under Nixon, pretty good; \nFord, back down; Carter; even under Reagan; Bush, it is down; Clinton, \nup a little bit more. All positive, Republicans and Democrats, until \nthis President, the only President in 70 years to have negative job \ngrowth.\n  That is why I call it the economic malpractice of the Bush \nadministration--the only President in all of those years to preside \nover negative job growth in our country.\n  Not only are we not discussing on the Senate floor these issues \npertaining to workers, but we are precluded by the majority from even \noffering amendments and getting a vote on them.\n\n  I tried earlier on the so-called FSC bill that everyone talks about, \nthe so-called JOBS bill they had here, to offer my amendment to \ndisallow the promulgation of proposed rules that would change the \novertime laws in our country.\n  Last year, to refresh everyone's memory, about this time--a year and \na month ago, as a matter of fact--the Department of Labor came out with \na proposed change in overtime rules.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act has been in existence since 1938. We \nhave had changes in basic overtime laws. But in every single case, when \nit has been done, it has always been done with consultation with \nCongress after open hearings with the public having input.\n  These proposed rules came like a bolt of lightning in the midnight \nhour. No public hearings were held. Not one public hearing was held on \nthese proposed changes in overtime rules. No hearings were held by \nCongress. No witnesses were called to talk about what these proposed \nchanges might mean in the workplace. They just put the rules out there.\n  Now the Department of Labor is about to issue its permanent change in \nregulations.\n  That is why last summer this Senator offered an amendment on the \nSenate floor to disallow these rules from going into effect. The Senate \nadopted my amendment on a bipartisan vote. We had quite a few \nRepublicans vote for it. The House of Representatives then voted to \ninstruct its conferees to go along with the Senate on that provision. \nThat was on the appropriations bill. The White House came in and got it \nknocked out. Then we were forced to vote on the appropriations bill \nwithout that provision in it.\n  I said at that time in January I was going to find any vehicle I \ncould to try to revisit this issue because the Congress had spoken; \nthat we did not want these rules to go into effect which would take \naway the rights of up to 8 million American workers to get paid time-\nand-a-half overtime if they worked over 40 hours a week.\n  The first bill I could do this on was the FSC bill, which was brought \nout by the Finance Committee to the floor. They termed it a jobs bill.\n  I pointed out then, and I point out again today: How can you have a \nmeaningful jobs bill on the floor of the Senate if we are not going to \nspeak about it, debate it, and vote on whether we are going to take \naway the rights of people in this country to get paid time and a half \nfor over 40 hours a week? Yet that is what happened. I offered the \namendment. The majority will not permit a vote on it. They tried all \nkinds of parliamentary maneuvers, tactics, recommits, all kinds of \nfunny parliamentary games just to keep us from voting on it.\n  I don't know what they are so afraid of. Are they afraid members of \nthe President's own party might vote to say those rules shouldn't go \ninto effect? They did last summer. I compliment them for it. That is \ncourage. I know the President and his Department of Labor want to \ndrastically change our overtime laws. They want to do it through the \nregulatory process--not through the legislative process.\n  Quite frankly, the Bush administration thought they could put these \nnew rules into effect quietly with no hearings before anyone knew what \nwas going on. But they were wrong. They got caught with their hand in \nthe cookie jar.\n  The fact is, public outrage over the proposed new overtime rules has \ngotten stronger and stronger as Americans learn more about the details. \nAt this point, the administration has about as much credibility on the \nissue of overtime as they do on the weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq. In other words, the administration has zero credibility on this \nissue.\n  The Department of Labor claims it simply wants to give employers \nclearer guidance as to who is eligible for overtime pay. But ordinary \nAmericans are not buying this happy talk. They know the administration \nis proposing a radical rewrite of the Nation's overtime rules. American \nworkers know these new rules will strip them of their right to fair \ncompensation. So we will continue to press for a vote on this and on a \ncouple of other issues.\n  Last week on the TANF bill, the temporary assistance to needy \nfamilies, Senator Boxer of California offered the amendment to raise \nthe minimum wage, now at $5.15 an hour, to $7 an hour over 2 years. The \nmajority will not vote on that, either. So that bill has gone by the \nwayside, too, because they do not want to face the music and\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\nvote on whether we increase the minimum wage. Mr. President, $5.15 is \nthe minimum wage now--mostly women, heads of households with children.\n  I point out again, since 1967, if the minimum wage had just kept pace \nwith inflation, the minimum wage would be over $8 an hour right now. \nYet we are only asking for $7 an hour.\n  I wonder what the hue and cry would be in this country if we had \nindexed CEO compensation the way we indexed the minimum wage increases \nsince 1968. We would probably be better off in this country, to tell \nyou the truth.\n  So we tried to bring up a minimum wage increase. We tried to stop \nthese rules on overtime from going into effect to strip people of their \novertime. We have tried to increase unemployment compensation, to get \nmore unemployment compensation to workers whose unemployment benefits \nhad run out. There are 1.1 million workers this last week who lost \ntheir unemployment benefits because of time running out. We want to \nextend that. The majority will not let us.\n  The administration is all for an economic stimulus when it involves \ntax breaks for people making more than $200,000 a year. When it comes \nto economic stimulus involving raising the income of people at the \nbottom of the economic ladder, whether by increasing the minimum wage \nor creating jobs directly, which is what the highway bill will do, the \nPresident is even threatening to veto the highway bill.\n  We passed a bipartisan highway bill in the Senate. The House passed \nsomething substantially less. The President has threatened to veto \nthat. Actually, the House bill for my own State of Iowa would mean \n12,000 jobs less than that passed by the Senate. Yet the President has \nthreatened to veto even the House version.\n  There is a frustration among American workers right now. They know \nthey are working harder. They know they are working longer. But \nsomething is wrong. They are not getting adequate compensation. As this \nchart indicates American workers are working longer hours per year than \nworkers in any other industrialized country. In fact, since 1979, every \nsingle industrial country has reduced its work hours except one, the \nUnited States. In Japan, since 1979, they have gone down 286 hours a \nyear. Germany has gone down 489 hours per year. Even Canada went down \n31 hours a year. Australia went down 44 hours per year. But the United \nStates went up an average of 32 hours per year. We are the only country \nincreasing the number of hours worked per year.\n\n  Not only that, as we found out earlier--I quoted the New York Times \nSunday article by Steven Greenhouse--unscrupulous businesses in America \nare cheating people out of their overtime. I may not have mentioned a \nguy by the name of Drew Pooters, retired member of the Air Force \nmilitary police. He went to work in a Toys ``R'' Us store in \nAlbuquerque. He was stunned by what he found his manager doing.\n\n     . . . his manager was sitting at a computer and altering \n     workers' time records, secretly deleting hours to cut their \n     paychecks and fatten his store's bottom line.\n       ``I told him, `That's not exactly legal,' '' said Mr. \n     Pooters, who ran the electronics department. Then he out-and-\n     out threatened me to not talk about what I saw.\n\n  Mr. Pooters quit. Then he got a job managing a Family Dollar store, \none of 5,100 in that discount chain. Top managers there ordered him not \nto let employee total hours exceed a certain amount each week. One day \nhe said the district manager told him to use a trick to cut payroll, \ndelete some hours electronically.\n  Experts on compensation say the illegal doctoring of hourly \nemployees' time records is far more prevalent than most Americans \nbelieve. The practice, called ``shaving time,'' is easily done and hard \nto detect with the simple matter of computer keystrokes.\n  I earlier had this article printed in the Record.\n  The article revealed in Toys ``R'' Us, in Dollar Stores, Taco Bell, \nPep Boys, Wal-Mart employees, et cetera, workers are basically being \ncheated out of their fair compensation. Many are being cheated out of \novertime.\n  Here is what the Wall Street Journal article said about this:\n\n       While employees like overtime pay, a lot of employers \n     don't. Violations are so common that the Employer Policy \n     Foundation, an employer-supported think tank in Washington, \n     estimates that workers would get an additional $199 billion a \n     year if the rules were observed. That estimate is considered \n     conservative by many researchers.\n\n  American workers are being cheated out of over $199 billion a year by \nunscrupulous employers.\n  Here we have the Department of Labor legally--trying to do it \nlegally--taking away workers' rights to overtime pay. The Steven \nGreenhouse article in the New York Times showed on Sunday there is a \nrampage in this country of illegal activities taking away workers' \nrights to their adequate pay. Why isn't the Department of Labor \nfocusing its time and energy in going after these unscrupulous \nemployers, making an example of them so others will not be encouraged \nto do the same thing rather than trying to legally take away workers' \nrights to overtime?\n  That is why I say this Bush administration is committing economic \nmalpractice.\n  You do not have to be from Iowa to know that you do not fertilize a \ntree from the top down. You fertilize the roots. That is how we need to \nstimulate the American economy, by applying stimulus directly to the \nroots. There are obvious ways to do this. One, instead of tax cuts for \nthe wealthy, you focus tax cuts on working people. Secondly, you \nincrease the minimum wage. You put more money in the pockets of hard-\nworking people who, by necessity, have to spend every penny. Three, you \nextend benefits for the long-term unemployed, again, who, by necessity, \nare spending every dollar they receive. Four, you pass a highway bill \nthat is as generous as possible.\n  We need to rebuild our Interstate Highway System in this country. \nTake a drive on any one of them. They are beat up. They are \ndisintegrating. They are a patchwork here and there. They are causing \ndelays in trucking. They are beating up our cars and taking away from \nthe productivity of America. Our bridges need to be replaced. Sewer and \nwater systems need to be upgraded.\n  These are good jobs. These are jobs that employ Americans. When you \nthink about construction jobs in this country, that is what I call \ninsourcing jobs rather than outsourcing jobs because, you see, if you \nare building a bridge or a highway, a sewer and water system, or maybe \na new school, when you think about it, most of the products are made in \nAmerica. Think about it. The cement is made here. The rebars, the \nrerods, and all that for construction are made here. When you put up a \nbuilding, you put up wallboard. That is made here--and electrical \nwiring, electrical conduits, electrical switches, electrical lights, \nplumbing. When you think about all that goes into construction, most--\nthe vast majority--of the products are made in this country.\n  Guess what else. All of the labor done is here in America. You do not \noutsource those jobs. Those are American jobs. What do you get out of \nit? You put a lot of people to work. You improve the productivity of \nAmerica. You get a lasting benefit of things that last for a long time, \nand that helps us be a more productive and vibrant Nation.\n  It seems we can spend billions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan to \nrebuild those countries. We need to invest money like that here in \nAmerica. For every $1 billion spent on these projects, we sustain or \ncreate more than 47,000 jobs for American workers. That is the \ndirection we ought to be going, rather than more tax cuts for those who \nmake over $200,000 a year.\n  I do not have it with me, but I saw a cartoon in the paper today that \nI thought said it all. There was a gasoline pump, with gas that cost \nabout $1.90 a gallon. This American worker had obviously just filled \nhis tank, and he was up at the window paying. In back of the window sat \nwhat looked like one of the Saudi Arabian princes saying, ``Thank \nyou,'' and taking our American worker's money. The caption below it \nwas: There goes the tax cut.\n  How many American workers, who are told by this President they got a \ntax cut for this or that, are now seeing it go to pay for imported oil, \nto pay for the increased price of gasoline because this administration \nwill not take their friends in Saudi Arabia to task to keep these \nprices low, will not let some of the oil out of our Strategic Oil \nReserve\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\nright now to counter these increased prices? So we find whatever little \nmoney the worker may have gotten in a tax cut going to pay for the \nincreased price of gasoline. Again, economic malpractice, economic \nmalpractice by this administration.\n\n  So we can go to the medical malpractice bill. Quite frankly, again, \nwe are focusing on medical malpractice and whether someone can sue for \ndamages, and this and that. While there may be a reasonable compromise \non this issue at some point, this bill is not it. But I wonder--I truly \nwonder--how many of the 43 million Americans who have no health \ninsurance coverage whatsoever would think this is the major health care \nissue that we ought to be debating and voting on in the Senate Chamber. \nThey are not interested in medical malpractice or suing. They just need \nhealth insurance. They need coverage for themselves and their families. \nHere we are talking about lawsuits, when what we ought to be talking \nabout is how we are going to get health care coverage to people in \nAmerica.\n  The other side can talk all they want about obstructionism and who is \nholding up what. We have said, time and time again, as I said on my \novertime amendment--I am not obstructing anything. I will take a time \nagreement. We have already had enough discussion. In 15 minutes we can \nhave a vote. In 15 minutes we can have a vote on the minimum wage. In \n15 minutes we can have a vote on extending unemployment compensation.\n  Who is obstructing what around here? It is simply that the majority \nside does not want to have these votes under the time-honored tradition \nof the Senate to debate, discuss, and vote. It seems as if the majority \nside now wants to turn the Senate into just another House of \nRepresentatives--come out with a closed rule. I know that sounds kind \nof funny. What does that mean? What it means is the majority party \nbrings out a bill. You cannot amend it. You cannot change it. You \neither have to vote for it the way it is or not vote. If they have the \nmajority votes, they want to pass it.\n  That is not the way to run the Senate. It is not the way to debate \nand vote in the Senate. The way to do it is to have our debates, have \nour votes, and move on. Sometimes you win; sometimes you do not. But, \nto me, that is what the American people want us to do.\n  We are doing nothing in the Senate right now--nothing. The reason we \nare doing nothing is because the other side will not let us vote. So \nhere we sit with bill after bill that is brought out, trying to game \nthe system so we cannot have votes on these meaningful issues.\n  They say: Well, these are just political games. No, they are not \npolitical. When you are talking about taking away a worker's right to \novertime pay; when you are talking about increasing the minimum wage \nfor a single mother with kids to feed, who is being cheated out of her \novertime pay; when you are talking about a family whose unemployment \nbenefits have run out, and they do not know where to turn, it is not \npolitical. It is just focusing on the real needs of America--our \nworking families--and not focusing on giving yet more tax breaks to \nthose who already have too much in our society.\n  Mr. President, I will close my remarks--I see others want the floor--\nto say we will be back. I do not like to quote too much the present \nGovernor of California but: I'll be back.\n  Time and time again, I will be back to offer this overtime amendment, \nuntil we have a vote on it, and until we can express ourselves on these \nonerous rules that the Department of Labor wants to foist on the \nAmerican worker.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, tomorrow we will cast an important vote for \nour constituents. Once again we have come back to the Senate floor to \npress for legislative change on an issue that is critical to health \ncare for all Americans. Time and again we have attempted to stop \nskyrocketing health care costs due to the runaway tort system under \nwhich trial lawyers abuse the court system with spurious claims that \ndrive up insurance premiums for physicians and hospitals and drive them \nto practice expensive defensive medicine; in other words, performing \ncostly and unnecessary procedures to be sure they won't be sued.\n  Last year I was a cosponsor of S. 11, the Patients First Act of 2003. \nThe Democratic minority precluded us from completing work on that \nlegislation. In February, we targeted a very narrow range of the \nmedical profession to try to see if our colleagues would help us out in \none area, the OB/GYN specialty, with S. 2061, called the Healthy \nMothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. Again the Democratic \nminority denied us cloture so we could not consider the bill.\n  It is time to stop this obstructionism. Here we are again. This time \nI hope my colleagues will join in voting for cloture so we may enact \nthe needed reforms to the medical liability system.\n  This legislation addresses lawsuits for health care liability claims \nrelated to the provision of obstetrical, gynecological, emergency, or \ntrauma care. With good reason, we again include the OB/GYN specialty. \nThe dramatic increase in OB/GYN premiums--more than 160 percent over \nthe last 16 years--has greatly outpaced the rate of inflation, and many \nphysicians and hospitals have been unable to keep up with these \nescalating costs. In my State of Arizona, OB/GYN practices face \npremiums averaging $67,000, up 16 percent in just 1 year's time. Think \nof this for a moment. I am not sure what the average salary or wage of \nan American earner is today, but it is nowhere close to $67,000. That \nis what your OB/GYN doctor has to pay before he or she can even think \nabout delivering your baby. That is the cost we have driven up.\n  My colleague from Iowa talked about the large number of people who \ncan't afford health insurance. This is one of the reasons they can't \nafford health insurance. We have so driven up the cost of practicing \nmedicine and the cost of health care by virtue of this broken tort \nsystem that a lot of people can't afford insurance and, in fact, \nemployers can't afford to provide insurance for them. Let's do \nsomething about it. This legislation does something about it.\n  I would like to share the account of a physician in Paradise Valley, \nAZ, a woman with whom I spoke about 3 or 4 weeks ago who told me the \nstory of her desire from the time she was a preteen to deliver babies \nand how she worked hard all through school to get good grades so she \ncould go to medical school and eventually complete her residency. She \ndid that. She had started out as a little girl volunteering in the \nhospital. She always wanted to deliver babies. After hard work and her \ndegree, she ultimately delivered more than 5,000 babies over the course \nof 17 years. By the way, the vast majority were without any \ncomplications, and she has one of the best reputations as a physician \nin our community.\n\n  On one occasion, much to the surprise and dismay of the labor and \ndelivery team, a baby was delivered with complications and cerebral \npalsy. While a group of doctors conducted a peer review of the case and \ndetermined there was no fault on the part of any of the physicians, the \ndoctor who delivered the baby--this woman of whom I speak--3 years \nafter the incident got sued.\n  Initially the plaintiff requested $2 million which was her insurance \npolicy limit. Deciding it was better to settle and avoid long, costly \nlitigation, the insurance company persuaded her to offer to settle the \ncase, which she did. But then the plaintiff asked for $10 million from \nthe physician and another $5 million from the hospital. This highly \ncompetent, highly dedicated, and motivated physician found herself \nconsciously practicing medicine differently. For instance, performing a \nlot more cesarean deliveries in order to lessen the risk of \ncomplications to the baby, just in case. She was filled with a new \nanxiety that had never been present before. Frankly, she said it took a \nlot of joy out of the work she had enjoyed so much for the previous 17 \nyears.\n  Eventually she stopped delivering babies because of the skyrocketing \ninsurance premiums due to the claim that had been filed against her \nand, candidly, because of the trepidation she felt now she had been \nsued and the fact she might be sued again. Incidentally, her case was \nultimately settled for less than the policy limits. But here is a\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\nphysician who was a tremendous contributor to the profession, to our \ncommunity, to the health of mothers, and the health and viability of a \nlot of new babies. She is no longer practicing her profession because \nof the tort system. This physician's story is far too common. It needs \nto be addressed, and we can address it through the legislation before \nus.\n  In addition to the reforms for obstetricians and gynecologists, S. \n2207 will cover physicians who treat patients in emergency \ncircumstances--not just in the emergency room but in any emergency \ncircumstance--from frivolous lawsuits. Many physicians find themselves \ndistanced from what led them into the profession in the first place--\ntheir desire to help people, just as the physician I talked about. \nEmergency rooms and trauma centers are flooded with patients who need \nhelp from accidents and disasters, all very unfavorable situations. \nThese professionals give their very best to try to address the patient \nregardless of the circumstance, without even asking whether they have \nthe ability to pay, focused on stabilizing the patients and providing \nexcellent care.\n  Imagine the effect on the physician and the hospital when after \ntreating a patient in an emergency situation, they are faced with a \nlawsuit, particularly a lawsuit that does not have merit or seeks an \nexcessive award. The result is frequently the emergency rooms are \nunderstaffed, sometimes even have to close. The trauma centers are \nlosing specialists and, in some cases, closing. The physicians are not \nthere to provide this kind of emergency care.\n  Since no one knows exactly whether and where an emergency will take \nplace, this legislation covers emergency services anywhere, not just \nthose that occur in the emergency room. For example, if a family \npractitioner assists a person in an emergency at a mall where \nsomebody had a heart attack, the doctor would be subject to the \nprotection of this bill. If an internist helps a person in an \nautomobile accident at the side of the highway and assists that \nindividual, that care would also be protected by this legislation.\n\n  The benefit of this legislation is while it makes specific reference \nto the OB/GYN doctors, it also addresses any emergency services, not \njust those performed by emergency room physicians or in a trauma \ncenter.\n  As with previous bills, this legislation will hold physicians and \ninsurers accountable for medical expenses in instances when they are \nclearly wrong. S. 2207 will maximize returns to the patients instead of \nthe trial lawyers by setting percentage caps on contingency fees. These \nare the fees the lawyers receive. The bill would allow lawyers to be \nwell compensated for their work but not at the unfair expense of the \nplaintiffs. Patients would have 3 years from the date of injury to \nbring forth a claim. In the case of minors, that statute of limitations \nwould be extended.\n  The bill will allow for unlimited awards of economic damages but \nplace reasonable caps on the so-called noneconomic damages or pain and \nsuffering damages. If we can pass S. 2207, we should therefore see \ntremendous benefits: a reduction in the backlog of these cases in our \ncourts; a reduction and perhaps elimination of these excessive jury \nawards; a reduction in the amount of money paid by the insurance \ncompanies to settle the cases. They incur great expenses in defending \nthe cases in court and even processing the claims for settlement. Even \nthose that are dismissed cost money. Physicians spend a large amount of \nmoney to defend themselves even in those cases they win. A large number \nof these cases are settled out of court to prevent the so-called mega \naward, the big award that can bankrupt a practice.\n  But something else will happen if we pass this bill. As I said, my \ncolleague from Iowa complained about too many people not having \ninsurance and one of the reasons why is because it has been expensed \nbeyond their ability to pay or their employer's ability to pay. Why? \nBecause the insurance company has to take into account these \nmalpractice awards, even the possibility a physician will be sued. \nImagine this: When a physician has to pay $67,000 in premiums for the \nability to deliver babies, think about how that additional cost has to \nbe shifted to the beneficiaries, the patients, the people who receive \nthe care, because the insurance companies have to make sure whatever \nhappens, their costs are covered.\n  So if we are going to talk about making it easier for people to get \ninsurance, making it easier for physicians to be able to continue their \npractices, for hospital emergency rooms to continue to stay open, and \nall of the other kinds of care to be provided, even that situation \nwhere you have a wreck on the side of the road and a doctor stops and \nrenders emergency care to you--any one of those situations--then we \nneed to deal with this bill tomorrow.\n  This has been around far too long, and tomorrow is our opportunity to \nright this wrong, vote for cloture, and enable us to take a final vote \non the bill. We should not condone a system that literally forces \nphysicians to retire early, as the physician from Paradise Valley I \nspoke of had to do. Sometimes they relocate to a different State with \nfriendlier laws. We should not force that either. Sometimes they drop \nhigh-risk services or they go into teaching or hospital administration. \nWe lose a lot of very competent physicians that way. This leads not \njust to improper staffing among physicians, obviously; more important, \nit compromises patient care.\n  We have heard the patient and physician stories and we have seen the \ncharts about the skyrocketing costs. We know of the facilities that \nhave had to close, emergency rooms and labor and delivery sections--all \nas a result of the high cost of a broken tort system. I ask my Senate \ncolleagues to join me in support of S. 2207 so we can provide quality \nhealth care to citizens across this Nation.\n  Mr. President, our constituents deserve nothing less, and that is all \nwe are asking for tomorrow--to give our constituents a chance to \nreceive the best health care they can receive, the best health care our \nsystem can provide. That is not occurring today and, far worse, it is \ngoing to continue to deteriorate in the future if we allow the trial \nlawyers and those who serve the trial lawyers to continue to obstruct \nthis commonsense legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to end the obstructionism, end the partisan \nbickering. Our constituents sent us here to accomplish and work \ntogether for sound results. Everyone knows we need this kind of reform. \nThe vote tomorrow is a vote to determine whether there will be a final \nvote on the bill. It only takes 40 Senators on the other side to say, \nno, we won't allow a vote to occur. That is a filibuster. That is \nobstructionism. That is a negative, partisan unwillingness to allow the \nwill of the majority to work on behalf of the people of this country.\n  I urge my colleagues tomorrow to please support the cloture vote, \nwhich will enable us to get to a final vote on this important bill. If \nwe do that, I think we can go home this fall and all be very proud, \nwhether we are Democrats or Republicans, or others, tell our \nconstituents we accomplished something for them in the area that \nperhaps, other than freedom, is most important for every one of us, and \nthat is quality health care. We owe our constituents nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access \nProtection Act of 2004 that is now before the Senate is a matter of \nvery real importance to real Americans. I have a good friend, an \nobstetrician, in Mobile, AL. We go to church together. He teaches \nSunday school class. He is a former president of the State association, \nas I recall. He was talking to me at church a few months ago about a \ndoctor who left the practice. His malpractice insurance was around \n$80,000, and he delivered around 80 children a year. That is $1,000 per \ndelivery that doctor paid for malpractice insurance.\n  This is a reality. I was with a doctor I know from the group that \ntreats my mother in Mobile, AL, just a week ago, and he told me people \nin the profession are retiring earlier and earlier because they are \ngetting tired of the stress and\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\nstrain of being micro-managed through litigation; that people do not \nhave to do that after a number of years and good people are leaving the \npractice over this issue.\n  Everybody in this body will say we need to do something about it; it \nis time for us to fix it; there is a problem; and we need to do this \nand that. But there is a strong influence, I have to say, from the \ntrial bar in the Senate. They are very active politically, everybody \nknows it. They are aggressive, and they contribute large sums of money. \nJust a very few lawyers contribute large sums of money to political \ncampaigns, and so far they have been able to block reforms.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, the assistant majority leader, Mr. \nMcConnell, proposed legislation that would eliminate lawsuits against \nrestaurants and food companies if somebody gets fat. You go to the \nstore and you ask for Little Debbie's. They sell them to you. That is \nwhat you want, isn't it, for Heaven's sake? They want to sue the \ncompany that gave the customer what they wanted. It is legal, so there \nshould not be a cause of action under any definition of law.\n  At that hearing, the premier witness, without a doubt, was Professor \nSchwartz, who is the editor of the most widely used textbook on torts \nin America. We got into a little bit of a philosophical discussion \nbecause some people suggest that it somehow is not legitimate that we \nin Congress should pass a law involving lawsuits; that it ought to be \nleft to the sanctified courts; that they are somehow better than the \npolitical branch, and that we ought to never pass a law that affects \nthe courts. Of course, that is hogwash. I asked him about that, and he \nsaid it plainly and we discussed it at some length.\n  Congress says what the statute of limitations is. If you file a \nlawsuit within 2 years, 5 years, 6 years, but 1 day late, you have no \nlawsuit; it is out; the statute of limitations runs. Congress sets that \nlimitation. Every State has limitations on damages. We create causes of \nactions that have never existed before by explicit statutory action.\n  There is a law in the code that if somebody rolls back your odometer \nand you sue them, you get an automatic $1,500 if you can prove they \nrolled back your odometer. In Kentucky, I am sure they roll back some \nodometers. Most cars we get in Alabama are rolled back in Tennessee, \nMr. President, and are shipped to the State. We created that cause of \naction--it never existed before--for actual damages, whatever would be \nsufficient. I filed a lawsuit under it one time.\n  I say all that to say Professor Schwartz is correct. We have every \nright to look at what is happening in America. I am not going to talk \nat length tonight, but I say we have a serious problem in this country \nthat is impacting health care in America. It is reducing the number of \nphysicians who are willing to practice, particularly to deliver babies.\n\n  I was in Ashland, AL, the hometown of Gov. Bob Riley of Alabama, in \nClay County. I visited their hospital because our prescription drug \nbill did a lot for rural hospitals. We had a big meeting and everybody \nwas there. They talked about how the year before they had given up the \ndelivery of babies in Ashland, AL, at that hospital. They no longer \ndeliver babies in the State. I have some numbers that were pretty \ndramatic to me that indicated how many of these hospitals had quit \ndelivering children. Why? Because they get sued. The amount of \nmalpractice it takes to do that is rather dramatic.\n  According to the Alabama Department of Public Health, only 58 \nhospitals in Alabama have labor and delivery services. That is down \nfrom 70 in 1999. Twelve hospitals since 1999 have quit delivering \nchildren. Only 14 of the hospitals that are left have full-time \nneonatologists and neonatal intensive care units. Those 14 are located \nin the five biggest cities: Birmingham, Montgomery, Mobile, Huntsville, \nand Tuscaloosa.\n  Those are big issues. Thirty-four of the 67 counties in the State do \nnot have OB delivery services. That was not true 30 years ago. This is \na recent trend. Sometimes it is better, I will admit, that a person go \nto a hospital, but we have a lot of people who believe in midwives \nbecause of the bonding and the personal attention a mother gets. They \nbelieve in that. I am not a believer in that. But a good doctor who \nknows the family, who knows the mother, maybe they go to church \ntogether, who cares about the family, used to deliver babies in a large \nway in Alabama. That kind of practice is going away today. We are \ncreating a circumstance in which fewer and fewer people are willing to \nundergo that type of practice.\n  Health insurance is way up. The delivery of health care has been \nconstricted as a result of unnecessary, oftentimes illegitimate \nlawsuits. In fact, it has almost gotten to the point where a physician \nwho delivers a child is held to be a guarantor of the healthiness of \nthat child.\n  If something is wrong, too often somebody looks around to find \nsomebody to sue; the doctor who did it or the hospital in which it was \ndelivered is the one who is sued.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be delighted to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It occurs to the Senator from Kentucky, in listening \nto observations of the Senator from Alabama, what has evolved in \nAmerica is that we believe we are a society of victims, everybody is a \nvictim? If somebody is wrong in my life, if I have a bad outcome in my \nlife, it must be somebody else's fault. So beyond the obvious abuse of \nthe legal system, it encourages the notion that personal responsibility \nis no longer a factor in American life.\n  I ask my friend from Alabama if he is also disturbed about this \ngrowing notion that I have no responsibility for the outcomes in my \nlife, if anything goes wrong it must be somebody else's fault and \nobviously the solution to that is to sue.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator from Kentucky is exactly correct. \nWe do have far too much of that. We have a lawsuit lottery mentality, \njackpot justice. People file suits and they seek huge amounts of money \nin hopes they will recover.\n  My daughter does some defense work in a law firm. She is a lawyer. \nShe was telling me about a nursing home case, and a person had bed \nsores, and there was a big lawsuit. She said, you know what they \ndiscovered? They had learned in some way that Ronald Reagan had bed \nsores.\n  These kind of things can happen, but they were having to pay a large \namount of money. Maybe they were negligent, maybe they deserved to pay, \nbut I just say there is this mentality that if something goes wrong \nsomebody has to pay. As the Senator from Kentucky knows, the one who \npays is the one who has insurance. That means the hospital or the \ndoctor normally. They are the ones who are getting whacked. It may be \nthat nobody investigated to see if maybe the mother drank alcohol too \nmuch during the pregnancy or something. Any number of things could have \noccurred that would have caused that.\n  I conclude by saying I am pleased to see this legislation move \nforward. It is not insignificant. I am hearing from my physicians that \nthey feel strongly that the quality of their lives, as well as the \nexcellence of their practice, have been adversely impacted by \nlitigation.\n  A doctor was in my office recently who is a leader in the medical \nassociation. He said, Jeff, I am telling you maybe as much as 50 \npercent of the medicine we practice is driven out of fear of lawsuits. \nWe could reduce the cost of medicine by a tremendous degree if we could \ncontain the threat of lawsuits.\n  There is no doubt that lawsuits have recompensed people who needed it \nfor a wrong. When a person commits a wrong, they should pay. There is \nno doubt about it. I know the Presiding Officer and the Senator from \nKentucky, in their law school there was a community standard of \nexcellence.\n  Everybody is not expected to be the best surgeon in America. Everyone \nis not expected to be the best lawyer in America. Take somebody who is \na professional and they were expected to give the best skilled work \nthey could give under the circumstances. They should not be found \nnegligent. They should not ignore a patient. They should not fail to \ngive the kind of care\n\n[[Page S3783]]\n\nthat everybody knows ought to be given. But just because one person has \na steadier hand or has more experience maybe and can do a surgery \nslightly better than another one does not mean, and never has meant \nunder American law, that there is a liability question.\n  I think the Senator from Kentucky is correct. What has concerned me \nis the erosion of the standard of negligence and error. A physician or \na hospital should commit an error, negligence, before they should be \nrequired to compensate someone who has had an unfortunate result in \nthat hospital. We have gotten away from that.\n  This bill, of course, allows for full recompense for damages and \ninjury for any cost for medical care; any cost for future treatment or \nhospitalization, which in a lifetime could be millions of dollars; \n$250,000 in pain and suffering, in addition to the compensatory costs; \nand $250,000 or twice the compensatory damages for punitive damages. \nThose things are allowed for in the bill; it just simply says there is \na limit.\n  When a person can sue somebody for $50 million and get a jury--juries \nreally have a difficult time deciding between $2 million and $30 \nmillion, and they come up with $15 million. How did they come up with \nthat number? This says that one gets fully compensated for however much \nit costs, for any damages that are sustained as a result of the \nnegligence of a physician. In addition to that, one can get punitive \ndamages and pain and suffering, but it is limited. I think that would \ngo a long way to making lawsuits settleable so both sides know the \nframework they are operating under. Then a lawsuit can be settled. \nWithout a limit on the top, it is very difficult to settle that \nlawsuit.\n  I believe this is good legislation. I hope it can move forward. I \nhope we do not see it obstructed and blocked as we have others. I hope \nwe can get an up-or-down vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alabama leaves, \nI want to thank him again for the hearings he held on the Commonsense \nConsumption Act, not the bill before us today but another measure that \nmakes, as the title implies, common sense. The common sense embedded in \nthat bill is that it is improper to sue a food manufacturer or a \ndistributor for damages claiming that the seller made you overweight. \nIt is simple justice. It would not deny any of the traditional claims \nagainst a distributor or manufacturer of food, but it would prevent \nsuch a ridiculous lawsuit.\n  The American people overwhelmingly support this legislation by well \nup into the 80 percent. The legislation passed the House of \nRepresentatives by an overwhelming bipartisan vote and is at the desk \nin the Senate. Hopefully sometime this year we will get an opportunity \nto call that up and see if maybe the Senate will let us at least pass a \nvery modest legal reform bill that deals with a problem that is \nbeginning to evolve in our society of victimhood.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, I would note that Professor \nSchwartz, as I said, the editor of the most utilized textbook on \nlawsuits and torts in America, strongly supports the legislation. He \nfeels it is appropriate. I will ask the Senator, does he not agree, \nbased on his experience as an attorney, that we have muddled over and \nglossed over the question of fault?\n  In the Senator's bill, if they sell food that is contaminated and a \nperson gets sick, if they sell food that has a bug in it or something, \nsomebody can still sue. If the food is unhealthy a person can sue, but \nif it is perfectly healthy food and it is the food one ordered they \nought not to be able to bring a lawsuit. Is that not the intent of the \nSenator's legislation?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Alabama is correct. That is, of \ncourse, the underlying principle of this legislation. I thank him for \nhaving the hearing and for giving people an opportunity to come forward \nand have their say on this important legislation.\n  As I said, it is at the desk and we hope sometime during the course \nof the second session of this Congress we will have a chance to address \nit.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One more question. Has not the question of fault always \nbeen the cornerstone of American law with regard to lawsuits and \nnegligence and liability, that somebody has to be at fault, have done \nsomething beyond the standard of care to cause a damage? That is when \nthere is a lawsuit. Is not getting away from that one of the reasons \nthat we are having so much abuse in the legal system?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is what we always were taught. As the Senator \nindicated, in school that is what tort law was about. If one was not \nnegligent, if they did not cause the harm, they should not be held \nliable. We have gotten away from that in this country. It is a very \ndangerous trend. It is time for the Congress of the United States to \nbegin to redress this imbalance. I thank my friend from Alabama.\n  Mr. President, on the matter before us upon which we will be voting \ncloture on the motion to proceed tomorrow, the Pregnancy and Trauma \nCare Protection Act introduced by Senator Gregg and Senator Ensign, \nthis is our third attempt this Congress and our second attempt in 6 \nweeks to try to do something about the medical liability crisis that is \nforcing patients all across the country to go without critically \nimportant medical services. On both previous occasions, a majority of \nthe Senate has voted to try to solve this problem.\n  Unfortunately, though, only one brave soul on the other side of the \naisle voted to support even taking up such a measure.\n  But hope springs eternal and maybe the third time is a charm. So we \ncome back to the Senate to try once again to give our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle a chance to join us in implementing real \nreforms for a problem that is all too real for many of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  As we did the last two times, we brought reform legislation to the \nfloor. We are offering the American people a proven remedy--not a \nplacebo. The bill we hope our colleagues will let us consider, like its \ntwo predecessors, is based upon California's successful MICRA reforms. \nThe Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act would allow \nplaintiffs to recover unlimited economic damages--up to a quarter of a \nmillion dollars in noneconomic damages and punitive damages up to the \ngreater of a quarter million dollars or twice the economic damages.\n  We recognize the reluctance of some of our colleagues to implement \nMICRA's reform on a nationwide scale, proven though these reforms are. \nSo rather than propose the comprehensive reform we tried to advance \nlast year for all medical practitioners, we are attempting a modest \nfirst step. The provisions in S. 2207 would apply only to two of the \nmedical specialties that are suffering the most in this crisis: OB/GYNs \nand emergency care services. That is all this bill would touch.\n  Though extremely modest in scope, this bill is crucial to protecting \nthe doctors who practice in these two areas and the millions of \nAmerican patients who rely on them. For example, OB/GYNs provide some \nof the most critical medical services. Sadly, they also bear the \nhighest premiums. As a result, women and children across our country \nare placed in danger as they struggle oftentimes unsuccessfully to find \neven basic obstetrics care.\n  In addition, emergency room doctors are the primary care physicians \nfor many Americans. According to the Alliance of Specialty Medicine, \neach year there are 110 million visits to emergency departments. More \nthan 90 percent of these visits are patients who need to be seen in 2 \nhours or less. And approximately 28.3 million Americans visit the \nemergency room each year due to an accident or unintentional injury. \nNinety-nine percent of those patients will recover after receiving \nlifesaving care from an ER or trauma center.\n  Thus, when ER doctors and trauma care physicians curtail their \npractices or go out of business altogether because of the medical \nliability crisis, the people who suffer the most obviously are the \nAmerican families.\n  Let us turn to the crisis in Kentucky. This chart illustrates \nKentucky's crisis in obstetric services.\n  Sixty percent of Kentucky's counties are without OB/GYNs.\n  This chart takes a look at the counties. The red counties, which the \noccupant of the Chair and our colleagues can see, are many counties. \nSixty-nine of one hundred twenty counties in Kentucky have no OB/GYN.\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\n  In addition to that, the next chart illustrates the availability of \nemergency services in Kentucky. 43 percent of Kentucky's counties are \nwithout emergency room physicians. That is 52 of the 120 counties.\n  All of the red counties all across the Commonwealth of Kentucky have \nno ER doctor at all--none.\n  Another 21 percent of Kentucky counties have only one specialist in \nemergency medicine for the entire county.\n  So you can see in our State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, there is a \nserious crisis--an absence of OB/GYN care and an absence of emergency \nroom doctors. A principal reason for that, not surprisingly, is the \nmedical malpractice crisis that we have in the Commonwealth of \nKentucky.\n  This is a serious problem. We have county after county in crisis. \nJust to give you an example, Perry County in southeastern Kentucky \ntechnically has a practicing OB/GYN. But that one doctor stopped \ndelivering babies during the last year. If you are in Perry County, it \ndoesn't do you much good. They have an OB/GYN but she does not deliver \nbabies.\n  Eighty-two of Kentucky's one hundred twenty counties don't have \neither an obstetrician or have one obstetrician.\n  This is a serious problem in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Six weeks ago, when we were asking our colleagues to consider the \nHealthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act--S. 2061-- I \ndiscussed the crisis in obstetric and gynecological services in my home \nState of Kentucky.\n  Kentucky does not have liability reform. Not surprisingly, liability \ninsurance rates for OB's in Kentucky, for example, increased 64 percent \nin just 1 year, from 2002 to 2003. Also not surprisingly, in just the \nlast 3 years, Kentucky has lost one-fourth of its obstetricians. \nMoreover, Kentucky has lost nearly half its potential obstetric \nservices during this time, when one factors in doctors who have limited \ntheir practices.\n  According to the Kentucky Medical Association, 60 percent of the \ncounties in Kentucky do not have any OB-GYNs.\n  Other counties, such as Perry County in southeastern Kentucky, \ntechnically have a practicing OB-GYN, but that one doctor has stopped \ndelivering babies within the last year. So if you are in Perry County, \nthat doesn't do you much good.\n  Another 8 counties--like Greenup, Lawrence, and Johnson Counties in \nnortheast Kentucky--have just one OB-GYN in each county.\n  So if you are a woman in these counties, you had better hope that \nthere isn't another woman having a baby at the same time you are, or \nthat the doctor is not out of town or busy with another patient. If \nthat happens, then you are going to have to drive through the hills on \nthe back roads of eastern Kentucky to try to find a doctor to deliver \nyour baby.\n  All told, 82 of Kentucky's 120 counties have no OB's or have just one \nOB.\n  Now, you may be thinking that, although this is far from ideal, \ncouldn't the women in these situations simply go to the emergency room \nand have an ER doctor deliver their baby? Maybe in the old days women \ncould do this, but they can't do this anymore.\n  Another casualty in the medical liability crisis has been in the \nprovision of emergency medical services. According to the Kentucky \nMedical Association, medical liability premiums for ER physicians \nincreased, on average, an astounding 204% from 2001 to 2002!\n  The situation of Dr. David Stanforth is illustrative. He is a partner \nin an emergency medicine group serving three hospitals in Northern \nKentucky. Dr. Stanforth had his malpractice insurance cancelled 3 years \nago and then switched insurance policies to obtain coverage. His \npremiums have since tripled to $800,000 per year, even though there \nwasn't a malpractice award against his ER group during that period.\n  The result of situations like Dr. Stanforth's are all-too-\npredictable.\n  According to the Kentucky Department of Public Health, 43% of \nKentucky counties do not have any doctors specializing in emergency \nmedicine. Another 21% of Kentucky counties have only one emergency room \nphysician. All told, then, 64% of Kentucky counties do not have any ER \ndoctors or have only one ER doctor for the entire county.\n  To come back to the crisis in obstetric services that I was \ndiscussing, if you are a woman in eastern Kentucky who is delivering a \nbaby, not only are you not going to be able to find an O.B. to delivery \nyour baby. You are not going to be able to find an ER doctor to help \nyou either. Instead, you are going to have to drive until you find some \ndoctor--any doctor--if you're lucky, to help with your delivery.\n  Unfortunately, too many women are not so lucky. They end up \ndelivering their babies in the backseat of a car or on the side of the \nroad.\n  This situation cannot continue. I applaud Senators Gregg and Ensign \nfor their determination to do something about this crisis. I hope my \ncolleagues on the other side will let us try to solve this problem with \nmeaningful reform and will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I will conclude by saying the principal reason for the crisis is the \nrising cost of medical malpractice insurance, and the inability of \nthese physicians, dedicated though they may be to public health and \nserving people in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, who simply can't afford \nto stay in business. They cannot make a living doing what they went to \nmedical school to do and what they want to do with their lives, which \nis to take care of women and babies and to save people in the emergency \nrooms of the Commonwealth.\n  We will have an opportunity tomorrow, once again--as I said earlier, \nhopefully a third time will be a charm--to take the simple step of \ngoing to the bill and giving us an opportunity in the Senate of \naddressing what is indeed a national medical crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3784-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I recognize the American Public Health \nAssociation's 14th annual National Public Health Week. I specifically \nwant to acknowledge and commend the Association on its theme this year: \n``Eliminating Health Disparities: Communities Moving from Statistics to \nSolutions.''\n  Our public health practitioners affect all areas of life as they \nfulfill their mission of promoting health and preventing disease at the \nbroader ``population'' level. The American Public Health Association is \nthe oldest and largest organization of public health professionals and \nhas had an enormous influence on public health priorities and policies \nfor over 100 years.\n  As we begin National Public Health Week, it is clear how the \nAssociation's selection of a particular theme can make a significant \ndifference in how we develop our health agenda as a nation. I think \nthis year's choice will be no exception and that it will be an impetus \nfor frank and thoughtful discussion about what should be one of the\n\n[[Page S3785]]\n\nNation's most critical priorities, the need to address health \ndisparities.\n  The first NIH Working Group on Health Disparities defined health and \nhealth care disparities as ``differences in the incidence, prevalence, \nmortality, and burden of diseases and other adverse health conditions \nthat exist among specific population groups in the United States.'' I \ntake a moment to highlight just a few of these differences.\n  Statistics from the Department of Health and Human Services Report \nentitled ``National Health Care Disparities'' bear out that minorities \nare less likely to be given appropriate cardiac medications or to \nundergo bypass surgery, and are less likely to receive kidney dialysis \nor transplants. The same study has shown that minorities are less \nlikely to receive the most sophisticated treatments for HIV infection, \nwhich could forestall the onset of AIDS. Our minority communities are \ninstead more likely to receive less desirable, non state-of-the-art \nprocedures, such as lower limb amputations for diabetes and other \nconditions.\n  These disparities also put our children at significant risk. In my \nown State of Maryland, the Infant Mortality rate for African Americans \nis two times higher than for Caucasian Americans.\n  And these disparities do not only occur along racial lines. Healthy \nPeople 2010 and the National Health Care Disparities Report show that \nthose who live in our more rural communities face similar inequitable \ntreatment. Rural community residents have less contact and fewer visits \nwith physicians, even though these residents tend to have a heightened \nneed for health care. Indeed, injury rates in rural communities are 40 \npercent higher than in urban areas.\n  Women are 20 times more likely than men to die from a heart attack. \nStatistics from the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality reflect \nthat women receive less aggressive treatment for heart related ailments \nthan men, and are less likely to receive life saving drugs such as \nlidocaine, beta-blockers and aspirin for heart attacks.\n  Persons with disabilities face significant disparities in the care \nthey are afforded as do the indigent; the list goes on and on. These \nare just a few examples of how this inequity affects our population.\n  The State of Maryland has engaged in a number of statewide and local \ninitiatives to address health care disparities in our communities. At \nthe Federal level, I have cosponsored S. 1833, the Healthcare Equality \nand Accountability Act, which seeks to eliminate racial and ethnic \nhealth disparities in health care. I hope we can use the momentum \ncreated by this week and redouble our efforts to ensure comprehensive \nquality health care for all of America's citizen's regardless of their \nrace, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, education level, \ngeographic location, disability or sexual orientation.\n  Again, I commend the American Public Health Association for focusing \nthe Nation's attention on this important issue and for serving to \nincrease the dialogue to rid the country of these inequities. I hope my \ncolleagues offer their support to this important effort as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3785-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OPERATION ENDURING LOVE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we all know that the war in Iraq is not \nwithout its controversies or detractors. But it is also important to \nnote that the spirit of the American people is transcendent. Whether \nyou supported the war in Iraq, as I did, or whether you opposed it, the \npeople of this Nation are very conscious of the sacrifice that our \nmilitary men and women are making for us all are grateful. I rise today \nto give one small example of the American people's spirit from \nLafayette, LA.\n  The soldiers of the 256th Army National Guard Infantry Brigade were \nrecently put on alert and notified that they could be heading to Iraq \nsoon. As for any Guard unit, such deployments mean a tremendous \ndisruption in the lives of the citizen soldiers who make up this \nbrigade. They miss work, they miss graduations, they miss birthdays, \nthey miss reunions, and sadly, for some, they miss weddings.\n  When the announcement went out that the 256th could be deploying, \nSpec. Jeremy Meyers and his fiancee, Amy Glorioso, decided that they \nneeded to move up their wedding date. But as everyone knows, weddings \nare expensive, and food, flowers, and venues have to be reserved and \npaid for months in advance. Changes to wedding dates can mean thousands \nof dollars in additional costs.\n  But thanks to the organization and drive of Merilyn Crain, the owner \nof L'Eglise in Vermilion Parish, and the patriotism and dedication of \nbusinesses throughout the Lafayette region, seven couples will enjoy \ntheir dream weddings--earlier than planned--and for free.\n  This act of generosity is the perfect symbol of the deep appreciation \nand love that all Americans feel for their soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines. The people of the Lafeyette region, and all of Louisiana \nshould be proud of the example they have set in rallying around the men \nand women of the 256th. As the Bible teaches us, ``No greater love hath \nany man than this, that he should lay his life down for another.'' It \nis therefore appropriate that we should repay the debt we owe our \nmilitary, by assisting them with ceremonies that celebrate the love \nbetween two people.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the businesses and individuals whose \ngenerosity made these efforts possible. I will have the privilege of \nmeeting the members of the 256th and their families this coming Monday. \nI will also get a chance to thank some of the members of Operation \nEnduring Love personally. However, I wanted to take this opportunity to \ntell this inspiring story here on the Senate floor, and record for \nposterity the names of those businesses and performers who have \nparticipated.

Mr. President, I want to make a statement about a \nsmall business bill that the Senate passed last week. I am referring to \nH.R. 4062, which, among other things, provides a temporary solution to \nthe administration's self-created funding crisis for the SBA's largest \nsmall-business lending program, commonly referred to as the 7(a) Loan \nprogram. In many ways, the bill is similar to legislation I introduced \nfour weeks ago, S. 2186. For example, it adopts my provision to keep \nthe 504 program operating through the rest of this fiscal year instead \nof subjecting the 504 borrowers and lenders to\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\nanother series of disruptive temporary extensions. Similar to my bill, \nit also lifts the $750,000 cap on loans, lifts the restriction on \ncombination or piggyback loans, gets loans to those small businesses \ndenied 7(a) loans since the program shutdown in January, and extends \nthe operation of the SBA overall, including the Small Disadvantaged \nBusiness Program and the Surety Bond program.\n  In general, H.R. 4062 is a step in the right direction and I commend \nCongressman Manzullo and Congresswoman Velazquez for their work. I do, \nhowever, have some concerns about the bill, concerns shared by many in \nthe small business community, and I regret that the Senate Republicans \nblocked a bi-partisan Snowe-Kerry amendment to address those concerns.\n  For example, H.R. 4062 did not address the pressing need to correct \nthe outdated funding formula for the SBA's Women's Business Centers \nprogram. The law needed to be changed before the Agency awards this \nyear's grants because more than 50 Centers around the country are at \nrisk of losing their matching federal money. I had been advocating for \nthis change since I introduced S. 2186 on March 9, and the Snowe-Kerry \namendment included my provision. Unfortunately, one or two Senate \nRepublicans objected to the provision and blocked its passage.\n  As for the 7(a) Loan Program, I am concerned about the extent of the \nfee increases, the lack of data justifying the increases, the rapid \nexpansion of the SBAExpress pilot program, and the precedent that these \nchanges will have on developing a workable approach to next year's 7(a) \nfunding problem created by the President's request for zero funding for \nfiscal year 2005. The Snowe-Kerry amendment took a much more measured \napproach to the fee increases, adopting the levels supported in S. 2186 \nand S. 2193, with flexibility for the SBA to increase the fees up to \nthe levels in the House bill should the need arise to keep the program \nrunning for the remainder of the year without restrictions. For \nexample, instead of temporarily charging a lender fee on the commercial \nportion of a combination or piggyback loan of .5 percent, H.R. 4062 \ncharges 40 percent more, imposing a fee of .7 percent. Senator Snowe \ndevised the discretionary stair-step compromise in our amendment and it \nwas preferred by the lending community. It is unfortunate that the \nlenders may be required to pay higher fees than necessary to reach the \ngoal: Congress seeks to keep access to 7(a) loans available to small \nbusinesses for the rest of this year, fiscal year 2004.\n  The Snowe-Kerry amendment also took a more measured approach in \nexpanding the SBAExpress program. H.R. 4062 includes a controversial \nprovision proposed by the administration that would expand the current \nSBAExpress reduced guarantee pilot program from loans of $150,000 to $2 \nmillion. An increase of 700 percent.\n  The administration contends that the pilot expansion would only be \nvoluntary and therefore harmless if not used. While SBAExpress has \nworked well for relatively small loans, those averaging around \n$150,000, lenders have testified before our Committee that SBA Express \nis not workable for all sizes of loans and that the volume of \nSBAExpress loans is not likely to increase. In fact, the smallest SBA \nlenders, community banks, have testified that to mandate SBAExpress \nwould drive virtually all community banks from the program. Yet the \nadministration argues this voluntary authority is necessary because, \nwhen combined with other program changes, it would reduce the subsidy \nrate, thereby stretching the 7(a) loan funding, getting the program \ncloser to their latest program volume projections.\n  This can only be true, however, if the volume of SBAExpress loans \nincrease. To date, the administration has not produced any \ndocumentation supporting that contention, and the small business \nlenders fear that the administration will circumvent the requirement \nthat this be strictly voluntary by showing preferential treatment to \nlenders who use the SBAExpress program. They believe this will occur in \norder to steer loans away from the regular program, which has a higher \nguarantee of 75 percent to 85 percent. Congresswoman Velazquez held \nstrong to including very good provisions aimed at protecting the loan \nprogram from such tinkering, and she is to be commended for her \neffective advocacy. Unfortunately, even with these safeguards, I \nbelieve it was premature to enact the administration's SBAExpress \nproposal until better data could be obtained and analyzed. Further, \nsince H.R. 4062 is a temporary extension of SBA's authority until June \n4th, 2004, there would have been time for this and other proposals to \nbe properly vetted and, if appropriate, adopted.\n  Extreme changes like expanding the SBAExpress program 700 percent \nwere driven by the administration. The groups agreed to live with them \nonly because it was better than the alternatives--further reducing the \nloan cap from $750,000 to $500,000, another shutdown, or the \nadministration's proposal to mandate all loans be made through the 50 \npercent guarantee SBAExpress program. Let me read to you a few quotes \nby the small business community that reflect the feelings of many \nexpressed to this Committee:\n  The Independent Community Bankers of America: ``The ICBA did not \noppose a short-term fix bill that would open up much needed lending to \nsmall businesses, but only because the alternative pushed by the SBA \nwas far worse and would have choked off lenders' ability to continue \nmaking SBA loans. We didn't want to punish small business because of \nthe unwillingness of the SBA to ask for the funds they knew were needed \nto keep the 7(a) program viable. This bill is only a short term Band-\nAid. The ICBA continues to oppose the SBA's efforts to squeeze the 7(a) \nprogram out of existence and hopes a genuine good faith resolution can \nbe part of the FY 2005 budget.''\n  The American Bankers Association as quoted in the ``American Banker'' \non April 1, 2004: ``The need to avoid an even lower loan-size cap is \nwhy the ABA supported the compromise, despite having serious \nreservations about the expansion of the SBAExpress and the additional \nfees on lenders. `We are not totally pleased with it, but we're not \ngoing to write a letter opposing it', said Mr. [James] Ballentine \n[Director of Community Development]. `We believe the lenders bent over \nbackwards to restart this program, and we've seen very little movement \non the part of the Agency.'''\n\n  Mr. President, we are all glad that the program is back in business \nfor the rest of the year, particularly for the small businesses that \nhave been hung out to dry since the January shutdown of the program. \nThe delays imposed on the FY2004 fix for the 7(a) loan program were \nunnecessary. There were several opportunities--bills or amendments--\nsince March 10th to mitigate the funding shortfall or all together fix \nit, but they've been blocked or stalled.\n  Mr. President, waiting has a price. Not only to the qualified small \nbusinesses waiting for needed loans and for those who had been promised \nloans in January only to have the administration abruptly impose a \ncrippling loan cap, but also to the taxpayer. If either of the changes \nSenator Snowe and I had proposed in our bills, S. 2186 and S. 2193, had \nbeen enacted as part of H.R. 3195 in mid-March, we could have saved \nmore than $100,000 a day, leveraging at least another $150 million in \nsmall business loans in this fiscal year. These delays are fiscally \nirresponsible.\n  The Republican obstructionists will justify their delay tactics by \narguing that the earlier bills did not solve the entire funding problem \nfor the rest of the year. However, there are numerous problems with \nsuch a claim. One, time was of the essence for the small businesses \nthat had been shutout since January. Two, no one knows if the \nadministration's estimates are accurate and the confidence in the \neconometric model that predicts future program costs has gone down as a \nresult of the SBA's latest estimates. For example, how could imposing a \nfee on piggyback loans of .5 percent, a fee that will generate new \nincome for the program, not offset the costs at all? And, if that is \ntrue, how could additional savings from increasing that fee by 40 \npercent, to .7 percent be only one one-hundredth of one percent? I \ndon't know of one lender who believes that claim. Three, it would have \nbeen better to take a step in the right direction and immediately \nreduce the cost of the program to the extent possible in order to \nstretch the lending dollars. This option would have allowed for future \nrefinements while saving precious appropriated dollars in the process. \nFour,\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\nthere would have been (and still are) several other opportunities to \nmake adjustments later in the fiscal year.\n  With respect to the other important provisions of H.R. 4062, I am \nglad that the bill includes my measure from S. 2186 that allows the 504 \nLoan Guarantee Program to operate through the rest of the fiscal year; \nhowever, I am very disappointed that, despite bipartisan support, the \nRepublican leadership refused to include a Snowe-Kerry amendment to \npromote women in business and safeguard one of their only dedicated \nresources of support: the nationwide network of women's business \ncenters. The Republicans that blocked our amendment--in support of the \nadministration's policy to eliminate experienced, efficient and \neffective women's business centers in favor of new and untested \ncenters--are potentially depriving thousands of women in business \naccess to much-needed assistance. The Snowe-Kerry amendment, like S. \n2267, would have made a small adjustment to the Women's Business Center \nprogram that corrects an outdated funding formula, without added cost \nto the Treasury. The adjustment would have changed the portion of \nfunding allowed for women's business centers in the sustainability part \nof the program to keep up with the increasing number of centers that \nwill need funding this fiscal year. Without it, all grants to \nsustainability centers in 39 States could be cut in half--or worse, 23 \nexperienced centers could lose funding completely. Our amendment was a \nbipartisan compromise intended to maintain an effective women's \nbusiness center network; a compromise that was agreed to by Chair \nSnowe, myself, and the bipartisan leadership of the House Small \nBusiness Committee. It was supported by women's groups across the \ncountry, and it is my sincere hope that my colleagues in Congress will \nsupport this change in the very near future.\n  I thank the broad coalition of small business trade associations that \nhave worked on the various bills and supported the provisions in my \nbill, S. 2186: The trade association of Women Impacting Public Policy \n(WIPP) and the National Association of Women's Business Owners (NAWBO), \nthe National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders (NAGGL), the \nAmerican Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers \nAssociation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for endorsing the \nprovisions relating to the 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program; WIPP, NAWBO, \nand the Association of Women's Business Centers for fully supporting \nthe provisions relating to the Women's Business Centers program, as \nwell as the cosponsors of S. 2186. I think anyone who knows of these \ngroups, their members and their leadership, knows that they work very \nwell with both sides of the aisle and with the leadership of our \nCommittee and also the House Committee on Small Business. Working \ncooperatively in a bipartisan fashion makes good sense and has long \nbeen their practice. We all appreciate their work to fix these \nproblems, and for the contribution they make to cultivating small \nstartup and growing small businesses in our communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask that several letters addressing the issue at \nhand be printed in the Record. I thank my colleagues for their support \nof small businesses and for considering immediate passage of this bill.\n  The letters follow.\n\n                                                   March 10, 2004.\n       Dear Representative: Today, as the House prepares to vote \n     on H.R. 3915, we are writing to express our concerns with \n     this legislation. We are very disappointed that it does not \n     include a SBA 7(a) program solution. Without a solution the \n     7(a) program will not be allowed to create much needed jobs \n     to help our economy.\n        The SBA's flagship 7(a) loan program, the single largest \n     provider of long-term start-up and expansion loans to \n     America's small businesses, has been crippled since the \n     beginning of this fiscal year, when the SBA temporarily shut \n     it down due to a funding shortfall. When the Agency reopened \n     the program a week later, it implemented an artificial loan \n     cap of $70,000--a reduction of more than 50% of the program's \n     statutory loan limit of $2 million--and a prohibition on \n     piggyback loans, which would have allowed lenders to make \n     loans in excess of a loan cap.\n        Businesses who had already submitted applications for \n     loans in excess of the new cap were then told their deals \n     would not qualify for the program. These applicants had gone \n     through months of financial planning and had been promised \n     their loans would be approved. Many had already begun \n     purchasing equipment and hiring employees. If their deals do \n     not get done, many will lose earnest money they had taken \n     from personal savings and retirement plans to inject into \n     these loans.\n        Other potential applicants who would ordinarily qualify \n     for the 7(a) program have since been told there is no \n     alternative to finance their start-up or expansion. The net \n     result to these small businesses is a loss of faith in the \n     U.S. government. The net result to the economy is a loss of \n     jobs.\n        A solution to this lingering problem does exist and it has \n     been communicated to the House Small Business Committee. This \n     proposal has bipartisan support on the Small Business \n     Committee, as well as the support of banking and small \n     business trade groups. The proposed solution would increase \n     fees for lenders to ensure that there is no budget impact. It \n     would maintain the 7(a) program. However, H.R. 3915 ignores \n     this solution.\n        Without a 7(a) solution, approximately $3 billion in loans \n     will remain unavailable to small businesses for the remainder \n     of FY 2004--a net loss of approximately 90,000 jobs. We also \n     fear that if a swift and equitable solution is not enacted, \n     many 7(a) lenders will flee the program, leaving a void in \n     availability of the long-term financing that is so crucial to \n     small businesses' success.\n        We request that Congress bolster economic recovery and the \n     small businesses that drive it by enacting a 7(a) program \n     solution that has the full support of Congress and the \n     industry.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Bankers Association.\n        America's Community Bankers.\n        Independent Community Bankers of America.\n        National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders.\n        The Financial Services Roundtable.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                Government Guaranteed Lenders,\n\n                                   Stillwater, OK, March 10, 2004.\n     Re SBA 7(a) funding crisis and S. 2186.\n\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: As Congress considers how to solve the \n     ongoing SBA 7(a) program funding crisis, we are writing to \n     express our support for S. 2186, which includes provisions \n     that both Small Business Committees and the 7(a) industry \n     have already agreed are equitable.\n       While NAGGL is generally opposed to programmatic fee \n     increases, the 2004 budget for the 7(a) program has made his \n     concession necessary. NAGGL testified in 2003 that 2004 \n     program demand would be nearly $12 billion, but the \n     Administration adamantly disagreed with our estimate, \n     providing program level of only $9.5 billion. The \n     Administration has also failed to reprogram any additional \n     money to the 7(a) program or offer a supplemental \n     appropriations request.\n       As a result, the SBA's flagship 7(a) loan program, the \n     single largest provider of long-term start-up and expansion \n     loans to American's small businesses, has been crippled since \n     the beginning of this fiscal year, when the SBA temporarily \n     shut it down due to a funding shortfall. When the Agency \n     reopened the program a week later, it implemented an \n     artificial loan cap of $750,000--a reduction of more than 50% \n     of the program's statutory loan limit of $2 million--and a \n     prohibition on piggyback loans, which would have allowed \n     lenders to make loans in excess of a loan cap.\n       Businesses who had already submitted applications for loans \n     in excess of the new cap were then told their deals would not \n     qualify for the program. These applicants had gone through \n     months of financial planning and had been promised their \n     loans would be approved. Many had already begun purchasing \n     equipment and hiring employees. And if their deals don't get \n     done, many will lose earnest money they had taken from \n     personal savings and retirement plans to inject into these \n     loans.\n       Other potential applicants who would ordinarily qualify for \n     the 7(a) program have since been told there is no alternative \n     to finance their start-up or expansion. The net result to \n     these small businesses is a loss of faith in the U.S. \n     government. The net result to the economy is a loss of jobs.\n       The provisions of S. 2186 fix this problem, and the bill \n     has NAGGL's full support. As the trade association \n     representing lenders who make over 80% of loans in the 7(a) \n     program every year, we can attest to the fact that the \n     minimal fee increases in S. 2186 are ones that lenders will \n     pay and will not be passed along to borrowers. We also \n     continue to oppose the SBA's legislative proposal to reduce \n     the guarantee on all 7(a) loans to 50% and allow the \n     legislation that provided for lender and borrower fee \n     decreases through the end of this fiscal year to simply \n     sunset.\n       Without the provisions of S. 2186, $3 billion in loans will \n     remain unavailable to small businesses for the remainder of \n     FY 2004--a net loss of approximately 90,000 jobs. We also \n     fear that if a swift and equitable solution is not enacted, \n     many 7(a) lenders will flee the program, leaving a void in \n     availability of the long-term financing that is so crucial to \n     small businesses' success. This will be occurring at a time \n     when our economy is in desperate need of a shot in the arm.\n       We request that you press for swift passage of S. 2186 to \n     bolster economic recovery and the small businesses that can \n     drive it. Thank you in advance for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Tony Wilkinson,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                           Crystal Collection,\n\n                                       Suwanee, GA, April 5, 2004.\n     Hon.

We ask the following from the committee.\n       Absent the SBA asking Congress for additional funding, \n     NAWBO supports increasing fees on lenders as an approach to \n     adequately funding the SBA 7(a) program and lifting \n     restrictions.\n       Specifically, NAWBO would like the program to:\n       Allow piggyback loans, but charge a 0.50 percent lender fee \n     for each;\n       Raise lender fees by 0.10 percent; and\n       For loans that are under $150,000, have lenders pay the SBA \n     the 0.25 percent fee that lenders currently keep for \n     themselves.

John F. Kerry,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Small Business, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Kerry: Please be advised that Business Loan \n     Center, LLC, aka Business Loan Express, LLC, the nation's \n     third largest SBA 7(a) lender, is a strong supporter of the \n     Senate and House bill that is also supported by the ``Access \n     to Capital Coalition Organization,'' which will permit the \n     reopening of a viable 7(a) loan program in America. This \n     means once law, SBA would be required to drop the prohibition \n     against ``piggyback loans'' and eliminate the current loan \n     cap. As most every 7(a) lending organization has indicated \n     since early January 2004, it is absolutely critical that \n     these 7(a) program impediments be dropped at the earliest \n     possible date. As you are aware, no knowledgeable trade \n     organization or 7(a) lending entity supports a mandatory 50% \n     maximum loan guaranty, as it would represent a slow death of \n     the 7(a) loan program. Most every community in America \n     utilizes the 7(a) loan program as a major part of their \n     economic development/job creating/job retention program. If \n     one removed from our economy all businesses and the jobs they \n     create directly and indirectly, who at one time or another \n     received 7(a) loan assistance, this would be a totally \n     different country. To assist the recovery of our economy and \n     the retention and creation of jobs, it is absolutely \n     essential that the 7(a) loan program be returned to its prior \n     dynamic status. Thank you for your leadership in this matter. \n     Please encourage the Administration and your colleagues to \n     support the House and the Senate bill that would solve this \n     current dilemma!\n           Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                            Deryl K. Schuster,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Director, Governmental Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Association of Small Business\n\n\n                                          Development Centers,\n\n                                       Burke, VA, January 9, 2004.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing about the recent decision \n     by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to suspend \n     making loan guarantees for small businesses under the 7(a) \n     loan program.\n       As you know, the SBA announced on December 23rd that it \n     would begin imposing a $750,000 cap on 7(a) loan guarantees \n     effective January 8th, even though Congress has authorized \n     loan guarantees up to $2 million. The SBA's announcement led \n     small businesses with loan applications for more than \n     $750,000 to submit their applications before the announcement \n     deadline. As a result, the SBA experienced a significant \n     increase in 7(a) loan applications and suspended the program \n     until further announcement, on the grounds that the increase \n     in loan applications had led to a shortfall in funding.\n       Small businesses throughout the country have seen their \n     loans put in jeopardy as a consequence of this decision, and \n     applicants for loans above $750,000 may be unable to obtain \n     loan guarantees--or be forced to re-apply--even if the 7(a) \n     loan program is re-opened. The ASBDC is hearing from Small \n     Business Development Center (SBDC) counselors in the field \n     that the decision to suspend the 7(a) loan program could pose \n     a severe hardship for many SBDC clients.\n       In the past three years, the 7(a) loan guarantee program \n     has helped make financing available to more than 40,000 \n     start-up small businesses and 99,000 existing small \n     businesses--leading to the creation of more than one million \n     new jobs. Suspending this vital small business lending \n     program at this critical stage of the economy's recovery from \n     the recession will prevent the start-up and the expansion of \n     small businesses throughout the country, and stymie the \n     economy's creation of new jobs.\n       I appreciate all that you do to support small business. I \n     urge you to continue to work with the SBA and the Office of \n     Management and Budget to reopen the 7(a) loan guarantee \n     program and remove the $750,000 loan cap as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Donald Wilson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Compass Bank,\n\n                                    Houston, TX, January 12, 2004.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing to alert you to an \n     economic crisis that should have been avoided but can still \n     be remedied.\n       The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) claims it has \n     run out of money for its flagship 7(a) loan program. This is \n     because the Administration did not request adequate funds for \n     the program for fiscal year 2004.\n       The Administration only requested a program level of $9.3 \n     billion, even though the program did $11.3 billion last year, \n     even with a $500,000 loan cap in place for nearly half of the \n     fiscal year. NAGGL estimated that demand would be $12.5 \n     billion beginning with our budget testimonies in February \n     2003.\n       Loan volume for the first three months of fiscal year 2004 \n     was $3.137 billion, a level of demand that clearly supports \n     NAGGL's estimates of demand.\n       Because the Administration did not seek sufficient program \n     level, the SBA has now shut down the 7(a) program until \n     further notice, depriving small businesses of the capital \n     they need in order to expand their businesses, hire new \n     people, and aid the American economic recovery. The shutdown \n     occurred just a few weeks after SBA Administrator Barreto \n     told the NAGGL Annual Conferees that the ``program would not \n     be shutdown, and that the $9.3 billion program request would \n     be sufficient.''\n       In unprecedented fashion, the SBA is now rejecting and \n     returning all loan applications. During previous funding \n     shortages, the SBA continued to accept and process loan \n     applications. The loans would then be funded when loan funds \n     became available. The SBA's action, to make small businesses \n     pay for its own mismanagement, is unconscionable.\n       Because small businesses are the chief engine of economic \n     recovery, America can ill afford a halt in funding to small \n     businesses in this time when the economy is just regaining \n     steam.\n       Though the SBA has been implored by members of both major \n     political parties to immediately seek an equitable solution, \n     the Administration has thus far not come forward with any \n     positive solutions. The Administration has thus far responded \n     only with loan caps, program shutdowns, and excuses why this \n     is Congress' fault.\n       One conclusion could be that the Administration desires to \n     either dismantle or significantly change the SBA and the 7(a) \n     program. I'm asking you not to let this happen.\n       The Administration should either request a reprogramming of \n     funds or submit a supplemental appropriation request \n     sufficient to fund the 7(a) program to $12.5 billion this \n     year. The SBA should be required to lift both the current \n     program freeze and the artificial $750,000 cap it has put in \n     place to restrict small business access to capital. The SBA \n     should be required to stop the budget gimmicks and put \n     forward a credible budget request that ensures this program \n     is funded properly in fiscal year 2005 and beyond without fee \n     increases to borrowers and lenders. Don't let this \n     Administration dismantle a program that has served small \n     businesses so well for so long.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Harriet Boshaw,\n                                   SBA Lending Department.\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3785-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3785-S3789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF PROGRAMS UNDER THE SMALL BUSINESS ACT AND THE \n                     SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT ACT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to make a statement about a \nsmall business bill that the Senate passed last week. I am referring to \nH.R. 4062, which, among other things, provides a temporary solution to \nthe administration's self-created funding crisis for the SBA's largest \nsmall-business lending program, commonly referred to as the 7(a) Loan \nprogram. In many ways, the bill is similar to legislation I introduced \nfour weeks ago, S. 2186. For example, it adopts my provision to keep \nthe 504 program operating through the rest of this fiscal year instead \nof subjecting the 504 borrowers and lenders to\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\nanother series of disruptive temporary extensions. Similar to my bill, \nit also lifts the $750,000 cap on loans, lifts the restriction on \ncombination or piggyback loans, gets loans to those small businesses \ndenied 7(a) loans since the program shutdown in January, and extends \nthe operation of the SBA overall, including the Small Disadvantaged \nBusiness Program and the Surety Bond program.\n  In general, H.R. 4062 is a step in the right direction and I commend \nCongressman Manzullo and Congresswoman Velazquez for their work. I do, \nhowever, have some concerns about the bill, concerns shared by many in \nthe small business community, and I regret that the Senate Republicans \nblocked a bi-partisan Snowe-Kerry amendment to address those concerns.\n  For example, H.R. 4062 did not address the pressing need to correct \nthe outdated funding formula for the SBA's Women's Business Centers \nprogram. The law needed to be changed before the Agency awards this \nyear's grants because more than 50 Centers around the country are at \nrisk of losing their matching federal money. I had been advocating for \nthis change since I introduced S. 2186 on March 9, and the Snowe-Kerry \namendment included my provision. Unfortunately, one or two Senate \nRepublicans objected to the provision and blocked its passage.\n  As for the 7(a) Loan Program, I am concerned about the extent of the \nfee increases, the lack of data justifying the increases, the rapid \nexpansion of the SBAExpress pilot program, and the precedent that these \nchanges will have on developing a workable approach to next year's 7(a) \nfunding problem created by the President's request for zero funding for \nfiscal year 2005. The Snowe-Kerry amendment took a much more measured \napproach to the fee increases, adopting the levels supported in S. 2186 \nand S. 2193, with flexibility for the SBA to increase the fees up to \nthe levels in the House bill should the need arise to keep the program \nrunning for the remainder of the year without restrictions. For \nexample, instead of temporarily charging a lender fee on the commercial \nportion of a combination or piggyback loan of .5 percent, H.R. 4062 \ncharges 40 percent more, imposing a fee of .7 percent. Senator Snowe \ndevised the discretionary stair-step compromise in our amendment and it \nwas preferred by the lending community. It is unfortunate that the \nlenders may be required to pay higher fees than necessary to reach the \ngoal: Congress seeks to keep access to 7(a) loans available to small \nbusinesses for the rest of this year, fiscal year 2004.\n  The Snowe-Kerry amendment also took a more measured approach in \nexpanding the SBAExpress program. H.R. 4062 includes a controversial \nprovision proposed by the administration that would expand the current \nSBAExpress reduced guarantee pilot program from loans of $150,000 to $2 \nmillion. An increase of 700 percent.\n  The administration contends that the pilot expansion would only be \nvoluntary and therefore harmless if not used. While SBAExpress has \nworked well for relatively small loans, those averaging around \n$150,000, lenders have testified before our Committee that SBA Express \nis not workable for all sizes of loans and that the volume of \nSBAExpress loans is not likely to increase. In fact, the smallest SBA \nlenders, community banks, have testified that to mandate SBAExpress \nwould drive virtually all community banks from the program. Yet the \nadministration argues this voluntary authority is necessary because, \nwhen combined with other program changes, it would reduce the subsidy \nrate, thereby stretching the 7(a) loan funding, getting the program \ncloser to their latest program volume projections.\n  This can only be true, however, if the volume of SBAExpress loans \nincrease. To date, the administration has not produced any \ndocumentation supporting that contention, and the small business \nlenders fear that the administration will circumvent the requirement \nthat this be strictly voluntary by showing preferential treatment to \nlenders who use the SBAExpress program. They believe this will occur in \norder to steer loans away from the regular program, which has a higher \nguarantee of 75 percent to 85 percent. Congresswoman Velazquez held \nstrong to including very good provisions aimed at protecting the loan \nprogram from such tinkering, and she is to be commended for her \neffective advocacy. Unfortunately, even with these safeguards, I \nbelieve it was premature to enact the administration's SBAExpress \nproposal until better data could be obtained and analyzed. Further, \nsince H.R. 4062 is a temporary extension of SBA's authority until June \n4th, 2004, there would have been time for this and other proposals to \nbe properly vetted and, if appropriate, adopted.\n  Extreme changes like expanding the SBAExpress program 700 percent \nwere driven by the administration. The groups agreed to live with them \nonly because it was better than the alternatives--further reducing the \nloan cap from $750,000 to $500,000, another shutdown, or the \nadministration's proposal to mandate all loans be made through the 50 \npercent guarantee SBAExpress program. Let me read to you a few quotes \nby the small business community that reflect the feelings of many \nexpressed to this Committee:\n  The Independent Community Bankers of America: ``The ICBA did not \noppose a short-term fix bill that would open up much needed lending to \nsmall businesses, but only because the alternative pushed by the SBA \nwas far worse and would have choked off lenders' ability to continue \nmaking SBA loans. We didn't want to punish small business because of \nthe unwillingness of the SBA to ask for the funds they knew were needed \nto keep the 7(a) program viable. This bill is only a short term Band-\nAid. The ICBA continues to oppose the SBA's efforts to squeeze the 7(a) \nprogram out of existence and hopes a genuine good faith resolution can \nbe part of the FY 2005 budget.''\n  The American Bankers Association as quoted in the ``American Banker'' \non April 1, 2004: ``The need to avoid an even lower loan-size cap is \nwhy the ABA supported the compromise, despite having serious \nreservations about the expansion of the SBAExpress and the additional \nfees on lenders. `We are not totally pleased with it, but we're not \ngoing to write a letter opposing it', said Mr. [James] Ballentine \n[Director of Community Development]. `We believe the lenders bent over \nbackwards to restart this program, and we've seen very little movement \non the part of the Agency.'''\n\n  Mr. President, we are all glad that the program is back in business \nfor the rest of the year, particularly for the small businesses that \nhave been hung out to dry since the January shutdown of the program. \nThe delays imposed on the FY2004 fix for the 7(a) loan program were \nunnecessary. There were several opportunities--bills or amendments--\nsince March 10th to mitigate the funding shortfall or all together fix \nit, but they've been blocked or stalled.\n  Mr. President, waiting has a price. Not only to the qualified small \nbusinesses waiting for needed loans and for those who had been promised \nloans in January only to have the administration abruptly impose a \ncrippling loan cap, but also to the taxpayer. If either of the changes \nSenator Snowe and I had proposed in our bills, S. 2186 and S. 2193, had \nbeen enacted as part of H.R. 3195 in mid-March, we could have saved \nmore than $100,000 a day, leveraging at least another $150 million in \nsmall business loans in this fiscal year. These delays are fiscally \nirresponsible.\n  The Republican obstructionists will justify their delay tactics by \narguing that the earlier bills did not solve the entire funding problem \nfor the rest of the year. However, there are numerous problems with \nsuch a claim. One, time was of the essence for the small businesses \nthat had been shutout since January. Two, no one knows if the \nadministration's estimates are accurate and the confidence in the \neconometric model that predicts future program costs has gone down as a \nresult of the SBA's latest estimates. For example, how could imposing a \nfee on piggyback loans of .5 percent, a fee that will generate new \nincome for the program, not offset the costs at all? And, if that is \ntrue, how could additional savings from increasing that fee by 40 \npercent, to .7 percent be only one one-hundredth of one percent? I \ndon't know of one lender who believes that claim. Three, it would have \nbeen better to take a step in the right direction and immediately \nreduce the cost of the program to the extent possible in order to \nstretch the lending dollars. This option would have allowed for future \nrefinements while saving precious appropriated dollars in the process. \nFour,\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\nthere would have been (and still are) several other opportunities to \nmake adjustments later in the fiscal year.\n  With respect to the other important provisions of H.R. 4062, I am \nglad that the bill includes my measure from S. 2186 that allows the 504 \nLoan Guarantee Program to operate through the rest of the fiscal year; \nhowever, I am very disappointed that, despite bipartisan support, the \nRepublican leadership refused to include a Snowe-Kerry amendment to \npromote women in business and safeguard one of their only dedicated \nresources of support: the nationwide network of women's business \ncenters. The Republicans that blocked our amendment--in support of the \nadministration's policy to eliminate experienced, efficient and \neffective women's business centers in favor of new and untested \ncenters--are potentially depriving thousands of women in business \naccess to much-needed assistance. The Snowe-Kerry amendment, like S. \n2267, would have made a small adjustment to the Women's Business Center \nprogram that corrects an outdated funding formula, without added cost \nto the Treasury. The adjustment would have changed the portion of \nfunding allowed for women's business centers in the sustainability part \nof the program to keep up with the increasing number of centers that \nwill need funding this fiscal year. Without it, all grants to \nsustainability centers in 39 States could be cut in half--or worse, 23 \nexperienced centers could lose funding completely. Our amendment was a \nbipartisan compromise intended to maintain an effective women's \nbusiness center network; a compromise that was agreed to by Chair \nSnowe, myself, and the bipartisan leadership of the House Small \nBusiness Committee. It was supported by women's groups across the \ncountry, and it is my sincere hope that my colleagues in Congress will \nsupport this change in the very near future.\n  I thank the broad coalition of small business trade associations that \nhave worked on the various bills and supported the provisions in my \nbill, S. 2186: The trade association of Women Impacting Public Policy \n(WIPP) and the National Association of Women's Business Owners (NAWBO), \nthe National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders (NAGGL), the \nAmerican Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers \nAssociation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for endorsing the \nprovisions relating to the 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program; WIPP, NAWBO, \nand the Association of Women's Business Centers for fully supporting \nthe provisions relating to the Women's Business Centers program, as \nwell as the cosponsors of S. 2186. I think anyone who knows of these \ngroups, their members and their leadership, knows that they work very \nwell with both sides of the aisle and with the leadership of our \nCommittee and also the House Committee on Small Business. Working \ncooperatively in a bipartisan fashion makes good sense and has long \nbeen their practice. We all appreciate their work to fix these \nproblems, and for the contribution they make to cultivating small \nstartup and growing small businesses in our communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask that several letters addressing the issue at \nhand be printed in the Record. I thank my colleagues for their support \nof small businesses and for considering immediate passage of this bill.\n  The letters follow.\n\n                                                   March 10, 2004.\n       Dear Representative: Today, as the House prepares to vote \n     on H.R. 3915, we are writing to express our concerns with \n     this legislation. We are very disappointed that it does not \n     include a SBA 7(a) program solution. Without a solution the \n     7(a) program will not be allowed to create much needed jobs \n     to help our economy.\n        The SBA's flagship 7(a) loan program, the single largest \n     provider of long-term start-up and expansion loans to \n     America's small businesses, has been crippled since the \n     beginning of this fiscal year, when the SBA temporarily shut \n     it down due to a funding shortfall. When the Agency reopened \n     the program a week later, it implemented an artificial loan \n     cap of $70,000--a reduction of more than 50% of the program's \n     statutory loan limit of $2 million--and a prohibition on \n     piggyback loans, which would have allowed lenders to make \n     loans in excess of a loan cap.\n        Businesses who had already submitted applications for \n     loans in excess of the new cap were then told their deals \n     would not qualify for the program. These applicants had gone \n     through months of financial planning and had been promised \n     their loans would be approved. Many had already begun \n     purchasing equipment and hiring employees. If their deals do \n     not get done, many will lose earnest money they had taken \n     from personal savings and retirement plans to inject into \n     these loans.\n        Other potential applicants who would ordinarily qualify \n     for the 7(a) program have since been told there is no \n     alternative to finance their start-up or expansion. The net \n     result to these small businesses is a loss of faith in the \n     U.S. government. The net result to the economy is a loss of \n     jobs.\n        A solution to this lingering problem does exist and it has \n     been communicated to the House Small Business Committee. This \n     proposal has bipartisan support on the Small Business \n     Committee, as well as the support of banking and small \n     business trade groups. The proposed solution would increase \n     fees for lenders to ensure that there is no budget impact. It \n     would maintain the 7(a) program. However, H.R. 3915 ignores \n     this solution.\n        Without a 7(a) solution, approximately $3 billion in loans \n     will remain unavailable to small businesses for the remainder \n     of FY 2004--a net loss of approximately 90,000 jobs. We also \n     fear that if a swift and equitable solution is not enacted, \n     many 7(a) lenders will flee the program, leaving a void in \n     availability of the long-term financing that is so crucial to \n     small businesses' success.\n        We request that Congress bolster economic recovery and the \n     small businesses that drive it by enacting a 7(a) program \n     solution that has the full support of Congress and the \n     industry.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Bankers Association.\n        America's Community Bankers.\n        Independent Community Bankers of America.\n        National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders.\n        The Financial Services Roundtable.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                Government Guaranteed Lenders,\n\n                                   Stillwater, OK, March 10, 2004.\n     Re SBA 7(a) funding crisis and S. 2186.\n\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: As Congress considers how to solve the \n     ongoing SBA 7(a) program funding crisis, we are writing to \n     express our support for S. 2186, which includes provisions \n     that both Small Business Committees and the 7(a) industry \n     have already agreed are equitable.\n       While NAGGL is generally opposed to programmatic fee \n     increases, the 2004 budget for the 7(a) program has made his \n     concession necessary. NAGGL testified in 2003 that 2004 \n     program demand would be nearly $12 billion, but the \n     Administration adamantly disagreed with our estimate, \n     providing program level of only $9.5 billion. The \n     Administration has also failed to reprogram any additional \n     money to the 7(a) program or offer a supplemental \n     appropriations request.\n       As a result, the SBA's flagship 7(a) loan program, the \n     single largest provider of long-term start-up and expansion \n     loans to American's small businesses, has been crippled since \n     the beginning of this fiscal year, when the SBA temporarily \n     shut it down due to a funding shortfall. When the Agency \n     reopened the program a week later, it implemented an \n     artificial loan cap of $750,000--a reduction of more than 50% \n     of the program's statutory loan limit of $2 million--and a \n     prohibition on piggyback loans, which would have allowed \n     lenders to make loans in excess of a loan cap.\n       Businesses who had already submitted applications for loans \n     in excess of the new cap were then told their deals would not \n     qualify for the program. These applicants had gone through \n     months of financial planning and had been promised their \n     loans would be approved. Many had already begun purchasing \n     equipment and hiring employees. And if their deals don't get \n     done, many will lose earnest money they had taken from \n     personal savings and retirement plans to inject into these \n     loans.\n       Other potential applicants who would ordinarily qualify for \n     the 7(a) program have since been told there is no alternative \n     to finance their start-up or expansion. The net result to \n     these small businesses is a loss of faith in the U.S. \n     government. The net result to the economy is a loss of jobs.\n       The provisions of S. 2186 fix this problem, and the bill \n     has NAGGL's full support. As the trade association \n     representing lenders who make over 80% of loans in the 7(a) \n     program every year, we can attest to the fact that the \n     minimal fee increases in S. 2186 are ones that lenders will \n     pay and will not be passed along to borrowers. We also \n     continue to oppose the SBA's legislative proposal to reduce \n     the guarantee on all 7(a) loans to 50% and allow the \n     legislation that provided for lender and borrower fee \n     decreases through the end of this fiscal year to simply \n     sunset.\n       Without the provisions of S. 2186, $3 billion in loans will \n     remain unavailable to small businesses for the remainder of \n     FY 2004--a net loss of approximately 90,000 jobs. We also \n     fear that if a swift and equitable solution is not enacted, \n     many 7(a) lenders will flee the program, leaving a void in \n     availability of the long-term financing that is so crucial to \n     small businesses' success. This will be occurring at a time \n     when our economy is in desperate need of a shot in the arm.\n       We request that you press for swift passage of S. 2186 to \n     bolster economic recovery and the small businesses that can \n     drive it. Thank you in advance for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Tony Wilkinson,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                           Crystal Collection,\n\n                                       Suwanee, GA, April 5, 2004.\n     Hon.

John F. Kerry,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Small Business, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Kerry: Please be advised that Business Loan \n     Center, LLC, aka Business Loan Express, LLC, the nation's \n     third largest SBA 7(a) lender, is a strong supporter of the \n     Senate and House bill that is also supported by the ``Access \n     to Capital Coalition Organization,'' which will permit the \n     reopening of a viable 7(a) loan program in America. This \n     means once law, SBA would be required to drop the prohibition \n     against ``piggyback loans'' and eliminate the current loan \n     cap. As most every 7(a) lending organization has indicated \n     since early January 2004, it is absolutely critical that \n     these 7(a) program impediments be dropped at the earliest \n     possible date. As you are aware, no knowledgeable trade \n     organization or 7(a) lending entity supports a mandatory 50% \n     maximum loan guaranty, as it would represent a slow death of \n     the 7(a) loan program. Most every community in America \n     utilizes the 7(a) loan program as a major part of their \n     economic development/job creating/job retention program. If \n     one removed from our economy all businesses and the jobs they \n     create directly and indirectly, who at one time or another \n     received 7(a) loan assistance, this would be a totally \n     different country. To assist the recovery of our economy and \n     the retention and creation of jobs, it is absolutely \n     essential that the 7(a) loan program be returned to its prior \n     dynamic status. Thank you for your leadership in this matter. \n     Please encourage the Administration and your colleagues to \n     support the House and the Senate bill that would solve this \n     current dilemma!\n           Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                            Deryl K. Schuster,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Director, Governmental Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Association of Small Business\n\n\n                                          Development Centers,\n\n                                       Burke, VA, January 9, 2004.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing about the recent decision \n     by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to suspend \n     making loan guarantees for small businesses under the 7(a) \n     loan program.\n       As you know, the SBA announced on December 23rd that it \n     would begin imposing a $750,000 cap on 7(a) loan guarantees \n     effective January 8th, even though Congress has authorized \n     loan guarantees up to $2 million. The SBA's announcement led \n     small businesses with loan applications for more than \n     $750,000 to submit their applications before the announcement \n     deadline. As a result, the SBA experienced a significant \n     increase in 7(a) loan applications and suspended the program \n     until further announcement, on the grounds that the increase \n     in loan applications had led to a shortfall in funding.\n       Small businesses throughout the country have seen their \n     loans put in jeopardy as a consequence of this decision, and \n     applicants for loans above $750,000 may be unable to obtain \n     loan guarantees--or be forced to re-apply--even if the 7(a) \n     loan program is re-opened. The ASBDC is hearing from Small \n     Business Development Center (SBDC) counselors in the field \n     that the decision to suspend the 7(a) loan program could pose \n     a severe hardship for many SBDC clients.\n       In the past three years, the 7(a) loan guarantee program \n     has helped make financing available to more than 40,000 \n     start-up small businesses and 99,000 existing small \n     businesses--leading to the creation of more than one million \n     new jobs. Suspending this vital small business lending \n     program at this critical stage of the economy's recovery from \n     the recession will prevent the start-up and the expansion of \n     small businesses throughout the country, and stymie the \n     economy's creation of new jobs.\n       I appreciate all that you do to support small business. I \n     urge you to continue to work with the SBA and the Office of \n     Management and Budget to reopen the 7(a) loan guarantee \n     program and remove the $750,000 loan cap as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Donald Wilson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Compass Bank,\n\n                                    Houston, TX, January 12, 2004.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing to alert you to an \n     economic crisis that should have been avoided but can still \n     be remedied.\n       The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) claims it has \n     run out of money for its flagship 7(a) loan program. This is \n     because the Administration did not request adequate funds for \n     the program for fiscal year 2004.\n       The Administration only requested a program level of $9.3 \n     billion, even though the program did $11.3 billion last year, \n     even with a $500,000 loan cap in place for nearly half of the \n     fiscal year. NAGGL estimated that demand would be $12.5 \n     billion beginning with our budget testimonies in February \n     2003.\n       Loan volume for the first three months of fiscal year 2004 \n     was $3.137 billion, a level of demand that clearly supports \n     NAGGL's estimates of demand.\n       Because the Administration did not seek sufficient program \n     level, the SBA has now shut down the 7(a) program until \n     further notice, depriving small businesses of the capital \n     they need in order to expand their businesses, hire new \n     people, and aid the American economic recovery. The shutdown \n     occurred just a few weeks after SBA Administrator Barreto \n     told the NAGGL Annual Conferees that the ``program would not \n     be shutdown, and that the $9.3 billion program request would \n     be sufficient.''\n       In unprecedented fashion, the SBA is now rejecting and \n     returning all loan applications. During previous funding \n     shortages, the SBA continued to accept and process loan \n     applications. The loans would then be funded when loan funds \n     became available. The SBA's action, to make small businesses \n     pay for its own mismanagement, is unconscionable.\n       Because small businesses are the chief engine of economic \n     recovery, America can ill afford a halt in funding to small \n     businesses in this time when the economy is just regaining \n     steam.\n       Though the SBA has been implored by members of both major \n     political parties to immediately seek an equitable solution, \n     the Administration has thus far not come forward with any \n     positive solutions. The Administration has thus far responded \n     only with loan caps, program shutdowns, and excuses why this \n     is Congress' fault.\n       One conclusion could be that the Administration desires to \n     either dismantle or significantly change the SBA and the 7(a) \n     program. I'm asking you not to let this happen.\n       The Administration should either request a reprogramming of \n     funds or submit a supplemental appropriation request \n     sufficient to fund the 7(a) program to $12.5 billion this \n     year. The SBA should be required to lift both the current \n     program freeze and the artificial $750,000 cap it has put in \n     place to restrict small business access to capital. The SBA \n     should be required to stop the budget gimmicks and put \n     forward a credible budget request that ensures this program \n     is funded properly in fiscal year 2005 and beyond without fee \n     increases to borrowers and lenders. Don't let this \n     Administration dismantle a program that has served small \n     businesses so well for so long.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Harriet Boshaw,\n                                   SBA Lending Department.\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3789-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      COMMEMORATING HENRY MANCINI\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to honor \nHenry Mancini, a fine composer, conductor, and arranger. Mr. Mancini \nwas one of the most versatile musical talents and one of America's most \ncelebrated musicians of the twentieth century. He lent his talents to \nmany films and television series, the themes and melodies of which are \nrecognizable to listeners the world over, even if they are unfamiliar \nwith the name of the composer.\n  April 16 would have been Henry Mancini's 80th birthday. Even though \nMr. Mancini passed away in 1994 after a long battle with cancer, his \ncontribution to music and the arts has not been forgotten.\n  The United States Postal Service will unveil the Henry Mancini \ncommemorative stamp next week. The unveiling ceremony on April 13 will \ntake place at the Music Center Plaza in Los Angeles and will be hosted \nby our distinguished former colleague, John Glenn, a longtime friend of \nMancini. Senator Glenn, it might be added, took a recording of \nMancini's timeless classic, ``Moon River,'' on his return to space in \nOctober 1998.\n  In his lifetime, Henry Mancini's masterful talents were recognized \nwith 72 Grammy Award nominations and 20 Grammy wins, eighteen Academy \nAward nominations and four Oscar wins, and a Golden Globe.\n  While awards are a notable measure of talent, the scope of Mr. \nMancini's work is more impressive than the nominations he received for \nthat work. During the 1950s, Mr. Mancini had a hand in the scores of \nover 100 films produced by Universal-International Studios. It was also \nat Universal that Mr. Mancini met Blake Edwards, and together they \nworked on 26 films over 30 years. These collaborations produced some of \nMancini's most popular and award-winning compositions, including the \n``Peter Gunn'' television series, ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' ``The \nPink Panther'' films, and ``Victor/Victoria.''\n  In all, over 500 of Mr. Mancini's works were published. Mr. Mancini \nrecorded over 90 albums with styles from jazz to classical, including \neight albums certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of \nAmerica. As an in-demand concert performer, he logged over 600 symphony \nperformances, and conducted such symphony orchestras as the London \nSymphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Los Angeles \nPhilharmonic, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.\n  Andy Williams said at Mancini's 70th birthday celebration: ``The \nwonders of Henry Mancini will be heard in every corner of the world \nright up to the minute this planet cools and shrinks to the size of an \neighth note.'' But it is more than the music he composed that will be \nHenry Mancini's legacy.\n  In honor of Mancini's dedication to educating young musicians, the \nHenry Mancini Institute was founded in Los Angeles in 1997 by his \nlongtime friend and fellow composer, Jack Elliott. The Henry Mancini \nInstitute's mission is to nurture the future of music by providing \ncomprehensive professional training and multilevel outreach programs \nthat make a direct impact in people's lives. Mr. Mancini himself \nestablished scholarships and fellowships at the Nation's top music \nschools. Many of tomorrow's composers, conductors, and arrangers have \nbenefited from Mancini programs at New York's Julliard School of Music \nhis alma mater, and in Los Angeles at USC and UCLA.\n  I would also like to recognize the Mancini family, who has gracefully \nembraced Henry's legacy and allowed for future generations of musicians \nto celebrate his accomplishments and contributions. My good friend \nGinny Mancini, whom he married in 1947, has relentlessly worked to \nbring about the creation of this stamp, as have their children: \nChristopher, Monica, and Felice.\n  Honoring Henry Mancini with this commemorative stamp will serve as a \nlasting tribute, just as his music is a lasting gift to the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3789-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be here today \nwith our colleagues from the House Veterans Affairs Committee and the \nmembers of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The VFW has a rich tradition \nin enhancing the lives of millions through its community service \nprograms and special projects, and I am proud to have their services in \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  The work of our committees is as important as ever because of the \nthousands of new wartime veterans leaving the service and the \nincreasing needs of our aging veterans. We owe all our veterans a debt \nof gratitude and I am committed to making sure we provide them with \nample benefits and quality medical care.\n  President Bush has proposed significant increases in spending for our \nveterans, but it is important to keep in mind that his budget is only a \nstarting point. Each year he has requested increases in funding for the \nVA and Congress has provided even more beyond those requests.\n  The last 2 years Congress has provided unprecedented increases in \nfunding for VA health care. I support another substantial increase for \nVA health care this year and I am confident we will deliver. In fact, \nthe budget resolution currently before the Senate provides for an extra \n$1.3 billion for the VA and rejects the proposed co-pay increases and \nenrollment fees.\n  VA conducts some of the most specialized medical research in our \nNation. That research is especially important to disabled veterans. I \noppose the proposed cut in VA research. The Budget Committee rejected \nthat cut and I added an additional $101 million for research, a 25 \npercent increase.\n  Now that the CARES process is wrapping up, VA can begin new \nconstruction projects. We will be watching to make sure the Secretary \ncarefully considers all proposed closings. I look forward to seeing new \nhospitals and clinics opened in Kentucky and around the Nation.\n  Last year I told the Secretary that VA had come a long way in fixing \nits problems but there was still a long way to go. I am glad to say \nthat the system is stronger this year, but we must not let up. We must \nkeep working to make sure our veterans receive the assistance they need \nin a timely and convenient manner. I am committed to doing just that.\n  Finally, I recognize all the Kentucky veterans in the hearing room. I \nhad a good visit with some of you in my office earlier this week. Thank \nyou for making the trip today and thank you for your service to our \nNation and your fellow veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3789-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3789-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3789-5", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3789-S3791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-6984.

A bill to expand the medicare rural community hospital \ndemonstration program to include outpatient services; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nto continue the relief to six hospitals in Nebraska that have been \nstruggling financially under the current Medicare payment structure.\n  Local hospitals can best meet the unique needs of rural communities \nwhich is why I am committed to ensuring that these hospitals have the \nresources they need. Vital services like hospitals are increasingly \nimportant for the survival of our rural communities. Towns can't \nadequately serve residents--or attract new residents--without access to \nbasic services. We need to focus on ensuring that hospitals and other \nvital services have the resources they need, so that communities will \nhave the essential services they require.\n  Last year, Senator Brownback and I proposed legislation to provide \ncost-based reimbursement for rural community hospitals. Rural Community \nHospitals (RCH) are hospitals with between 25-50 beds. Those hospitals \nhad been adversely affected by Medicare formulas that set rates for \nreimbursement nationwide. These rates did not take into account the \nhigher costs of practicing medicine in rural areas as these areas do \nnot have the benefits of volume that larger hospitals enjoy. RCHs are \nalso too large to qualify for critical access designation given to \nhospitals with fewer than 25 beds.\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\n  I am pleased that provisions from this legislation were included in \nthe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of \n2003 as a pilot program. The program provided cost-based reimbursements \nfor inpatient services.\n  The legislation Senator Brownback and I are introducing today will \nexpand the pilot program to cover outpatient services as well. This \nlegislation will again address a critical shortcoming in current \nreimbursement practices and help Rural Community Hospitals serve their \ncommunities and invest in the future of rural health care.\n  Six Nebraska hospitals would be affected by expanding the scope of \nthe pilot program. Those hospitals are: Beatrice Community Hospital, \nColumbus Community Hospital, McCook Community Hospital, Jennie Melham \nMemorial Medical Center in Broken Bow, Phelps Memorial Health Center in \nHoldrege, and Tri County Hospital in Lexington.\n  We made some progress for our rural hospitals by creating the RCH \npilot program last year. This legislation would expand on that victory \nby ensuring that all Medicare treatments, whether inpatient or \noutpatient, would receive cost-based reimbursement. Expanding this \nprogram will make a big difference to these hospitals and more \nimportantly, the patients they serve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2285. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey a \nparcel of real property to Beaver County, Utah; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would \ndirect the Secretary of the Interior to convey a parcel of property to \nBeaver County, UT. This bill would allow Beaver County in Southwestern \nUtah to obtain and maintain, without restrictions, the former \nMinersville State Park. In sum, this bill is necessary to allow County \nofficials to sell a small portion of this land--which has essentially \nbeen under their control for over 40 years--in order to offset funding \nneeded to maintain the remainder of the park.\n  Some history might be beneficial at this point. In 1961, Beaver \nCounty obtained a lease for 207 acres of land from the Bureau of Land \nManagement (BLM) to develop a recreational locale under the Recreation \nand Public Purposes Act. In 1963, Beaver County turned over the acreage \nto the State for the development of a park. Over the course of nearly \n40 years, the State of Utah spent about one million dollars to develop \ncampsites, a boat ramp, a dock, and other camping amenities to turn \nthis area into the Minersville Reservoir State Park. In 2002, in an \nendeavor to reduce operating costs, Utah State Parks transferred \ncontrol of the area back over to Beaver County. As County officials \nstated during negotiations, in order for Beaver County to afford \nmanagement of the day to day operations of the would-be county park, \nthey would need to sell some of the property to private investors. \nHowever, it was not until after park management responsibility was \ntransferred to the county that the BLM pointed out that the state had \nnot yet acquired the property through the Recreation and Public \nPurposes Act process. The plan for Beaver County to sell some of the \nland to pay for park operation, however, is not allowed under the \nRecreation and Public Purposes Act lease, which only allows the \nproperty to be developed for recreation or other purposes. The only way \nfor Beaver County to undertake responsibility for park is to remove the \ncurrent Federal restrictions on the property.\n  Today, Beaver County faces financial constraints in operating this \npark that threaten its continued use. Due to the prevailing \nrestrictions in the Recreation and Public Purposes Act lease, initiated \nmore than 40 years ago, the good people of southern Utah and visitors \nto the area will not be able to access and enjoy this county park. The \ncampsites would be littered and unkept. The boat ramp and the boat \ndocks would have to be closed. The park would become a destitute \nrecreation area, because there would be no one to administer park \nmaintenance and upkeep. The only public access to Minersville \nReservoir, which features a converted blue ribbon trout fishery, would \ngo to waste because of the Federal government's current Recreation and \nPublic Purposes Act lease restriction.\n  I don't believe that letting management of the park revert to the BLM \nis a viable option either. The intensive, day to day management this \nsmall park requires can be best accomplished to local officials. If \nBeaver County acquires the property, it will continue to make this park \nan excellent recreational refuge, a superb fishery, and a great place \nto visit. Beaver County will be able to provide a clean and safe park \nenjoyed by all who visit. That is why I am introducing this legislation \nthis legislation that would convey the Minersville Park land to Beaver \nCounty.\n  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address this issue today, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n   S. 2288. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to assist \nStates in establishing, maintaining, and improving systems to reduce \nthe diversion and abuse of prescription drugs; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the abuse of prescription drugs has \nreached epidemic proportions in this country. In many States, including \nmy home State of Maine, deaths from prescription drug overdoses now \nexceed deaths from illicit drugs. Nationwide, emergency room visits for \nprescription drug problems more than doubled in the last decade.\n   The number of Americans who divert prescription drugs from their \nintended purposes and abuse them was estimated at 4 million in 1998. \nToday, the estimate is 11 million Americans. At a time when, according \nto the National Institute on Drug Abuse, our young people are turning \naway from marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, and even alcohol, they \nunfortunately are turning to the medicine cabinet.\n   Nearly one in five of our Nation's high school juniors and seniors \nsay they abuse prescription drugs.\n   The cost of drug abuse to our society in treatment, health care, \nlost productivity, crime, and incarceration exceeds $150 billion a \nyear. The cost to its victims is incalculable. That is why today I am \nintroducing the Prescription Drug Stewardship Act. I use the word \n``stewardship'' to emphasize our responsibility as individuals and as a \nsociety to see that these beneficial medications are used for their \nintended purposes, not to cause addiction, disability, and even death.\n   This legislation attacks the spiraling cycle of diversion and abuse \nwith three key stewardship activities:\n   First, computerized prescription drug systems to better track the \nflow of medications.\n   Second, ongoing practitioner training to help our busy medical \nprofessionals keep current with the trends in diversion treatment and \nabuse.\n   Third, and perhaps most important, public education to help our \ncitizens better understand the dangers posed by the misuse of these \ndrugs.\n   I have found in talking with experts in this field that many \nindividuals who would never think of trying heroin, for example, will \ntake leftover prescription drugs that may, in the long run, be equally \naddictive and just as harmful.\n   Combined with improved and more accessible substance abuse treatment \nprograms, the legislation I am introducing would help to stem the \nrising tide of abuse and addiction that has swamped families and \nweakened communities in my State and across the country.\n  My bill would authorize per year for each of the next 3 years to fund \nprescription drug monitoring and education programs at the State level. \nIt would create competitive grant programs which would be administered \nby the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. They \nwould require States to demonstrate their commitment to stewardship \nwith matching funds and also to meet the privacy requirements under \ncurrent law as they carry out these important activities.\n  What we have found is that the most abused medications are those that \nrelieve pain and anxiety. For millions of legitimate patients suffering \nfrom illness or injury, these medicines are\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\nvital and their availability is proper and humane. They can make the \ndifference between suffering and the ability to carry on with a normal \nlife for people who are in serious pain or suffering from serious \ndisease or injury. It is tragically clear, however, that these \nmedications, many of them as powerful or as addictive as illegal drugs, \nincreasingly are being diverted from their legitimate use to \ntrafficking and abuse.\n  I want to emphasize that the problems is not with these medications \nwhen they are prescribed, dispensed, and consumed responsibly. In fact, \nwe know that pain is still undertreated in this country, and that most \nphysicians are extremely responsible in trying to relieve pain felt by \ntheir patients. The problem is what happens when the chain of \nresponsibility breaks.\n  Oversight of the licensing and practices for prescribing and \ndispensing of these medications has long been a matter of State \njurisdiction. As a former State regulator who was in charge of \nlicensing boards for physicians and pharmacists, for example, I \ncertainly have no desire to change that system. The States have not \nshirked their stewardship responsibility. They simply have been \noverwhelmed by this epidemic of diversion and abuse, and they need some \nFederal assistance, not to take over their programs, but to help them \nin a partnership to make them more effective.\n  This national calamity has hit rural States particularly hard. The \nPresiding Officer's home State of North Carolina is one of those States \nthat has felt the devastating impact of this epidemic. Kentucky, \nVirginia, West Virginia all report prescription drug abuse at epidemic \nlevels. But no State, unfortunately, has been hit harder than my State \nof Maine.\n  From 1997 to 2002, the number of accidental deaths in Maine from all \ndrugs soared from 19 to 126, an increase of more than 500 percent, and \nprescription drugs were present in 60 percent of these deaths.\n  The 2002 Main Youth Drug and Alcohol Survey found that a disturbing \n25 percent of my State's high school juniors and seniors abuse \nprescription drugs. That is an astonishing number and a very disturbing \nstatistic. In the last 5 years, enrollment in Main clinics that treat \nopiate addiction has increased tenfold.\n  These shocking numbers from Main demonstrate that drug abuse and \naddiction is not longer a big-city problem. It is a problem that \nafflicts our citizens no matter where they live, whether it is Los \nAngeles, CA, or Calais, ME. In fact, a hearing I helped put together \nlast year demonstrated that there is a terrible problem in Washington \nCounty in Downeast, ME. Some estimates are that as many as 1,000 of the \ncitizens of this county of only 35,000 citizens are struggling with \ndrug addiction and abuse. This was a hearing before the HELP Committee. \nIt actually was 2 years ago. But last August, I chaired a committee \nmeeting of the Governmental Affairs Committee in Bangor, ME, where we \nheard from law enforcement officers, from drug treatment counselors, \nand from many others who are expert in drug addiction and abuse. The \npicture they painted was a startling one. It showed that drug abuse, \nand abuse of prescription drugs in particular, is a problem throughout \nthe entire State of Maine.\n\n  My legislation would provide States, such as Maine, with the \nresources to carry out three critical stewardship activities. The first \nwould help States to monitor the flow of prescription drugs from \npractitioner to pharmacy to patient. We know that prescription drugs \noften find their way to the street when unscrupulous individuals obtain \nmultiple prescriptions from multiple doctors. These so-called doctor \nshoppers operate in every State. Sometimes they act alone and sometimes \nthey act in concert with organized gangs of criminals. Each can divert \nhundreds, even thousands, of pills per day. Many of these drugs have a \nstreet value 10 times the cost at the pharmacy.\n  Twenty States now have prescription tracking systems. Maine began \noperating such a system or putting it together just this summer. About \nhalf of these systems use the latest computer technology and have \nproven that illegal diversion can be curtailed without reducing access \nto these medications by legitimate patients and without breaching that \nessential doctor-patient confidentiality.\n  We want to make sure any system we put in place does not chill a \ndoctor's ability to prescribe legitimate medication for patients who \nare suffering and need help with their pain.\n  These systems have also demonstrated an effective prescription drug \nsystem more than pays for itself by reducing the tremendous costs \nassociated with drug abuse and addiction. Thirty States, however, have \nno system whatsoever for monitoring or tracking prescription drugs in a \nway that would help us identify and put a stop to doctor shopping. My \nlegislation would provide the States with the resources to start up \nsuch a system to help improve its quality or to maintain it.\n  The testimony I heard last August in Bangor, ME, before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, along with my colleague Senator Sununu, \nprovided the basis not only for that provision of our bill but also for \ntwo others. The testimony we heard that day from those who are on the \nfront lines, law enforcement, hospital emergency room physicians, and \ntreatment clinic personnel, was alarming. They told us medical \npractitioners need our help. Our doctors, our physician assistants, our \nnurses are busy professionals, often far too busy. Many simply do not \nhave the time to travel to seminars where they would receive \ninformation about the latest trends in drug abuse, learn how to \nrecognize drug-seeking behavior, dependence, or addiction among their \npatients. The most effective and efficient way to provide that kind of \ntraining to medical personnel is to take the education to them through \none-on-one small group mentoring in their offices or in their \nhospitals.\n  The second part of my legislation would provide grants for such \nmentoring projects so practitioners with special training in drug abuse \nissues can pass along this vital knowledge to their colleagues who are \npracticing in communities all over America. Experts also tell us a \nmajor reason so many Americans with no history of abusing illegal drugs \nnow are abusing prescriptions drugs is many people have a terrible \nmisconception that these prescription drugs are somehow safe to abuse, \nthat it is safe to take someone else's prescription. After all, they \nthink they are researched in high-tech laboratories, manufactured in \nmodern factories, prescribed and dispensed by highly trained medical \nexperts; therefore, they must be safe. When they are used properly, \nthey are, but as the overdose and addiction statistics prove, when used \nimproperly they can be fatal.\n  We need an aggressive public education campaign to warn our citizens \nabout the dangers of abusing prescription drugs. The reduction in \nsmoking rates, in illicit drug use, even in drunk-driving deaths is \ntestament to the progress we can make with seemingly intractable \nproblems when we commit the resources for public education campaigns in \npartnership with the States. I believe the same approach can help our \ncitizens become better stewards of prescription medications.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the legislation I am \nintroducing today to address the increasingly devastating problem of \nprescription drug abuse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS:\n  S. 2289.

A bill to expand the medicare rural community hospital \ndemonstration program to include outpatient services; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nto continue the relief to six hospitals in Nebraska that have been \nstruggling financially under the current Medicare payment structure.\n  Local hospitals can best meet the unique needs of rural communities \nwhich is why I am committed to ensuring that these hospitals have the \nresources they need. Vital services like hospitals are increasingly \nimportant for the survival of our rural communities. Towns can't \nadequately serve residents--or attract new residents--without access to \nbasic services. We need to focus on ensuring that hospitals and other \nvital services have the resources they need, so that communities will \nhave the essential services they require.\n  Last year, Senator Brownback and I proposed legislation to provide \ncost-based reimbursement for rural community hospitals. Rural Community \nHospitals (RCH) are hospitals with between 25-50 beds. Those hospitals \nhad been adversely affected by Medicare formulas that set rates for \nreimbursement nationwide. These rates did not take into account the \nhigher costs of practicing medicine in rural areas as these areas do \nnot have the benefits of volume that larger hospitals enjoy. RCHs are \nalso too large to qualify for critical access designation given to \nhospitals with fewer than 25 beds.\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\n  I am pleased that provisions from this legislation were included in \nthe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of \n2003 as a pilot program. The program provided cost-based reimbursements \nfor inpatient services.\n  The legislation Senator Brownback and I are introducing today will \nexpand the pilot program to cover outpatient services as well. This \nlegislation will again address a critical shortcoming in current \nreimbursement practices and help Rural Community Hospitals serve their \ncommunities and invest in the future of rural health care.\n  Six Nebraska hospitals would be affected by expanding the scope of \nthe pilot program. Those hospitals are: Beatrice Community Hospital, \nColumbus Community Hospital, McCook Community Hospital, Jennie Melham \nMemorial Medical Center in Broken Bow, Phelps Memorial Health Center in \nHoldrege, and Tri County Hospital in Lexington.\n  We made some progress for our rural hospitals by creating the RCH \npilot program last year. This legislation would expand on that victory \nby ensuring that all Medicare treatments, whether inpatient or \noutpatient, would receive cost-based reimbursement. Expanding this \nprogram will make a big difference to these hospitals and more \nimportantly, the patients they serve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2285. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey a \nparcel of real property to Beaver County, Utah; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would \ndirect the Secretary of the Interior to convey a parcel of property to \nBeaver County, UT. This bill would allow Beaver County in Southwestern \nUtah to obtain and maintain, without restrictions, the former \nMinersville State Park. In sum, this bill is necessary to allow County \nofficials to sell a small portion of this land--which has essentially \nbeen under their control for over 40 years--in order to offset funding \nneeded to maintain the remainder of the park.\n  Some history might be beneficial at this point. In 1961, Beaver \nCounty obtained a lease for 207 acres of land from the Bureau of Land \nManagement (BLM) to develop a recreational locale under the Recreation \nand Public Purposes Act. In 1963, Beaver County turned over the acreage \nto the State for the development of a park. Over the course of nearly \n40 years, the State of Utah spent about one million dollars to develop \ncampsites, a boat ramp, a dock, and other camping amenities to turn \nthis area into the Minersville Reservoir State Park. In 2002, in an \nendeavor to reduce operating costs, Utah State Parks transferred \ncontrol of the area back over to Beaver County. As County officials \nstated during negotiations, in order for Beaver County to afford \nmanagement of the day to day operations of the would-be county park, \nthey would need to sell some of the property to private investors. \nHowever, it was not until after park management responsibility was \ntransferred to the county that the BLM pointed out that the state had \nnot yet acquired the property through the Recreation and Public \nPurposes Act process. The plan for Beaver County to sell some of the \nland to pay for park operation, however, is not allowed under the \nRecreation and Public Purposes Act lease, which only allows the \nproperty to be developed for recreation or other purposes. The only way \nfor Beaver County to undertake responsibility for park is to remove the \ncurrent Federal restrictions on the property.\n  Today, Beaver County faces financial constraints in operating this \npark that threaten its continued use. Due to the prevailing \nrestrictions in the Recreation and Public Purposes Act lease, initiated \nmore than 40 years ago, the good people of southern Utah and visitors \nto the area will not be able to access and enjoy this county park. The \ncampsites would be littered and unkept. The boat ramp and the boat \ndocks would have to be closed. The park would become a destitute \nrecreation area, because there would be no one to administer park \nmaintenance and upkeep. The only public access to Minersville \nReservoir, which features a converted blue ribbon trout fishery, would \ngo to waste because of the Federal government's current Recreation and \nPublic Purposes Act lease restriction.\n  I don't believe that letting management of the park revert to the BLM \nis a viable option either. The intensive, day to day management this \nsmall park requires can be best accomplished to local officials. If \nBeaver County acquires the property, it will continue to make this park \nan excellent recreational refuge, a superb fishery, and a great place \nto visit. Beaver County will be able to provide a clean and safe park \nenjoyed by all who visit. That is why I am introducing this legislation \nthis legislation that would convey the Minersville Park land to Beaver \nCounty.\n  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address this issue today, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n   S. 2288. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to assist \nStates in establishing, maintaining, and improving systems to reduce \nthe diversion and abuse of prescription drugs; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the abuse of prescription drugs has \nreached epidemic proportions in this country. In many States, including \nmy home State of Maine, deaths from prescription drug overdoses now \nexceed deaths from illicit drugs. Nationwide, emergency room visits for \nprescription drug problems more than doubled in the last decade.\n   The number of Americans who divert prescription drugs from their \nintended purposes and abuse them was estimated at 4 million in 1998. \nToday, the estimate is 11 million Americans. At a time when, according \nto the National Institute on Drug Abuse, our young people are turning \naway from marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, and even alcohol, they \nunfortunately are turning to the medicine cabinet.\n   Nearly one in five of our Nation's high school juniors and seniors \nsay they abuse prescription drugs.\n   The cost of drug abuse to our society in treatment, health care, \nlost productivity, crime, and incarceration exceeds $150 billion a \nyear. The cost to its victims is incalculable. That is why today I am \nintroducing the Prescription Drug Stewardship Act. I use the word \n``stewardship'' to emphasize our responsibility as individuals and as a \nsociety to see that these beneficial medications are used for their \nintended purposes, not to cause addiction, disability, and even death.\n   This legislation attacks the spiraling cycle of diversion and abuse \nwith three key stewardship activities:\n   First, computerized prescription drug systems to better track the \nflow of medications.\n   Second, ongoing practitioner training to help our busy medical \nprofessionals keep current with the trends in diversion treatment and \nabuse.\n   Third, and perhaps most important, public education to help our \ncitizens better understand the dangers posed by the misuse of these \ndrugs.\n   I have found in talking with experts in this field that many \nindividuals who would never think of trying heroin, for example, will \ntake leftover prescription drugs that may, in the long run, be equally \naddictive and just as harmful.\n   Combined with improved and more accessible substance abuse treatment \nprograms, the legislation I am introducing would help to stem the \nrising tide of abuse and addiction that has swamped families and \nweakened communities in my State and across the country.\n  My bill would authorize per year for each of the next 3 years to fund \nprescription drug monitoring and education programs at the State level. \nIt would create competitive grant programs which would be administered \nby the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. They \nwould require States to demonstrate their commitment to stewardship \nwith matching funds and also to meet the privacy requirements under \ncurrent law as they carry out these important activities.\n  What we have found is that the most abused medications are those that \nrelieve pain and anxiety. For millions of legitimate patients suffering \nfrom illness or injury, these medicines are\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\nvital and their availability is proper and humane. They can make the \ndifference between suffering and the ability to carry on with a normal \nlife for people who are in serious pain or suffering from serious \ndisease or injury. It is tragically clear, however, that these \nmedications, many of them as powerful or as addictive as illegal drugs, \nincreasingly are being diverted from their legitimate use to \ntrafficking and abuse.\n  I want to emphasize that the problems is not with these medications \nwhen they are prescribed, dispensed, and consumed responsibly. In fact, \nwe know that pain is still undertreated in this country, and that most \nphysicians are extremely responsible in trying to relieve pain felt by \ntheir patients. The problem is what happens when the chain of \nresponsibility breaks.\n  Oversight of the licensing and practices for prescribing and \ndispensing of these medications has long been a matter of State \njurisdiction. As a former State regulator who was in charge of \nlicensing boards for physicians and pharmacists, for example, I \ncertainly have no desire to change that system. The States have not \nshirked their stewardship responsibility. They simply have been \noverwhelmed by this epidemic of diversion and abuse, and they need some \nFederal assistance, not to take over their programs, but to help them \nin a partnership to make them more effective.\n  This national calamity has hit rural States particularly hard. The \nPresiding Officer's home State of North Carolina is one of those States \nthat has felt the devastating impact of this epidemic. Kentucky, \nVirginia, West Virginia all report prescription drug abuse at epidemic \nlevels. But no State, unfortunately, has been hit harder than my State \nof Maine.\n  From 1997 to 2002, the number of accidental deaths in Maine from all \ndrugs soared from 19 to 126, an increase of more than 500 percent, and \nprescription drugs were present in 60 percent of these deaths.\n  The 2002 Main Youth Drug and Alcohol Survey found that a disturbing \n25 percent of my State's high school juniors and seniors abuse \nprescription drugs. That is an astonishing number and a very disturbing \nstatistic. In the last 5 years, enrollment in Main clinics that treat \nopiate addiction has increased tenfold.\n  These shocking numbers from Main demonstrate that drug abuse and \naddiction is not longer a big-city problem. It is a problem that \nafflicts our citizens no matter where they live, whether it is Los \nAngeles, CA, or Calais, ME. In fact, a hearing I helped put together \nlast year demonstrated that there is a terrible problem in Washington \nCounty in Downeast, ME. Some estimates are that as many as 1,000 of the \ncitizens of this county of only 35,000 citizens are struggling with \ndrug addiction and abuse. This was a hearing before the HELP Committee. \nIt actually was 2 years ago. But last August, I chaired a committee \nmeeting of the Governmental Affairs Committee in Bangor, ME, where we \nheard from law enforcement officers, from drug treatment counselors, \nand from many others who are expert in drug addiction and abuse. The \npicture they painted was a startling one. It showed that drug abuse, \nand abuse of prescription drugs in particular, is a problem throughout \nthe entire State of Maine.\n\n  My legislation would provide States, such as Maine, with the \nresources to carry out three critical stewardship activities. The first \nwould help States to monitor the flow of prescription drugs from \npractitioner to pharmacy to patient. We know that prescription drugs \noften find their way to the street when unscrupulous individuals obtain \nmultiple prescriptions from multiple doctors. These so-called doctor \nshoppers operate in every State. Sometimes they act alone and sometimes \nthey act in concert with organized gangs of criminals. Each can divert \nhundreds, even thousands, of pills per day. Many of these drugs have a \nstreet value 10 times the cost at the pharmacy.\n  Twenty States now have prescription tracking systems. Maine began \noperating such a system or putting it together just this summer. About \nhalf of these systems use the latest computer technology and have \nproven that illegal diversion can be curtailed without reducing access \nto these medications by legitimate patients and without breaching that \nessential doctor-patient confidentiality.\n  We want to make sure any system we put in place does not chill a \ndoctor's ability to prescribe legitimate medication for patients who \nare suffering and need help with their pain.\n  These systems have also demonstrated an effective prescription drug \nsystem more than pays for itself by reducing the tremendous costs \nassociated with drug abuse and addiction. Thirty States, however, have \nno system whatsoever for monitoring or tracking prescription drugs in a \nway that would help us identify and put a stop to doctor shopping. My \nlegislation would provide the States with the resources to start up \nsuch a system to help improve its quality or to maintain it.\n  The testimony I heard last August in Bangor, ME, before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, along with my colleague Senator Sununu, \nprovided the basis not only for that provision of our bill but also for \ntwo others. The testimony we heard that day from those who are on the \nfront lines, law enforcement, hospital emergency room physicians, and \ntreatment clinic personnel, was alarming. They told us medical \npractitioners need our help. Our doctors, our physician assistants, our \nnurses are busy professionals, often far too busy. Many simply do not \nhave the time to travel to seminars where they would receive \ninformation about the latest trends in drug abuse, learn how to \nrecognize drug-seeking behavior, dependence, or addiction among their \npatients. The most effective and efficient way to provide that kind of \ntraining to medical personnel is to take the education to them through \none-on-one small group mentoring in their offices or in their \nhospitals.\n  The second part of my legislation would provide grants for such \nmentoring projects so practitioners with special training in drug abuse \nissues can pass along this vital knowledge to their colleagues who are \npracticing in communities all over America. Experts also tell us a \nmajor reason so many Americans with no history of abusing illegal drugs \nnow are abusing prescriptions drugs is many people have a terrible \nmisconception that these prescription drugs are somehow safe to abuse, \nthat it is safe to take someone else's prescription. After all, they \nthink they are researched in high-tech laboratories, manufactured in \nmodern factories, prescribed and dispensed by highly trained medical \nexperts; therefore, they must be safe.

Res. 332\n\n       Whereas 10 years ago, during a 3-month period in 1994, \n     800,000 Rwandans were killed in an organized campaign of \n     genocide that targeted ethnic Tutsis and political moderates;\n       Whereas the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda \n     was dramatically scaled back as the genocide occurred;\n       Whereas by mid-July 2004, 2,000,000 Rwandans became \n     refugees and another 1,000,000 were internally displaced due \n     to the genocide and civil war;\n       Whereas in 1994, the United Nations Security Council \n     established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to \n     hold accountable those responsible for the atrocities;\n       Whereas in March 1998, President William Jefferson Clinton \n     acknowledged that ``we in the United States and the world \n     community did not do as much as we could have and should have \n     done to try to limit what occurred in Rwanda in 1994'';\n       Whereas in 1999, the Independent Inquiry into the Actions \n     of the United Nations during the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda \n     found that ``the failure by the United Nations to prevent, \n     and subsequently, to stop the genocide in Rwanda was a \n     failure by the United Nations system as a whole'';\n       Whereas the Rwandan genocide and its aftermath played a \n     significant part in the destabilization of the entire Great \n     Lakes region over the last decade; and\n       Whereas today, the vast majority of Rwandan refugees have \n     returned to their country, and the Government of Rwanda is \n     working to address the backlog of genocide-related cases \n     awaiting trial through the formal justice sector and through \n     community-based gacaca courts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) solemnly observes the tenth anniversary of the Rwandan \n     genocide of 1994;\n       (2) recognizes and is saddened by the failure of the \n     international community, including the United States, to \n     prevent the genocide;\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment to the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, done at \n     Paris on December 9, 1948;\n       (4) supports ongoing efforts to educate the people of the \n     United States and of the world about the Rwandan genocide;\n       (5) commits to continuing efforts to strengthen \n     institutions working to bring to justice those responsible \n     for the genocide; and\n       (6) urges the President and the international community to \n     seize on the occasion of this anniversary to focus attention \n     on the future of Rwanda, and to support the people of Rwanda \n     so that they may--\n       (A) be free from the fear of ethnic violence, mob violence, \n     or state-sponsored violence;\n       (B) enjoy full civil and political rights and feel free to \n     voice legitimate disagreements honestly and publicly without \n     fear of violence or intimidation;\n       (C) have confidence in the independence of the judiciary \n     and the rule of law in Rwanda; and\n       (D) experience sustained economic growth and development \n     that improves the standard of living in Rwanda.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncommemorating the 10th anniversary of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Ten \nyears ago, a deliberate, centrally-planned, and organized campaign of \nviolence was set in motion, and eventually it took the lives of some \n800,000 Rwandans. The campaign targeted ethnic Tutsis, but also ethnic \nHutus who espoused moderate political beliefs and paid for their \ncommitment to equal rights for all Rwandans with their lives. Millions \nwere displaced, and the institutions and infrastructure of the country \nwere shattered.\n  As this horror unfolded, the international community, including the \nUnited States, failed to act. The United Nations Mission for Rwanda was \nscaled down when the massacres started rather than being reinforced. \nThe U.S. engaged in semantic strategies of avoidance, referring to \nmassacres and atrocities and finally ``acts of genocide,'' but refusing \nto acknowledge the truth for fear it should make plain our \nresponsibility.\n  If some of the Rwandan voices that will be heard during this time of \ncommemoration and reflection sound angry, well, we have to accept that \ntheir anger is justified. The world had said ``never again'' to \ngenocide. And then we abandoned the people of Rwanda to an unspeakable \nnational nightmare.\n  Today, the people of Rwanda still struggle to cope with the legacy of \nthe genocide, with the trauma of their national experience, and with \nthe search for justice and accountability. And they still struggle with \nfear.\n  The United States can and should insist that those who devised and \nimplemented the plan for genocide be held accountable for their \nactions. Four years ago I was proud to introduce legislation that \nextended the Rewards for Justice program, so that today the U.S. is \nhelping to track down those who have been indicted by the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda and are still at large. In addition, we \ncan and do assist the Government of Rwanda in strengthening its own \ncapacity to address the backlog of genocide-related cases awaiting \ntrial, sometimes through the formal justice system, and sometimes \nthrough the community-based gacaca courts.\n  But today I want to urge my colleagues to seize on this moment not \nonly to reflect on the past, not only to honor the dead, but to think \nabout the future and to care for the living. And the people of Rwanda \ntoday do need assistance. Too many Rwandans live in a context of \ncrushing poverty. Approximately 9 percent of the adult population is \nHIV positive, and life expectancy is about 40 years. There is much \ndevelopment work yet to be done.\n  In Rwanda today, basic human rights are still not guaranteed. The \nmost recent State Department human rights report on Rwanda makes \nreference to ``politically motivated disappearances; arbitrary arrest \nand detention, particularly of opposition supporters.''\n  No one with even a cursory grasp of Rwanda's history could fault the \ngovernment for being sensitive to ethnically divisive forces. But, not \nall dissent is divisive, and history teaches us that imposing order \nalone is not enough to guarantee stability and security. Order without \njustice tends to crumble. Suppressing legitimate disagreements, \nallowing intimidation to silence citizens--these acts undermine \nsecurity rather than enhance it. The people of Rwanda, including the \nleadership of the country, find themselves in a tremendously difficult \nposition. I can imagine, but I cannot know, the challenges of governing \nin the wake of a tragedy of this magnitude. But I do know that those of \nus in the international community only compound our past mistakes when \nwe do not interest ourselves in the future of the Rwandan people today, \nwhen we do not concern ourselves with freeing the next generation from \nfear.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution of solemn \ncommemoration. It acknowledges the terrible past, but it also expresses \nhope for the future. The people of Rwanda have picked themselves up and \nhave set about rebuilding their lives and their country. The world \nfailed them ten years ago. Let us resolve not to fail them again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/06/senate-section/article/S3796-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3796-S3797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3016.
