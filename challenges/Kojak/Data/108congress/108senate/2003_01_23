It is hoped we will be able to complete action on \nthis bill at a reasonable time today.\n  I thank the Democratic leader and whip for their assistance in \nreaching short time agreements on the amendments that were offered \nyesterday. We made tremendous progress over the last 36 hours. I thank \nall Members of this body for their cooperation in coming to the Chamber \nto offer their amendments and limiting their remarks. A great deal of \nprogress was made yesterday, and if we are able to continue that good \nwork over the course of today, I believe we will finish this bill and \ncomplete these 11 appropriations bills sometime today.\n  Again, I announce to my colleagues if we complete this bill today, \nthere will be no session of the Senate on Friday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the direction of the Democratic \nleader, we have been able to move a lot of amendments. We also have \nabout six amendments left on this side at this stage, or maybe a couple \nof others may pop up, but that is what we have. The managers of the \nbill are going to try to move a bunch of amendments shortly. I think we \nhave an opportunity to finish this bill some time early this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1373-6", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I wish to use a few \nmoments of morning business to talk about and describe two amendments I \nhave proposed to the pending legislation. I hope these are amendments \nthat can be unanimously agreed to by all Senators. They seem to me to \nmake eminent sense and, clearly, are in the best interest of our \ncountry and the people we represent.\n  The first amendment I wish to speak about is amendment No. 138. This \namendment, which Senator Kennedy is cosponsoring with me, would extend \na critical Federal-State program that assists low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries to pay the health premiums under the Medicare Program. It \nuses the Medicaid Program to do that. It is a program that was enacted \nin 1997. It was slated to be reauthorized at the end of 2002, but, of \ncourse, Congress did not enact either Medicaid or Medicare legislation \nin the 107th Congress. The program was extended by the continuing \nresolutions that we have enacted in the last few months. It was \nextended until March 12 of this year.\n  The amendment I have offered will extend that program through \nSeptember 30 of this year to give us additional time to do a more \ncomplete extension.\n  This program is known as the QI-1 Program. It is the Qualifying \nIndividual Program. It is a program within Medicaid. It is a block \ngrant payment to States to pay the Medicare Part B premium of $58.70 \nper month, and it is a program that will allow States to pay that \npremium for individuals who have incomes of somewhere between $887 a \nmonth and $997 a month, or couples with an income of $1,194 a month up \nto $1,344 a month. This covers Medicare beneficiaries whose income is \nbetween 120 and 135 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  This amounts to a benefit of nearly $700 annually that many older and \ndisabled Americans depend upon to pay for a portion of their health \ncare costs and items such as prescription drugs and supplemental \ncoverage. There are well over 120,000 people nationwide who currently \nrely on the QI-1 Program. These 120,000 people will be hard pressed to \nafford Medicare coverage without this assistance.\n  In short, to prevent the erosion of existing low-income protections, \nCongress needs to extend this 5-year Federal allocation for the QI-1 \nProgram through the remainder of this fiscal year.\n  According to the data of the Kaiser Family Foundation, there are over \n9 million Medicare beneficiaries with incomes between 100 percent of \npoverty and 175 percent of poverty. Although we do not know the exact \nnumber eligible for this particular program of Medicare beneficiaries \nwho are between 120 and 135 percent of poverty, we can estimate there \nare at least 1 million who are eligible for the program. As I have \nindicated, there are 120,000 people currently enrolled.\n\n  In my home State, for example, we have almost 1,000 New Mexicans \nenrolled in the QI-1 Program. Disenrolling these low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries would cost each and every one of them about $700 \nannually. This could have a significant impact not only on their \nfinances but on their health.\n  In a letter from the Medicare Rights Center, they give an example of \na 69-year-old widow with severe arthritis, with hypertension, with high \ncholesterol, in the Nation's Capital. This woman, I refer to as Mrs. B, \ndoes not qualify for Medicaid, yet she cannot afford premiums for a \nMedicare HMO or Medigap plan. This QI-1 Program, which we are seeking \nin this amendment to extend, does cover her Part B premium of over $700 \nper year. If she loses that assistance, she does not know how she can \nmake ends meet. She already struggles to buy food, make the Medicare \ncopayment, and purchase prescription drugs.\n  This is a bipartisan issue. President Bush had included QI-1 \nreauthorization in his fiscal year 2003 budget. Moreover, in his \nconfirmation testimony to be the Commissioner of the FDA, Mark \nMcClellan testified that the administration continues to support \nreauthorization of this program. In addition, QI-1 reauthorization was \nalso included as part of S. 3018, the Beneficiary Access to Care and \nMedicare Equity Act of 2002, which was introduced by my colleagues, \nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley, late last year.\n  During each and every Senate race this past fall, candidates from \nboth sides of the aisle promised our Nation's seniors and disabled \nMedicare beneficiaries improved health coverage with the addition of \nprescription drug coverage. While waiting for that to come about, low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries should not be blindsided by the loss of \ncritically needed premium protection that the QI-1 Program provides.\n  I urge passage of this amendment, when we get to it, for another 6\\1/\n2\\ months. I implore my colleagues to address the issue and to \npermanently extend the program once that issue becomes appropriate to \nconsider.\n  Mr. President, another amendment I have filed, amendment No. 126, is \nan amendment to provide permanent authority to operate the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is the major tool \nthe United States has to deal with the impact of a significant \ndisruption in oil supplies. Releasing oil from the SPR, as it is \nreferred to, in coordination with stock drawdowns with other consuming \nnations pursuant to the international energy agreement, can add more \nsupply to a tight market, can reduce the possibility of price spikes, \nand reduce the possibility of economic havoc as the United States \nexperienced during the Arab oil embargo.\n  We are currently experiencing a disruption in oil supplies from \nVenezuela. We face the possibility of an additional disruption if we \nwind up going to war with Iraq and during the aftermath of any conflict \nin Iraq. In this context, it should be of concern to all Senators that \nthe current authority to draw down oil from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve and to participate in the international energy agreement will \nexpire on September 30 of this year.\n  My amendment incorporates the exact language we agreed to last fall \nbetween House and Senate conferees on H.R. 4, the comprehensive energy \nbill. The amendment permanently authorizes the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. It also requires filling the Reserve to 700 million or its \ncurrent capacity.\n  While I prefer to move this legislation through the Energy Committee, \nI cannot guarantee we would complete our work and get this legislation \nto the President before September 30. Therefore, I believe the prudent \nthing for the Senate to do is to add this language to the omnibus \nappropriations bill and deal with this matter now.\n  Again, I see this as a bipartisan issue, one that the administration \nsupports, one that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support. I \nhope very much this amendment, as well, can be added to the bill \nwithout objection by any Senator.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1374-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1374-S1375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAMINE RELIEF FOR AFRICA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I take a couple of moments to \ninform the Senate what I will be doing later. Yesterday, this freshman \nSenator from Florida brought forth an\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\namendment that was a $600 million emergency famine starvation relief \namendment for sub-saharan Africa. There was a good bit of drama that \noccurred in the well, because the vote was so razor thin in difference. \nThe final vote on a motion to table my amendment was agreed to 48 to \n46. One vote change would have had the vote 47 to 47, and the motion to \ntable my amendment would have failed, which would have given me the \nopportunity to go on and try to pass the amendment.\n  I have spoken to the substance, the reason for this amendment. There \nis not a person in the Senate who has not seen sights of those children \nwith the spindly legs, the distended bellies, the thatched hair, and \nthe soulful eyes. A lot of it is caused by the lack of rain. This has \ngone in cycles.\n  In 1985, I had the privilege of assisting my wife who had put \ntogether the first private group, other than the NGO organizations, \nresponding to the famine in Ethiopia. My wife had raised the money in \nFlorida. I was then a Member of the House of Representatives and had \narranged for this stretch DC8 airplane. We rode the sacks of food into \nAddis Ababa and went into the feeding camps to see that food was \ndistributed. Of course, when you see those starving children, and when \nmy wife had the experience of holding a near lifeless African child in \nher arms, realizing in only a matter of moments that child would \nexpire, it makes an impression. When famine comes back to that part of \nthe land some 17 years later, it is hard to sit still.\n  Although my amendment was defeated yesterday by the razor-thin margin \nof one vote, I am not going to sit still. I am going to offer that \namendment again and, fortunately, am in a parliamentary procedure by \nwhich I can do so because a very similar amendment to the one that was \ndefeated yesterday had been filed by me.\n  For those Senators on the other side of the aisle--and there were \nfour or five yesterday--who have been deeply touched by personal \nexperiences in Africa, having seen that famine and the ravages of it on \nhuman beings, for those five or six on the other side of the aisle, and \na score more who wanted to vote for that amendment, first, I thank you \nprofoundly for your votes. You know, each one of you, who you are. And \nsecond, I want to say that we are going to have another chance. We are \ngoing to have another chance this afternoon.\n  I ask Senators to examine their hearts and see if they don't think \nthat this is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, to help move things along and to notify \nDemocrats as to whose amendment would come, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Democratic amendments--and Senator Stevens may want to \nintersperse these with Republican amendments, and that is his \nprivilege, but I ask unanimous consent that the next Democrat amendment \nbe that of Senator Kennedy, No. 123; Senator Clinton, No. 89; Senator \nBingaman, Nos. 126 and 138, and Senator Cantwell, No. 108.\n  Mr. President, I also would say on each of these our members have \nagreed to time. But until the majority has seen the amendments, I am \nnot going to ask time limits be established, even though we have \nestablished what our people have asked for in the way of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think probably there is no disagreement but at this \ntime there needs to be some more agreement from our leader, so I object \nfor the moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time do the Democrats have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes forty seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, all we are trying to do is move things \nalong. We have a right to have our amendments in the order we want. If \nwe want to move this bill along, as the two leaders want, we cannot \nhave these foolish--I know someone told the Senator to object. I am not \ncalling the Senator foolish--these foolish objections. I know there is \nnothing that can be done because there is an objection that has been \nraised, but it is too bad.\n  Democratic Senators should be aware this is the order we are going to \noffer amendments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, have these \npriorities been established already and agreed to with Mr. Stevens?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I have talked to Senator Stevens. I talked to him this \nmorning in the presence of the majority leader.\n  Mr. BYRD. What the distinguished whip is trying to do is simply to \nlay the prioritization in the Record, so Senators will not have to wait \naround; they will know when their amendments are going to be called up?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely right. We have a number of Senators who have \nbeen waiting since yesterday or the day before to offer amendments. \nThis is done so they are not standing around here waiting, so there is \nsome kind of order in the Chamber rather than people trying to get \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Perhaps, when Senator Stevens is back on the floor, you can \nget that consent. I would hope so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we would like to take the remainder of the \ntime that has been assigned to this side of the aisle to talk about an \namendment that would be before us this morning, the Mikulski amendment, \nwhich has been proposed as an amendment to the bill. It has to do with \nthe implementation of the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act, the \nFAIR Act, which was passed in 1998. It basically requires all Federal \nagencies to itemize jobs that are classified as noninherently \ngovernmental in nature, so there will be an opportunity for competition \nfor those kinds of activities that the private sector, in the cases \nwhere it is appropriate, can be a competitor and can, indeed, do \ngenerally more efficiently than having it continue, as it has, with no \ncompetition.\n  In 2001 the FAIR Act inventory noted over 840,000 Federal jobs that \nare noninherently governmental. Those are jobs that could be done by \ncontract, that could well be done by contract. There should be \nopportunity for that competition to exist.\n  The goal, of course, of the FAIR Act is to spend taxpayers' money as \nefficiently as possible, to ensure the Federal Government is not \nwithout competition with the private sector.\n  I think most of us would like to have as much done in the private \nsector as we reasonably can do. This, obviously, is not all the things \nGovernment does. There are inherently governmental programs, and they \nwill continue to be that. The goal of the FAIR Act is to spend the \ntaxpayers' money as efficiently as possible to ensure the Federal \nGovernment does not compete with the private sector. Wherever that can \nbe, whether it is in contracting, whether it is the kinds of \nthings that could be better done in the private sector, that is what we \nare seeking to do.\n\n  President Bush's Competitive Sourcing Initiative asked the Federal \nagencies to conduct private sector competitions in up to 15 percent of \nthe jobs listed in the FAIR Act inventory. Of course, that is exactly \nwhat needs to be done, to identify these roles and then to have an \nopportunity to put them into the private sector and let the Government \ncompete with the private sector and do it that way. It is a pretty \nbasic sort of philosophy and something which I think most people would \nagree to do.\n  The amendment that has been put forth was to not allow the \nadministration to move forward with their plans. I will later offer a \ncopy of a letter that the President has sent through his \nadministration, saying that they are opposed to this idea, that they \nwant to move forward.\n  The fact is, during the Clinton administration, after the 1998 \npassage of the FAIR Act, there was very little done to implement it. \nNow we have an administration that believes they ought to implement the \nlaw as it exists, and we want to move forward in doing that.\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\n  That is what this is all about. We will be voting on that amendment \nlater today. It has been before the Senate several times. It has failed \nbefore. Hopefully, it will fail again. In fact, it was put on the \nappropriations bill for the Treasury Department last year and then \ntaken off before it became part of this bill. So there has been a \nstrong feeling about that, and that is what we want to pursue.\n  I yield the Senator from Virginia 5 minutes to comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nThomas, for his leadership. I will not repeat his eloquent explanation \nof the FAIR Act. I am rising with him, and hopefully with a majority of \nour colleagues, in opposition to Senator Mikulski's amendment which \nwould prohibit the administration from applying and enforcing efforts \nto get the private sector involved where it is appropriate in various \ngovernmental services.\n  This amendment would weaken the executive branch's ability to manage \nthe Federal Government. It would impede improvement of many of the \nGovernment's significant commercial activities and prevent the \noutsourcing of inherently nongovernmental jobs to the private sector. \nIt really would be one of anti-efficiency.\n  I think the Bush management plan has a relatively modest goal of \ninjecting some competition to the commercial activities performed by \nthe Government. I believe we ought to be encouraging, not impeding, \npublic-private competition reviews. Clearly, the President ought to \nhave the flexibility to best execute governmental functions and to \nenforce important management objectives and goals, specifically in the \narea of competitive sourcing.\n  The fact that they look at potentially competitive areas each year \ndoesn't mean that these jobs will go to the private sector. It only \nmeans that there will be an analysis. It may be that the Government \nfunctions at less cost and with better service and efficiency than the \nprivate sector.\n  They also realize even if the Government continues to perform a \nservice or function that there are better ways of doing it. We will \nneed to be looking at ways of improving, of innovating, of adapting and \nnot just keep doing things the same old way.\n  This amendment is opposed by large and small business enterprises all \nacross the country. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is opposed to this, \nwhose letter I will submit along with my statement.\n  For example, they state the time is now to create a more efficient \nand effective partnership between the public and private sectors and \nnot to enact restrictive policies that limit funding, flexibility, and \nthe decisionmaking process.\n  We also have received letters from the Professional Services Council \nwhich represents 140 different businesses--the CADI, Northrup-Grumman, \nLockheed, Quest, and many others. They point to what we all recognize \nas the truth. Competition is the greatest and the best guarantor of \noptimal performance and efficiency, and the Government's increasing \nreliance on competition has proven essential to achieving both \nmeaningful savings and significant performance improvements.\n  Also, the Northern Virginia Technology Council that represents 1,600 \nmember companies with 180,000 employees in Northern Virginia, is \nopposed to this.\n  The Information Technology Association of America, which represents \n400 corporate technology companies, is opposed to it.\n  In addition, there is a coalition on outsourcing and privatization \nmade up of small, minority, and women-owned businesses, national \nsecurity organizations, experts in technology, community, and taxpayer \ngroups that says do not be fooled by the hype and that urges Congress \nto hold the executive branch responsible for the highest possible level \nof performance and efficiency without placing procedural obstacles in \nthe way of achieving that goal.\n  The Contract Services Association also points out that many of their \nmembers oppose this. Many of their members are small businesses, \nincluding eight A-certified companies, small, disadvantaged businesses, \nand Native American-owned firms. The goal of their Contract Services \nAssociation is to put the private sector to work for the public good. I \nask unanimous consent that all of these letters be submitted as part of \nmy statement.\n  Perhaps as important as all of these job opportunities is the \nrecognition right now that this could have not only negative economic \nramifications, but that it could impact national security as well. \nIndeed, at a time when our Nation is at war, the Federal Government \nmust have the flexibility to contract out for services.\n  For example, look at the Departments of Defense and Homeland \nSecurity. What is going to be most useful for the Department of \nHomeland Security is not where all these boxes are located and who is \nmoved from one place to the other, but the adaptation and the \nutilization of enterprise systems that will allow them to analyze \nvolumes of information, analyze it accurately, and share it within the \ninstitution and also with others.\n  Furthermore, such contracting creates more private sector jobs and \nallows federal agencies to focus on their core missions, instead of \nconcentrating on commercial activities.\n  I think at this point we need to be working for the taxpayers. We \nneed to be increasing security. And we should be embracing advancements \nin technology and have the private sector help where they can help.\n  Therefore, I suggest that no member of this body should support \nlegislation that increases the cost of government for taxpayers while \nlimiting the government's ability to respond to the changing economic \nand security needs of the American people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 2003.\n       To Members of the U.S. Senate: The U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business federation, \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector and region, offers our \n     strong support of H.J. Res. 2--the Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus \n     Appropriations bill. Passage of this measure is critical for \n     continuity of existing domestic spending programs and \n     initiation of funding for new programs for Homeland Security.\n       The U.S. Chamber and the business community applaud the \n     Senate's resolve to wrap up the Fiscal Year 2003 spending \n     bills prior to the upcoming Appropriations Committee's \n     important work on the Fiscal Year 2004 appropriations \n     measures. While separate passage of the 11 remaining \n     individual Fiscal Year 2003 spending bills would be \n     preferable, we support the Senate's determination in creating \n     and moving this $385.9 billion spending package during this \n     compressed time frame. We are troubled that passage of this \n     important appropriations measure could be jeopardized by the \n     addition of several onerous policy riders to this package.\n       The Chamber strongly opposes any efforts to stall needed \n     reform of the new source review (NSR) program. The amendment \n     offered by Senator John Edwards (D-NC) would effectively \n     prohibit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from \n     expending funds to implement recently promulgated changes to \n     the NSR program. This amendment would derail much needed NSR \n     reforms at a time when the courts are reviewing the \n     regulations.\n       The Edwards NSR amendment would disrupt the Clean Air Act \n     permitting process, and stifle economic activity during an \n     economic downturn by making the maintenance and expansion of \n     existing industrial facilities and power plants almost \n     impossible. The new regulations have restored some certainty \n     to the troubled NSR process. Congress should not interfere in \n     the regulatory efforts of two administrations in this way.\n       In addition, we specifically urge you to oppose an \n     amendment offered by Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) that \n     would prohibit the expenditure of funds by executive agencies \n     to establish, apply or enforce any numerical goals, targets \n     or quotas for public-private competitions of commercial \n     functions with Federal agencies. Such language would \n     legislatively weaken any President's authority to manage the \n     Federal government and effect real saving and fundamental \n     improvements. It is directly counter to efforts by the Bush \n     Administration to increase government efficiency through \n     competition between the public and private sectors. It would \n     limit the President's ability to establish goals for \n     outsourcing, and other procurement and acquisition workforce \n     initiatives. Such a prohibition could significantly limit \n     private sector involvement and discourage competition, which \n     has proven to reap significant cost savings and performance \n     enhancements regardless of who wins. The time is now to \n     create more efficient and effective partnerships between the \n     public and private sector, not to enact restrictive policies \n     that\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\n     limit funding or flexibility in the sourcing decision-making \n     process.\n       We also ask you to oppose an amendment sponsored by Senator \n     Mark Dayton that would deny new contracts to subsidiaries of \n     a publicly traded corporation if the corporation is \n     incorporated in certain tax-advantaged foreign countries. By \n     imposing these bans on contracting with domestic subsidiary \n     corporations, Congress is seeking to discourage corporate \n     ``inversions,'' i.e., corporate flight from U.S. tax domicile \n     in order to achieve tax parity with foreign competitors. We \n     believe Congress should be asking why our tax system is \n     causing corporate flight increasingly to occur.\n       Corporations should be free to incorporate where they \n     choose, without the Federal government imposing economic \n     penalties upon their free exercise of prudent business \n     decision-making, and that the U.S. Congress certainly should \n     not favor foreign firms over U.S. firms in the tax code. \n     These contract bans are a poor substitute for needed reform \n     of the U.S. tax code's archaic international provisions which \n     currently put our corporations at a competitive disadvantage \n     internationally and provide great incentive for them to leave \n     this country. We believe that the proper response should be \n     the undertaking of serious and overdue tax reform, such as \n     conversion of the U.S. tax system to one based on \n     territoriality, to active parity.\n       We also urge you to oppose the amendment offered by Senator \n     Tom Harkin (D-IA) and Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) pertaining \n     to cash balance plans. Cash balance plans have become popular \n     among both employers and employees. Because they are a \n     relatively new ``hybrid'' type of plan, until last month, \n     Treasury had not provided clear guidance to plan sponsors \n     about how such plans should be designed. On December 10, \n     2002, after more than three years of study by an interagency \n     task force, the Treasury Department issued proposed cash \n     balance plan regulations.\n       The Harkin/Feingold amendment would prohibit the Treasury \n     Department from finalizing or enforcing this rule. The \n     proposed regulation clarifies how cash balance plans must be \n     designed in order to satisfy existing laws pertaining to age \n     discrimination and pension accruals. While the Chamber has \n     concerns about certain parts of the regulations, which we \n     will be conveying in comments to the Treasury Department, we \n     do not believe the appropriations process is the proper place \n     for enforcing pension laws and regulations.\n       We urge your swift consideration of the Fiscal Year 2003 \n     Omnibus spending measure. In addition we strongly support the \n     concept that spending restraint is a critical component to \n     encouraging economic growth and long-term prosperity. Because \n     of the importance of fully funding our domestic spending \n     priorities, the U.S. Chamber may include votes on or in \n     relation to these issues in our annual How They Voted Ratings \n     for 2003.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten,\n     Executive Vice President, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Professional Services Council,\n\n                                   Arlington, VA, January 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: I write on behalf on the 140 member \n     companies of the Professional Services Council (PSC), the \n     leading national trade association representing the Federal, \n     professional and technical services industry. PSC's companies \n     provide services including information technology, research \n     and development, and high-end consulting to every government \n     agency, and represent a significant portion of the \n     government's technology industrial base.\n       As the Senate considers the remaining FY 2003 \n     appropriations bills, I urge you to remove Section 640 of the \n     Fiscal Year 2003 Treasury Appropriations bill, or any related \n     provision that prohibits the expenditure of funds by \n     executive agencies to establish, apply or enforce any \n     numerical goals, targets or quotas for public-private \n     competitions for commercial functions within agencies.\n       While Congress should hold the Executive Branch responsible \n     for the highest levels of performance and efficiency, it \n     should not place obstacles in the way of achieving that goal. \n     Section 640 prohibits the President from establishing and \n     enforcing important management objectives and goals, \n     specifically in the area of competitive sourcing, which is \n     one key element of his management agenda. It is an \n     inappropriate constraint on executive branch management and \n     on the President's flexibility to best execute governmental \n     functions. Competition is the best guarantor of optimal \n     performance and efficiency, and the government's increasing \n     reliance on competition has proven essential to achieving \n     both meaningful savings and significant performance \n     improvements.\n       Again, on behalf of the member companies of the PSC, and \n     the hundreds of thousands of working Americans who provide \n     support to our government every day, I urge you to remove \n     Section 640 of the Fiscal Year 2003 Treasury Appropriations \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Stan Z. Soloway,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Northern Virginia\n\n\n                                           Technology Council,\n\n                                    Herndon, VA, January 23, 2003.\n     Hon. George Allen,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allen: On behalf of the more than 1,600 member \n     companies of the Northern Virginia Technology Council (NVTC), \n     I urge you to oppose an amendment offered by Senator Barbara \n     Mikulski that would prohibit the expenditure of funds by \n     executive agencies to establish, apply or enforce any \n     numerical goals or targets for public-private competition of \n     commercial functions within federal agencies.\n       During floor action on the FY 2003 Omnibus Appropriations \n     bill, Senator Mikulski intends to offer an amendment (#61) \n     which would prevent President Bush from setting any goals for \n     federal agencies as a way to save taxpayer dollars and make \n     the government more efficient. It is directly counter to \n     efforts by the Bush Administration to increase government \n     efficiency through competition between the public and private \n     sectors. This amendment would significantly limit private \n     sector involvement and discourage competition vital to the \n     technology community.\n       I am concerned that this amendment hinders the flexibility \n     of the President to efficiently manage the Federal \n     government. By prohibiting the President from establishing \n     and enforcing important management goals, specifically in the \n     area of competitive sourcing, this amendment inappropriately \n     hinders private-public competition. Competition creates the \n     best environment for optimal performance and efficiency. The \n     government's increasing reliance on competition has proven \n     beneficial to taxpayers, private industry and the overall \n     economy.\n       Again, on behalf of the more than 1,600 member companies \n     representing over 180,000 employees in Northern Virginia that \n     heavily rely on federal procurement contracts, I urge you to \n     oppose the Mikulski amendment. Our membership includes \n     companies from all sectors of the technology industry \n     including information technology, software, Internet, ISPs, \n     ASPs, telecommunications, bioscience, and aerospace, as well \n     as the service providers that provide vital support and \n     services to the Federal government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Bobbie Kilberg,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Contract Services\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, January 23, 2003.\n     Hon. George Allen,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Allen: On behalf of the members of the Contract \n     Services Association of America (CSA), I urge you to vote \n     against an amendment offered by Senator Barbara Mikulski.\n       This provision would prohibit the expenditures of funds by \n     executive agencies to establish, apply or enforce any \n     numerical goals, targets or quotas for public-private \n     competitions for commercial functions within agencies.\n       I am concerned, however, that the amendment hinders the \n     flexibility of the President to efficiently manage the \n     Federal government. One long-established management tool, \n     used by all Presidents, is to set goals--whether it is for \n     outsourcing targets within the Department of Defense (as \n     established by the Clinton Administration), goals for \n     performance-based services contracting or even small business \n     contracting goals. Indeed, the amendment is directly counter \n     to efforts by the Bush Administration aimed at increasing \n     government efficiency through competition between the public \n     and private sectors.\n       CSA is the premier industry representative for private \n     sector companies that provide a wide array of services to \n     Federal, state, and local governments. CSA members are \n     involved in everything from maintenance contracts at military \n     bases and within civilian agencies to high technology \n     services, such as scientific research and engineering \n     studies. Many of our members are small businesses, including \n     8(a)-certified companies, small disadvantaged businesses, and \n     Native American owned firms. The goal of CSA is to put the \n     private sector to work for the public good.\n       Again, I urge you to vote against the Mikulski amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gary Engebreison,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Information Technology\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                                 January 23, 2003.\n     Hon. George Allen,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allen: On behalf of the Information Technology \n     Association of America, we urge you to oppose an amendment \n     that Senator Barbara Mikulski will be offering today during \n     floor consideration of the Omnibus Appropriations bill. ITAA \n     appreciates your leadership in raising the IT industry's \n     concerns on this restrictive amendment.\n       As you know, this amendment would prohibit agencies from \n     using appropriated funds to establish, apply or enforce any \n     numerical goals aimed at conducting public-private \n     competitions for commercial functions within Federal \n     agencies. President Bush and his Administration would be \n     hampered in their efforts to promote competition and to \n     manage the Federal government. All future Administrations \n     would also face these restrictions. The Mikulski Amendment \n     would also undermine the intent of the new revisions to the \n     OMB Circular A-76, which were recently issued by the Office \n     of Federal Procurement Policy.\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\n       The Information Technology Association of America consists \n     of over 400 corporate members throughout the United States, \n     and a global network of 49 countries' IT associations. ITAA \n     members range from the smallest IT start-ups to the industry \n     leaders in the Internet, software, IT services, ASP, digital \n     content, systems integration, and telecommunications services \n     sectors.\n       Again, we urge you to vote ``No'' on this amendment and \n     thank you for your leadership in opposing this restrictive \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Harris N. Miller,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia who \ncertainly touched on the issues involved.\n  I yield to my friend and colleague, the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment that was offered by my colleague, the Senator from Maryland. \nThis amendment would prohibit the administration from applying or \nenforcing any numerical goals for competitive sourcing within agencies, \nor converting Federal employees doing this work to private sector \ncontractors. This provision would prevent this President and all future \nPresidents from managing Federal agencies for increased cost-\neffectiveness and quality.\n  I want to emphasize that again.\n  It would prevent this President and all future Presidents from \nmanaging Federal agencies for increased cost-effectiveness and quality. \nThat is what we are trying to do. It is good for Government. Congress \npassed the first step, which was the Federal Activities Inventory \nReform Act--the FAIR Act--in 1998. That was the bill that was drafted \nand sponsored and put through the process by my colleague from Wyoming, \nSenator Thomas. It requires all Federal agencies to itemize jobs \nclassified as noninherently governmental in nature. These are positions \nwhich potentially could be from the private sector, lessening the size \nof the Federal Government, and creating more opportunities for our \neconomy through private business.\n  This is a tremendous step we have taken. It is one that recognizes we \npay Government with taxes to operate, and we provide buildings and \nspace for them--and a lot of other things that are kind of hidden \ncosts. We have said the hidden costs ought to be counted in all of \nthis. There ought to be competition with the private sector in all \nareas where it is traditionally done.\n  It seems to me like a pretty basic concept. President Bush's \nCompetitive Sourcing Initiative requires Federal agencies to conduct \npublic-private competition on 15 percent of the jobs listed on the FAIR \nAct inventory--that is, 840,000 jobs in 2001. That is to conduct \npublic-private competition on just 15 percent of these 840,000 jobs \nthat were listed in the inventory as being noninherently governmental \nin nature.\n\n  This amendment would prevent the President from setting and enforcing \nthis reasonable goal. If this amendment passes, one of the losers will \nbe the small business community.\n  I host an annual procurement conference in Wyoming to encourage small \nbusinesses to seek Federal procurement opportunities. Small businesses, \nservices, and products is one of the treasures we will leave in the \nground if this amendment is agreed to. We have a tremendous resource--\nthe small businesses out there--that can provide services in a very \ncompetitive way. We need to make sure they have that opportunity.\n  I was visiting one Federal agency where they were talking about how \nthey were going to check on bills that were coming in for Medicare. \nThey were building their own program to do that. The interesting thing \nis the private sector already had programs that would do thousands more \nprocedures than they were able to program in their first year of \nprogramming. Their agency wasn't designed to program it. But they tried \ndoing it from the ground up.\n  I see that in agency after agency. When I take a look at this \nGovernment Performance Results Program, that is another thing that we \nput on agencies. They are supposed to tell us what they are doing, how \nwe will know when they get it done, and how that relates to the budget. \nCongress needs to enforce that a little bit more to make sure it is \nhappening because it gives us tremendous insight into all of the \nagencies and what their job is and the ways they are infringing on the \nprivate sector at greater expense than what the private sector would \nhave. It is also resulting in some greater efficiencies in Government.\n  A couple of weeks ago, I visited the mint in Philadelphia. Those \npeople are aware of this particular amendment. They are working like \ncrazy to make sure they are the most competitive agency for being able \nto perform that work, and I am certain that they will. It is that kind \nof spirit of American competitiveness that they have at that Government \nagency. They do outstanding work there. I am sure, as a result, that is \nthe way they will continue to handle it.\n  But it is an awareness that agencies have to have. President Bush's \ninitiative encourages Federal agencies to allow private industry--\nincluding small business--to compete for jobs. Everybody wins because \nFederal agencies can concentrate on their real goals and private \nindustry is encouraged at the same time.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment, allow the \nadministration to manage Federal agencies, and give small businesses a \nchance.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator for his comments. Certainly, his \ninterest in small business activities is reflected in his comments on \nthis bill.\n  I think there are a number of reasons why we should oppose this \namendment. The administration opposes such limitations on the \nmanagement agenda. I think all of us in the Government need to push the \nidea of having some vision as to where we are going and look beyond \nnext week but to look to the future as to what we want to do with a \nnumber of activities that could well be in the competitive arena and to \nmake some plans to get those out there.\n  That is basically what the administration is seeking to do. Senior \nadvisers to the President are recommending that he veto any legislation \nthat challenges this management agenda. Certainly we do not want that \nto happen.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes ten seconds remain.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to my friend from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \nrecognizing me.\n  I rise in opposition to the Mikulski amendment to this omnibus \nappropriations bill. Succinctly put, we held a hearing 4 or 5 years ago \non this very particular point. Much of it has been covered in the \ndiscussion and the debate so far, but if we want to have an efficient \nGovernment, we need to allow the private sector to compete.\n  What we need to do as well is make sure this 47-year-old Federal \npolicy--which states ``the government should not be involved in \ncommercial activities''--is complied with and is enforced.\n  The goal of the FAIR Act was to eliminate the Government's direct \ncompetition with the private sector while at the same time providing a \nbetter utilization of taxpayer dollars. This is going both ways: So we \ndo not have direct competition with the private sector, which we should \nnot do, which is against Federal law for us to do, and at the same time \nprovide a better utilization of taxpayer dollars so we concentrate the \nGovernment workers in areas where only the Government can do the work.\n  This seems to me to be good management and good objectives.\n  In 2001, the FAIR Act inventory noted that over 840,000 Federal jobs \nwere noninherently governmental. President Bush's Competitive Sourcing \nInitiative requires Federal agencies to conduct public-private \ncompetition on 15 percent of the jobs listed on the FAIR Act inventory. \nThis seems to be minimal at best.\n  The Mikulski amendment prohibits the President from establishing or \nenforcing goals for competitive sourcing. This is not the direction in \nwhich we should go. In addition, it would severely impede our ability \nto manage the Federal Government. We need that management flexibility \nat this time.\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\nWhere we have budget deficits that are rising, we need to get those \ndown and to use every tool we have at our disposal to be able to keep \nthose budget deficits down as efficiently and effectively as we \npossibly can.\n  This amendment would prevent improving the performance of the \nGovernment's many commercial activities. We certainly do not need to do \nthat. The amendment goes against the congressionally mandated findings \nof the Commercial Activities Panel which unanimously adopted the \nprinciple of competition.\n  Competition has been good in this country.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 200\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nFeingold amendment. The Feingold amendment, as my colleagues probably \nknow, deals with Indonesia and makes not too subtle suggestions about \nevil doings and suggests that we can only work with them in certain \ncircumstances. As one who has traveled frequently to that region, I am \nvery much disturbed by the intent and the apparent direction of this \namendment.\n  It is very clear to the Government of Indonesia and its people that \nthere is a legitimate terrorism threat in that country today. The \ntragic bombing in Bali, a major international tourist destination and \nthe source of essential revenue in the country, brought the reality of \nterrorism squarely on the heads of the Indonesian Government. This is a \ncountry which, if superimposed geographically on the United States, \nwould extend from San Francisco to Bermuda. It is the fourth largest \ncountry in the world, with the largest Muslim population in the world. \nIt is also, unfortunately, home to many elements of al-Qaida and Jamaah \nIslamiyah, another Islamic terrorist group.\n  The tragic bombing in Bali, with almost 300 people killed, has \nbrought home to that country the real threat of terrorism, and they are \ntaking that threat seriously.\n  I have talked with our resources in the area, our embassies. I have \ntalked with neighboring countries that are very much concerned about \nthe future of Indonesia. We believe they are performing a credible and \nthorough investigation of the bombing. Arrests have been made. But the \ninvestigation continues and the Government is committed to arresting \nall those involved.\n\n  Indonesia is a majority Muslim nation. Many of its citizens, \nregrettably, hear continually from extreme elements within the country \nthat the United States is targeting Muslims and is anti-Islam. This \ncreates a very difficult political climate for the country's moderate \nMuslim President. She is one who has visited this country. I have met \nwith her on a number of occasions, and I know she understands the \nimportance of our relationship and the importance of their efforts \nagainst terrorism.\n  The country is making an effort now to investigate the terrorists who \ncommitted the bombing, to control the terrorism problem, and to \nstrengthen the military.\n  I ask, Is this the best we can offer in the Senate to encourage \ncooperation between the two countries, to pursue a warmed-over agenda, \nto embarrass the military because some activist groups are not \nsatisfied with the results of the tribunals that investigated the \noutrages in East Timor?\n  This is a time when we in the United States have to be serious about \nour relationship with moderate Muslim nations. We need to support the \npeople within these countries who are resisting the extremists. It is a \ntremendous challenge for them to stand up to extreme voices. We should \nbe supportive. We ought not to be sticking a finger in their eye. We \nought not to be gratuitously slapping them in the face.\n  In the case of Indonesia, we should encourage strengthening those \ninstitutions which the Government will rely on to investigate \nterrorism, apprehend terrorists, and prevent further attacks. In \nIndonesia, the only institution with that capacity is the military.\n  I have talked with our Secretary of State and our Secretary of \nDefense, and I have asked them what we can do to improve our relations \nwith Indonesia to assure they have the strength to resist terrorism and \nto provide their share of the role in the international battle against \nterrorism.\n  What they have said, quite frankly, to bipartisan groups in front of \nthem is to stop congressional interference and slurs on the Indonesia \nmilitary. Unfortunately, rather than moving in a sensible direction to \nencourage military-to-military contact, to take actions to raise the \nstandards of their military to levels we are comfortable with and to \npromote relationships between officers, we would, by adopting this \nmeasure, pursue a course that insults the people, strains relations, \nand will aid the extremist elements in their efforts to demonize the \nUnited States.\n  This may be presented as a harmless amendment, one that can be \nsatisfied easily by us and the Indonesians, but those people are our \nfriends. Our allies in Southeast Asia take note of what we do; they \nhear our message. What we pass is loud, and it is clear; it resonates. \nIt is not only a bad idea, it is dangerous.\n  We need to stand up and support our friends, especially in these \nchallenging times. As I have met with friendly nations in Southeast \nAsia, they have been dumbfounded that we continue to insult, denigrate, \nand downgrade Indonesia. We should be supporting them.\n  This amendment is not grounded in legitimate policy concerns but, \nrather, in an ongoing interest by some to refight the East Timor battle \nyear in and year out, despite the fact that East Timor is now an \nindependent country. It is hollow all the way through.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in defeating this amendment, to \nsend the message that we will support moderate Islam countries, \nstruggling democracies trying to fight terrorism.\n  I thank the managers and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in the interest of fairness, although I \ndo agree with my friend from Missouri, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsponsor of the amendment, Senator Feingold, have 5 minutes when he \nappears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I see Senator Feingold is on the floor. I did make \narrangements for Senator Feingold to have an extra 5 minutes, and I \ncall that to his attention. Senator Bond has just spoken on the \nFeingold amendment. There are 5 minutes for Senator Feingold to speak, \nif he wishes to do so.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have conferred with the manager of the \nbill on what the Democrats would like to do in offering their \namendments. I understand there will be Republican amendments \ninterspersed. Our first amendment with Senator Kennedy, there has been \na 30-minute time agreement on that; that has been agreed to. I ask \nunanimous consent that that be approved. Senator Clinton, amendment No. \n89, a time agreement of 30 minutes, evenly divided; Senator Bingaman, \namendment No. 138, I have no time agreement on that; Senator Cantwell, \namendment No. 108, a 30-minute time agreement; Senator Nelson, \namendment No. 178, a 10-minute time agreement equally divided; Senator \nCorzine, amendment No. 233, I have no time agreement on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I agree we \nshould set this order. We are still working on it. We hope we will have \na chance to have an amendment on one side and then the other. I will \ncome later and try to intersperse these with amendments from our side \nof the aisle when they are identified.\n  Mr. REID. The only thing I would ask, Mr. President, is that there \nwould be no amendments except as I have already talked about to the \nmanager of the bill. The Nelson amendment----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will have to reserve, I think, on one \nor more of those. There may be a second-degree amendment. I don't have \nany problem with the order, but I will come back.\n  Mr. REID. Then eliminate the time on the amendment. I ask that the--\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is fair. We will set the order and agree on the \ntime; and if there is an amendment, if there is any identified, at the \npresent time, Senators are willing to set the order with that \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. REID. Should we eliminate the time though?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we have the time applicable unless you decide to \noffer a second-degree.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well, I don't have any problem with that. But I do \nwant to reserve the right to schedule amendments from this side in \nbetween if Senators wish to offer amendments in this period of time.\n  Mr. REID. I did mention that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. For the information of Senators, as I indicated last \nevening, we will have a series of amendments that we will offer in \nsmall groupings very soon. I believe we will have some amendments \nidentified on our side of the aisle as soon as this first vote will \nbegin. It is my understanding that the vote on Senator Feingold's \namendment will commence at 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Senator ready to start now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. My understanding is that I am to be allotted 5 minutes \nin response to Senator Bond's comments on my amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That was my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair and I thank the managers for their \nfairness in light of the fact that we were going to have a minute on \neach side. I appreciate the understanding that I do want to respond to \nSenator Bond's remarks.\n  Senator Bond apparently has not actually read what my amendment does \nwith regard to the Indonesian military and the IMET Program. Obviously, \nthere is a terrorism threat in Indonesia today, as Senator Bond \nindicated. That is one of the conditions this amendment is all about. \nIt is about making sure that Indonesia cooperates with us in fighting \nterrorist attacks, such as the ones that were so awfully perpetrated on \nthe people in Bali.\n  What is even more troubling about Senator Bond's remarks is that he \ndoesn't even mention the fact that apparently the Indonesian military \nwas involved in an incident in Papua which killed American citizens.\n  Are we only going to be upset when American citizens are killed in \nYemen and Kuwait or are we going to respond and expect standards of \nhelp and behavior from countries when our citizens are killed in a \nplace such as Indonesia?\n  All this amendment does is try to make sure, as we continue our \nrelationship with Indonesia--yes, a fledgling democracy--that we \nactually have accountability of that Indonesian military with which we \nwould be involved. I am very troubled when we see the failure of \ncooperation with the FBI's reasonable request to deal with this awful \nmurder of our citizens. We need a message to be sent clearly to the \nIndonesian Government, and in particular to the Indonesian military, \nthat as the FBI returns to try to do this investigation again, we will \nget cooperation.\n  The whole point here is not that we are trying to cut off military \nhelp and assistance; it is that there have to be two preconditions to \nmake sure it is a legitimate enterprise in which to be involved. One is \nthat the Indonesian Government and military has to help us in dealing \nwith terrorism; secondly, they need to help us get to the bottom of \nthis awful massacre that occurred.\n  If Senators don't believe me, I refer them to the letter of Patricia \nLynn Spier of Colorado, whose husband was brutally murdered in this \nincident. Ask her and the other families whether they think it is \nappropriate for the Indonesian military to investigate itself with \nregard to this incident or whether they should cooperate with the FBI.\n  Despite the attempt to distort what this amendment is about, my \namendment is simple. Until the President determines that Indonesia is \ncommitted to fighting terrorism and committed to cooperating and \ninvestigating the murder of American citizens, my amendment would deny \nIndonesia access to IMET, though it would--I emphasize this to the \nSenator from Missouri--permit access to expanded IMET courses that are \nrelevant to military reforms. So, yes, we want to promote a good \nrelationship with the military in Indonesia, if these preconditions are \nmet. We are going to continue counter-terrorism training, expanded IMET \nsales of nonlethal defense articles, officer visits, educational \nexchanges, and port visits. We are not cutting off these items.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have the floor, Mr. President.\n  Let's be clear, because the Senator from Missouri did not mention \nthis. Last August, two Americans were killed and eight were wounded in \nan ambush in West Papua, Indonesia. Indonesia's police investigated, \nand their report concluded that the Indonesian military was very likely \nresponsible for the deaths of these Americans. When the investigation \nwas turned over to the Indonesian military, it exonerated itself and it \nfailed to fully cooperate not only with the Indonesian authorities but \nwith our own FBI.\n  Some may say this amendment cuts off ties to the Indonesian military\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\nwhen we need a strong coalition to fight terrorism. But nothing in my \namendment will prohibit important national security programs, including \ncounterterrorism training. Why would we hesitate? Why would we hesitate \nto condition one element--only one element--of our relationship with \nthe Indonesian military on a demand that we simply get to the bottom of \nthis incident? Real partners in the fight against terrorism do not \nmurder American citizens and do not conspire to cover up such murders.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 24 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am not speaking on the time on this side. \nI ask my colleague from Wisconsin if he has visited the area, if he has \ntalked with our officials in the region, if he has talked with the \npeople in governments who support us and who support Indonesia. Has he \nhad the opportunity to find out what the impact of this amendment would \nbe?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have had daily contact with a wide variety of \nindividuals we are concerned with, including some the Senator \nmentioned. I have been involved in this issue of Indonesia and East \nTimor for 10 years, since I have been a Member of the Senate and a \nmember of the Subcommittee on Asia. I think I have a right to speak on \nthis as much as the Senator from Missouri. When it comes to the deaths \nof American citizens, they should be cooperating with the FBI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is exactly the wrong time to be \ntaking away IMET from the Indonesian military. For 10 years they were \nprohibited from having the kind of military-to-military relationship \nwith us that helps upgrade their military and teach them about human \nrights and to do the right thing regarding their own people. It took a \nlong time to get IMET restored, and the leader of that effort was \nSenator Inouye of Hawaii--that bipartisan effort to get IMET restored. \nNow we would take a step in the wrong direction.\n  (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I want to convey to my colleagues \nmy opposition to this amendment. During the markup of the foreign \noperations bill by the full Appropriations Committee, I offered an \namendment to restore full International Military Education and Training \nto Indonesia. I believe full participation in this important program is \nessential to maintain our partnership with Indonesia in our global \nfight against terrorism. The restriction on the participation of \nIndonesia proposed by my colleague from Wisconsin will harm our \nrelationship and impede our fight against terrorism in one of the \nfront-line countries of this fight. I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. The Feingold amendment will send a message to the \nIndonesians that although we ask for their cooperation in our fight \nagainst international terrorism, we will not provide them with the \ntraining and tools necessary for that fight and view their country as \nnot worthy of full participation in our international assistance \nprograms. I do not believe this is the message we want to send to one \nof our critical allies. It is in our national interest to have a stable \nand democratic Indonesia and that their military is accountable and \nprofessional. We can work toward these goals through the participation \nof Indonesia's military in our IMET program.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues to oppose the pending amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of the statement I made when I \noffered my amendment before the Appropriations Committee be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The statement follows.\n\n       Introduction of the Amendment to Restore IMET to Indonesia\n\n       Mr. Chairman, together with my colleagues the senior \n     Senators from Alaska, Kentucky, and Missouri, I offer an \n     amendment to restore full International Military Education \n     and Training (IMET) program participation to Indonesia.\n       In April, Senators Stevens and I traveled to Asia. We \n     visited Indonesia where they had just brought into custody a \n     Muslim cleric who was quoted as having said, ``Osama bin \n     Laden is a lightweight.'' Indonesia has the world's largest \n     Muslim population and has only recently embraced democratic \n     principles. We must engage and support this fledgling \n     democracy by supporting reform of the military and helping to \n     build capacity to control and support modern, professional \n     armed forces. We believe that full access to IMET programs \n     will foster the necessary changes.\n       We also believe that the continued restriction on IMET \n     program participation of Indonesia sends a message to the \n     Indonesians. It is a message that they are second class \n     international citizens, unworthy of full participation in our \n     international assistance programs. Is this the message we \n     want to send?\n       I appreciate that this bill provides $400,000 for Expanded \n     (IMET (E-IMET) programs in Indonesia. However, the training \n     provided under E-IMER focuses on administration of the armed \n     forces and the dissemination of international human rights \n     information through the use of Mobile Education Teams that \n     are sent in country. The E-IMET program does provide valuable \n     skills in defense resource management and military justice, \n     but Indonesia needs to focus on professionalizing the \n     military. This can only be accomplished through our \n     assistance via the full IMET program.\n       I IMET program training is provided to all levels of the \n     military, from generals to enlisted personnel. This training, \n     much of which is provided in the United States, builds \n     invaluable connections between the United States and foreign \n     nations that provide long-term benefits. The Department of \n     Defense conducts a variety of activities for foreign military \n     and civilian officials. Formal instruction is offered \n     involving more than 2,000 courses taught at approximately 150 \n     military schools and installations. The program is based upon \n     the premise that active promoting of democratic values is one \n     of the most effective means available for achieving U.S. \n     national security and foreign policy objectives and for \n     fostering peaceful relationships among the nations of the \n     world.\n       I understand that Senator Leahy views IMET as a reward and \n     does not believe it should be afforded to the TNI in light of \n     past abuses and failure to achieve the accountability \n     benchmarks set in last year's Foreign Operations \n     Appropriations bill. This is not a reward. IMET is a vehicle \n     to help TNI achieve those benchmarks. Indonesia has made some \n     progress toward meeting the Leahy conditions, but without \n     recognition of and response to what has been accomplished to \n     date, we will only bolster the arguments of those in \n     Indonesia opposed to reform who believe it is worthless to \n     try to please the United States since we are unwilling to \n     recognize their progress.\n       There are few countries in the world with democratic \n     governments where the rule of law is as firmly established as \n     in the United States. That cannot be our litmus test for \n     provision of assistance. Providing the requested assistance \n     to Indonesia would not be an exception to a well-established \n     rule. Our nation assists countries that are obviously not \n     democracies. Why do we do this? Because, it is in our \n     national interest. Were we helping a democracy when we \n     embarked on Operation Dessert Storm and put up our fortune \n     and our most precious resource, the lives of our soldiers? \n     No, we were not, but we were acting in our national interest.\n       It is in our national interest to have a stable and \n     democratic Indonesia. It is in our national interest that \n     Indonesia develops internal capabilities to address \n     international terrorism. It is in our national interest that \n     Indonesia's military is professional and accountable. We can \n     work toward these goals through the participation of \n     Indonesia's military in our IMET program.\n       Please be assured that I do not advocate lifting the \n     prohibition on the participation of Indonesia in the Foreign \n     Military Financing program. I believe a strong professional \n     and accountable TNI must be established before Indonesia's \n     participation in that program is renewed. However, I believe \n     participation in the full IMET program is vital to reaching \n     that goal, and I ask my colleagues to support this \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nabout a deadly attack that occurred last August in West Papua, \nIndonesia, and to call on the Government of Indonesia to cooperate \nfully with U.S. law enforcement authorities to ensure that those \nresponsible are brought to justice.\n  Ted Burgon of Oregon and Rick Spier of Colorado were gunned down \nalong with an Indonesian, Bambang Riwanto. Eight Americans were \ninjured: Nancy Burgon, Saundra Hopkins, Ken Balk, and Taia Hopkins, all \nof Oregon, Patsy Spier of Colorado, Francine Goodfriend of Illinois, \nSteven Emma of Florida, and Lynn Poston, of Washington State.\n  The victims, school teachers from the International School and their\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\nfamilies, were associated with the Freeport-McMoran mine in West Papua.\n  I speak to this issue because the bill before us restores funding for \nInternational Military Education and Training programs for Indonesia. \nBefore we do that, I think we need some answers.\n  Mr. President, there is troubling evidence that members of the \nIndonesian military may have been behind the attack. It occurred less \nthan half a mile from an Indonesian military outpost.\n  Hundreds of rounds were fired at the teachers and their vehicles \nduring the ambush, which lasted 45 minutes, but the military was very \nslow to respond and failed to apprehend any of the assailants.\n  The Indonesian police promptly began an investigation. They collected \nevidence, interviewed witnesses, and reconstructed the ambush. The \nsenior police official in charge said last December that there is \nevidence that soldiers from the army's strategic reserve force were \ninvolved in the shooting. This same senior police official also \nreported last November that a witness to the ambush reported seeing \nmembers of the Indonesian army's special forces participating in the \nattack.\n  The motive? The Army may have hoped to blame the murders on West \nPapuan rebels who have been fighting a low level insurgency for years \nseeking independence from Indonesia.\n  Bottom line: The police report on the murders concludes, quote: \n``there is a strong possibility that the case was perpetrated by \nmembers of the Indonesian National Army Force, however, it still needs \nto be investigated further.''\n  Well, guess what happened? After they pointed the finger at the \nmilitary, the two senior police officials on the case, General Raziman \nand Assistant Senior Police Commissioner Sumarjiyo were mysteriously \ntransferred, removed from all responsibility for investigating the \nmurders.\n  The investigation was handed over to the Indonesian military itself! \nNot surprisingly, the military concluded that the armed forces had \nnothing to do with the killings.\n  Mr. President, this is the same military that denied all culpability \nfor gross violations of human rights over 25 years in East Timor and \nAceh. The same military that has armed, trained, and protected militant \nIslamic groups associated with grotesque, religiously motivated attacks \non innocent civilians elsewhere in Indonesia.\n  Mr. President, it is essential that the United States secure the full \nsupport of Indonesia--a nation of 200 million people, most of them \nMuslims--in the war on terrorism.\n  Indonesia itself has been the target of terrorists, as we witnessed \nlast year in the terrible bombing on Bali that left hundreds dead and \ninjured, many of them Australian tourists.\n  It is appropriate that in the wake of 9/11, the United States has \nsought ways to strengthen our ties to Indonesia, including considering \nthe resumption of normal military training for the Indonesian Army. \nCivilian authorities in Jakarta and some officers within the military \nare trying to end the culture of impunity that has prevailed for the \npast 30 years. I think it is in our national interests to establish \nappropriate links to the Indonesian armed forces to improve their \nprofessionalism, enhance intelligence sharing, and help prevent future \nterrorist attacks in Indonesia or elsewhere.\n  But that does not mean we should turn a blind eye to continuing \nabuses by the Indonesian Army.\n  We will not be doing ourselves or the Indonesian people any favors if \nwe ally ourselves with those who may themselves be responsible for \ncriminal acts.\n  Before we jump to restore IMET funding for Indonesia, I hope that \nPresident Bush will give us his assurance that we are getting the full \ncooperation of Indonesian authorities. The FBI should have full access \nto all the evidence and to the witnesses to the attack. An independent \ninvestigation should be launched of the possible Indonesian military \ninvolvement.\n  These are American citizens we are talking about. Victims, perhaps, \nof a cynical effort to manipulate United States public opinion and \nconvince our government to increase aid to the Indonesian armed forces \nas part of the war on terrorism. We need to get to the bottom of what \nhappened.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom the State Department opposing this amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of State, Assistant Secretary of State \n           for Legislative Affairs,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express concern about \n     the proposed amendment to the FY 03 omnibus appropriation \n     bill by Senator Feingold that restricts IMET to Indonesia. \n     The Department of State opposes this amendment, which would \n     damage important U.S. foreign policy interests in Indonesia.\n       The amendment in question would limit Indonesian military \n     personnel to participation in the Expanded IMET program only, \n     absent a presidential determination ``that the Government of \n     Indonesia and the Indonesian Armed Forces are (1) \n     demonstrating a commitment to assist United States efforts to \n     combat international terrorism, including United States \n     interdiction efforts against al-Qaida and other terrorist \n     organizations, and taking effective measures to bring to \n     justice those responsible for the October 13, 2002 terrorist \n     attack on Bali, which killed U.S. citizens, and (2) taking \n     effective measures, including cooperating with the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation, to bring to justice any member of \n     the Indonesian Armed Forces or Indonesian militia group \n     against whom there is credible evidence of involvement in the \n     August 31, 2002 attack which resulted in the deaths of United \n     States citizens, and in other gross violations of human \n     rights.''\n       We share Senator Feingold's concerns on both points and \n     have been working actively with the Indonesian Government on \n     them. Indonesia is engaged in the war against terrorism--\n     including a new police counter-terrorism unit that we are \n     helping to establish. Indonesia authorities are investigating \n     and prosecuting terrorists, including members of the al-Qaida \n     affiliated Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), while not sacrificing \n     newly-gained democratic freedoms. In the extremely \n     professional Bali bombing investigation, Indonesian National \n     Police investigators have detained over 30 supects to date, \n     and are cooperating with regional ASEAN neighbors to uncover \n     possible links to international terrorism. The Bali \n     investigation process has also seen good cooperation \n     between the Indonesian National Police and counterparts \n     from the Australian Federal Police, the FBI, and Scotland \n     Yard. It is also important to note that the Indonesian \n     Police, not the Indonesian Armed Forces, have the lead \n     responsibility in this and in other terrorist \n     investigations.\n       The killing of American citizens in Papua is a matter of \n     gravest importance to us. The President has directed that we \n     emphasize to the Government of Indonesia that there must be a \n     credible investigation and process of justice to avoid damage \n     to our entire bilateral relationship. We have done so at the \n     highest levels. In response to our repeated demarches, the \n     Indonesian Government has agreed to a new investigation of \n     this crime to include FBI participation. FBI agents will \n     arrive in Indonesia on January 22 to explore the terms of \n     their participation in the investigation.\n       We have requested that $400,000 in FY03 IMET be provided \n     for Indonesia. If approved by Congress, this will be the \n     first time in a decade that we will have the ability to use \n     IMET as a tool to pursue our national objectives in \n     Indonesia. These objectives include strengthening Indonesian \n     cooperation in the war on terrorism, as well as supporting \n     the democratic transition in, and the territorial integrity \n     of, Indonesia. IMET assists these objectives by providing us \n     with access to the Indonesian Armed Forces, which remains \n     among the most prominent national institutions in Indonesia. \n     IMET also provides a vehicle for the United States to impart \n     our ideas about civil-military relations to foreign military \n     audiences, and to promote military reform.\n       We ask that Congress proceed with its consideration of the \n     Administration's IMET request. The goals of the proposed \n     amendment by Senator Feingold are worthy and we share them. \n     But, they are now, and will remain, works in progress for \n     some time to come, not settled issues. In the interim, if \n     Congress approves our request, we will not obligate these \n     IMET funds without further consultation with Congress.\n       We hope that this information assists you in your \n     consideration of this amendment. Please contact us if you \n     have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul V. Kelly,\n                                              Assistant Secretary.\n\n  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, let me sum it up. The Bali bombing \nunderscores that when it come to terrorism, Indonesia is at ground \nzero, right there in the middle of it. They are on our side. This \namendment should be roundly defeated.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, with much reservation, I rise today in \nsupport of the Feingold amendment. On\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\nAugust 31, 2002 several Americans in West Papua--Indonesia were \nbrutally attacked by heavily armed assailants. Two Americans--Rick \nSpier and Ted Burgon--were murdered during the 35 minute ambush and \nmany others were seriously wounded.\n  Last week, I met with Rick Spier's wife, Mrs. Patsy Spier, who was \nalso shot three times during the attack. She described with much \nemotion the circumstances of the attack and the horrific result. I was \nsaddened by her loss and angered by the Indonesian Government's failure \nto bring the perpetrators to justice. Following my meeting with Mrs. \nSpier, I contacted the Department of States and later received a \ndetailed briefing from Deputy Assistant Secretary Matthew Daley. I also \ncontacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and expressed my interest \nin meeting the agents charged with investigation this case upon their \nreturn from Indonesia.\n  Following these meetings, I wrote to President Bush to express my \nstrong views about this matter. I urged the President to press the \nIndonesian Government to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the \nattack. I further wrote that if the Indonesian Government fails to act, \na severe diplomatic response, including the suspension of funding for \nthe International Military Education Training Program for Indonesia, \nshould be considered. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks my letter of January 16 to \nPresident Bush.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is as ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am pleased that Senator Mitch McConnell, Chairman of \nthe Foreign Operations Subcommittee, has included strong report \nlanguage on Indonesia. As I noted in a colloquy with Senator McConnell, \nthe references in the report language to the Americans murdered in West \nPapua and the demands that justice be served for these crimes were \nwarranted and much appreciated.\n  The amendment before us would limit Indonesian military personnel to \nparticipation in the IMET program only, absent a presidential \ndetermination that the Indonesian government and armed forces are \n``demonstrating a commitment to assist United States efforts to combat \ninternational terrorism'' and ``taking effective measures, including \ncooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to bring to \njustice any member of the Indonesian Armed Forces or Indonesian \nmilitia'' whom might be involved in the August 31 killings.\n  I understand that the Department of State opposes this amendment, \nwhich it believes would damage important U.S. foreign policy interest \nin Indonesia. In a letter sent to Senator McConnell, Assistant \nSecretary of State James Kelly wrote:\n\n       . . . the President has directed that we [the Department of \n     State] emphasize to the Government of Indonesia that there \n     must be a credible investigation and process of justice to \n     avoid damage in our entire bilateral relationship.\n\n  He further wrote:\n\n       In response to our repeated demarches, the Indonesian \n     government has agreed to a new investigation of this crime to \n     include FBI participation. FBI agents will arrive in \n     Indonesia on January 22 to explore the terms of their \n     participation in the investigation.\n\n  While I applaud the administration for its involvement in this issue \nand am encouraged by Indonesia Government's agreement to conduct a new \ninvestigation, I strongly believe that the murder of innocent Americans \nis unacceptable and demands serious action on our part. We cannot be \nseen as rewarding the Indonesian government for covering up the killing \nof Americans. Such an action would set a frightful precedent and give \nother nations the impression that the murder of Americans would not \nwarrant a serious response on the part of the United States. Clearly, \nthe IMET funding in this bill sends the wrong signal at the wrong time. \nTherefore, despite serious reservations, I will vote in support of the \nFeingold amendment.\n  Like many of my colleagues here in the Senate, I will continue to \nmonitor this situation very closely, and should the Indonesian \nGovernment conduct a full and fair investigation, I will consider \nsupporting new funding for Indonesia in the future.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2003.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President, the White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: I am writing to express my growing \n     concern about the lagging investigation into the August 31, \n     2002 attack on several Americans in West Papau, Indonesia. \n     Three people were killed, including two Americans, during the \n     attack, and eight others were seriously wounded.\n       As you may know, the Indonesian police completed its \n     preliminary investigation last fall and concluded that the \n     Indonesian military may have been responsible for the attack. \n     Despite being informed of the results of the police \n     investigation, the Indonesian military has failed to look \n     into this matter. In fact, press reports suggest that the \n     Indonesian military may have exonerated itself of any \n     responsibility.\n       I understand that senior officials at the Department of \n     State have expressed the concerns of your Administration \n     about the dogged pace of the investigation to the Indonesian \n     government. Your effort to determine who was responsible for \n     this brutal attack is commendable. However, more must be \n     done.\n       I urge you to press the Indonesian government to conduct a \n     comprehensive investigation into the attack. Such an \n     investigation should include active and meaningful \n     participation by United States law enforcement agencies who \n     should have complete access to evidence and witnesses.\n       The murder of innocent Americans overseas warrants a \n     serious response on our part. If the Indonesian government \n     fails to act, severe diplomatic actions, including the \n     suspension of IMET funding for Indonesia, should be \n     considered. We cannot afford to overlook further delays in \n     this important investigation.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts, and I look forward to \n     your response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Wayne Allard,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 200.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 39\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the next amendment in order is Senator \nMurray's amendment. There is a minute on each side, if the Senator \nwishes to use it. I wish to state now we will accept this amendment and \nit will be included in the across-the-board cut as an offset. Because \nof an amendment that was adopted yesterday, we now have leeway in that \nceiling that we self-imposed, and we can take the amendment of the \nSenator from Washington. I believe her amendment has the approval of \nthe House also. Many of us want to vote for it. We are prepared to \naccept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there debate?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let her offer it, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska, and \nSenators Frist and Gregg and others who worked with us on the Community \nAccess Program.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand the Senator from Rhode Island has a \ncolloquy?\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I announce there will be no votes for a little while \nnow. We have worked out we will have another series in a few minutes. \nRight now we would like to have the colloquy out of the way.\n  I urge we adopt the Murray amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Murray for her strong \nleadership in restoring funds for the Healthy Communities Access \nProgram to improve the delivery of care to the uninsured. The program \nprovides grants to coalitions of health providers to improve the \ncoordination of care for the uninsured. Since its inception, we have \nseen an overwhelmingly positive response to the program. Through these \ngrants, 150 communities have been able to increase care for the \nuninsured, reduce unnecessary health costs, and create innovative \nprojects through collaboration and information-sharing. In \nMassachusetts, the Cambridge Health Alliance used its grant to launch \nan impressive outreach campaign to enroll 57,000 uninsured residents in \na comprehensive and well-coordinated system of care. The Alliance has \nformed strong partnerships with local schools, law enforcement, and \nadvocacy groups who work together to meet the needs of the most \nvulnerable members of the community.\n  The Healthy Communities Access Program embodies exactly the kind of \ninnovative approach to improving the quality of health care that we \nneed. Yet, despite its successes, the administration wants to zero out \nthe program and the Omnibus Bill eliminates its funding. We should not \nallow the gains made in communities across the country to be lost \nbecause of this shortsightedness. I urge the Senate to approve this \namendment and support our communities in this effective way to improve \ncare for the uninsured.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 39) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I inquire how much time the Senator from Rhode Island \nand the Senator from West Virginia wish for their colloquy?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I believe it would be about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Ten minutes total?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. We don't need that much.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Rhode Island \nand the Senator from West Virginia be recognized for not to exceed 10 \nminutes total.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                                 S-CHIP\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have been working for the last several \nmonths with a bipartisan group of Members from the House and Senate to \nprotect funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, also \nknown as S-CHIP, which provides critical health care to millions of \nchildren. In Rhode Island, over 12,000 children participate in this \nprogram. There is strong, bipartisan support for a 2-year S-CHIP \nproposal developed last fall that would preserve $2.7 billion in \nFederal S-CHIP funds that either expired at the end of fiscal year 2002 \nor will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. Our proposal also \nestablishes a redistribution formula for the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services to use to quickly redistribute unspent fiscal year \n2000 funds to those states that have exhausted their allotments and \nneed additional funds.\n  Under Federal law, CMS is required to redistribute all unspent 2000 \nfunds this year, but there is no Federal requirement on what formula it \nshould use. CMS is currently holding off redistributing unspent 2000 \nfunds because it is awaiting Congressional action. However, a few \nStates, including Rhode Island, need the redistribution of 2000 funds \nas soon as possible so they have sufficient funds for the rest of the \nyear to maintain services to the children currently enrolled in S-CHIP.\n  This S-CHIP issue is very time-sensitive. If we do not remedy this \nsituation soon, some States may scale back S-CHIP eligibility because \nthey will assume they will have far less in Federal funds available \nthan previously expected.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that we cannot address this issue in the \nomnibus appropriations bill. I appreciate the willingness of the \nchairman of the Finance and budget Committees, Senators Grassley and \nNickles, to work with us to address this issue in both the fiscal year \n2004 budget resolution and then to move this legislation quickly in the \nFinance Committee.\n  I also think it is imperative for us to work with CMS so that they \ncan move forward to begin to redistribute some of the unspent 2000 \nfunds to States like mine that are facing a serious S-CHIP funding \nproblem. As Congress moves ahead to complete action on this proposal, \nCMS should move forward on the immediate redistribution of these funds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a moment? Does the Senator \nhave the time?\n  I want to commend my friend from Rhode Island. As one of the authors \nof the S-CHIP Program, we gave the States an opportunity to use the \nmoney and then we provided, if they did not use the money, that States \nthat were attempting to cover the children would have some access to it \nand then eventually it would go back to the Treasury.\n  We are finding out now that there are a number of States that are \nprepared to go ahead and insure these children. This program is so \nenormously important, because if you put it with the Medicaid Program, \nthere is no real reason why any child in America isn't covered with \nsome form of health insurance.\n  I commend the Senator from Rhode Island. This program was agreed to \nand accepted in a strong bipartisan way. As author, along with my \nfriend from Utah, Senator Hatch, if we had just not provided this \nprovision and let the States have a little more time to implement it, \nwe would have a lot more children covered. This makes a great\n\n[[Page S1385]]\n\ndeal of sense. It is focused and it is a successful program. The point \nthe Senator from Rhode Island makes is that it will ensure that \nhundreds of thousands of more children will be protected with health \ninsurance.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, following on what the Senator from \nRhode Island said, it is extremely important that we get it done \nimmediately. This is a two-part problem. One is the $1.5 billion \nshortfall in this fiscal year, and the $1.6 billion in the second \nfiscal year. The States have the money. Since we did not put the \nprogram under Medicaid at the very beginning, States started at various \nrates. Some were faster than others. Therefore, not all the money has \nbeen used. Rather than return it to the Treasury where it can't help \nany child at all--we still have 8 million, or 10 million, or 12 million \nchildren who need to be insured. We need to do the short-term fix, \nwhich is what this colloquy is about. Then we need to get to a longer \nterm fix in the Finance Committee. I look forward to working with \nChairman Grassley and Chairman Baucus to mark up a bill which will \naccomplish this objective on an annual basis, and then, of course, move \non to the next logical step, which is to include the parent or parents \nof those same children.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to join in the colloquy \nthat has just been held because it comes under the jurisdiction--or at \nleast some of it--of the committee that I chair.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention to this important \nchildren's health care policy. They are correct that something must be \ndone to address the funds that have and will revert to the treasury in \nthe near future. They are also correct to note the constraints within \nthe omnibus bill. I strongly support the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program. It is a program that provides heath care for over \n16,000 low-income children in my state.\n  Senators Chafee, Snowe, and Rockefeller are looking to address a \nnecessary maintenance issue within S-CHIP. As Senator Snowe noted, I \nworked very closely with Senator Baucus, Senator Chafee, Senator \nRockefeller, Chairman Tauzin, and Representative Dingell on a \nbipartisan, bicameral proposal that would have addressed expired S-CHIP \nfunds.\n  The proposal reflected a balanced approach to redistributing S-CHIP \nfunding taking into account that some states are spending through their \nexisting allotments and other states are ramping up their programs and \nwill need additional funding in the years to come.\n  This proposal did not pass the Senate last year, but it is a fair \napproach to redistributing S-CHIP funds. Unfortunately, I can not \nsupport including this policy at this time. The omnibus bill is a poor \nvehicle for this necessary maintenance.\n  I am sympathetic to the intent of this policy, although this is \nneither the time nor the place to address this issue. The Senate and \nthe House have an agreement with the Administration to keep the omnibus \nappropriation bill under $750 billion. The S-CHIP policy costs over \n$1.2 billion in budget authority in 2003. An amendment of this nature \nwould break that agreement and that is simply not acceptable. I \nappreciate Senator Snowe's, Chafee's and Rockefeller's willingness to \naccept this reality.\n  I assure my colleagues that I will work with them in the near future \nto update the S-CHIP redistribution policy in the near future as \nchairman of the Finance Committee. It my understanding that Senator \nNickles, the chairman of the Budget Committee, is also interested in a \nregular order approach and that he is interested in putting money aside \nin the budget to address the needs of S-CHIP.\n  With this in mind, I believe the most appropriate way to address this \nissue is to work with the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nNickles, to secure sufficient funding for this bipartisan S-CHIP \nproposal and then to address it in the Finance Committee. I will also \ncontinue my work with Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Tauzin, so \nthe Senate and the House can move forward in a coordinated fashion.\n  I assure my colleagues that I will work with them once the budget \nresolution for fiscal year 2004 has been adopted to move legislation \nquickly through the Finance Committee that reflects a bipartisan, \nbicameral two-year agreement on S-CHIP.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. I will work with him. I tell the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, if these amendments had come up, we would \nhave had problems. There were about three S-CHIP amendments. We will \nnot do the amendments on the appropriations bill. We will work to try \nto make it possible to do them through the Budget Committee. If we did \npass one, it would go over to the House, and the House--which did pass \na budget, and they have exceeded their authorization--they would stop \nit. I think this is the best way to work. When we pass a new budget \nresolution, we will supersede last year's budget resolution. We will be \nable to do this in regular order through the Finance Committee.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman, and also Senator Snowe, \nSenator Collins, Senator Rockefeller, and others who have strong \ninterests in trying to make sure these unexpended funds that are set \naside for S-CHIP can be appropriately used.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program and to thank my colleagues for \ntheir willingness to work with me on restoring funding to this program \nthat is essential to ensuring continued health care coverage for \nAmerica's children.\n  For the past week, I have worked with my colleagues to secure this \nagreement that will restore $2.7 billion in expired, or soon to expire, \nSCHIP funding. This compromise, that has been endorsed by our Nation's \nGovernors, would ensure that this funding remains in the program and \ncontinues to provide children with access to the care that is vital to \ntheir healthy development.\n  I appreciate the willingness of Majority Leader Frist, Finance \nCommittee Chairman Grassley and Budget Committee Chairman Nickles to \nwork with us in developing this agreement. Because of their commitment \nto finding a solution, we are able to move forward with this important \npolicy.\n  I believe this agreement is the most appropriate way to restore the \nSCHIP funding. Because the budget resolution adopted by the House of \nRepresentatives does not include adequate budget authority to restore \nthis funding, the floor amendment that I filed to the omnibus \nappropriations bill would be subject to a budget point of order in the \nHouse. Given the that this point of order would lie against the \nprovision, the likelihood that the House would strip this during \nconference is great. In light of these circumstances, I believe that \nthis agreement is the most appropriate way to ensure that this funding \nis restored.\n  The agreement that was struck would, in exchange for withdrawing the \namendments that my colleagues and I filed to the omnibus appropriations \nbill to restore SCHIP funding--provide the support of the majority \nleader and Chairman Grassley and Nickles to make necessary changes that \nwill remove the budget hurdles that have prevented this legislation \nfrom being enacted.\n  Specifically, Senator Nickles has provided his commitment to \nreallocate through the fiscal year 2004 budget process additional \nbudget authority for SCHIP in fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004. \nSenator Nickles, I am confident that under your leadership, the budget \nprocess will move smoothly and expeditiously and that we will be able \nto speed the adoption of this proposal in both the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Further, Chairman Grassley has agreed to move this policy through his \ncommittee as soon as the necessary changes are made to the budget \nallocations. Again, under his strong leadership, I am confident that we \nwill get this done.\n  Finally, Majority Leader Frist has agreed to place the legislation on \nthe\n\n[[Page S1386]]\n\nSenate calender as soon as it is reported from the Finance Committee.\n  I might add that while I am aware that this agreement was forged in \nthe Senate, the underlying policy proposal was developed through a \nbipartisan, bicameral process led by Senators Grassley and Baucus last \nfall. I hope that the House of Representatives will work with us to \nmake the necessary changes to the fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 \nbudget allocations and to see this vital policy enacted in a timely \nmanner.\n  Since 1997, States have made historic progress in their effort to \ninsure low-income children under SCHIP. In fact, the National Center \nfor Health Statistics just released data this month showing that the \npercentage of children 17 years of age and younger with health \ninsurance has increased from 86.1 percent in 1997 to 91.2 percent \nduring the first half of 2002. During this same period of time, \nstatistics show the percentage of children insured by government \nprograms, such as SCHIP, also increased to 27.2 percent. While these \nstatistics are encouraging, a great deal of work remains if we are to \naddress the critical issues of affordability and accessibility of \nhealth insurance, especially as they relate to health care for our \nchildren.\n  These compelling statistics reinforce the necessity that Congress \nmust act to restore the expiring SCHIP funds. If we delay, we could \njeopardize the substantial progress that has been made since 1997 in \nincreasing the number of insured children in America. It is estimated \nthat without restoration of this funding, almost one million children \ncould lose health insurance coverage.\n  How it works it this, once passed, the policy would restore $2.7 \nbillion in SCHIP funding that has either reverted to the Treasury or is \nscheduled to revert to HHS for redistribution. On October 1, 2002, $1.2 \nbillion reverted to the Treasury in unspent SCHIP funding from 1998 and \n1999. If we do not recapture this funding, it will be lost to the \nprogram. Our agreement allows the States to reclaim this unspent money \nand provides until the end of fiscal year 2004 to spend it on health \ninsurance provided by SCHIP.\n  It also strikes a compromise between States that have spent all of \ntheir 2000 and 2001 allotments, and those that have not, by dividing \nthe funding evenly between them. Those States that have not spent all \nof their allocations would be able to retain half of their funding, \nwhile the remaining States would receive additional allotments from the \nredistributed funding.\n  It also rewards those States that used Medicaid to expand access to \nhealth care for low-income children prior to the creation of SCHIP, by \nallowing them to access some of their SCHIP funding to serve this \npopulation. This compromise has the endorsement of the National \nGovernors Association and children's health advocates from across the \ncountry.\n  In my home State of Maine, this proposal would allow the State to \nkeep $13.4 million in SCHIP funding and would provide until the end of \nfiscal year 2004 to spent, I do not know about your State, but in Maine \n$13.24 million will help provide health care assistance to a lot of \nchildren, children who otherwise would not have access to \nimmunizations, well-baby visits and yearly check-ups.\n  While my colleagues and I have agreed to forgo the appropriations \nprocess as the vehicle to move this package, we certainly have not \nabandoned our effort to restore the funding. If fact, we are more \ncommitted then ever to seeing the SCHIP funding restored and have added \nthe support of the majority leader and chairs of the Finance and Budget \nCommittees. Adding their endorsement to this effort, which already has \ngarnered strong bipartisan support, will help to speed its passage.\n  In closing, I wish to highlight a quote from Secretary Thompson when \nhis agency released the positive new data I referenced earlier \nregarding the level of health insurance for children in our country. He \nsaid:\n\n       More and more children are getting the health care they \n     need, thanks in large measure to our success in working with \n     states to expand health coverage through the SCHIP program. \n     We are giving governors the flexibility they need to continue \n     to expand coverage to more children, and our strategy is \n     paying off for children and parents alike.\n\n  This strong endorsement of SCHIP should act as an impetus to getting \nthis policy enacted and ensuring that we do so in a timely fashion. \nAgain, I appreciate the support of my colleagues and look forward to \nworking with you as we move forward to enact this policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \nthe Kennedy amendment be 30 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 123.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase funding for reducing health disparities and \n                       promoting minority health)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) In General.--In addition to amounts \n     otherwise appropriated in this Act, there are appropriated \n     $584,646,000, of which--\n       (1) $43,492,000 shall be made available to the National \n     Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities;\n       (2) $21,015,000 shall be made available to the Office of \n     Minority Health of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services;\n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\n       (3) $15,334,000 shall be made available to the Office for \n     Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     for discrimination-related enforcement and allocated to \n     enforcement actions and the investigation of complaints and \n     potential violations of law relating to discrimination and \n     racial disparities in health care;\n       (4) $491,500,000 shall be made available to the Department \n     of Health and Human Services for research and activities \n     under the Minority HIV/AIDS initiative; and\n       (5) $13,305,000 shall be made available to the Health \n     Resources and Services Administration for Health Professions \n     Training for Diversity programs.\n       (b) Office of Minority Health.--The amount appropriated \n     under subsection (a)(2), shall be made available to the \n     Office of Minority Health of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services to be used for activities including--\n       (1) to undertake, through and in collaboration with the \n     Public Health Service agencies, a coordinated Federal \n     initiative to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health, \n     particularly in the six focus areas of infant mortality, \n     cancer screening and management, cardiovascular disease, \n     diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and immunizations;\n       (2) to increase funding for minority health initiatives and \n     collaborations at the multi-State, State, and local level \n     that employ proven public health strategies to reduce health \n     disparities in specific minority populations;\n       (3) to expand Federal efforts and assist States in the \n     collection and analysis of health status data that includes \n     standard racial and ethnic data;\n       (4) to conduct or support research on effective health \n     interventions in minority communities;\n       (5) to assist in the development and dissemination of cross \n     cultural curricula for the training of health professionals;\n       (6) to provide technical assistance to States to improve \n     public health infrastructures and outreach for health \n     disparity populations; and\n       (7) to sponsor National Forums on African American Health \n     Care, Latino Health Care, Asian American Health Care, and \n     Native American Health Care.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a health amendment. It is related \nto the broad disparities that exist in health care in our society, \nwhich recently the President of the United States has recognized, and \nalso our majority leader.\n  I will take a moment or two to demonstrate these very significant \nhealth disparities. This amendment is intended to support and expand \nsome of the existing programs which are in effect and a number of which \nhave been cut very deeply in this omnibus appropriations bill, to \nrestore funding to the appropriations, and then also to meet some of \nthe current needs.\n  Just very quickly, we have nearly one in four African Americans and \none in three Hispanics who are uninsured compared to 16 percent of all \nAmericans. The mortality rate for African Americans is 1.6 times higher \nthan for Whites, a ratio that is actually identical to the ratio in \n1950. That has not changed since 1950--the last 50 years. The African-\nAmerican infant mortality rate is twice that of Whites. Diabetes \nafflicts Hispanics twice as much as Whites. Minorities are less likely \nto get heart medicines or cardiac surgery or even essential pain \nmedications. African-American men suffer prostate cancer twice as often \nas White men.\n  This is the reality. And I could go on. There are very dramatic and \nsignificant disparities. Take, for example, the health disparities in \nHIV/AIDS. This chart shows the rate per 100,000 of the population. It \nis 81.9 among Black Americans, 34.7 among Hispanics, 9.4 among American \nIndians/Alaskans. And it is 8.4 among the White population. There is a \ntremendous disparity.\n  What we have seen is that the minority HIV/AIDS initiative faces a \ndevastating cut in this omnibus bill. It is an 85-percent cut. Do we \nhear that? An 85-percent cut.\n  In 2002, there was $381 million available for the initiative. In the \nomnibus, it is $50 million. This amendment would put it at $540 \nmillion. It would take the $380 million and adjust it to the increased \ndemands we are facing.\n  It is absolutely intolerable that we have seen this dramatic \nreduction in terms of outreach for services, for prescriptions, for \ncaring among minority populations. I think it is one of the glaring \ndeficiencies of this particular program.\n  Before continuing, I must make a brief comment on today's Washington \nPost article on the front page where they say the AIDS panel choice \nwrote of a ``gay plague''--a ``gay plague.'' ``Views of White House \nCommission Nominee Draw Criticism.''\n  I would have thought, with all the debate and discussion we have had \nhere on the floor, going back to the debate and discussion on Ryan \nWhite, and how we have debated and discussed the NIH budget and other \nissues relating to minority health, that we could have moved beyond \nthis kind of serious stereotype of characterizing those with HIV or \nAIDS as part of a ``gay plague.'' Most of us thought this country had \ngone well beyond that kind of horrible insensitivity. I believe this \nappointment should be withdrawn. It is an insult to gay Americans, to \nthose who have worked so hard to treat people with AIDS with \nsensitivity and support.\n  Removing one individual is not enough. We must maintain and expand \nour commitment to deal with the disease. When it comes to AIDS in the \nminority community, this appropriations bill is missing in action.\n  This amendment also provides some assistance to the NIH Center on \nMinorities and Health Disparities to try to make sure that the center, \nwhich coordinates a national research agenda on minority health is \ngoing to be adequately funded.\n  It also provides a very small and modest increase in the HHS Office \nfor Civil Rights. Many members of the minority community are being \nexcluded from treatment, care, and attention. It is difficult to think \nthat is the case, but that is happening all over this country. The HHS \nOffice for Civil Rights has more than 1,000 complaints on its desk that \nare being unanswered. We provide a few million dollars, from $33 \nmillion up to $48 million, to be able to deal with this.\n  Finally, one of the most important provisions in all of this pertains \nto programs that are directed to try to help meet the deficiencies in \ntraining minority health professionals and support historically Black \nschools. I just want to point out that in the Clinton year of 2000, \nfunding was $93 million; in 2001, it was $109 million; and in 2002, it \nwas $115 million; but the Bush request for this year is $10 million--\n$10 million.\n  There has been an increase in the revised omnibus, but it still shows \na blatant and flagrant failure to understand the serious problem in the \ndeclining numbers of minority health professionals. These series of \nprograms and the centers of excellence that enable many minorities to \nmake it to schools of professional training--in nursing, dentistry, and \nmedicine--those programs would have effectively been closed down. And \nthe scholarship programs which have been available to minority students \neffectively would have been drastically reduced.\n  It does seem to me, after all we have heard in the debates over the \nperiod of the last 2 weeks, on issues of affirmative action, on issues \nof civil rights, that the one area on which we could all come together \nis these extraordinary disparities in health care that have been out \nthere. These are the same disparities that have been around for the \nlast 50 years and, under this omnibus bill, programs that help to \nalleviate the disparities are being cut back or abandoned in a very \nsignificant and important way.\n  This amendment restores those funds and adds additional funding to it \nto make sure we have realistic levels of assistance to reduce \ndisparities. It does seem that even though we have had debates that \nhave been divisive over recent times, on issues of affirmative action \nand other judicial issues, we as a Senate ought to be able to come \ntogether and say that whether you are going to get care and attention \non a particular sickness or disease should not depend on the color of \nyour skin. That is what is happening.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, that is what is happening. In too many \ninstances we are finding that those whose skin is not white are being \ndenied medical care. They are being denied the services which are so \nessential to individuals to improve their kind of health conditions.\n  This is an area we can do something about. We will have broad debates \non\n\n[[Page S1388]]\n\nother kinds of policy issues, but in terms of reducing the disparities \nand having support for the tried and true programs, this amendment will \nadvance that cause. I hope we can accept it and move on.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Does anyone yield time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and the \ntime to be applied equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this amendment by the Senator from \nMassachusetts would increase funding by nearly $600 million. It would \nincrease funding for programs at the National Center on Minority Health \nand Health Disparities, the Office of Minority Health at the Department \nof Health and Human Services (HHS), the Office for Civil Rights at HHS, \nthe Department's Minority HIV/AIDS initiative, and the Health Resources \nand Services Administration's (HRSA) Health Professionals Training for \nDiversity Programs.\n  I support these programs. In fact, many of these programs were \nestablished or authorized by legislation that I authored, including the \nMinority Health and Health Disparities Act of 2000 and the Health \nProfessions Education Partnership Act of 1998.\n  However, this amendment provides no offsets for these spending \nincreases. At a time when we are facing significant spending pressures, \nit is irresponsible to propose such spending without specifying how to \npay for them; and, although I support and will continue to support \nthese programs, I must oppose this amendment.\n  I would also note that the bill we are considering already contains \nsignificant increases in many of these programs, and I would commend \nSenators Stevens and Specter for their good work in this area. In fact, \nfor the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities and \nfor the Office of Minority Health, the bill before us today contains \nexactly the same funding levels as the Democrats provided in their July \n2002 Labor-HHS Appropriations bill.\n  In the case of Health Professions' programs in general, and the \nHealth Professionals Training for Diversity program in particular, the \nbill already contains a drastic increase from that provided in the \nDemocrats' July bill. For the Health Professionals Training for \nDiversity program that this amendment targets, I would point out that \nthe underlying bill contains $125 million--an increase from the \nprevious fiscal year--and that this program was zeroed out by the \nDemocrats in July. For them to now say that we are not providing \nsufficient funding is disingenuous and disgraceful.\n  I am disappointed by this attempt to politicize an important issue \nthat we have successfully worked in the past to address on a bipartisan \nbasis. I have made this issue of health disparities a priority over the \npast several years, and hope that, together, we can make additional \nstrides in an area of health disparities in the coming year.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have 5 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, I would like to call attention to the Labor-HHS \nappropriations conference report from FY 2002 on the Minority HIV/AIDS \nInitiative.\n  What it shows is the appropriations for HIV/AIDS health programs for \nFY 2002--$123 million for HRSA; $96 million for CDC; $7 million for \nSAMHSA/Center for Mental Health Services; $57 million for SAMHSA/Center \nfor Substance Abuse Treatment; $38 million to the Center for Substance \nAbuse Prevention; $50 million for the Office of the Secretary; $9.7 \nmillion for the Office of Minority Health. That adds up to $381 \nmillion.\n  The Senate fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations lists $50 million \nfor the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, Office of the Secretary. That is \nit. It is all listed in very considerable detail in this 2002 report. \nOn the other hand, under this fiscal year 2003, minority HIV/AIDS has \njust the $50 million, Office of the Secretary.\n  This is extremely important. The 2002 conference report illustrates \nexactly where the funding has been directed and the support for it. \nThat is completely missing in this proposal.\n  Our amendment addresses these issues and provides the kind of support \nwhich will make an important difference in reducing the disparities in \nhealth care in our society.\n  Having listened to so many who have spoken so often in the last \nseveral days on civil rights, there may be differences on one issue or \nanother affecting civil rights, but we should all come together on this \nissue to address the disparities in health care which exist. We should \ngo beyond our differences.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does anyone yield time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 additional minute.\n  What do these cuts mean? They mean 10,000 minority women and \nchildren, including HIV-infected pregnant women, will lose medical care \nunder title IV of Ryan White; 11,000 minority patients in the hardest \nhit cities will lose lifesaving drugs and critical medical care through \ntitle I of Ryan White; another 5,000 minority patients will lose \nmedical care funded through State governments under title II of Ryan \nWhite. These are just some of what will happen unless we make major \nchanges in the omnibus appropriations bill, and my amendment does that.\n  I withhold my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an important program. As a matter \nof fact, the amendment I have offered provides $130 million more than \nthe minority bill in the last Congress for these same programs. In \naddition, the amendment I have offered, the omnibus amendment, provides \nover $3.1 billion for minority health, education, and training \ninitiatives which was not in the bill that was prepared in the last \nCongress when the leadership was on the other side of the aisle.\n  This $3.1 billion is an increase of $144.3 million over the level of \nfiscal year 2002, which is the operating level now.\n  Has the Senator's time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 33 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have 2 minutes which I will use.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Would the Senator consider reserving his 2 minutes and \nhave 2 minutes reserved on this side, and let's put this off? I know \nmany people have left the building now for lunch. I would like to see \nthis vote started at 1:15. At that time the Senator would have 2 \nminutes, and I would have 2 minutes before that vote. Is the Senator \nagreeable to that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, reserving the \nright to object, it is my understanding what we are planning on trying \nto do--Senator Clinton is in the Chamber, and she is willing to offer \nher amendment. There is 30 minutes on that which would take us until \nabout 12:30. I understand Senator McCain is available.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It would be my hope, I say to the distinguished \nDemocratic whip, that we would have a series of amendments stacked and \nstart the votes at 1:15. A series of tabling motions, as a matter of \nfact, would occur at 1:15.\n  Mr. REID. My only statement here, in reserving my right to object, is \nthat it is good we are stacking these votes. I have no problem with \nthat. But I would rather we did it when the debate on the third one \nends.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't have any objection to that. I think the third \none will end when I make the motion to table.\n  Mr. REID. Let's do that. Let's have Clinton. Let's have McCain.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Two McCains.\n  Mr. REID. There are two McCains? OK, fine. We would do those and then \nhave three stacked votes.\n\n[[Page S1389]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Clinton and two McCains, and we will have the vote take \nplace at the end of the last of those.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is that agreeable with the Senator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator be good enough to repeat?\n  Mr. REID. We are going to have a series of votes starting at \napproximately 1:15, 1:30.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have not yet made the motion to table because we have \n2 minutes on a side. I will make it later. Is Senator Clinton prepared \nto proceed now?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will put off the McCain amendment until the Senator \nhas offered the amendment.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 89\n\n   (Purpose: To improve health care under the medicare and medicaid \n                               programs)\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 89 and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 89.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of January 21, 2003 under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to offer the 6-month Medicare and \nMedicaid extenders amendment No. 89 to H.J. Res. 2. The modified \nversion of the amendment is at the desk. The modification assures that \nthe cost of this amendment is fully offset by extension of the Customs \nuser fee.\n  The current appropriations bill, like the extension of unemployment \ninsurance we passed earlier, represents unfinished business from last \nyear. We are dedicating so much time to deliberating this bill because \nwe recognize our obligation to take care of issues we left unresolved \nin the last Congress. I stand before you today to discuss another \nobligation that we left unfinished. That is Medicare.\n  Virtually every Senator on both sides of the aisle has in the past \nexpressed deep concern about the shortfalls of the Medicare system, \nparticularly the lack of a long overdue prescription drug benefit.\n  Now, regardless of the many DSH solutions that have been proposed and \ndebated, I think it is fair to say that all of us stand united in \nsaying Medicare needs fixing. Now, does this amendment provide that \nlong-awaited fix? No. But what it does do is effectively freeze \nMedicare in its 2002 state.\n  As badly as we all believe that Medicare was functioning last year \nbecause of the fiscal pressures, without action Medicare will be in \neven worse shape this year. Many of the Medicare and Medicaid \nprovisions enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1999 or the \nBeneficiary Improvement and Protection Act of 2001 either expired at \nthe end of fiscal year 2002 or will be expiring soon.\n  Last year, there was bipartisan interest, led by Senators Grassley \nand Baucus, in addressing many of these ill-conceived cuts. But that \neffort was caught up and procedurally tangled at the end of last year, \nand many of the cuts we were trying to avert will now go into effect. I \nbelieve a number of these cuts, once implemented, will be very \ndifficult to reverse. Yet because of procedural roadblocks, we won't be \nable to address them, despite the overwhelming bipartisan majorities in \nthis body to fix these cuts and their impact.\n  This is policy by default and by neglect, not by deliberative \ndemocracy. My bill provides a 6-month moratorium on this Medicare cliff \nto prevent irreversible deterioration of services for beneficiaries \nwhile Congress completes the unfinished debate from last year over a \nmore comprehensive Medicare reform package. The measures in this \namendment--with the exception of the physician payment update, which \nlasts from March 1 to September 30--are scheduled to be implemented \nfrom April 1 to September 30, 2003, the exact same time period as the \nother rural hospital provision that is already included in the omnibus.\n  The specific measures of this amendment include an inflationary \nupdate for hospitals and a continuation of the workforce add-on for \nnursing facilities that are trying to maintain nurses in a time of \nshortage. It also delays the automatic 15-percent home health cut. It \nprevents cuts in dialysis services, and it helps stroke victims by \ncontinuing a moratorium on the $1,500 cap for therapy services.\n  This amendment would also assure that hospitals serving a \ndisproportionate share of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, \nincluding teaching hospitals, are not crippled or even have services \nbasically shut down while Congress debates this issue. It assures that \ndoctors who have suffered a 5.4-percent cut last year, and are frozen \nat last year's rate by this omnibus bill, would get a 2-percent \nincrease from last year's unacceptably low levels. It also extends the \nQI Program, which I know my colleague Senator Bingaman is very \ninterested in; that provides support for low-income seniors who would \notherwise be unable to afford Medicare premiums. These seniors will be \nkicked off Medicare on April 1. Once they are kicked off, it will be \nhard to identify and reinstate them unless Congress extends their \neligibility.\n  Medicare+Choice plans are also increasing their premiums, cutting \nbenefits, and withdrawing services. I believe beneficiaries need \nprotections against these health plan deductions and we should debate \nand pass these protections in the coming year.\n  In the meantime, I am troubled by reports of plans pulling out of \nmarkets and leaving beneficiaries stranded. As you can tell from this \nchart, until we can act to help beneficiaries, this amendment provides \nfor a 3-percent increase, increasing the 2 percent already scheduled, \nwhich will hopefully prevent further pull-outs and the disruption they \ncause to the continuity of care.\n\n  So what would happen if we didn't do anything? Well, as this chart \nshows, hospitals are already struggling to keep up with rising health \ncare demands while trying to invest in the latest lifesaving \ntechnology. They would lose roughly $1 billion, including over $100 \nmillion in New York alone. Medicaid DSH hospitals, which take care of a \ndisproportionately high number of uninsured patients, would lose an \nadditional $100 million.\n  Meanwhile, this chart shows the increasing amount of uncompensated \ncare that hospitals are forced to provide. Let me say a word about \nphysicians, many of whom were forced to limit their Medicare practice \ndue to last year's cut. This will--if we don't act, if we only \nimplement what is in the omnibus bill--continue to bring about \nlimitations in practice and decrease the numbers of patients who are \nserved.\n  Skilled nursing facilities already facing worsening nursing shortages \nwould lose $700 million. That amounts to about $32 per day per \nresident. And for the average nursing facility, this amendment amounts \nto about a $117,000 annual cut. That is enough to pay for two \nregistered nurses, three licensed practical nurses, or five certified \nnursing assistants.\n  Home health agencies, which are so critical in allowing patients to \nbe taken care of at home rather than in expensive inpatient facilities, \nwould lose $500 million. These are just a few of the providers who form \nthe fabric of our seniors' health care system. If we allow the fabric \nto fray, it will be much harder to weave it together again. As this \nchart shows, the fabric is already framed. Over the past year, I have \ntalked to numerous providers from New York and from other States who \nare just on the brink of halting services, not only to Medicare \npatients but actually going out of business altogether. The common \nrefrain I hear is that once these providers leave the Medicare system, \nthey are not coming back, even if an eventual long-term solution is \nfound. In other words, it is far easier, and I argue far cheaper, to \npreserve our current system and then strengthen it later than to allow \nthe current system to be destroyed with the hope of rebuilding it in \nthe future.\n  When a critically ill patient comes into the emergency room, he is \nfirst seen in the ER, stabilized, then sent to surgery, if required. \nWhy? Well, we all know from watching television that the ER physician \nknows that surgery will take a while. If immediate measures are not \ntaken, the patient could\n\n[[Page S1390]]\n\ndie before the surgeon can even begin operating.\n  What we have with Medicare right now is a critically ill system, one \nwhich I know requires major surgery in the very near future to \ntransplant the dying patient into once again a live and vigorous one. \nBut until we are ready to do that operation, we need to take immediate \naction to stabilize the system and prevent it from collapsing before we \nare able to act.\n  This amendment will act as that stabilizer, will give us time to \nundertake the long-term task. I therefore urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment. Continued inaction will leave Medicare so irreversibly \ndamaged that even the best healers among us will be unable to \nrevitalize it. I look forward to stabilizing our patients and getting \non to debating the right cure.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am happy to cosponsor this amendment. I \nwill ask the Senator a question. We in New York--and I think it is true \nthroughout the country--are seeing that our providers, whether they be \nhospitals or clinics or home health care, are laying off people and are \nnot able to do the job anymore that they once did. There is no more fat \nin the system. We cut that out in New York in the 1980s, and then we \ndid it further federally in the 1990s.\n  Aside from the No. 1 job, which is to provide the best health care \npossible to our seniors and others, aren't our cutbacks in New York and \nelsewhere causing the economy to go down even further because of the \nlayoffs of many people? These are some of the poorest citizens--people \nwho just climbed the ladder, with health care jobs, particularly at the \nentry level, which are important to immigrants and so many others. \nDoesn't she believe her amendment might have a small stimulative effect \non the economy, and, conversely, not doing this amendment and allowing \nthe cuts to go deeper would hurt our economy throughout the country?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The Senator is absolutely correct. Health care is a \nprimary provider of jobs in every State that I know of and certainly in \nthe cities across the country. Our hospitals, nursing homes, home \nhealth programs, physicians offices are all providing employment. That \nis why it was so important that we tried to address this last year. We \ncould not get past the procedural roadblocks, despite the best efforts \nof Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus. I supported their proposals. \nNow we have to act because we are on the brink of an emergency.\n\n  I want to make sure that the modified version of the amendment with \nthe offsets we have found is at the desk because there seems to have \nbeen some confusion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from New York yield?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New York, it is \nnot a question of whether we address this issue; it is a question of \nwhen and how. This is a very serious issue. It has a profound impact \nespecially on rural hospitals but on all hospitals and all facilities \nthat provide patient care. This Congress has to address this issue.\n  I really appreciate the amendment the Senator has offered. I hope \nperhaps we can begin the process of addressing it today. If not, it has \nto be soon.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. Clearly, if we \ndo not act, doctors are going to start pulling out of Medicare in a \nmonth. Then we are going to have the rapid unraveling of the system, \nwhich we all fear. It is going to be much harder to put it together \nunder the leadership of Senator Grassley and others who are addressing \nthis issue.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator from New York yield?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I heard the Senator mention a modification, but I have \nnot seen it yet. I am concerned in reading page 15, section 302, about \nbudget scorekeeping, that the Senator is modifying the Budget Act or \ntrying to waive the Budget Act.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The Senator is correct to point that out. That is not \nin the modified amendment. I apologize; the Senator has not gotten a \ncopy of the modified amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the Senator's information, none of us has a copy of \nthe modification. This Senator, for one, is going to be very reluctant \nto agree to anything if we are modifying the budget or waiving the \nbudget.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. No.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I warn my colleague, she cannot be throwing up a \nmodification and saying we want you to accept this when the amendment \ndeals with substantive issues. The amendment deals with entitlements, \nwith issues that are under the Finance Committee jurisdiction. I have \nmade five speeches saying we should not be doing authorizing work on an \nappropriations bill without the appropriate committees having \nsignificant time to review the bill.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. As the Senator \nknows, as often happens around here, we have been working very closely \nwith staff of the Finance Committee. Many of these provisions have been \nmodified, and also we were able to fully offset the costs by extension \nof the Customs user fee, knowing full well that is a concern of many of \nmy colleagues with respect to how this would be paid for. I will take \nthe position it is such an emergency that we should find new money, if \nnecessary, to give us the time to do this in a deliberative manner. But \nwe do have the offsets, and the modified amendment provides for those \noffsets.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator tell me whether this amendment addresses \nthe indirect medical education cost issue?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The teaching hospitals will certainly help defray some \nof the increasing costs that are not going to be taken care of \notherwise.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to the Members of the Senate, I hope \nthey have listened carefully to their hospital administrators across \ntheir States, particularly at teaching hospitals which we count on to \ndeal with some of the most complicated medical cases that are \npresented, and also hospitals that are responsible for teaching the \nnext generation of specialists, including children's hospitals.\n  If the Senator from New York does not prevail, I can tell her that in \nmy State of Illinois, some of the very best and most important care \nwill be compromised, and we will see the next generation of doctors who \nwe want to be the best and brightest in America not being prepared. How \ncan that be in the best interest of medical care in Illinois, New York, \nIowa, or Oklahoma?\n  I salute the Senator from New York. We have talked about a lot of \namendments to this appropriations bill, but I wish to ask the Senator \nin closing----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New York has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does she believe, with the offset she has come up with, \nthat we have avoided any budget complaints that this bill is not being \npaid for?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The Senator's question is absolutely pertinent. We \nworked very hard through the night addressing that point. I have been \ninformed by my staff, in consultation with the Finance Committee staff, \nthat the amount is offset. Clearly, as I have said, I think this is \nsuch an emergency that we should spend new money, but we do have such \nan offset.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New York has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if there is a question before the \nSenate, I do not want to interfere.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, \ncorrect me--parliamentary inquiry--I do not believe there has been a \nmodification agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has not.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The modification has a tax increase to pay for it, I \nunderstand that, but that may have some problems in itself. I want all \nof our colleagues to know the amendment has not been modified as of \nyet.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmodified amendment be accepted at the desk and be considered.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S1391]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to pose a question to the Senator from \nNew York, if I may. Do I understand the offset is with Customs user \nfees; is that correct?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object because the Customs user fees would \nbe one of the worst offsets we could provide, given the obligations of \nthe Homeland Security Department with Customs security at our borders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have time.\n  Mrs. CLINTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have time.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, and then I \nwill yield Senator Kyl 5 minutes.\n  I want my colleagues to reject this amendment. I, like the Senator \nfrom New York, agree we need to strengthen and improve Medicare, and I \nproved that last year with a bipartisan bill on Medicare give-back. \nWorking with Senator Baucus, we put together a $43 billion bill that \nwould have improved health care in rural America and address many of \nthe issues the Senator from New York wants to address as well.\n  While I support addressing the needs of all Medicare providers, I \ncannot support doing it in this way in the amendment being proposed. We \nhave to do this in a comprehensive, studied, and targeted way.\n  Everyone agrees that Medicare needs improving, and most of us would \nagree that Medicare payments need to be updated, but we do not have \nagreement on how that should be done. Some, including this Senator, \nbelieve that at least some providers need more money, but other \nSenators who might disagree with me say that providers are doing well \nand that their funding should be reduced.\n  Even very recently, we had the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommittee last week make recommendations to Congress calling for \nreductions in some provider payments.\n  I do not take these recommendations as gospel truth, and they are not \ngoing to govern my decisionmaking, but I believe we have a \nresponsibility in the Finance Committee to examine all of these issues \nclosely. More important, the only way we get anything done in this body \nis by a bipartisan approach. So we have to build a consensus before we \npass a one-size-fits-all policy such as the one before us. I believe \nthe place to do that is the Finance Committee. We will do our homework. \nThat means listening to providers, beneficiaries, and experts to craft \npayment adjustments that ensure access to services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  I will certainly ensure that the Finance Committee consider my \ncolleague's proposal. The two Medicare provisions in this omnibus bill \nare limited in time and duration. They target the cases with the most \nwidespread support--physicians as well as rural and small urban \nhospitals--while we can do it. These two items stand the best chance of \nbeing preserved through conference and in negotiation with the White \nHouse.\n  If this bill turns into some sort of Christmas tree for additional \nhealth care provisions, then the reality is that these provisions are \nlikely to come out of the bill entirely, and we will not be helping \nanybody. Consequently, particularly doctors are going to have to wait \nuntil spring or summer. Let's not let the best be the enemy of the \ngood.\n  That is why I suggest we keep with the compromise in the bill and \nexpect our committee, which we will do, to bring forth recommendations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to inform my colleague from New York, at \nleast at this point I have not decided to object to a unanimous consent \nto modify her amendment, but I am concerned about the amendment. I am \nconcerned about the modification, of which I have just now received a \ncopy. I think I have the first copy on this side of the aisle.\n  These are entitlement changes. They are expensive and they affect a \nlot of people.\n  I will also tell my colleague from New York, there are a lot of us \nwho have a lot of interest in a whole lot of these provisions. Being on \nthe Finance Committee, I have worked with a lot of provider groups that \nhave an interest in Medicare modifications and updates. This should go \nthrough the Finance Committee, and it should be bipartisan. Ninety-\nsome-odd percent of the Medicare adjustments that have ever been made \nsince Medicare's inception have been bipartisan.\n  I might mention that when I read language we are going to waive the \nbudget and/or now we are going to raise taxes, that is not bipartisan; \nthat is not working together.\n  I reserve the right to object on the modification, but I say to my \ncolleagues, this is the type of bill that should have regular order, \nshould go through the committees, should be bipartisan through the \ncommittees, with input from all members of those committees, instead of \nbeing on an appropriations bill where we have not had a chance to \nthoroughly analyze it to a greater degree.\n  I think we have some mutual objectives that can be accomplished in \nshort order, but I do not believe this is the right way to do it today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight and a half minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Okay. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona and \nthen 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have already objected to the modification \nof the amendment because it includes an offset of U.S. Customs Service \nfees. I have talked to the Senator from New York about my commitment to \ntry to find a way in the Finance Committee to develop a plan very early \nin this year to find the reimbursement capability for the health care \nproviders that are included within her amendment because I have in the \npast cosponsored legislation which would provide for adequate \nreimbursement to all of the health care professions.\n  To set the record straight, we have ensured in this legislation that \nthe cut that was going to take place in physician reimbursements will \nnot take place. Additionally, there is funding for the rural hospitals. \nThat will be done because those were the emergency requirements that we \ndeal with in this legislation.\n  In addition to that, the add-ons to the reimbursements to all of the \nother providers that are the subject of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New York are set to expire. It is my intention to work with the \nSenator from New York to find a way to ensure that we can continue \nthose add-ons. That can be done in the Finance Committee, and I am \nhopeful we will be able to do that.\n  The first point I want to make is that the true emergency--the \nphysicians--is being taken care of in this legislation. The expiration \nof the add-ons is something I will work on with the Senator from New \nYork to try to accomplish, but we cannot do it by offsetting Customs \nuser fees. At a time when we are asking the Customs Department to aid \nus in the war on terror at our borders and they are stretched as thin \nas they can possibly be stretched, it would be the absolute wrong thing \nto do. In talking with the Senator from New York, I am sure she agrees \nthat if this is, in fact, what would happen, this would not be a \nnecessarily good thing, that the funding that ordinarily would accrue \nto the Customs Service would not necessarily accrue to the Customs \nService if an offset is permitted for this particular program.\n  I will quote two things from a statement before the Terrorism \nSubcommittee last year. Bonni Tischler, the Acting Director of the \nCustoms Service, testified, and I will quote a couple of things she \nsaid. I asked her about the effect of an offset on Customs user fees. \nShe said: My personal opinion is it would severely hamper us.\n\n[[Page S1392]]\n\n  Later on she said: Yes, we would be severely hampered in how we \noperated.\n  Then in a letter from the Customs Service from the Acting \nCommissioner which was sent to all of us--it was actually a memorandum \nfrom the Under Secretary for Enforcement--the point was that it would \nnegatively impact the available funding from the Customs Service.\n  I think my bone fides are pretty good. I helped to defeat a proposal \nof my chairman, Chairman Grassley, which was also going to be using the \nCustoms user fees as an offset. This is the wrong way to achieve what \nmay well be good objectives, and therefore I was constrained to object.\n  We are all in agreement that we cannot allow the reimbursements to \nphysicians to be cut in March. We are taking care of that in this \nlegislation. In addition, we should try to find ways to prevent the \nadd-ons, or the other health care providers, from not continuing to be \nin effect throughout the next year. It is my commitment to try to work \nwith the Senator from New York in a way to ensure that happens as part \nof the Finance Committee deliberations probably on the Medicare \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, controls the time; is that right?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Arizona used his 5 minutes, and I have \nyielded 3\\1/2\\ minutes to Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Of my time?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If it is not more than 30 seconds and we can get the \nshow on the road, let's do it.\n  Mr. REID. I say to everyone on that side of the aisle, we are going \nto have a vote on this amendment one way or the other. It is not that \nhard to do. So I think rather than having two votes, we should have \none. I suggest that as the votes have gone in the last week or so, they \nhave not been too favorable for us, and I do not know what the fear is \nof having a vote. We are going to have a vote sometime today. I thank \nthe Senator very much for the 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Iowa. I take this opportunity \ntoday to keep the Senate updated as to the ``spendometer'' that is \nflying now at a very high rate of speed as a result of the last few \namendments. We have been going through all the different amendments, \nand now they are at such a level I will not detail them all, but as of \nthe last time I spoke with this chart, we were at $341 billion. That \nwas yesterday at about this time. So within a 24-hour period, we have \ngone from $341 billion added to the deficit, with the inclusion of the \namendments that have yet to be voted on--which are the Clinton, the \nKennedy, the Cantwell, and the Bingaman amendments--with those votes we \nwill be almost to the grand total of a half a trillion dollars in new \nspending being proposed over the next 10 years by Members on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  These are additions to the baseline which CBO will score as an amount \nthat will be added to with inflation, plus the interest costs of \ncarrying this additional deficit.\n  So when we hear the other side talk about how we cannot afford any \nrelief for the taxpayer, we cannot afford any economic stimulus package \nbecause we will add to the deficit, this is money they want to add to \nbills that should have been passed 3 months ago.\n  In a matter of a month or two, we will consider the 2004 budget. I \nsuspect we will see amendments probably double or triple this amount to \nadd to the 2004 budget on top of what they wanted to add to the 2003 \nbudget. We are looking at an enormous expansion of Government that has \nbeen voted on almost unanimously by the Members on the other side of \nthe aisle. Some of them, I agree, have been voted by us and I condemn \nus for the ones that we have voted for, but they have been rather small \namounts of money.\n\n  I argue that we are heading down a path of Government growth in \nspending that is simply not sustainable in this economy, and we need to \nfocus on growing the economy, not growing Government.\n  This is a fundamental difference between the two sides of the aisle. \nWe are about growing the economy through putting more money out in the \nprivate sector. They are about growing the Government in the last week \nto the tune of almost a half trillion dollars in new spending over the \nnext 10 years.\n  That is fine. If they want to go out to the American public and say \nwe think the answers to the economic woes this country is suffering are \ngoing to be met with more Government spending to the tune of a half \ntrillion dollars over the next 10 years, go out and make the case, but \ndo not make the case that we do not have money to help this economy \ngrow because we are concerned about deficits.\n  No one who proposes half a trillion dollars in new spending--and, by \nthe way, votes for it almost unanimously--can make a legitimate claim \nthat they are worried about deficits. One cannot be worried about \ndeficits and vote unanimously, almost to a person on the other side, \nfor almost half a trillion dollars in new spending over the next 10 \nyears. It is inconsistent. It is not honest.\n  Let's be consistent. We are either for more spending, we are for \nhigher deficits, or we are for growth in the economy. That is the \ndifference between the two parties. Let's face the facts.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa retains 20 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I enjoyed very much the speech of my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, but it has almost no relevance to what is \ngoing on here at all. It was good for the amusement of the Chamber, but \nthose numbers bear no relationship to the amendments that have been \noffered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania adds up some tote board scoring of \ncosts that bear no relationship to the amendments on which we voted. \nThese amendments were not spending for 10 years. These amendments were \nto restore cuts that have been made in the budget for this year. This \ndoes not have anything to do with spending for 10 years from now, or 5 \nyears from now. So all those cumulative totals bear no relationship to \nwhat has occurred in the Senate.\n  The concern with deficits of the Senator from Pennsylvania is \ninteresting, but it is a change for him because he supported the \nmassive tax cuts that have opened up this chasm, where we have gone \nfrom a projection 2 years ago of $5.6 trillion of surpluses over the \nnext decade to now being $2 trillion in the hole. Where was he in his \nconcern for deficits then?\n  The assertion that each of these items that have been voted on can be \ntotaled is erroneous as well. We cannot just take each of these \namendments, every one of them which has been defeated, and total them. \nOne amendment is offered, it is defeated. That money cannot be treated \nas though it has been spent. That is what the Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas done. It defies logic. It defies reason. It defies the facts.\n  These amendments were not offered in total. They were offered one at \na time. As they were defeated, another amendment was offered. So you \ncannot total them. And you certainly cannot make 10-year totals from \nany of them because they are 1-year pending proposals.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might ask a question, it has been interesting to \nhear this discussion. I saw the tote board.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair, based on \nprevious conversations, that we were to proceed with the Senator from \nArizona and the offering of his amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I might ask the Chair, the Senator from North Dakota\n\n[[Page S1393]]\n\nsought recognition, was granted recognition, the Senator from North \nDakota still has the floor; is that not the case?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct. And I have yielded to my colleague, the \nSenator from North Dakota, for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might ask a question, the discussion was quite \ninteresting. I will be very brief.\n  Our colleague said our position is to grow Government. I am wondering \nif growing Government would be something that occurs as a result of \nproposals that dramatically increase the Federal deficit. Is it the \ncase that those who would propose and support policies that \ndramatically increase the deficit, such as a $1.7 trillion tax cut or \n$690 billion tax cut, all of which is borrowed, is it the case that \nwould target the growth of the economy?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, deficits inhibit growth and hurt the \neconomic strength of the country. That is undeniable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 214\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration. The amendment is numbered 214.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCAIN] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 214.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require completion of the feasibility study required by \nPublic Law 105-245, and the other requirements of that law relating to \n   construction of an emergency outlet at Devils Lake, North Dakota, \n        before any appropriated funds are spent for the project)\n\n       On page 262, beginning with ``That'' in line 2, strike \n     through ``State,'' in line 24, and insert ``That the \n     Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, \n     may use up to $5,000,000 of Construction, General funding as \n     provided herein for construction of an emergency outlet from \n     Devils Lake, North Dakota, to the Sheyenne River except that \n     the funds shall not become available until completion of the \n     feasibility study required by Public Law 150-245, for the \n     continuation of which the Secretary may use $500,000 of such \n     funding, and except that the funds for such construction \n     shall not become available unless the Secretary of the Army \n     determines that an emergency (as defined in section 102 of \n     the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122) exists with respect to the \n     emergency need for the outlet and reports to Congress that \n     the construction is technically sound, economically \n     justified, and environmentally acceptable and in compliance \n     with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. \n     4321 et seq.): Provided further, That the economic \n     justification for the emergency outlet shall be prepared in \n     accordance with the principles and guidelines for economic \n     evaluation as required by regulations and procedures of the \n     Army Corps of Engineers for all flood control projects: \n     Provided further, That the economic justification be fully \n     described, including the analysis of the benefits and costs, \n     in the project plan documents: Provided further, That the \n     plans for the emergency outlet shall be reviewed and, to be \n     effective, shall contain assurances provided by the Secretary \n     of State, after consultation with the International Joint \n     Commission,''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as soon as the Senator from Minnesota \narrives in the Chamber, I intend to propose a time agreement so we can \ndispense with this amendment. I would like to consult with cosponsors \nbefore we do. I don't think this issue needs to be debated very long. \nBut I will propose a time agreement very shortly.\n  I offer an amendment to a provision of a bill regarding a project to \nconstruct an outlet in Devils Lake, ND. The project is very \ncontroversial and its impact extends well beyond North Dakota into \nMinnesota, Missouri, and Canada. I am pleased to be joined in support \nof this by Senators Dayton and Coleman.\n  The outlet from the landlocked lake allows contaminated water to flow \ninto neighboring waterways, causing the introduction of invasive \nspecies.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have letters of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Friends of the Earth; Minnesota Center for Environmental \n           Advocacy; National Audubon Society; National Wildlife \n           Federation; Sierra Club,\n                                                 January 22, 2003.\n     Re McCain-Dayton Devils Lake Amendment to the Omnibus \n         Appropriations Bill.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our conservation organizations \n     and the millions of members and supporters we represent, we \n     urge you to support the McCain-Dayton Devils Lake amendment \n     to the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for FY 2003. That \n     amendment would remove an anti-environment, anti-taypayer \n     rider authorizing the Devils Lake ``Emergency'' Outlet \n     project in North Dakota. The rider waives the standard \n     requirement that the project's benefits must exceed its costs \n     and changes current law to weaken international consultation \n     requirements with Canada.\n       Far from a parochial state issue, the rider would authorize \n     a bad precedent-setting out-of-basin water transfer and a key \n     element of North Dakota's longstanding and highly \n     controversial Garrison Water Diversion Plan. The States of \n     Minnesota, Missouri, and the Great Lakes Commission all \n     oppose the Devils Lake project. So too do the Canadian \n     Government and the province of Manitoba.\n       The Bush Administration did not request any funding for the \n     Devils Lake outlet and the Army Corps of Engineers has \n     delayed issuing a Final Environmental Impact Statement for \n     the project, citing the need for additional analysis of the \n     project's environmental impacts in the U.S. and Canada. The \n     Corps has also calculated that the project benefit/cost would \n     only generate 37 cents of benefits on the dollar based on the \n     region's hydrologic record.\n       Because Devils Lake has no natural outlet, it contains high \n     concentrations of salts, dissolved solids and other \n     pollutants. Pumping the lake water into the Sheyenne River, \n     which flows to Minnesota and Manitoba, would take a dramatic \n     toll on water quality downstream--with serious impacts on \n     people, wildlife and the environment that could reach through \n     the Red River to Lake Winnipeg and as far as the Hudson Bay.\n       Far from an ``emergency,'' the water level of Devils Lake \n     has actually declined over the last two years. In addition, \n     taxpayers have already spent more than $350 million on \n     mitigation, including buying out affected property owners \n     around the lake. This project is not authorized and has not \n     been reviewed in hearings before the Senate Environment and \n     Public Works Committee. When considered through the proper \n     channels, it will become clear that there are far better and \n     less expensive solutions, such as restoring wetlands around \n     Devils Lake, than transferring its water out of basin.\n       We urge you to support the McCain amendment, which would \n     preserve a legitimate planning process for the Devils Lake \n     project, honor our international treaty obligations to \n     Canada, and protect wildlife and the environment and the \n     affected communities in Minnesota's Red River Valley.\n           Sincerely,\n         Sara Zdeb, Legislative Director, Friends of the Earth; \n           Peter Bachman, Executive Director, Minnesota Center for \n           Environmental Advocacy; Bob Perciasepe, Sr. Vice \n           President for Policy, National Audubon Society; Jim \n           Lyon, Senior Director for Congressional and Federal \n           Affairs, National Wildlife Federation; Debbie Sease, \n           Legislative Director, Sierra Club.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Canadian Government is so concerned that it was a \nleading item in recent talks between President Bush and the Prime \nMinister of Canada.\n  The provision authorizes $5 million for construction and a total of \n$100 million for the Corps of Engineers to have completed their \nfeasibility study or environmental review. In fact, the Corps has \nindicated they do not believe the outlet would accomplish the purpose \nfor which it was intended.\n  There is a letter from the Canadian Ambassador addressed to the \nHonorable Bill Young, chairman of the Appropriations Committee that I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Canadian Embassy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2000.\n     Re Devils Lake Supplemental Appropriation.\n\n     Hon. Bill Young,\n     Chairman, Appropriations Committee, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Young: I understand that you will soon be \n     considering the Administration's request for $6.6 million in \n     emergency supplemental funding for preconstruction activities \n     related to the Corps of Engineers' proposed construction of \n     an outlet from Devils Lake, North Dakota, to the Sheyenne \n     River. I am writing to express the strong opposition of the \n     Government of Canada and the Province of Manitoba to a \n     project that could lead to transfers of water, potentially \n     carrying non-native biota, including fish diseases, from \n     Devils Lake into the Red River\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\n     and Hudson Bay basin, a result that the International Joint \n     Commission concluded in 1977 could have ``irreversible and \n     catastrophic'' consequences for Manitoba's commercial fishing \n     industry.\n        While Canada sympathizes with North Dakota's problems with \n     Devils Lake flooding, it cannot agree to a solution that \n     poses a genuine threat to Canadian water resources, as well \n     as to those of other states. There are alternative, internal \n     solutions available to North Dakota, including the \n     construction of additional flood protection works and the \n     pursuit of upper basin storage approaches. Canada urges that \n     additional funds not be provided for the Devils Lake outlet \n     project unless and until all of the issues it raises are \n     thoroughly addressed through studies repeatedly mandated by \n     Congress, and following meaningful consultation with Canada \n     under the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty.\n       There is little question that an outlet to the Sheyenne \n     River from Devils Lake would adversely affect water quality \n     in the Red River (into which the Sheyenne flows), due to the \n     high level of total dissolved solids, sulphates and \n     bioaccumulation of mercury in Devils Lake water. The initial \n     work done by the Corps of Engineers has raised serious doubts \n     about the possibility of operating an outlet in compliance \n     with existing US water quality standards. Water quality in \n     the Red River at the point where it flows into Canada has \n     already failed to meet established objectives, according to \n     the International Joint Commission. Additional, poor quality \n     water from Devils Lake would require municipalities which use \n     the Red River as their drinking water source to increase \n     their level of treatment, and incur increased costs.\n       Although the US Fish and Wildlife Service's preliminary \n     review in May 1999 did not address the impact of an outlet on \n     the Red River, it concluded that ``the combination of high \n     total dissolved solids (TDS), sulfates, and chlorides (plus \n     unknown levels of other toxic or harmful constituents) would \n     likely devastate the freshwater aquatic life in the Sheyenne \n     River.'' The US Fish and Wildlife Service also concluded that \n     the ``introduction of Devils Lake water into the Sheyenne \n     River will significantly degrade water quality, increase \n     erosion and sedimentation, and result in conditions \n     detrimental to aquatic mollusks, such as freshwater mussels, \n     pill clams, and snails.'' We understand that these concerns \n     are shared by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources \n     and contribute to opposition to the outlet from Governor \n     Ventura and Senator Wellstone.\n       In addition to the impact on downstream water quality and \n     its effect on aquatic species, Canada is especially concerned \n     about the potential transfer of unknown biota from Devils \n     Lake to the Red River. While there is some knowledge of the \n     large fish species, very little is understood at this time \n     about microscopic organisms in either system such as fish \n     pathogens, viruses, etc. As you know, there are many examples \n     of prior man-made connections between major watersheds \n     causing severe regional and international problems because of \n     biota transfer, including the introduction of the sea lamprey \n     into the Great Lakes, the spread of zebra mussels to dozens \n     of states, and the invasion by round gobies (which are \n     displacing perch in Lake Michigan) of the Mississippi River \n     and Missouri River watersheds. Zebra mussel management in the \n     Great Lakes alone costs over $3 billion per year. President \n     Clinton recognized the seriousness of this national \n     problem last year in his Executive Order on Invasive \n     Species. If a Devils Lake outlet to the Sheyenne River is \n     constructed, it will provide a permanent route for \n     existing and future non-native biota to move into the \n     Hudson Bay basin.\n       From a technical standpoint, there is serious doubt that an \n     outlet with the proposed capacity would have any demonstrable \n     effect on the level of Devils Lake. After thorough review, \n     the Corps of Engineers announced in a June 1999 press release \n     its conclusion that an outlet is not the necessary or \n     appropriate solution, at this time, and recommended a review \n     of alternatives. Restoration of drained wetlands is one \n     possibility. As Devils Lake has no natural outlet, its high \n     levels may well have been exacerbated by the amount of run-\n     off from drained wetlands in the basin.\n       If the proposed outlet is nevertheless constructed and \n     found ineffective, this could result in pressure to increase \n     the flows, thereby increasing the volume of water flowing \n     into the Red River and Hudson Bay basin, and exacerbating \n     future flooding and water quality problems in both the United \n     States and Canada.\n       Of critical concern to Canada, Manitoba and US opponents of \n     the outlet is the link between the Bureau of Reclamation's \n     Garrison Diversion Unit and the stabilization of water levels \n     in Devils Lake. It is well known that water level \n     stabilization in Devils Lake was one of the original goals of \n     the Garrison project. Public statements by both local \n     government officials in the Devils Lake basin and by the \n     North Dakota congressional delegation clearly indicate that \n     this has been their long-term goal. While gaining an outlet \n     to Devils Lake is their immediate objective, once water \n     levels recede naturally following the end of the present wet \n     cycle--as they have historically--their next goal will be to \n     create an inlet to raise the lake level using water diverted \n     from the Missouri River. It is important to note that less \n     than ten years ago, North Dakota was examining proposals to \n     construct an inlet to Devils Lake from the Missouri River \n     because of concerns with low water levels. This objective has \n     remained evident in State of North Dakota literature on the \n     Garrison Diversion and on Devils Lake. This raises once again \n     Canadian and other concerns over inter-basin biota transfer \n     that caused such controversy over the Garrison Diversion \n     before the 1986 Reformulation Act.\n       The potential for imminent overflow of Devils Lake to the \n     Red River basin in minimal. U.S. federal agencies had \n     concluded in 1999 that, even with the previous rate of lake \n     level increase, such an overflow would not occur naturally \n     for another 10-18 years, and that planning for such an event \n     would not have to begin for another five or six years. This \n     year, it is predicted there will be a decrease in level for \n     the first time in several years, further supporting that \n     conclusion. This allows sufficient time for serious and \n     thoughtful examination of all potential alternatives and a \n     thorough assessment of environmental impacts.\n       For all these reasons, Canada is very concerned that the \n     Corps of Engineers has proposed in its Supplemental Fiscal \n     Year 2000 request, and in its request for Fiscal Year 2001, \n     the deletion of language contained in the last several Energy \n     and Water Development Appropriations Acts that requires a \n     showing of an emergency need and economic justification \n     before construction can proceed. Canada urges that those \n     restrictions, which among other things require compliance \n     with U.S. environmental laws and obligations under the \n     Boundary Water Treaty of 1909, remain intact.\n       I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have \n     regarding Canada's position on the Devils Lake outlet or the \n     Garrison Diversion project.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Raymond Chretien,\n                                                       Ambassador.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. In part it reads:\n\n       While Canada sympathizes with North Dakota's problems with \n     Devils Lake flooding, it cannot agree to a solution that \n     poses a genuine threat to Canadian water resources, as well \n     as to those of other states. There are alternative, internal \n     solutions available to North Dakota, including the \n     construction of additional flood protection works and the \n     pursuit of upper basin storage approaches. Canada urges that \n     additional funds not be provided for the Devils Lake outlet \n     project unless and until all of the issues it raises are \n     thoroughly addressed through studies repeatedly mandated by \n     Congress, and following meaningful consultation with Canada \n     under the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty.\n       From a technical standpoint, there is serious doubt that an \n     outlet with the proposed capacity would have any demonstrable \n     effect on the level of Devils Lake.

Restoration of drained wetlands is one \n     possibility. As Devils Lake has no natural outlet, its high \n     levels may well have been exacerbated by the amount of run-\n     off from drained wetlands in the basin.\n\n  I have had extended conversations with both Senators from North \nDakota. I do not claim to have extensive education and expertise on \nthis issue. I think it is serious when we have these concerns by Canada \nand neighboring States and there is not a cost-benefit analysis.\n  My friends from North Dakota point out that it is under the way in \nwhich that cost-benefit analysis is conducted. With a basin such as \nthis, that catches water and does not release water, as happens in the \ncase of rivers, this is very difficult, if not impossible, to do. I \nstill believe we should be able to fashion some kind of formula to find \nout what the cost-benefit ratio is.\n  I also point out that, thanks to the good efforts of the Senators \nfrom North Dakota, $350 million has been spent in the last several \nyears, raising highways and relocating individuals who live in \nproximity to Devils Lake.\n  There are concerns raised. I think the concerns are serious. I also \nassured my colleagues from North Dakota that I will send my staff out \nto North Dakota.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator entertain a time agreement now?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to wait, if it is agreeable to the Senator \nfrom Alaska. I understand the senior Senator from Minnesota is on his \nway. If you could give me about 3 or 4 minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. All right. Thank you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The senior Senator, as well as the junior Senator, from \nMinnesota, have views on this issue. I would not like to enter into a \ntime agreement until such time as they at least are consulted. But I am \nsure they would be agreeable to a reasonable time limit.\n  I did discuss with my colleagues from North Dakota that I sent staff \nout to\n\n[[Page S1395]]\n\nDevils Lake to further look at this situation. I understand and \nappreciate their long involvement--I understand 9 years--in this issue. \nI would be more than willing to learn more about this issue.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank our colleague from \nArizona for taking the time to listen to our concerns, because this is \na disaster of staggering proportion in our State. Let me just say it is \nthe unanimous view of every elected official in the State of North \nDakota, every single one, Republican and Democrat, that we must deal \nwith this unfolding crisis.\n  Here is what has happened to this lake. This lake, by the way, is \nthree times the size of the District of Columbia. This is a massive \nlake. It has risen dramatically, some 26 vertical feet, since 1992. It \nstarted rising then and, as you can see, it has been straight up since \nthen. This is a flood unlike any other in our Nation's history. The \nreason for that is that there are only two closed basins in the entire \nUnited States. The drainage basin for this lake is the size of the \nState of Massachusetts. This lake, if it continues uncontrolled, will \nreach the size of the State of Rhode Island. That is not just \nconjecture. That has happened two times in history. Those two times \nwere at times when North Dakota and Minnesota were unpopulated.\n  Already the cost to the Federal Government already of this lake \nrising has been over $350 million. Threatened structures have been \nmoved. Highways have been raised. A massive dike protecting the town of \nDevils Lake has been increased twice already. The Federal Government is \npoised to raise it again. So the hard reality is that unless more is \ndone, we face a catastrophic event.\n  The year before last, 50 miles outside this basin, there was an event \nwhere 18 inches of rain fell in 1 day. If that event had occurred 50 \nmiles to the west, this lake would have gone up, according to the Corps \nof Engineers' calculations, by 3 feet, perhaps even more. That probably \nwould have overwhelmed the road system, because we now have roads \nacting as dams, protecting homes, protecting people from catastrophic \nloss. If that event would have occurred in the middle of the night, it \nis entirely likely that lives would have been lost.\n\n  The consequences of a failure to act here are enormous. This lake, \nwhich is already three times the size of the District of Columbia, has \nhad an uncontrolled release out of the east end twice before in its \nhistory. If it happened again, it would be devastating to the hundreds \nof thousands of people downstream.\n  I remind our colleagues, the first ones downstream are the people in \nNorth Dakota, in the towns of Valley City, Fargo, and Grand Forks.\n  We have insisted that water quality has to be met with any outlet \nprocedure. The provision in this bill provides that the funds shall not \nbecome available unless the Secretary of the Army determines that an \nemergency exists with respect to the need for an outlet and reports to \nCongress that the construction is technically sound, environmentally \nacceptable, and in compliance with the National Environmental Policy \nAct; provided further that the justification for the emergency outlet \nshall be fully described, including the analysis of benefits and costs \nto which the Senator from Arizona referred. There will be a requirement \nthat a cost-benefit analysis is done. Provided further that the plans \nfor the emergency outlet shall be reviewed and, to be effective, shall \ncontain assurances provided by the Secretary of State that the project \nwill not violate the treaty between the United States and Great Britain \nrelating to the boundary waters between the United States and Canada.\n  We have attempted to be environmentally sensitive and cost-friendly \nto American taxpayers, but also to respond to this burgeoning crisis in \nthe Devils Lake Basin, a crisis that has already cost the taxpayers of \nthe United States $350 million. If the growth of this lake continues, \nit has the prospect of costing the American taxpayers hundreds and \nhundreds of millions of dollars more.\n  We have already had to buy out an entire town. We have already had to \nbuy out the town of Church's Ferry.\n  The next town on the list is Minnewaukan. There is the lake. It has \nalready eaten up the playing field of the high school there. That is \nall under water. This entire town is now threatened.\n  American taxpayers have already had to buy out Church's Ferry. Next \nis Minnewaukan, and if this continues, Devils Lake, a town of 10,000, \nwould potentially fall into the requirement of having to be bought out. \nThe cost of that to the American taxpayers would be billions of \ndollars. That is the hard reality.\n  Let me close with this photo. We like to say this is the luckiest \nfellow in North Dakota because he just escaped the advancing flood. \nThis is a lake that, as one Federal official came out and said: My God, \nthis looks like an ocean. Indeed, it is huge, three times the size of \nthe District of Columbia. If it continues to grow, we will see complete \ndevastation for hundreds and hundreds of thousands of acres and for \nhundreds of thousands of people.\n  This is a picture of a home having to be burned because it was in \nline with the floodwaters before it could be moved. Of course it would \nhave created a serious health hazard had it been allowed to go into the \nwater. So homes all across this area had to be burned and hundreds have \nhad to be moved.\n  This project needs to go forward to protect human life and to prevent \na disaster of stunning proportion. If this lake escapes uncontrolled \nout of the east end, as it has twice in our history, we expect that the \ndownstream people would have a very serious adverse health effect.\n  I asked one time, when I heard repeatedly the Corps of Engineers talk \nabout the health effects that would occur, the illness that would be \nthe result of an uncontrolled release of the water out of the east end, \nwhat kind of health problems would occur? They explained the water \nsystems downstream cannot handle the dissolved salts that are in this \nlake. If it went out of the east end of the lake uncontrolled, \nthousands of people downstream would be made ill.\n  There are many things that need to be done. Additional storage in the \nupper basin, millions of dollars have been spent on that. Moving \nthreatened structures, raising roads, millions of dollars have been \nspent on that. Raising the dike protecting Devils Lake, tens of \nmillions of dollars have been spent on that.\n  But one part of an overall strategy to deal with this crisis is to \nprovide for an outlet. As the Senator from Arizona correctly states, \nthere is no assurance that will solve the problem, but it is our best \nhope to prevent a catastrophe of truly stunning proportion, one that \nwould not only adversely affect the people of North Dakota but the \npeople of Minnesota and the people of Canada as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dorgan \nbe recognized for 5 minutes, Senator Dayton for 10 minutes, Senator \nMcCain for 2 minutes, and following that the debate on this be ended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote will occur \nat 1:15 on the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote be \nmoved to 1:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague has pretty much covered this \nsubject.\n  Let me say to my colleague from Arizona that I understand he raised \nsome concerns to which I think Senator Conrad has responded. I \nappreciate the manner in which Senator McCain has raised this issue. \nThis is not an issue that is irrelevant to others. It is very important \nto others. It is important to our neighbors. It is important to the \nState of Minnesota. It is important to the neighboring country of \nCanada to the north. It is important to the American taxpayers. It is, \nobviously, important to my colleague from Arizona. I don't dismiss \nconcerns people have raised about these issues.\n\n[[Page S1396]]\n\n  I want to say--as my colleague, Senator Conrad, said--that it is not \nour intention to build an outlet from the lake itself in a manner that \ninjures anyone. We don't come to this project saying we would like to \nhave a project for our State. This is not something we are anxious to \ndo because we believe this project would be something that would be a \nfeather in our cap. We come to this because we have a lake that has \nbeen chronically flooding for a long time.\n  As was mentioned earlier, there are only two closed basins in this \ncountry. One is the Great Salt Lake and the other is Devils Lake. The \nupper basin of Devils Lake is the size of the State of Massachusetts. \nWater funnels down from that basin into Devils Lake. This picture \ndoesn't do justice to the lake. But it does show what is happening \nhere. What used to be a road and commerce and opportunity in this area \nof our State that is very important to us is now flooded--inundated--\nwith water. This extends over to an Indian reservation called the \nSpirit Lake Nation.\n  I recall one day driving around with the tribal chairman of the \nSpirit Lake Nation with a man named Elmer White. Elmer is dead now. \nElmer passed away a couple of years ago. He said: Our elders told us \nthe water was coming. He said: All of these roads that are no longer \npassable and all of these roads that are now inundated with water, our \nelders told us this was going to happen.\n\n  What happened is we stranded part of this Indian reservation. We have \nhad to make substantial investments in roads in order to get people to \nhospitals. They have to move around and meander in strange ways on \nbackroads.\n  This flooding has been chronic and very difficult. Frankly, I don't \nexpect anybody to understand lake flooding until they have seen it. My \nnotion of a flood is almost always the notion of the Red River Valley \nflood or some other flood that I have seen on television someplace. \nThere is a coursing and a gushing river--a virtual torrent and wall of \nwater. It sweeps houses and trees and cattle downstream in a rush of \nwater and in a roar of noise. Then, 12 hours later, or 24 hours later, \nor 48 hours later, the river is back in its banks, in all its calm. \nThat is what river flooding is. That is what we think of with flooding.\n  This lake has increased 26 feet in height in the last 9 years. It has \ngobbled up more and more land.\n  One of the things we have to do to respond--not because we want to \nbut because we must in order to protect others--is try to take some \npressure off that lake and do it without hurting anyone else. If we \ndon't take pressure off that lake with a measured outlet, what is going \nto happen is, if that water continues to rise, it goes over the divide \nnaturally in an uncontrolled way and you have people living \ndownstream--yes, in North Dakota our big population centers, but also \nup in Canada--and the worst quality water is going to make literally \nhundreds of thousands of people sick--North Dakotans, Minnesotans, and \nCanadians. That is what will happen in an uncontrolled release of water \nover the divide if we don't do something to reduce the risk.\n  That is what this proposed outlet is about.\n  I have a couple of final points. This outlet cannot be built unless \nit meets all environmental standards. Under the NEPA Act, the studies \nare ongoing. The studies must be done.\n  Second, this cannot be built and we cannot do anything unless we \npledge--as we have and unless our country determines as it has--that we \nwill not violate the boundary waters treaty with Canada. We don't \nintend to take a problem that exists here and foist that problem on \nsomeone else; certainly not on our constituents living downstream, not \non our neighbors, not on Minnesotans, and not on the Canadians.\n  This is a project that is critically necessary to reduce risks.\n  I understand my colleague from Arizona and the questions he has \nraised. We had a long meeting this morning. I hope we will be able to \nresolve all of these issues. But I believe this project is critically \nimportant to a whole lot of folks who have been victimized by chronic \nfloods that came and stayed--by lake flooding that has been devastating \nto this region of the country. We must find a way to reduce the risk \nfor the people who live in this region, for the American taxpayer--\nespecially for people who live downstream who would be the recipients \nand victims of an uncontrolled release of water if we don't do \nsomething to take the pressure off this lake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota for taking on so many of the responsibilities here, and for \nhis involvement in the balance of our portfolios in Minnesota. I \nwelcome the Chair.\n  I don't like to disagree with my colleagues from North Dakota. We \nhave an excellent working relationship. In fact, our two States--other \nthan fighting over hockey players--generally get along pretty well on \neverything else, and particularly on this matter related to the water \nmanagement. We have worked cooperatively on water problems in most \ncases over the last couple of decades because it is absolutely \nnecessary to get something accomplished. Minnesota shouldn't be \nfoisting problems on North Dakota that are not of its creation and that \nexacerbate their situation. We in Minnesota would ask the same of our \nfriends across the border in North Dakota. In this case, that is \nexactly what would happen.\n  I am very disappointed that my colleagues from North Dakota have \nchosen to try to insert this funding into the appropriations bill \nauthorizing a $100 million project that I am told did not go before the \nSenate committees. It hasn't had that review. It hasn't gone through \nthe normal Senate process. It has been instead snuck into this measure.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, for his \nvigilance in this matter. I am going to read bills as carefully and as \nthoroughly as the Senator from Arizona does because he does a \nphenomenal job at identifying these attempts to circumvent our Senate \nprocess.\n  In 1999--this preceded my time in the Senate--according to the \nRecord, the States of Minnesota and North Dakota, along with the \nCanadian Government, which may not have been in complete accord, worked \nout language that was reflected in the 1999 bill which set forth basic \nprocedures that would have to be followed before this project could \nmove forward.\n  That language says very specifically, among other things, that the \neconomic justification for this emergency outlet shall be prepared in \naccordance with the principles and guidelines for economic evaluation \nas required by regulations and procedures of the Army Corps of \nEngineers for all flood projects.\n  I am told the project itself does not meet those requirements. \nMinnesota projects have been turned down by the Army Corps of Engineers \nbecause of the cost-benefit analysis. The costs exceed the benefits. In \nthis area, we were told that the project would have a cost benefit of \n0.37 percent. According to the EPA, that is an understatement because \nit fails to take into account the environmental damage that would \nensue.\n  The solution, according to my colleagues, is to waive that \nrequirement and have them report on a cost-benefit analysis but not \nhave to apply the same standard or measure that is applied to the other \nprojects in Minnesota and other States across the country, which would \ncircumvent the will of the Congress in terms of how these projects are \nmanaged, and to make it consistent across the Nation.\n  The funding would then allow water to be diverted initially to North \nDakota but then into the Red River, which is the common boundary \nbetween Minnesota and North Dakota, and within the site of severe \nflooding in recent years, which included cites that are on the \nMinnesota and North Dakota border. But also, then, at the very northern \npart, as we border Canada, the river diverts from North Dakota--the \nRainy River--and runs across our northern border.\n  I wish I could show my colleagues this picture. It is of this last \nsummer, the flooding that occurred in Roseau, MN. The entire city was \nunder water--everything except the Polaris manufacturing plant, which \nemploys 1,800 people in the northwestern corner of our State. If that \nhad been flooded, the\n\n[[Page S1397]]\n\ncompany's loss would have been just so devastating to the region; its \ncost is almost incalculable. It was within half an inch of flooding \nentirely and only because the entire city gave up on their homes and \nwent to sandbags. Just down the river in, Warroad, MN, the dikes were \nan inch from overflowing and flooding the entire city.\n  So anything that would divert water from anywhere else and put that \nwater downstream into Minnesota poses a grave risk to our State. That \nis the reason our Department of Natural Resources has opposed it, along \nwith local officials throughout Minnesota.\n  There are also concerns about the effect in terms of the solidity of \nthe water in Devils Lake. Because of its own problems, it is much \ndifferent in quality and characteristic from water elsewhere.\n  So, again, they are going to solve their problem by passing it on to \nus. I think, again, this is grotesquely unfair and unwarranted.\n  This project is opposed by not only the State of Minnesota but by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. We have castigated EPA recently--some \nof us--in some of their decisions. In this case, EPA stands four square \nwith the environmental organizations in opposing this project.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife oppose it. The State of Minnesota, the \nCanadian Government, the Great Lakes Commission, Taxpayers for Common \nSense, the National Wildlife Federation, Minnesota Conservation \nFederation, the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy--just about \neverybody opposes it except for North Dakota. I understand the reasons \nthat the North Dakota Senators would want to accomplish this project \nbut not at Minnesota's expense, not at the violation of our procedures \nhere, not at the circumvention of the way we send legislation through \nour committees and the governmental relations we have between North \nDakota and Minnesota and Canada.\n  We are attempting to work constructively to solve these problems. \nThis is not the way to do that. I urge my colleagues to oppose this \nmeasure.\n  I also point out that the Army Corps of Engineers, which is the very \nentity that would be carrying out this project, itself has indicated \nthat it would not favor proceeding at this time. It was, I expect, the \ndecision of the Chief of Engineers, Robert Flowers, of the Army Corps \nof Engineers, in August of last year, who announced he would not \napprove the environmental impact statement because the Corps had not \ngiven adequate consideration to the project's potential for serious \nenvironmental damage. He recommended that the International Joint \nCommission be given the opportunity to examine the report.\n  That unwillingness to proceed--again, a Federal Government agency \ndoing its job properly, as instructed by the rules and regulations of \nlaws passed by Congress and the rules and regulations that itself \npromulgated--brought this project to a halt. So now we are going to \ncircumvent that entire professional judgment here in the Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, I conclude my remarks at this point, but I ask for the \nyeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield my 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank, again, Senator McCain, and I \nthank my colleague, Senator Dayton. He is here defending his \nconstituency as he sees it. I just want to assure him of a couple of \nthings.\n  No. 1, on this notion that we are asking for a different standard of \nmeasuring the cost-benefit test, that is true. And the reason is that \nthe standard that applies in the law has no relevance to what is \nhappening in North Dakota. The standard that applies in the law is \ndesigned to deal with river flooding, where the water comes and the \nwater goes, and once the damage has been done you can rebuild.\n  That is not the circumstance here. That is why everyone who has \nexamined this circumstance has said the standard cost model is \nirrelevant.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield, but if I can just finish my thought.\n  What is required here is to understand this is cumulative damage as \nthis lake continues to rise. That is why we have had to raise this dike \ntwice, and the Federal Government is poised to raise it a third time. \nThat is why the roads have had to be raised twice. That is why hundreds \nof threatened structures have had to have been moved. More will have to \nbe done. And the cumulative cost continues to grow.\n  Second, on the question of flooding in Minnesota, we share the border \nwith Minnesota. We are not going to do anything that will make the \nflooding worse for our own people. We share the border with Minnesota. \nWe will do nothing to hurt Minnesota or North Dakota because that would \nnot be in our constituency interest.\n  Finally, we have to meet NEPA. That is what our amendment provides. \nThat is what is in this law. We have to meet the National Environmental \nPolicy Act. We have to meet the Boundary Waters Treaty with Canada. But \nwe should not be blocked, either, by Canada refusing to make a joint \nreferral to the IGC, which they have done for more than a year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I understand I have a minute remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, then I will entertain questions from my \ncolleagues from North Dakota in return.\n  I will point out, I was not here in 1999, but my two colleagues from \nNorth Dakota were. I do not know the circumstances under which this \nlanguage was adopted. That requires the Army Corps of Engineers to \nundertake exactly the same kind of cost-benefit analysis for this \nproject as it does for others. If that was not applicable then, I do \nnot know why that was not raised in 1999 or 2000 or 2001.\n\n  Contrary to what the Senator implied, the language in this amendment \ndoes not set up a different standard. It weighs the standard. It simply \nsays the Army Corps of Engineers will describe the cost benefit. It is \nnot going to have any standard it has to meet whatsoever other than the \nfact that that analysis is done.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DAYTON. When I finish my thought.\n  In terms of the two States, I cannot explain why, since we do share a \ncommon border, our departments of natural resources view it \ndifferently, although the interests are different. But I know for a \nfact that part of that is because of the severe flooding which we \nshared in 1997 in East Grand Forks and Grand Forks and Fargo and \nMoorhead.\n  But also, as I indicated, in the last 2 years Minnesota farmers have \nbeen devastated in the northwestern part of the State and the cities \nthere have been flooded after the river diverts from the North Dakota-\nMinnesota border.\n  We have circumstances that are different; therefore, the interests of \nour States differ. That is exactly the reason why Minnesota and North \nDakota and Canada should be working cooperatively on this and not have \none State go off on its own trying to finagle something which I think \nundermines the trust and working relationship.\n  I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I just point out, if this were to injure downstream \ncitizens in your State or ours, I would not support it. We do not \nintend to foist a problem that exists in this basin on any other \nconstituency anywhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DAYTON. In the judgment of Minnesota, that is what you are doing.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to table the Senator's amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays on that tabling motion. And I ask unanimous consent that \nvote take place following the vote on Senator Clinton's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, the vote will \ntake place after the Clinton amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator McCain has another amendment. It \nis my understanding that the parties have agreed to a 20-minute time \nagreement equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 230\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 230 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona proposes (Mr. McCain) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 230.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reduce the total construction general account in the Corps \n of Engineers, Flood Control Mississippi River and Tributaries, etc., \n  account by $14,750,000 and restore the appropriation for the Yazoo \nBasin Backwater Pumping Plant to the $250,000 level recommended by the \n                               President)\n\n       On page 263, beginning with ``$346,437,000,'' in line 24, \n     strike through line 6 on page 264 and insert ``$331,687,000, \n     to remain available until expended: Provided, That the \n     Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, \n     using $250,000 of the funds provided herein, is directed to \n     continue environmental review and project plans for the Yazoo \n     Basin, Yazoo Backwater Pumping Plant, Mississippi.''.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to reduce \nfunding for the Yazoo Pump Project in Yazoo Basin, MS. I believe the \nproject is wasteful and environmentally harmful. It has not been \nsubjected to standard responsible environmental or economic assessment. \nAnd although it was touted as a flood control project, the Yazoo pumps \nare not designed to save homes and lives. Instead, in my view, the \npumps are specifically designed to drain wetlands so that large \nlandowners can increase agricultural production on marginal lands, the \nmajority of which are irreplaceable wetlands.\n  In fact the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has indicated this \nproject will likely be subject to a Clean Water Act veto because the \nproject will drain and damage more than 200,000 acres of significant \nwetlands in the Mississippi flyway. That is more than three times the \nnumber of wetlands lost across the country in an entire year from all \ncauses. It is more than seven times as many wetlands as the Corps \nallows private developers to destroy in an entire year nationwide under \nthe Clean Water Act section 404 permit program.\n  Wetlands drained will include more than 31,000 acres currently \nenrolled in the Wetlands Reserve and Conservation Reserve programs \nwhich the Federal taxpayers already have paid more than $30 million to \nprotect. Tens of thousands of acres of forest and wetlands located on \nFederal and State lands will also be damaged. But the harm won't end \nthere. The pumps will alter the hydrology of the entire 925,000-acre \nproject area and of the Dear Creek, Steele Bayou, Little Sunflower, and \nBig Sunflower Rivers that flow through that area. The project also \nencourages increased pesticide use in an area of the country already \nplagued by significant toxic contamination.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has also opposed the project due \nto the severity of the ecological harm it will cause.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the opposition \nstatement of the EPA.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Atlanta, GA, January 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Louis Caldera,\n     Secretary of the Army,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Caldera: While there has been extensive \n     communication between the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) and the Corps of Engineers regarding the Yazoo \n     Backwater Pumping Plant, we are writing to express directly \n     to you the depth of our concern with the environmental \n     consequences of the Corps proposal. It would alter the \n     hydrology of over 200,000 acres of ecologically significant \n     wetlands. It would drain wetlands currently enrolled in the \n     Conservation Reserve Program and the Wetlands Reserve \n     Program, wetlands being managed as mitigation for previously \n     constructed projects in the region, and wetlands on national \n     forest, national wildlife refuge, and state lands. Moreover, \n     an independent evaluation has found serious flaws in the \n     Corps' cost-benefit analysis for this project. Our objections \n     are intensified because the unacceptable environmental \n     impacts are avoidable.\n       The Yazoo Backwater Pumping Plant would work against the \n     progress that has been made in reducing the losses of our \n     nation's wetlands resulting from the hard work of the Army \n     Corps, other agencies, and our non-federal partners. Just \n     last week Secretaries Babbitt and Glickman announced that the \n     net wetland loss rate has been reduced to less than 60,000 \n     acres per year across the entire U.S., which puts in \n     perspective the massive scale of the wetlands at risk because \n     of the Yazoo project.\n       The Corps has not responded to our concerns that the \n     project exceeds the Congressional authorization. The Flood \n     Control Act of 1941, upon which the Corps derives its \n     authority to construct the Yazoo Pumps, prohibits the \n     draining of lands below the 90 foot elevation. This \n     prohibition has never been removed or altered. The \n     recommended plan, however, proposes to drain lands well below \n     the 90 foot elevation with significant adverse environmental \n     impacts. Over approximately 150,000 acres of forested and \n     cropped wetlands will be adversely impacted by draining below \n     the authorized elevation.\n       Explicit Congressional authorization would be required \n     before the Corps could proceed with the project or seek a \n     Clean Water Act exemption, and any such authorization would \n     be subject to the cost share requirements of 33 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2213.\n       Because of the environmental effects, EPA strongly opposes \n     Congressional authorization of the project as proposed. We \n     hope that the Department of Army would share our objections.\n       We are reiterating EPA's offer to work with the Corps to \n     develop an alternative to meet project objectives, while \n     avoiding the significant level of environmental damage \n     associated with the Corps proposal. Other federal agencies \n     with programs that could be part of an alternative approach, \n     including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the \n     Natural resources Conservation Service, and the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service have also expressed their willingness to \n     cooperate with the Corps in exploring less environmentally \n     damaging alternatives.\n       Thank you for your interest and involvement in this \n     important issue. If your wish to discuss this matter, please \n     contact John Meagher at 202-260-1917.\n           Sincerely,\n     J. Charles Fox,\n       Assistant Administrator, Office of Water.\n     John Hankinson,\n       Regional Administrator, EPA Region IV.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The controversy surrounding this project is not limited \nto the environmental harm the pumps will cause. An independent economic \nanalysis conducted by a highly respected economist, who also chairs the \nNational Academy of Sciences panel, shows that the Yazoo pumps cannot \nbe economically justified. It shows that the Corps has overstated just \nthe agricultural benefits of the project by $144 million. It also shows \nthat the Corps of Engineers is asking Federal taxpayers to spend well \nover $180 million simply to help large landowners earn more farm \nsubsidy payments.\n  Those subsidies are already substantial. In just the 2-year flood \nplain of the project area, where 150,000 acres of wetlands will be \ndamaged, 51 landowners split $15.3 million on Federal farm subsidies in \nthe 6 years from 1996 to 2001. One of those landowners received $2.7 \nmillion during that time while four others received more than $1 \nmillion each.\n  Perhaps the worst thing about this project is that each and every \nbenefit could be achieved in a way that would avoid each and every \nimpact we are talking about. Nonstructural measures, including the \npurchase of conservation and flowage easements and targeted flood \nproofing of buildings, could reduce flood damages in the region. This \nalternative has been suggested for years but has been brushed aside by \nthe Corps. The Corps has not finished its environmental review of this \nproject, has not finished the feasibility study for this project, and \nit has not issued a record of decision. The Corps of Engineers has far \nto go to satisfy its planning requirements. The draft environmental \nreview was so flawed that it was given the lowest possible rating by \nthe EPA.\n  This makes any directive to enter into a continuing contract for the\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\npumps supply contract entirely premature. Given the widespread \nopposition to this project, the detailed and scientifically supported \nchallenges to the Corps project analysis, and the ecosystemwide harm \nthis project will cause, Congress would do an enormous disservice to \ntaxpayers and the environment to direct the Corps to begin \nconstruction.\n  This amendment would allow the planning process to proceed without \ninterference. It would ensure we don't short circuit the ongoing \nenvironmental and physical review of this project that could destroy an \nentire ecosystem and cause taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not.\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona. Let me point out that there has \nbeen a lot of discussion over the last several years about the impact \nof the Yazoo Backwater project.\n  The Corps of Engineers several years ago undertook a reevaluation of \nthis project which was authorized over 40 years ago. As a matter of \nfact, it is a part of a very large Mississippi River and tributaries \nproject. This is one of the last parts of that authorized project to be \nconstructed. Because it is one of the last projects to be constructed, \nan intense amount of scrutiny has been devoted to the project. That is \njust fine. That is an appropriate thing for people who are concerned \nand interested in the environment and in agricultural production and in \nthe lives and well-being of the people who live in this area.\n  The point is, the project is not going to authorize the drainage of \nany new wetlands. There will be no new lands cleared of bottom lined \nhardwood for this project. There will be a small amount of land \ncleared, 38 acres, in order to construct the project. But 62,500 acres \nof existing agricultural land will be reforested. There will be new \nhabitat created, way beyond what exists now.\n  The purpose of this project is not to create new agricultural \nopportunities in this part of the Mississippi Delta, but it is to save \nlives. It is to prevent damage to existing infrastructure such as roads \nand bridges. It is to prevent the flooding of schools and hospitals and \nbusinesses. It is to address the concerns of people who want the \nproject to proceed, such as those who visited my office last week when \nthey heard there might be an amendment to strike the money to begin \nthis construction project.\n  These were not big shot farmers. These were poor people who have \nhomes and businesses in Mayersville and in Sharkey County in the area \nwhere this project will be constructed.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will reject this amendment. It is an \namendment designed to cut money the committee put in the bill, $14.5 \nmillion. It will cut almost all of that money.\n  The Corps of Engineers is nearing the point where they will be able \nto enter into contracts for design and construction of the project and \nto do some real estate activities that are necessary before the \nconstruction is actually begun.\n  I urge the Senate to carefully look at the facts. I will include for \nthe Record 5 pages of misconceptions and the facts that prove those \nmisconceptions to be erroneous. I hope Senators will take the time to \nlook at them and to read these factual statistics and information as \nrelevant to this project. I ask unanimous consent that a document \nentitled ``Yazoo Backwater Area, Mississippi'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Yazoo Backwater Area, Mississippi\n\n       The Corps of Engineers initiated the reevaluation of flood \n     control plans for Mississippi's Yazoo Backwater Area, a \n     1,550-square-mile portion of the state's flood-prone lower \n     Delta region. The goal of the study was to provide protection \n     to businesses, infrastructure, and people of the area, while \n     notably improving the future of the region's environment.\n       Extensive coordination with customers and stakeholders took \n     place over the course of the study to find a solution that \n     addressed both the economic and environmental needs of the \n     Backwater Area. The Corps spent several years in a consensus \n     building process among environmental agencies and economic \n     interests in the Mississippi Delta. The effort resulted in a \n     multi-purpose approach that addresses the desire for a \n     balance between flood control, environmental restoration, and \n     the concerns of the private landowners in the Yazoo Backwater \n     area.\n       As a part of our public involvement program, it is the goal \n     of the Vicksburg District to provide the public with \n     unbiased, factual information about the Yazoo Backwater \n     Project. A considerable amount of inaccurate and/or \n     incomplete information is currently being circulated about \n     this proposed project.\n       The following misconceptions were selected based on the \n     comments we received since the release of our draft report.\n       Misconception 1: Contrary to federal policy, the Yazoo \n     Pumps are designed to drain wetlands to increase agricultural \n     production on lands that have always flooded.\n       Facts: The structural features of the Yazoo Backwater Area \n     Project are designed to lessen flooding in the Lower Delta \n     for those flood events that exceed a one-year flood. While \n     the lessening of flooding would possibly increase production \n     on existing agricultural lands, Federal agricultural policy \n     remains in place, which would preclude the clearing and \n     draining of any wetlands. In addition, the non-structural \n     flood control feature of the proposed project provides for \n     increasing bottomland hardwood wetland habitat by converting \n     up to 62,500 acres of lands currently in agricultural \n     production to forest lands.\n       Misconception 2: The project will drain and damage 200,000 \n     acres of wetlands, two times the number of acres destroyed \n     each year across the country by all public and private \n     projects combined.\n       Facts: The wetland resources in the project area would be \n     increased by 23% under the proposed plan. The Yazoo Backwater \n     Area Project includes both a structural and non-structural \n     feature. The structural feature, the pumping plant, would not \n     change flooding on 62,500 acres of farmed or prior converted \n     wetlands or the 142,000 acres of bottomland hardwoods that \n     are now flooded by the 1-year flood. These lands would \n     continue to be flooded. The Corps of Engineers would purchase \n     conservation easements on up to 62,500 acres of farmed or \n     prior converted wetlands from willing sellers and reforest \n     this land. Lands above the 1-year flood plain would receive \n     reduced levels of flooding. In this area, there could be some \n     increase in the level of production on these lands and there \n     could be some shifting of crop types by the farmers; however, \n     no additional land would be cleared.\n       Misconception 3: The project would not make a single home \n     free from flooding.\n       Facts: There are 1,441 homes that would be impacted under \n     existing conditions by a 100-year flood. The average value of \n     these homes is approximately $36,000. With the implementation \n     of the proposed Yazoo Backwater Area Project, over 1,000 of \n     these homes would be free from flooding by the 100-year \n     event.\n       The proposed project would lower the elevation of the 100-\n     year flood by 4 to 4\\1/2\\ feet. For example, if a flood \n     similar to the 1973 flood occurred again, those homes that \n     had 4 to 4\\1/2\\ feet of water in them in 1973 would no longer \n     be flooded. Those homes and structures that had more than \n     4\\1/2\\ feet of water would still have water in them; however, \n     they would not be flooded as deep or for as long.\n       The Eagle Lake area would see significant reductions in \n     flooding. Almost all residences in this area would be \n     protected from the 100-frequency flood event. Only 5 of the \n     homes would still be subjected to the 100-year flood, but \n     even these 5 homes would benefit overall from the lessened \n     flooding. Flooding in other communities in the project area \n     would also be reduced significantly. No homes in the towns of \n     Cary, Valley Park, Anguilla, Rolling Fork, Mayersville, or \n     Hollandale would be flooded by the 100-year flood with the \n     project in place.\n       Flooding impacts even those residents whose homes have not \n     flooded in the past. Those residents have to contend with \n     significant flooding of roads and bridges. Flooding of roads \n     in the area disrupts transportation of children to schools, \n     causes access problems for emergency vehicles, and creates \n     problems for area residents in their daily lives. It becomes \n     difficult to get to the supermarket for food, or to see a \n     doctor or dentist. This proposed project would help to \n     alleviate much of the flooding of area roads and bridges.\n       Misconception 4: This project would promote increased \n     pesticide and fertilizer use in a region already plagued by \n     toxic contamination.\n       Facts: With the reforestation of up to 62,500 acres of \n     cropland, an increase in the usage of agricultural chemicals \n     associated with implementation of the recommended Yazoo \n     Backwater Project is unlikely. No additional land would be \n     cleared for agricultural production.\n       Misconception 5: The project would waste millions of tax \n     dollars to increase agricultural production when the federal \n     government is spending billions on farm subsidies and on \n     taking excess croplands out of production.\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\n       Facts: The amount of agricultural cropland in the Yazoo \n     Backwater Area would be reduced, not increased. In the case \n     of the Yazoo Backwater Area, the proposed project would not \n     change the flood patterns on the 62,500 acres of cropland or \n     the 142,000 acres of bottomland hardwoods in the 1-year \n     floodplain. These lands would still flood as they have in the \n     past. The Federal government would offer to purchase \n     conservation easements from willing sellers on these 62,500 \n     acres of cropland and where these easements are purchased, \n     the agricultural intensification benefits associated with \n     this project would be limited to either increasing the amount \n     of a crop grown per acre of remaining cropland or switching \n     to grow a more valuable crop on the remaining cropland.\n       Misconception 6: The project is wasteful because it \n     benefits a few people at tremendous taxpayer expense.\n       Facts: In addition to local benefits, the project would \n     also provide additional national benefits. Everyone who uses \n     stores, schools, roads, medical facilities, or owns \n     businesses and farms would benefit. The project as proposed \n     would reverse the prior clearing of bottomland hardwood \n     forests in this important area by replanting up to 100 square \n     miles of the alluvial flood plain, which accounts for \n     approximately 20% of farmland that is now in use. Such local \n     benefits would be accomplished over and above a return of \n     $1.48 in economic benefits to the country for every $1 \n     invested.\n       Misconception 7: The pumps would destroy some of the best \n     remaining bottomland hardwood forest in the lower Mississippi \n     River basin, which provide habitat for bald eagles, \n     alligators, bobcat, deer, and the threatened Louisiana black \n     bear.\n       Facts: The construction of the pump plant would result in \n     the loss of a 38-acre tract of forested land. No additional \n     clearing would be required for implementation of the project \n     and no additional clearing is expected due to project \n     implementation. The reforestation of up to 62,500 acres of \n     agricultural lands would provide a significant environmental \n     benefit to the backwater area. This land use conversion from \n     agricultural to bottomland hardwoods would result in a \n     significant increase in environmental habitat by connecting \n     fragmented tracts of forested land. This reforested land \n     would also create a significant buffer between agricultural \n     activities and the aquatic environment, which would result in \n     improved water quality in the lower Delta.\n       The project calls for raising low water levels during the \n     summer months, which would provide more wildlife habitat. The \n     excessive low water stages on the Mississippi River \n     experienced over the past two summers would have resulted in \n     an extreme hardship on the terrestrial and aquatic \n     environment had it not been for the operation of the Steele \n     Bayou Structure. Water was ponded approximately 20 feet \n     higher than that of the Mississippi River. The entire basin \n     would have essentially dried up if it were not for the \n     structure and the series of weirs in Steele Bayou constructed \n     by the Corps. The proposed project would allow for increased \n     stages to even further reduce the hardship on aquatic \n     habitat.\n       Separate habitat-based analyses for waterfowl, wetland, \n     terrestrial, and aquatic resources, have documented both the \n     positive and negative impacts to the environment from the \n     recommended plan. These studies showed that terrestrial \n     resources would increase 17 percent, wetland resources would \n     increase 23 percent, and aquatic resources would increase 19 \n     percent; however, waterfowl resources would decrease 42 \n     percent. The waterfowl decrease is the result of a reduction \n     in foraging habitat with the reforesting of agricultural \n     lands. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has indicated that \n     the reforestation of agricultural lands is more important to \n     waterfowl than the loss of foraging habitat since sufficient \n     foraging habitat would remain in the area.\n       Misconception 8: The project would damage productive lakes \n     and swamps that support hunting, fishing, and ecotoursim \n     industry.\n       Facts: The pump project would not drain the delta. The \n     pumps would only operate during flood conditions when the \n     Steele Bayou Control Structure gates are closed and water \n     levels are above evaluation 87. At this level, there are \n     still about 170,000 acres that remain flooded on a yearly \n     basis. The pump would be used to reduce flooding for only the \n     more serious events.\n       Misconception 9: The pumps would be used for all floods.\n       Facts: The pump feature of the project is designed to \n     remove only that water which is above elevation 87.0 and \n     trapped behind the closed gates of the Steele Bayou \n     Structure. The Steele Bayou Structure gates are closed only \n     when the Mississippi River is at flood stage to prevent \n     backwater flooding into the protected area. Should the water \n     level be above elevation 87.0 while the gates of Steele Bayou \n     Structure are open, it is unlikely the pump would be utilized \n     because normal gravity flow would occur.\n       Misconception 10: The Vicksburg District is behind in its \n     mitigation requirements for other projects.\n       Facts: The Yazoo Backwater project requires no compensatory \n     mitigation. Several other projects under construction by the \n     Vicksburg District do require compensatory mitigation; the \n     Vicksburg District is committed to fulfilling all of its \n     authorized mitigation requirements. Lands required for \n     mitigation by the Vicksburg District are from willing sellers \n     and must meet certain environmental criteria such as use as a \n     moist soil area or frequency of flooding prior to purchase. \n     The lands purchased to meet this mitigation requirement are \n     acquired concurrent with project construction. As of June \n     2000, the Vicksburg District has purchased 82,050 acres of \n     mitigation lands for all projects requiring land acquisition. \n     This acreage is 12,450 acres more than the amount required to \n     be concurrent with construction of our projects.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I, too, rise in opposition to this amendment \nand support the funds that are provided in this section of the energy \nand water appropriations bill for the Yazoo Backwater Pump Project. I \nthank the committee for the time they spent on this project and for the \nfunds they provided. Actually, they have a lot of knowledge about this \nproject because it is not new.\n  Let me take a minute to add a few points to the very good points my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Mississippi, already made. First of \nall, the Great Flood of 1927 that hit the Mississippi Delta covered \n27,000 square miles, killed more than 500 people, and left 700,000 \npeople homeless.\n  In response to this event and because water from 41 percent of the \nUnited States drains through the Delta--I was listening to the \ndiscussions about the Devil's Lake project in North Dakota and thinking \nthat the drainage begins way up there, but it all winds up down in this \nfunnel-like area of the Mississippi Delta. Being aware of that, \nCongress passed the Flood Control Act of 1929 making flood protection \nin the Mississippi River Valley a Federal responsibility.\n  The Yazoo Pump Project was actually authorized in 1941 as a part of \nthis overall effort. So, you see, this is not something that hasn't \nbeen considered and worked on for years and years. The point was made \nearlier that the Corps of Engineers hasn't finished its review. I \nwonder, how long does it take? Year after year, these people who live \nin this area are threatened with floods, as are their homes and \nbusinesses and hospitals, as the Senator pointed out. It is a very \ndangerous situation.\n  This pump actually will protect 1,000 homes--not just a few rich \nfarmers, as has been alleged, but 1,000 homes, and includes, very \nimportantly, the reforestation of over 62,000 acres currently in \nagricultural production.\n  This is a win-win situation. It protects the people from flooding \nwhile restoring large amounts of land to natural habitat. I thought \nthat was what we should be trying to do.\n  This is a project that is being moved forward very carefully. The \nfunding here is slightly short of $15 million. So it is being done \nincrementally and in a way that will include the ability to improve \nthis natural habitat.\n  This pumping plant, by the way, is not unique. There are currently 15 \nsimilar plants in operation throughout Arkansas, Louisiana, and \nMississippi within 200 miles of the Yazoo pump. In fact, the W.G. \nHuxtable Pump in Arkansas is almost the same size as the Yazoo but \ndrains only half the acreage of the Yazoo. The Yazoo will protect 2.6 \nmillion acres, while the Huxtable plant drains only 1.3 million acres.\n  This project has bipartisan support from Democrats such as \nCongressman Bennie Thompson, who has been there and looked at the \ndamage and the threat to the people. He supports this project, as do \nDemocratic State elected officials.\n  Aside from that type of statistic, I think the most important thing \nis the human side of this. Year after year--and it is almost every year \nthat people have water in their homes. You cannot believe what it is \nlike. I was looking at some of the pictures being shown earlier with \nthe Devil's Lake project. We can show you the same type of pictures \nfrom Mississippi--people with sandbags around their houses and the \nwater is up above the porch level. These are hard-working, mostly poor \npeople in this area of the Mississippi Delta--five counties right down \nat the end of the funnel, really.\n  By the way, in most of these counties, the African-American \npopulation is the majority--the lowest is 54 percent, up to as much as \n71.8 percent. The delegation Senator Cochran referred to who came to \nsee us was led by Ms. Ruby Johnson of Cary, MS. She met\n\n[[Page S1401]]\n\nwith us to talk about these projects. She had a delegation of five. All \nfive of them were African Americans who literally were concerned about \nbeing able to continue to live there. They were talking about how their \nkids have left the Delta and can't come back. They cannot attract \nbusinesses and industry because of, among other things, the threat of \nthe flooding year in and year out. They told us stories about having to \nput their children in boats to take them to school when the water is \nrising. They told us of fearing snakes, which find their way into their \nhomes after the waters recede.\n  The Federal Government has made a promise to these good people. This \nproject has been delayed, analyzed, and criticized in the media. \nSpecial interest groups are saying it is not being done in an \nenvironmentally sound way. It is. A project like this one which will \nprovide flood protection while restoring thousands of acres to its \nnatural habitat should be held up as a model for future environmental \nprojects.\n  I urge defeat of this amendment and support of the Yazoo Backwater \nPump. If we don't, we are going to end up with five counties in this \narea that will have no people and no opportunity for a decent living, \nor any kind of business, or economic development. We can have all of \nthese in this area if only we keep the promises first made by the \nfederal government over 70 years ago. The people of the Mississippi \nDelta have waited long enough.\n  So I appreciate the opportunity to speak, and I plead for my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know of no two Members of the Senate who \nhave worked harder on behalf of their constituents than my friends from \nMississippi. I also understand that they have special problems and \nspecial needs in one of the least economically well-off parts of \nAmerica. I understand their dedication to this and other efforts they \nhave made on behalf of their constituents.\n  It is with that understanding that I still oppose this project. It \nhas nothing to do with the admiration and respect I have for both of my \ndear friends.\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment will be sustained by my \ncolleagues. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is yielded back.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are going to proceed to a vote on four \namendments soon. There is an agreement for 2 minutes on each side \nbefore Kennedy amendment No. 123.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes before the Clinton \namendment No. 89, which will follow the Kennedy amendment. And then on \nthe McCain amendment No. 214, I have already made a motion to table \nthat amendment. The yeas and nays are in order. I move to table the \nMcCain amendment No. 230, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe Kennedy amendment, the votes on all three succeeding amendments be \nlimited to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I want to say \na couple things to the manager. First of all, the Clinton amendment--\nhave you moved to table that?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No.\n  Mr. REID. There is a question as to whether or not she is going to be \nable to modify. Senator Nickles is not in the Chamber.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my hope that she will be able to modify the \namendment. We are trying to work that out. I have not asked for the \nyeas and nays on the Clinton amendment yet.\n  Mr. REID. I also say that we have been through this and we are trying \nto limit the votes to 10 minutes. We hope the majority leader will \ncondense the votes to 10 minutes; otherwise, we are going to be here \nreally late tonight.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are saying 10 minutes. I think the Senate will see \nwhat 10 minutes means this afternoon. If we are going to finish, we \nmust stick to that. So there will not be voting beyond 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Kennedy has 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 123\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my good friend from Alaska has alleged \nthat the appropriations bill already has funds for minority health. The \nfact is that this bill dramatically cuts funding for minority AIDS \ntreatment and prevention. It cuts the Office of Civil Rights and the \nOffice of Minority Health, and it has a small, inadequate increase for \nother minority health problems.\n  Let me focus on what this bill does for minority AIDS. Bear in mind \nthat we have an epidemic of AIDS in the minority community that is \nkilling and infecting minority men and women and children every day. \nLast year's appropriations bill set aside $123 million for AIDS efforts \nout of the Health Resources and Service Administration for the minority \nAIDS program. That is the Ryan White Program. You can search this \nSenate appropriations bill from cover to cover. You will not find it; \nit is not there. You will find $96 million for prevention and tracking \nof AIDS through the CDC set-aside for minorities in last year's bill. \nYou can look cover to cover in this Senate bill and you won't find it; \nit is not there. The list goes on.\n  So what does it mean to reject this amendment? It means that \nthousands of minority students will not enter the health professions to \nbecome doctors and nurses and scientists.\n  It means civil rights violations will continue to go uninvestigated \nand unpunished. It means tens of thousands of minority men, women, and \nchildren with AIDS will not get the medical care they need, and \nprevention efforts will be reduced.\n  On this Dr. Martin Luther King birthday week, let us stand up for \nminority health. Let us do what the new majority leader has said we \nshould do and put new emphasis on minority health. Let us do what the \ntrue spirit of America calls us to do. Let us try to bring the blessing \nof good health to all of our people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I hope my good friend from Massachusetts \nwill agree that this amendment would provide an additional $584 million \nfor various programs, and the amendment I offered provides $130 million \nmore than the bill that was before the Senate last year when it was \nmanaged by the Democratic Party.\n  My amendment also, I stated, provides $3.1 billion for a minority \nhealth, education, and training initiative which was not in the July \nbill that was before us. This is an increase of $144.3 million over the \n2002 level. That is the current level of funding for these programs.\n  Mr. President, I move to table this amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the \nSenator from Hawaii Inouye), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLeiberman) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 20 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\n\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Lieberman\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 89\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senate will now consider Senator \nClinton's amendment numbered 89, with 2 minutes on each side. I ask \nthat Senator Nickles take the time on our side.\n  I remind the Senate that all votes now will be 10 minutes for the \nrest of the afternoon, and 10 minutes means 10 minutes. If we are to \nfinish this evening, we cannot go on and on and on with these \namendments. Ten minutes means 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment. I \nurge the Senate to take action now because, in the event we do not \nfreeze the cuts that would go into effect, we will be facing disastrous \nimpacts throughout our Nation with respect to our physicians, our home \nhealth agencies, our skilled nursing homes, our Medicare+Choice \nprograms, our teaching hospitals, our community hospitals, our rural \nhospitals--all of which need to keep up with inflation and increasing \ncosts and demands.\n  If you look across our country you can see specifically the amount of \nmoney that our hospitals and all of our other health care providers \nwill lose if we do not take this action now to freeze these cuts before \nthey go into effect on the first of March.\n  This amendment provides for the freeze. It also provides for a 2-\npercent increase for physicians who otherwise are going to be leaving \nMedicare.\n  I really appreciate the commitment we have received from the Finance \nCommittee to address this issue. We will all be working diligently to \nensure we do address it. But in the meantime, our system is \ndeteriorating. The quality of service is decreasing. The numbers of \nproviders are not there to take care of the increased demand, and I \nurge the Senate to take this intermediary step to vote this 6-month \naction while we try to fix the program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Senate is not order in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I want to make sure from the \nSenator from New York this is the original proposal, not the modified \nproposal?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, it is the original proposal.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I urge our colleagues to vote to sustain a budget point \nof order that I will raise in just a moment. This is a bill that should \ngo through appropriate order, regular order. This is an entitlement \nprogram. These are big changes. These are changes we should do in the \nFinance Committee. These are changes for which we have bipartisan \nsupport in the Finance Committee, many, but they have to be worked out.\n  This is an amendment many of us saw just moments ago. It deals with \nbillions of dollars--actually I think it is about $4.1 billion.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee and also the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee did a fix for doctors, but there are a lot of \nother provisions we need to consider, dealing with some of the \nprovisions mentioned by the Senator from New York, but they need to be \ndealt with in a bipartisan way through the regular order through the \ncommittee. If we are going to bypass all the committees all the time, \nmaybe we don't need to have committees. Those on the Finance Committee \nwho have been working on this issue would like to have some input on it \nas well.\n  Therefore, the pending amendment by Senator Clinton includes an \nincrease in mandatory spending and, if adopted, would certainly \nincrease the deficit. Therefore I raise a point of order pursuant to \nsection 207 of H. Con. Res. 68, the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution \nas amended by S. Res. 304 from the 107th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask to speak using leader time for \napproximately 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, before doing that, I would be happy to \nyield to the Senator from New York. Was she about to respond?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. Majority Leader, I was going to move to waive the \nrelevant section of the Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays, but \nlet me wait until you are finished.\n  Mr. FRIST. It would be more appropriate for you to go ahead.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Pursuant to section 207(C) of H. Con. Res. 68, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000, I move to \nwaive section 207(B) of that concurrent resolution for purposes of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Using leader time, I just want to make a very brief \ncomment because this is a very important issue, an important issue to \nthe many seniors who are listening to this debate, and individuals with \ndisabilities, the physicians, the hospitals, the health care providers.\n  It is very clear to me that health care providers today are being \ninadequately paid under the Medicare Program, and that is why I, as has \nbeen pointed out earlier, regret the fact that we finished, adjourned \nthe 107th Congress, without passing legislation to provide seniors with \nprescription drug coverage and have more comprehensive strengthening of \nthe Medicare system.\n  But now, once we get finished with some of the unfinished business \nsuch as the appropriations bills, we have a new Congress, we have new \nleadership, and we absolutely will address strengthening Medicare head \non, including provider payments, including a prescription drug benefit \npackage for our seniors and individuals with disabilities.\n  This particular amendment has not been considered by the Finance \nCommittee. There are urgent needs that we are addressing in the \nunderlying Stevens amendment. It has been mentioned one of those is a \nflattening of this decrease in payments that we have seen for doctors \nover time, by freezing what otherwise would be a 4.4-percent cut for \nphysicians. The underlying Stevens amendment addresses that.\n  What the Senator from New York has proposed--part of that is contrary \nto the specific recommendations of MEDPAC, which is the advisory \ncommission specifically set up for us, in terms of learning what we \nshould be doing. A package such as this, as the Senator from Oklahoma \npointed out, does deserve careful vetting, careful consideration. We \nsimply have not had that opportunity to date.\n  Let me make it clear once again. My priority as majority leader, as a \nphysician, is to address in a comprehensive way, legislation that will \ndo things such as provide access to seniors, strengthen and improve the \nMedicare Program, as well as address provider payments, which this \nparticular amendment attempts to do. I look forward to working with my \nFinance Committee colleagues. I do want this to go through the Finance \nCommittee where we can have careful vetting and consideration as we \ndevelop this legislation which will strengthen Medicare.\n  In closing, I urge Senators to vote no to waive the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I hadn't intended to speak, but I will be\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\nbrief, and I will use some of my leader time to do so. Let me say three \nthings.\n  First, I don't know that there is a greater crisis in our country \ntoday than in what we are witnessing with providers in rural and urban \nareas alike. Whether it is doctors or nurses, facilities, nursing \nhomes--the crisis is as severe as any that I have seen in our lifetime.\n  Secondly, there are those who say this process ought to go through an \nappropriate legislative process, the way we would normally do things. I \ncouldn't agree more that the legislative process is a good one and we \nought to respect it.\n  But we have talked about providing relief, now, for years. There is a \ngreat deal in this bill that we are now supporting that had nothing to \ndo with the legislative process or committee consideration. This is an \nemergency that has to be addressed. I don't know how much longer we can \nwait. Of course, it is always better to go through the committee \nprocess, and where that is possible we ought to do so. But this doesn't \npreclude going through the committee process as we look at this issue \nover and over again in the coming months and years.\n  So it is critical we send the right message. At least the Senate \nought to go on record today that, at this point, with as difficult a \ntime as our health care industry is having, with the crisis we are \nfacing at the provider level, at the facility level, at the \ninstitutional level--throughout our country--we need to say without \nequivocation that we are going to be partners in fixing it. There is no \nbetter time to do that than right now. There is no better message to \nsend than the one we can send with this amendment. I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have the authority of the leader to \nyield 1 minute to me on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am trying to finish this bill tonight. We are trying \nto get this bill into conference with the House and to settle the 11 \nbills that were not passed last year, for whatever reason they were not \npassed.\n  This, with all due respect to the Senator from New York, is a Finance \nCommittee amendment. It would require the Ways and Means and Finance \nCommittees to meet, separate from us, in conference. It is not \nsomething that belongs on this bill. This is an appropriations bill. \nFor years we had points of order that would take these out of our \nconsideration, but I urge the Senate not to do this. There are a whole \nseries of other amendments coming up just like this one that deal with \nother subjects from other committees. They are legislative amendments.\n  We are going to finish this tonight by saying we are passing an \nappropriations bill or we are going to sit here and debate other \nlegislative items that should go to Finance or Energy or other \ncommittees all night.\n  I urge that the Senate vote no on this motion. I hope we will table \nthe other ones because we will have a series of them unless people \nlisten to us. Let us get out of here tonight.\n  I might add one little thing. In my lifetime, we have never met \nbefore the State of the Union Message. Do you know why? Because \nPresidents in the past were just like this one--trying to figure out \nwhat should be in the State of the Union Message and what should be in \nthe budget. This President can't decide what should be in the State of \nthe Union Message because we haven't yet finished last year's budget. I \nhope we can go home tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the \nSenator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman), are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 41, nays 56.\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 21 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--56\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Lieberman\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How long did that \nvote take?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 214\n\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield my minute to the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Dayton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona whose \nvigilance brought this matter to light.\n  This project is opposed by those who are supposed to carry it out, \nthe Army Corps of Engineers, the chief engineer of which, last August, \nsaid this project does not meet environmental standards. It does not \nmeet the cost-benefit analysis standards that are applied to every \nother water diversion project across the country.\n  So that North Dakota solution is, I am sorry to say: Well, let's \nwaive the standards and waive the tests. So we would not have a cost-\nbenefit analysis requirement. They do one, but it would not account for \nanything. And they pass this problem on to Minnesota and to Canada, \nboth of which oppose this project. The Canadian Government is opposed, \nthe State of Minnesota is opposed, the EPA is opposed, the Army Corps \nof Engineers is opposed, the major environmental groups in this area \nare opposed, everyone is opposed to this project, except for the State \nof North Dakota, which wants to pass this problem on to Minnesota.\n  That is why I ask my colleagues to join in opposition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition to the \namendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the time in opposition is on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, what has just been stated is not the case. \nThe Corps of Engineers is not opposed to this project. They have been \nworking on this project for years. EPA has not registered opposition to \nthis project. We have met with the Director.\n  Let me show my colleagues the problem we face. We have a lake called \nDevils Lake that has risen 26 vertical feet since 1992. The Federal \nGovernment has already had to spend $350 million raising roads, raising \nprotective dikes, and moving threatened structures and\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\npopulations. The Corps of Engineers has determined that if we have to \ncontinue to buy out communities--we have already had to buy one; the \nwater is lapping at the edge of a second town--if we have to buy out \nthe town of Devils Lake, it will cost billions of dollars.\n  The answer is, more storage in the upper basin and outlet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I urge my colleagues to support the tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), the \nSenator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the next amendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 230\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on a motion to table the \nMcCain amendment No. 230.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May we have order? The Senator has time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand I have 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would eliminate $14.5 \nmillion for construction activities for the Yazoo Pump Station in \nMississippi. It would require the completion of feasibility studies, \nenvironmental review, and the economic analysis that is required of \nother core projects.\n  If the project proceeds unimpeded, there are 200,000 acres of \nenvironmentally sensitive wetlands that would be destroyed and a host \nof other environmental problems that will ensue.\n  It is telling that the other Federal agencies charged with evaluating \nprojects and protecting the Nation's environment are opposed to the \nproject. The EPA has given, in the core analysis of this project, its \nlowest possible rating. And the analysis also revealed that the costs \nof the project far outweigh the benefits, questions that should be \nanswered before this project proceeds. I urge my colleagues not to \ntable the amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Senators should understand this is a \nproject that actually protects the environment in a more aggressive way \nthan it would have without the project being funded. Mr. President, \n62,500 acres of farmland will be reforested under this project, when \nthis project is complete. This is money that begins a process of \ndeveloping, design, and construction. It is at the early stage of work.\n  There are homes, hospitals, schools, businesses, roads, and bridges \nthat are flooded but for the construction of this project. It will get \nworse rather than better. These are mostly poor people who are affected \nin this area of Mississippi.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this amendment and vote aye on a motion \nto table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute \nwhile I explain the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is the last of the stacked votes. After this vote \nis over, we will start the process of bringing before the Senate the \namendments we have on both sides agreed to accept in groups. We expect \nthat will take an hour or so to accomplish. As I understand it, between \n4 and 5 there will be a briefing. We have asked for no votes during \nthat time.\n  I think Members know if their amendment is going to be accepted. If \nthere is anyone on either side who intends to ask for a vote on an \namendment, I urge them to notify either me or the Senator from Nevada, \nand we will then, hopefully, have a process to get those amendments \nvoted upon before 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Nevada \nhave a minute also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Mikulski offered an amendment \nearlier in the proceedings. There was some hope we could work that out. \nWe have not been able to do that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is right. I thought it was worked out. \nDuring this vote, we will try our best to work it out.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to the very cooperative Senator \nfrom Alaska, we have not been able to work out our amendment because of \na disagreement with OMB. Our colleagues have been most collegial, but \nwe have not been able to work it out. We have been able to work out the \nnurses amendment, but I do not believe we have been able to work out \nthe civil service quota amendment.\n  Mr. REID. The question is, Should we dispose of that after this vote?\n  Mr. STEVENS. If we do not dispose of it, it will be the first vote \nwhen we come back at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. I also say, because there are a lot of Members in the \nChamber now, we have scrubbed our side quite well. I have amendments \nstill by Senators Bingaman, Cantwell, Nelson, Lautenberg, Durbin, Dodd, \nLandrieu, and Wyden. They know the numbers of those amendments. I think \nthat is all we have. I hope that is all we have. That is eight. Even if \nwe have 10 minutes a side--my colleagues can add it up themselves--it \nis going to be quite a long night. I hope this is all. If it is not, we \nneed to know right away.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 230. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the \nSenator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the outcome of \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nSenate, the managers have now reviewed the 245 amendments that were \nfiled by the deadline on the omnibus bill. At this juncture, we \ncontinue to work to clear as many of these amendments as we can.\n  To facilitate the Senate's consideration of these amendments, we will \nnow present them grouped by the subcommittee with jurisdiction over \neach amendment. We intend to proceed in the following order this \nafternoon as we complete the review of each section.\n  The first section we will consider, and I will bring it to the desk \nin a moment, will be the Legislative Branch-Treasury bill; the second, \nCommerce, Justice, State; the third, Foreign Operations; the fourth, \nLabor-Health and Human Services; the fifth, Transportation-HUD-VA; \nsixth, Defense-Energy and Water; seventh, Agriculture; and the eighth, \nInterior.\n  There are also separate groups of amendments that require \nmodification to be adopted. We are going to handle them in a separate \ngroup.\n  The managers intend to call up amendments by number in each group and \nask for adoption en bloc. Any Senator, of course, is entitled to object \nto these amendments and needs to be on the floor so we can proceed to \ndebate and vote on amendments that may be objected to. These have been \ncleared on both sides of our Appropriations Committee by the \nsubcommittee staffs, by myself, and I believe the manager on the other \nside.\n  If we can adopt this process, it is still possible to finish today. \nWe do not know on this side yet how many amendments we may wish to have \na vote upon. I think this process may identify some of those.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator wishing to move forward on the first block \nat this time?\n\n\n           Amendments Nos. 165, 23, 70, 96, 113, 190, and 174\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will call that up now.

They all come under the heading of the \nLegislative Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. REID. Every amendment is fine, except No. 166; we need to look at \nthat, the second amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Byrd's? I will pull that out of the package, \nthen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WEST COAST GROUNDFISH FISHERY CAPACITY REDUCTION.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall implement a fishing \n     capacity reduction program for the West Coast groundfish \n     fishery pursuant to section 212 of P.L. 107-206 and 16 U.S.C. \n     1861a(b)-(e) except that, the program may apply to multiple \n     fisheries, except that: Within 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish a public \n     notice in the Federal Register and issue an invitation to bid \n     for reduction payments that specifies the contractual terms \n     and conditions under which bids shall be made and accepted \n     under this section; except that: Section 144(d)(1)(K)(3) of \n     Title I, Division B of P.L. 106-544 shall apply to the \n     program implemented by this section.\n       (b) A reduction fishery is eligible for capacity reduction \n     under the program implemented under this section, except that \n     no vessel harvesting and processing whiting in the catcher-\n     processors section (section 19 660.323(a)(4)(A) of title 50, \n     Code of Federal Regulations) may participate in any capacity \n     reduction referendum or industry fee established under this \n     section.\n       (c) A referendum on the industry fee system shall occur \n     after bids have been submitted, and such bids have been \n     accepted by the Secretary, as follows: members of the \n     reduction fishery, and persons who have been issued \n     Washington, Oregon, or California Dungeness Crab and Pink \n     Shrimp permits, shall be eligible to vote in the referendum \n     to approve an industry fee system; referendum votes cast in \n     each fishery shall be weighted in proportion to the debt \n     obligation of each fishery, as calculated in subsection (f) \n     of this section; the industry fee system shall be approved if \n     the referendum votes cast in favor of the proposed system \n     constitute a simple majority of the participants voting; \n     except that notwithstanding 5 U.S.C. 553 and 16 U.S.C. \n     1861a(e), the Secretary shall not prepare or publish proposed \n     or final regulations for the implementation of the program \n     under this section before the referendum is conducted.\n       (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit \n     the Pacific Fishery Management Council from recommending, or \n     the Secretary from approving, changes to any fishery \n     management plan, in accordance with applicable law; or the \n     Secretary from promulgating regulations (including \n     regulations governing this program), after an industry fee \n     system has been approved by the reduction fishery.\n       (e) The Secretary shall determine, and state in the public \n     notice published under paragraph (a), all program \n     implementation aspects the Secretary deems relevant.\n       (f) Any bid submitted in response to the invitation to bid \n     issued by the Secretary under this section shall be \n     irrevocable; the Secretary shall use a bid acceptance \n     procedure that ranks each bid in accordance with this \n     paragraph and with additional criteria, if any, established \n     by the Secretary: for each bid from a qualified bidder that \n     meets the bidding requirements in the public notice or the \n     invitation to bid, the Secretary shall determine a bid score \n     by dividing the bid's dollar amount by the average annual \n     total ex-vessel dollar value of landings of Pacific \n     groundfish, Dungeness crab, and Pink shrimp base on the 3 \n     highest total annual revenues earned from such stocks that \n     the bidder's reduction vessel landed during 1998, 1999, \n     2000 or 2001. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``total annual revenue'' means the revenue earned in a \n     single year from such stocks. The secretary shall accept \n     each qualified bid in rank order of bid score from the \n     lowest to the highest until acceptance of the next \n     qualified bid with the next lowest bid score would cause \n     the reduction cost to exceed the reduction loan's maximum \n     amount. Acceptance of a bid by the Secretary shall create \n     a binding reduction contract between the United States and \n     the person whose bid is accepted, the performance of which \n     shall be subject only to the conclusion of a successful \n     referendum, except that a person whose bid is accepted by \n     the Secretary under this section shall relinquish all \n     permits in the reduction fishery and any Dungeness crab \n     and Pink shrimp permits issued by Washington, Oregon, or \n     California, except that the Secretary shall revoke the \n     Pacific groundfish permit, as well as all Federal fishery \n     licenses, fishery permits, area, and species endorsements, \n     and any other fishery privileges issued to a vessel or \n     vessels (or to persons on the basis of their operation or \n     ownership of that vessel or vessels) removed under the \n     program.\n       (g) The Secretary shall establish separate reduction loan \n     sub-amounts and repayment fees for fish sellers in the \n     reduction fishery and for fish sellers in each of the fee-\n     share fisheries by dividing the total ex-vessel dollar value \n     during the bid scoring period of all reduction vessel \n     landings from the reduction fishery and from each of the fee-\n     share fisheries by the total such value of all such landings \n     for all such fisheries; and multiplying the reduction loan \n     amount by each of the quotients resulting from each of the \n     divisions above. Each of the resulting products shall be the \n     reduction loan sub-amount for the reduction fishery and for \n     each of the fee-share fisheries to which each of such \n     products pertains, except that, each fish seller in the \n     reduction fishery and in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     shall pay the fees required by the reduction loan sub-amounts \n     allocated to it under this paragraph, except that, the \n     Secretary may enter into agreements with Washington, Oregon, \n     and California to collect any fees established under this \n     paragraph.\n       (h) Notwithstanding 46 U.S.C. App. 1279(b)(4), the \n     reduction loan's term shall not be less than 30 years.\n       (i) It is the sense of the Congress that the States of \n     Washington, Oregon, and California should revoke all \n     relinquishment permits in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     immediately after reduction payment, and otherwise to \n     implement appropriate State fisheries management and \n     conservation provisions in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     that establishes a program that meets the requirements of 16 \n     U.S.C. 141861a(b)(1)(B) as if were applicable to fee-share \n     fisheries.\n       (j) The term ``fee-share fishery'' means a fishery, other \n     than the reduction fishery, whose members are eligible to \n     vote in a referendum for an industry fee system under \n     paragraph (c). The term ``reduction fishery'' means that \n     portion of a fishery holding limited entry fishing permits \n     endorsed for the operation of trawl gear and issued under the \n     Federal Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 72\n\n(Purpose: To provide necessary funding for the Crime-free Rural States \n     by offsetting funds by reducing the account for buildings and \n                facilities of the Federal Prison System)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the joint resolution, insert \n     the following:\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\n       Sec. ____.

Mr. President, I would like to have a word with the \nChairman concerning funding for the war on methamphetamine production \nand trafficking. I appreciate your accepting my amendment to allocate \n$10 million for the continuance of methamphetamine reduction efforts. I \nunderstand that these funds will come from the $50 million in the bill \ndesignated for policing initiatives to combat methamphetamine \nproduction and trafficking and to enhance policing initiatives in drug \nhot spots. It is also my understanding that this $10 million will be \nused to combat meth production and distribution in the State of Iowa. \nThis money will go to the Iowa Office of Drug Control Policy to fund \nprograms that I consider essential to treating and controlling the drug \nproblem in the State of Iowa. These programs would include a Drug-Free \nWorkplace Coordinator to help educate employees to deter and detect \nuse, and put procedures in place to take corrective action if there is \na workplace-related substance abuse problem; various community \nprevention, intervention, and treatment programs; and for a Meth Safe \nHouse in Iowa to provide a safe and drug-free environment for \nrecovering meth addicts, and help push them away from the negative \ninfluences that previously fed their addiction.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I was pleased to be able to make the Senator's amendment \na part of the manager's package. The Senator's understanding is \ncorrect. This $10 million will go to the Iowa Office of Drug Control \nPolicy to fund programs to combat methamphetamine production and \ntrafficking.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment \nalong with Senator Clinton that would prevent the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service from deporting the spouses of children of the \nvictims of the September 11 attacks. This simple legislation would \nallow some 300 people who are still grieving the loss of their loved \nones to remain in the United States to sort out their affairs.\n  The Patriot Act responsibly included a provision that allowed \nnonimmigrant survivors of victims of the September 11 attacks to remain \nin the United States until September 11, 2002. That length of time, \nhowever, was not sufficient for those families to sort out their \naffairs before returning to their countries of origin.\n  I remain steadfast in my belief that these families should be \npermitted to stay in the United States indefinitely as legal permanent \nresidents. I intend to raise that issue in the future. This amendment, \nhowever, is crafted narrowly as a stopgap humanitarian response to the \neveryday challenges these families face before being able to return to \ntheir native countries. Tough in mourning for well over a year, many \nwidows and children have not recovered the remains of their loved ones. \nInstead, they are awaiting DNA analyses of the samples collected from \nthe attack site.\n  The children of these widows and widowers are enrolled in American \nschools. In fact, some are native-born American citizens and would have \nto return to a country they don't know or face the prospect of \nseparating from their one surviving parent.\n  The great majority of these families is still awaiting awards from \nthe victims' compensation fund. They have homes that will need to be \nsold and other unfamiliar financial matters to settle before returning \nto their native countries. And many are participating in support groups \nwith other survivors, groups that simply will not exist in their birth \ncountry. It would be inhumane to deport them at this time.\n  This amendment will provide these brave families with additional time \nto attend to their affairs and undertake the unenviable task of \ndismantling their lives in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this simple but important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a provision that the \nSenate agreed to earlier today and that is of particular importance for \nmy State of Vermont--my amendment to appropriate $10 million for the \nCrime-Free Rural States Program. I worked to authorize this program \nlast year in the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act, which was signed into law last November.\n  This program will provide crucial law enforcement assistance to rural \nStates that are struggling with a variety of crime problems. It \nprovides for grants to State criminal justice, Byrne, or other \ndesignated agencies to develop rural States' capacity to assist local \ncommunities in the prevention and reduction of crime, violence, and \nsubstance abuse.\n  This program gives States the flexibility to use the funding where it \nis most needed. For example, Vermont is suffering terribly from a rapid \nincrease in the abuse of heroin that has put an extraordinary burden on \nour communities and our law enforcement agencies. Vermont could use the \nmoney provided by this program to help local governments address this \ncrisis.\n  Rural States face unique problems in their efforts to reduce crime, \nwith small numbers of law enforcement officers responsible for \nprotecting widely-dispersed communities. As drugs and\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\nviolent crime have become more prevalent in remote regions of our \nNation, law enforcement officers in those areas have seen their jobs \nbecome increasingly difficult. This program, which States would \nadminister with the assistance of the National Crime Prevention \nCouncil, would help State and local law enforcement by promoting \ninnovation in the development of crime-fighting technology and by \nfunding the development of statewide strategic plans, including \nperformance targets to ensure the funding is well-spent.\n  This program will provide crucial assistance to rural States. I thank \nSenators Stevens, Byrd, Gregg, and Hollings for accepting it as part of \nthe managers' package. In addition, I urge the conference committee \nthat will reconcile the House and Senate-passed bills to retain this \nprovision, and give rural States assistance they so desperately need.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 191, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been asked, notwithstanding the \nactions taken so far, to ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 191 \nbe reconsidered--brought back to the desk in order that one word might \nbe changed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send the modification to the desk. It changes the word \n``shall'' to ``may.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is further \nmodified.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the modification I made to \namendment No. 191 be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge passage of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 191), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 138\n\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the managers of the bill. In an effort to \nsave time, we ask that we move to the Bingaman amendment No. 138 and \nthere be 20 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. And prior to the vote, that there be no second-degree \namendment filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before discussing the Bingaman amendment \nNo. 138, I ask unanimous consent first, with regard to amendment No. \n126, that Senator Domenici and Senator Landrieu be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask that that amendment be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Ms. Collins, Mr. Kennedy, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 138.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 138\n\n  (Purpose: To extend the QI-1 program under title XIX of the Social \n           Security Act through the end of fiscal year 2003)\n\n       On page 1047, between lines 19 and 20, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 404. Section 136 of Public Law 107-229, as added by \n     section 5 of Public Law 107-240, is amended by striking ``60 \n     days after the date specified in section 107(c) of Public Law \n     107-229, as amended'' and inserting ``September 30, 2003''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Collins, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Landrieu. The \npurpose is to extend a critical Federal-State program that assists low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries to pay their health premium costs.\n  This program that has been on the books, now, since 1997 and that I \nam trying to extend to the end of this fiscal year, the end of \nSeptember, is one which allows States to use Medicaid funds to assist \nthese low-income individuals in paying their Medicare premiums. It is \nfor low-income seniors. It was enacted as part of the 1997 Balanced \nBudget Act. It was slated for reauthorization at the end of this last \nyear, 2002. Unfortunately, we did not enact any Medicare or Medicaid \nlegislation as part of the 107th Congress, so the program was extended \nby the last two continuing resolutions.\n  The current continuing resolution under which we are operating the \nGovernment right now provides for extension of this until March 12. The \namendment I am offering would further extend this through September 30 \nof 2003.\n  The program to which I am referring is called the QI-1 Program, \nQualifying Individual Program, within Medicaid. It is a block grant \npayment to States to pay the Medicare Part B premium. This Part B \npremium is $58.70 per month this year.\n  This program only applies to individuals who have monthly incomes \nbetween $887 and $997. So if you have an income over $997 per month, \nyou are not qualified to participate in the program I am trying to \nextend. In the case of a couple, the income of the couple can be \nanywhere between $1,194 and $1,344. This represents an effort to cover \nMedicare beneficiaries with incomes between 120 and 135 percent of the \nFederal poverty level. This amounts to a little over $700 annually for \nmany of these older and disabled Americans who depend upon this payment \nfor a portion of their health care costs. This is for such things as \nprescription drugs and supplemental coverage. We have over 120,000 \npeople nationwide who currently rely on this QI-1 Program. They will be \nhard pressed to afford Medicare coverage unless this assistance is \ncontinued.\n  In short, to prevent the erosion of existing low-income protections, \nCongress needs to extend the 5-year Federal allocation for the QI-1 \nProgram this year.\n  We do not know the exact number of people who are eligible for this \nparticular program--that is, the number of Medicare beneficiaries who \nhave incomes between 120 percent and 135 percent of poverty--but the \nestimate we have is there are about a million of these individuals. We \nhave about 120,000, as I indicated before, who are actually enrolled, \nalthough the numbers are likely far higher than that. We have missing \ndata from several States, and it is very difficult to calculate it.\n  In my State of New Mexico, for example, we know there are almost \n1,000 New Mexicans who are currently enrolled in the QI-1 Program. This \ndisenrolling of these low-income Medicare beneficiaries, which is what \nwe would do if we did not adopt my amendment--we would disenroll these \npeople from the program--it would cost each and every one of them $700 \nannually. It could have a significant impact on their health.\n  In a letter from the Medicare Rights Center, they gave an example of \nthe kind of person who is affected by this amendment. The example was a \n69-year-old widow with severe arthritis, hypertension, and high \ncholesterol who lives here in our Nation's Capital. This woman, \nreferred to as Mrs. B, does not qualify for Medicaid, yet she cannot \nafford premiums for a Medicare HMO or a Medigap plan. The QI-1 Program \ndoes cover her Part B premium of over $700 per year. If she loses that \nassistance, as she will unless the amendment we are offering here is \nadopted--if she loses that assistance, she does not know how she could \nmake ends meet since she already struggles to buy food, to pay her \nMedicare copayment, and to purchase\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\nprescription drugs. As I indicated before, in order to qualify for this \npayment which she is now receiving, she cannot have an income of over \n$997 per month.\n\n  This is a bipartisan issue. President Bush has included the QI-1 \nreauthorization in his fiscal year 2003 budget. When we had the \nconfirmation hearing in the Health and Education Committee on the new \nCommissioner for the Food and Drug Administration, Mark McClellan, he \ntestified that the administration continues to support the \nreauthorization of this program.\n  In addition, QI-1 reauthorization was also included in S. 3018, which \nis the Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity Act. This was a \nbill that Senators Grassley and Baucus introduced late last year.\n  During every Senate race around this country last fall, candidates on \nboth sides of the aisle promised our Nation's seniors and disabled \nMedicare beneficiaries improved health coverage with the addition of a \nprescription drug benefit. While they are waiting for us to enact that \nprescription drug benefit, low-income Medicare beneficiaries should not \nbe blindsided by the loss of critically needed premium protection that \nis provided in the QI-1 Program.\n  I urge the passage of this amendment to extend the program another \n6\\1/2\\ months. I urge my colleagues to join me in addressing the issue \non a more permanent basis in the coming months. There are at least \n120,000 low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are counting on us.\n  Let me also respond very briefly to some comments my colleague from \nPennsylvania made earlier, where he said all of these amendments that \nare being offered are new money.\n  This is not new money. This is an existing program. It is a program \nthat has been in place for 5 years. There are 120,000 individuals out \nthere who are depending upon us continuing to assist them in making \nthese Medicare premium payments. This is not an example of growing \ngovernment, as was suggested. This is an example of maintaining a \nbenefit for low-income seniors and disabled individuals in our society.\n  Let me indicate a few of the numbers we are talking about in \ndifferent States so my colleagues have a sense of what is involved.\n  In the State of Alabama, there are 9,817 individuals currently \nreceiving this benefit; in the State of Arizona, there are 5,620; in \nthe State of Florida, there are 13,769; in the State of Kentucky, \n4,329; Louisiana, 5,596; New Jersey, 7,214; North Carolina, 9,059; \nOhio, 8,362; and Oklahoma, 3,169. There are many individuals who depend \nupon this payment. The correct thing to do, and the right thing to do, \nis for us to adopt this amendment.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 10 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time on \nthat amendment and ask unanimous consent that it be set aside \ntemporarily so Senator Cantwell might present her amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Cantwell has agreed to bring up \namendment No. 104 with 20 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. May I ask what the unanimous consent request is?\n  Mr. REID. Cantwell for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would still have the initial minute or so?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. One minute prior to the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 108\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell], for herself and \n     Mr. Nelson, proposes an amendment numbered 108.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 108\n\n     (Purpose: To increase appropriations for workforce investment \n                              activities)\n\n       On page 549, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated under \n     this Act for title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 \n     (29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.), $678,551,000 is appropriated to \n     carry out that Act, of which--\n       (1) $156,965,000 (which is available for obligation for the \n     period April 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004) shall be for \n     making allotments and grants in accordance with subparagraphs \n     (B) and (C) of section 127(b)(1) of that Act (29 U.S.C. \n     2852(b)(1)) (relating to youth activities);\n       (2) $76,000,000 (which is available for obligation for the \n     period July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004) shall be for \n     making allotments and grants in accordance with section \n     132(b)(1) of that Act (29 U.S.C. 2862(b)(1)) (relating to \n     employment and training activities for adults);\n       (3) $206,096,000 (which is available for obligation for the \n     period July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004) shall be for \n     making allotments and grants in accordance with section \n     132(b)(2) of that Act (29 U.S.C. 2862(b)(2)) (relating to \n     employment and training activities for dislocated workers);\n       (4) $181,890,000 (which is available for obligation for the \n     period April 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004) shall be for use \n     under section 169 of that Act (29 U.S.C. 2914) (relating to \n     youth opportunity grants); and\n       (5) $57,600,000 (which is available for obligation for the \n     period July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2006) shall be for \n     carrying out subtitle C of title I of that Act (29 U.S.C. \n     2881 et seq.) (relating to the Job Corps).\n\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, funds \n     provided under the preceding sentence shall not result in a \n     further across-the-board rescission under section 601 of \n     division N.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the \nfollowing Senators as cosponsors of my amendment: Senators Kennedy, \nBingaman, Murray, Boxer, Akaka, Clinton, Sarbanes, and Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important amendment sponsored by myself, the Senator from \nFlorida, and others, which restores essential funding for education and \njob training in America.\n  Job training should be our first priority, not our last priority. \nAmerican workers want to learn new skills, and businesses are looking \nfor skilled workers. So it would be a terrible decision today to deny \nthem the opportunity to provide job training so that they can go back \nto work. But that is exactly what we are doing in this omnibus bill \ntoday. In fact, this bill is a 10-percent cut in the fiscal year 2002 \nfunding level. That is a 10-percent cut in the fiscal year 2002 level \nafter the Senate Appropriations Committee voted last year to increase \nthat number to a higher amount. My amendment restores the original \ncommittee level.\n  Some would argue that these funds have no material impact because \nthey would like to say that fiscal year 2002 funds that haven't yet \nbeen distributed could also be used to offset this cut that is being \nproposed by the administration. That is like saying there is a magic \nslush fund for job training when there isn't. The fact is that job \ntraining dollars--because the programs continue for several years--are \ncommitted over a 2- or 3-year period of time. That is how they make the \nprograms effective. In fact, if this amendment does not pass today and \nwe do not make a decision to restore these cuts, over 65,000 job \ntraining opportunities will be lost in America.\n  To further bolster this notion of the fact that these cuts really \nwill take effect and have full impact, I point out to my colleague the \nGAO study on this very issue on whether the States were spending their \nworkforce investment dollars. In fact, quoting from the report, it \nsaid:\n\n       States are spending their funds faster than required by \n     law. And even though 44 percent of the program funds for year \n     2001 are being carried over to 2002, many of these funds have \n     already been committed. Furthermore, because of reporting \n     inconsistencies, the Department of Labor data do not \n     adequately reflect the funds and how they have been obligated \n     in long-term commitments.\n\n  What does this mean? It means that GAO is saying there is no magic \nslush fund. If we make this cut today, we will actually see a cut in \nreduction in programs.\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\n  Some of my colleagues ask: What is so serious about that? Maybe we \nneed a little belt tightening. I point out to my colleagues that we are \ngoing through rough economic times. Actually retraining workers who are \nthen rehired by a company to add to their bottom-line profitability is \na good economic stimulus package. As Stephanie Powers, CEO of the \nNational Association of Workforce Boards, wrote me:\n\n       We strongly agree with the GAO's report and we support \n     maintaining current funding levels. We are on the front line \n     of serving over 2.3 million workers who have lost their jobs \n     over the last two years, and this cut would dramatically \n     impede our ability to meet these services at a very \n     critical time.\n\n  If there is a silver lining to this economic recession we have been \nin, it is the fact that there are companies and there are businesses \nthat say they still want to hire workers but can't find the skilled \nworkers they need.\n  Take the health care industry, for example. The American Hospital \nAssociation estimates that there are currently over 126,000 unfilled \nnursing positions in the country. Why would we take money away from the \ntraining programs to retrain individuals who have lost their jobs and \nwho could go into nursing to give their families an income and give the \nhealth care industry the workers they need?\n  While we are facing tough economic times, we are also simply facing a \nskills gap. The best way to deal with that skills gap is to give the \ndislocated workers the opportunity to improve their skills. That is \nwhy, given the high unemployment rate, and the unemployment claims just \nlast week increasing by 18,000 and over 2 million people having lost \ntheir jobs in the last 2 years, this amendment would actually be the \neconomic stimulus we are looking for.\n  I don't think job training is a political issue or a partisan issue. \nIn fact, last year I was enthused by the fact that a majority of \nMembers of the Senate signed a letter asking the Senate Appropriators \nto increase funding for Job Training Programs. Of those Senators who \nsigned the letter, I want to read from it and quote that they said:\n\n       We are writing to express our support for increasing the \n     funding for 2003. The ability of a skilled workforce is \n     critical to our Nation's economy and will provide the \n     adequate support for job training. We are concerned that the \n     unemployment landscape may not turn around rapidly and that \n     these displaced workers will not be able to return to their \n     former jobs. Many of them need to prepare for new jobs in the \n     workforce.\n\n  If the same colleagues who signed this letter will vote for this \namendment today, we can put this issue to rest and give the American \nworkers the kind of job training and skills they need.\n  This amendment will accomplish a stimulus for our economy that is \nmuch needed. It will make sure that we don't say no to workers and no \nto the businesses that are looking for help, and it will make sure that \nwe will say yes to tomorrow's economic opportunities for all of us. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, how much time does Senator \nCantwell have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes three seconds.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of Senator \nCantwell's amendment and the Workforce Investment Act program amount \nshe is seeking. The bottom line is workforce training in a time when \nour economy is in a recession. One of the things we want to do is, when \npeople are thrown of work, we want to get them retrained with skills so \nthey can obtain work. So that is what this is all about.\n\n  This funding that we are trying to restore was already provided in \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee-passed bill; but subsequently, with \nthese across-the-board cuts, it has been severely nicked, to the tune \nof what we are trying to restore.\n  Why do we want to restore this amount, other than because of the \ncommonsense answer that you want to provide job training for folks out \nof work? It assists workers who lose their jobs as a result of \ncircumstances beyond their control. It helps Americans gain an element \nof self-sufficiency.\n  This is not the time to cut funding for programs that give Americans \nthe tools, the guidance, and the skills they need to handle these \nproblems.\n  I am very much a proponent of this Workforce Investment Act because I \nhave seen what it can do. I have seen the workforce centers in Florida. \nWe have about four. I have been to one of those centers. And what do \nthey do? They train young people to have a saleable skill in the job \nmarket. And they have an incredible success rate of placing 80 percent. \nAnd those 80 percent are in jobs that last some number of months. That \nis an incredible success rate.\n  Since its inauguration way back in 1964, the Job Corps has provided \nover 2 million disadvantaged youth with the integrated, academic, \nvocational, and social skills training they needed to gain \nindependence.\n  In closing, I wish to share an e-mail I recently received from an \norganization committed to providing education to young adults down in \nTampa. This is what the e-mail said:\n\n       We have helped 178 youths get a High School Diploma, 171 \n     youths enter college, 605 youths complete Job Readiness \n     Training and almost 800! youths have found jobs.\n\n  These are real results, results that may not be duplicated if we do \nnot continue to invest in providing employment training and opportunity \nfor disadvantaged Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  All time in support of the amendment has been utilized.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment be \nset aside, the time reserved as it is now, pending another amendment to \nbe offered and debated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from Wyoming wish to speak on the \nCantwell amendment?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Cantwell \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes nine seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator from Wyoming such time as he wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us is the Workforce Investment \nAct amendment which appropriates an additional $678 million for \nprograms under title I of the Workforce Investment Act. It has some \nmoney for all of the different processes: youth activities, employment \nand training activities, opportunity grants, and Job Corps.\n  The managers' amendment to the omnibus appropriations bill provides \n$5.12 billion for training and employment services. That is $144.3 \nmillion above the budget request. Of this total amount, the bill \nprovides $1.38 billion for dislocated worker activities.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training, I \nhave been a strong supporter of the Workforce Investment Act. In fact, \nI have joined with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in efforts \nto provide sufficient funding for the Workforce Investment Act.\n  Therefore, I have to carefully explain why I am opposing this \namendment. Let me be clear, I am not questioning the importance of job \ntraining in these\n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\ndifficult economic times, nor am I questioning the importance of the \nWorkforce Investment Act as our Federal workforce development system. \nHowever, I am opposing an amendment that increases funding without \noffsetting such increased amounts. I am opposing an amendment that \nincreases funding by $678 million that is not targeted to the \nindividuals who are most in need of job training and assistance. Of the \n$678 million increase in funding, only $206.1 million will go to \ndislocated worker programs, those individuals who are most in need of \nassistance to get back to work.\n  The President's economic stimulus proposal gives $3.6 billion to fund \npersonal reemployment accounts to individuals who need the most help \ngetting back to work. These accounts can be used for job training, \nchild care, transportation, or other expenses associated with finding a \nnew job. These accounts will be administered through the Workforce \nInvestment Act's One-Stop Career Center. The personal reemployment \naccounts proposed by the President are both targeted and flexible, \nunlike the amendment before us.\n  Most importantly, the Workforce Investment Act is up for \nreauthorization this year. My subcommittee will shortly be commencing \nhearings on the reauthorization. During the reauthorization process, we \nwill be considering funding issues for the Workforce Investment Act to \ndetermine how resources are most effectively used for people who need \nit most. This is not the time to address these issues. We need to \ncomplete our work on fiscal year 2003 appropriations now. The time to \naddress the Workforce Investment Act is during the reauthorization of \nthe bill this coming year which will be one of my priorities as \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Employment, Safety, and Training.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to oppose the amendment. It is not \noffset. It is new money.

Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nredirect funding that was made available in the Transportation Equity \nAct for the 21st Century for the construction of a pedestrian and \nbicycle bridge across the Susquehanna between Havre de Grace and \nPerryville, MD to a related project.\n  During a tour of Havre de Grace and Perryville in April 1998, the \nmayors of the two towns and members of the Lower Susquehanna Heritage \nGreenway Committee, briefed me on the Heritage Greenway plan and \nexpressed a hope that the two towns would one day be connected by a \npedestrian/bicycle bridge. There are three bridges spanning the \nSusquehanna River at U.S. Route 1, I-95 and U.S. Route 40, but for \nsafety reasons Maryland State Highway Administration policy prohibits \npedestrian/bike traffic on these bridges. The Lower Susquehanna \nGreenway Resource Report dated January, 1994 identified the need to \nlink greenway trails along the river in Harford and Cecil Counties via \na river crossing and identified a potential crossing site which would \nutilize the old Route 40 piers that parallel the existing Amtrak \nbridge.\n  In order to help facilitate construction of a pedestrian and bicycle \nbridge at this site, Senator Mikulski and I succeeded in getting a \nprovision included in TEA-21 which provided $1.25 million for this \nproject. Using a portion of the funds, the State Highway Administration \nconducted an engineering analysis of the existing piers and determined \nthat the piers could not support such a bridge without significant and \ncostly structural and other improvements. Since that time the \nSusquehanna Heritage Greenway Committee has been examining other \noptions, including a ferry boat and a pedestrian/bicycle bridge \ncrossing further upstream. My amendment would give the committee \nadditional flexibility to undertake these potential crossing \nalternatives and related Lower Susquehanna Heritage Greenway projects. \nI urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss provisions in the \nOmnibus Appropriations bill relating to Price-Anderson nuclear \nliability. As you know Price-Anderson coverage for NRC licensees ended \nlast August 1. Extension of Price-Anderson had been agreed upon by \nconferees on last Session's Comprehensive Energy Bill, but the demise \nof that Bill ended hopes of extension of Price-Anderson before it \nlapsed.\n  I've discussed this situation with Senator Inhofe and Senator \nVoinovich, from their perspectives involving the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee with jurisdiction over Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nissues. I'm pleased that they concur that the nation is best served by \nprompt renewal of Price-Anderson legislation, retroactive to August 1 \nof last year, to ensure that both NRC licensees and Department of \nEnergy contractors are subject to its full provisions. I believe we \nagreed that the language agreed to by the energy bill conferees last \nyear was adequate to accomplish this goal.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Environment and Public Works Committee has had Price-\nAnderson reauthorization bills referred to it in three consecutive \nCongresses now--my bill, S. 2292, in the 106th Congress as well as \nSenator Voinovich's bills, S. 1591 and S. 1360 from the 107th Congress \nand S. 156 in this 108th Congress. I laud Senator Voinovich's diligent \nand effective work on this legislation. I would also like to thank \nEnvironmental and Public Works Committee staff and associated staff who \nhave worked on this legislation, especially Andrew Wheeler, Lewis \nRenjel, Marty Hall, Brian Mormino, and Aloysius Hogan.\n  It is quite appropriate that the passage of this legislation be one \nof the first actions of the new Republican majority in the U.S. Senate. \nIndeed, I had scheduled the passage of Senator Voinovich's bill S. 156 \nfor my first Environment and Public Works Committee mark-up as Chairman \nin this 108th Congress. Moreover, in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee I look forward to further productive oversight and \nlegislation regarding the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, control of \nnuclear energy, infrastructure, and continued environmental enhancement \nfor our flora, fauna, air, water, and soil.\n  I support the opportunity to enact this legislation promptly on this \nomnibus appropriations bill in lieu of Environment and Public Works \nCommittee action. By fostering the clean-up of our soil and water and \nby fostering clean air energy sources, the legislation we pass in this \nbill is good for our environment. The sooner we enact this legislation, \nthe better for our environment.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I concur with both of my colleagues, Senators Inhofe \nand Domenici, that prompt, retroactive renewal of the Price-Anderson \nprogram is in the best interest of the Nation. We need to do whatever \nwe can to promote a safe and efficient nuclear energy industry and \nencourage the development of new nuclear reactors. Reauthorizing the \nPrice-Anderson Act is a major step in that direction.\n  Almost a year before the program was to expire, on August 3, 2001, I \nintroduced S. 1360 and shortly thereafter S. 1591 to reauthorize the \nAct. During consideration of the Energy bill, I then proposed an \namendment that included the provisions of my bills. While my colleagues \nrecognized the importance of the amendment and passed it by a vote of \n78-21, the Energy bill was ultimately not considered. Thus, I recently \nreintroduced my bill from last Congress as S. 156.\n  I am pleased that this matter is finally being handled in the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill with the inclusion of the House and Senate \ncompromise language of my amendment.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 49\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nensure the integrity of a shoreline protection system that was \nconstructed by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1985 at Tall Times, MD to \nmitigate the erosion induced by the Herring Creek entrance jetties.\n  The Herring Creek Navigation Project, located on the left bank of the \nPotomac River in St. Mary's County, MD, was constructed in 1960 by the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers to maintain a navigable channel at the \ninlet. Although the jetties functioned as designed, they blocked the \nnatural drift of sand along the shoreline and caused significant \nerosion in the area downstream of the project. To correct this erosion \nproblem, in 1985 the Corps of Engineers implemented a mitigation \nproject under the authority of section 111 of the River and Harbors Act \nof 1968. The modification consisted of construction of 250 feet of \nbeach fill and 2,187 linear feet of stone revetment, and upgrading 350 \nlinear feet of existing revetment along the Tall Timbers waterfront, \nsouth of the project inlet. The revetment was constructed essentially \non top of an existing wooden bulkhead built by St. Mary's County in \n1950. Herein lies the problem: the wooden bulkhead is failing in \nsections, causing huge sinkholes on private property, and undermining \nthe integrity of the revetment.\n  Although the Local Cooperation Agreement specified that the Army \nCorps of Engineers was responsible for maintaining the revetment, it \ndid not specify who would be responsible for maintaining the bulkhead. \nSt. Mary's County and local residents assert that this is a Corps \nresponsibility. The Corps asserts that it does not have the authority \nto repair the bulkhead.\n  The amendment that Senator Mikulski and I are offering would clarify \nthe responsibilities of the Army Corps of Engineers to provide \nmaintenance of the project. It should be pointed out that, should the \nentire bulkhead fail, the revetment will also fail and the Corps would \nbe responsible for replacing the entire revetment at a cost of well \nover $1 million. This is an instance where an ounce of prevention now \nwill prevent a pound of federal expenditures later. I urge adoption of \nthe amendment.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 59\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of an amendment \nthat was offered by my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden.\n  I want to begin with a USA Today article from February 27, 2002 \nentitled\n\n[[Page S1415]]\n\n``Bush Cheney Champion Privacy--for themselves'' by Tony Mauro.\n  The article describes how the administration is very concerned about \nprotecting privacy when it comes to protecting their meetings to \ndevelop an energy policy for our Nation. As Mr. Mauro writes, ``Cheney \nand Bush want privacy for their conversations, but not for anyone \nelse's.''\n  This article also sheds light on how the administration places a \npremium on privacy. Unfortunately, its leaders seem to value secrecy \nmainly to protect themselves from embarrassing revelations or to \nprotect their corporate cronies from public scrutiny.\n  And yet while the White House was fighting vigorously to prevent the \nAmerican people from getting access to government records, the \nadministration was working arduously to ensure that government would \nhave unprecedented access into the personal lives of the American \npeople through electronic records.\n  Today, my colleague from Oregon is offering an amendment to ensure \nthat such a program does not go forward unless the privacy of the \nAmerican people is assured.\n  This week, many of my colleagues have joined me in speaking on civil \nrights and civil liberties. I feel strongly that we must defend the \ncivil liberties of Nevadans and all Americans, including their \nfundamental right to privacy.\n  After September 11, our Nation was forced to reflect on the freedoms \nwe so often take for granted.\n  Americans have accepted many restrictions on those freedoms, because \nthey recognized some limits were necessary to provide security against \nterrorists and other realistic threats, and because they believed these \nrestrictions would be administered justly.\n  So we tolerate waiting several hours to board airplanes, because we \nknow it necessary to check our luggage more rigorously than ever \nbefore.\n  But the program my distinguished colleague from Oregon is describing \nconcerns me, and I have heard from many Nevadans expressing their \nopposition to the White House plan unless we have greater assurances \nthat it will not infringe upon our precious privacy.\n\n  Senator Wyden's amendment aims to curtail the Total Information \nAwareness program being funded at the Defense Advanced Research \nProjects Agency, which is an effort to develop a digital description of \neach and every one of us, available in nanoseconds.\n  This digital ``you'' will be made up of every credit card purchase, \nevery bank transaction, every driver's license application, every court \nrecord, and every library book loan you ever borrowed.\n  The Federal Government will store all this information--ready to be \nprocessed in a moment's notice.\n  Sound like a good idea?\n  I don't think so for a very simple reason: No one has figured out how \nthis information is going to be protected, so that you don't become the \nvictim of an overzealous Government snoop.\n  The Total Information Awareness program is doing nothing to protect \nthat privacy. Instead of being an electronic Fort Knox, TIA is going to \nbe a gold mine for privacy violations.\n  In fact, the White House decided to pick a John Poindexter to run the \nproject. He may be a brilliant man, but he was also convicted of lying \nto Congress in the Iran-Contra scandal.\n  How are we supposed to believe a man who lied to Congress when he \ntells us that your privacy is safe--that this clearinghouse of \nconfidential computer records won't be used improperly?\n  There other problems. Just look at the way this agency will work.\n  All the research to build this computer web will be done by \ncontractors--businesses who are allowed to market, sell and distribute \ntheir work for commercial development.\n  That means the same technology the government is developing to snoop \non your video rentals could be used by the video rental companies to \npeek on your publicly available government records.\n  You can bet the companies who buy this technological peeping tom \nwon't be using it to protect the public good, but merely to pad their \ncorporate profits.\n  Your privacy is not a privilege but a principle that must be \nprotected.\n  Senator Wyden's amendment is an important and necessary step to \nprevent the Federal Government from trampling your privacy while still \nallowing the Federal Government to protect us against terrorists.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 59\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the Senate moves forward on the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill, I wish to explain in greater detail the amendment \nI first discussed the other day. I offered this amendment with Senators \nFeinstein, Reid, Boxer, and Corzine to establish clear and unambiguous \ncongressional oversight over the Pentagon's Office of Total Information \nAwareness, TIA. It is an amendment on which I have worked with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I want to especially \nrecognize the invaluable guidance Senator Inouye has provided us in \ncrafting this amendment.\n  It is an amendment that would limit the scope of the Office of Total \nInformation Awareness. This is a program that is now being directed by \nretired Admiral John Poindexter, the former National Security Adviser \nto former President Reagan. It is one that raises a number of important \nissues that have arisen in our country since the horrific events of 9/\n11.\n  Let me be clear. The amendment does not kill the program; rather, the \namendment shifts the burden to the executive branch to make the case \nfor the program. The amendment would restrict funding for the program \nunless the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General and the Director \nof Central Intelligence send to Congress within 60 days a report \nanswering a series of questions about the TIA program, or the President \ncertifies to Congress in writing that that cessation of TIA's research \nand development work would endanger U.S. national security. Further, \nthe amendment would prohibit DOD from sharing this technology with any \nFederal agency that wishes to deploy or implement it until the \nSecretary of Defense informs Congress about the element of the \nprogram's technology that would be deployed and the intended method and \nscope of the deployment, and an authorization and an appropriations law \nhave been enacted to provide for the specific deployment or \nimplementation.\n  Given the fact that our country is engaged in fighting a war against \nan enemy without boundaries, clearly we must, as a nation, take steps \nthat constantly strive to balance the rights of our citizens against \nthe need to protect the national security of our Nation.\n  My concern is the program that is being developed by Mr. Poindexter \nis going forward without congressional oversight and without clear \naccountability and guidelines. That is why I think it is important for \nthe Senate, as we reflect on the need to fight terrorism while \nbalancing the need to protect the rights of our citizens, to emphasize \nhow important it is that a program like this be subject to \ncongressional oversight, and that there be clear accountability.\n  On the Web site of this particular program, the Total Information \nAwareness Program, is cited a Latin slogan--``Knowledge is power''--\nsomething we would all agree with, and it states:\n\n       The total information awareness of translational threats \n     requires keeping track of individuals and understanding how \n     they fit in to models. To this end, this office would seek to \n     develop a way to integrate databases into a ``virtual \n     centralized grand database.\n\n  The ``centralized grand database'' would enable the federal \ngovernment to look at the education, financial, travel, medical, and \nother activities of U.S. citizens, and develop risk profiles for \nmillions of Americans in the quest to examine questionable conduct and \ncertainly suspicious activity that would generate concern for the \nsafety of the American people. Our country must fight terrorists, but \nAmerica should not unleash virtual bloodhounds to sniff into the \npersonal financial, medical, and other records of millions of \nAmericans.\n\n  I am of the view the Senate has a special obligation to be vigilant \nin this area so we do not approve actions or condone actions by this \nparticular office that could compromise the bedrock of this Nation: our \nConstitution.\n  I sit on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I know it is a difficult \njob to find and maintain the proper balance between constitutional \nrights and the need to thoroughly track down every valid lead on \nterrorism, but I will tell you, I think it is critically important\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\nthat the Senate have oversight over this program, and we make sure \nthere is not a program of what amounts to virtual bloodhounds.\n  We need to make sure there are guidelines and rules so that there has \nto be, for example, evidence there is activity that could threaten the \ncountry before additional intrusive steps are taken and, second, that \nthere are safeguards in place at a time when it is possible, because of \nmodern technology and new databases, to share information very quickly.\n  The fact is much of this information is already being shared in the \nprivate sector, and that is why so many Americans are troubled about \nthe prospect of losing privacy right now. What is of concern to many \nabout the Office of Total Information Awareness is it will take the \ncurrent policies that threaten the privacy of the Americana people and \nmagnify those problems, given the fact we have not been informed as to \nwhat safeguards and constitutional protections would be in place when \nthis program goes forward.\n  I am of the view that the Senate must act to suspend this massive \ndata-mining project unless and until the executive branch comes forward \nto make the case for it and Congress determines whether the proposed \nbenefits of this technology come at too high a price to the privacy and \npersonal liberty of U.S. citizens.\n  Clearly, to fight terrorism, we have to have the confidence of the \nAmerican people. In doing so, we must protect their rights. My concern \nis the Office of Total Information Awareness, as it is constituted \ntoday, tips that balance against the procedural safeguards that are \nneeded to protect the rights of millions of Americans while fighting \nterrorism.\n  That is why I and my distinguished colleagues believe Congress must \nact now to limit the scope of the TIA office. The amendment will ensure \nthat as this program is developed in its early days it is done in a \nfashion that is sensitive and respectful of constitutional protections \nand safeguards, while still ensuring that our Nation can continue to \nfight terrorism.\n  In closing, I again thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nSenate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for his generous assistance.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 59\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I support the Wyden-Feinstein Amendment. This amendment \nwould represent a critical first step towards addressing the concerns \nthat so many of our citizens have about one specific data-mining \nsystem, the Total Information Awareness program in the Department of \nDefense. The amendment would require specific congressional \nauthorization before the Total Information Awareness program could be \ndeployed.\n  Time after time at listening sessions I told throughout my home State \nof Wisconsin people have expressed serious concerns about the prospect \nof data mining. People want a government that can protect us, but not \nat the expense of our most cherished liberties.\n  The untested and controversial intelligence procedure of data-mining \nis capable of maintaining and accessing extensive files containing both \npublic and private Government records on each and every American. The \nTotal Information Awareness program represents a dangerous step that \nthreatens some of the very freedoms that we are fighting to preserve in \nthe fight against terrorism. Through comprehensive data mining, as \nenvisioned by the Information Awareness office at the Department of \nDefense, everything from people's video rentals or drugstore purchases \nmade with a credit card to their most private health concerns could be \nfed into a computer and monitored by the Federal Government.\n  It is important to emphasize that this amendment is only a first \nstep. I will continue to fight for further congressional oversight and \naction on the important issue of data mining. The administration must \nsuspend not only the Total Information Awareness program but all other \ndata-mining initiatives in the Department of Defense and the Department \nof Homeland Security until Congress can determine whether the proposed \nbenefits of aggressive data mining comes at too high a price for our \nprivacy and personal liberties.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have another series of amendments. \nThese are the amendments we stopped. Senator Wyden's amendment No. 59, \nSenator Bunning's amendment, with Senator Bingaman, amendment No. 37, \nSenator Bunning's amendment No. 38, Senator Domenici's amendment No. \n42, Senator Sarbanes' amendment No. 49, Senator Reid's amendment No. \n84, Senator Levin's, and others, amendment No. 128.

Mr. President, I want to make sure the clerk heard my \nmodifications. I do not remember the clerk acknowledging the words were \nchanged per my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk made the changes from ``shall'' to \n``may.''\n  That request has been granted.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I acknowledge my error. We have two of \nthose in the next block. The amendments have been changed, as I \nrequested, and they now have been adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk made all the corrections.\n  The amendments have been adopted.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I send amendment No. 74 to the desk, \nwhich I introduce on behalf of the distinguished majority leader, to \nreinforce the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security in \napplying criteria to designate college- and university-based centers \nfor homeland security research.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are not doing \nthis en bloc, that this is standing alone?\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is one item standing alone.\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\n  Mr. REID. We have no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Frist, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 74.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alaska that amendment No. 158 has \nbeen cleared on this side. It is in the next batch on Interior.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), for herself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Graham of Florida, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 137.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 137\n\n(Purpose: To authorize additional appropriations for historically black \ncolleges and universities and to decrease the cost-sharing requirement \n               relating to the additional appropriations)\n\n       On page 486, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.\n\n       (a) Decreased Cost-Sharing Requirement.--Section 507(c) of \n     the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 (16 \n     U.S.C. 470a note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(1) Except'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--Except'';\n       (2) by striking ``paragraph (2)'' and inserting \n     ``paragraphs (2) and (3)'';\n       (3) by striking ``(2) The Secretary'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(2) Waiver.--The Secretary'';\n       (4) by striking ``paragraph (1)'' and inserting \n     ``paragraphs (1) and (3)''; and\n       (5) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Exception.--The Secretary shall not obligate funds \n     made available under subsection (d)(2) for a grant with \n     respect to a building or structure listed on, or eligible for \n     listing on, the National Register of Historic Places unless \n     the grantee agrees to provide, from funds derived from non-\n     Federal sources, an amount that is equal to 30 percent of the \n     total cost of the project for which the grant is provided.''.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 507(d) of the \n     Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 (16 \n     U.S.C. 470a note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Pursuant to'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(1) In general.--Under''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Additional funding.--In addition to amounts made \n     available under paragraph (1), there is authorized to be \n     appropriated from the Historic Preservation Fund to carry out \n     this section $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2003 \n     through 2008.''.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the managers for working with us \non this amendment. I believe it has been accepted now on both sides. I \nask for 2 minutes to explain the amendment, and I think we are prepared \nto accept it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection to 2 minutes for the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as you may know, as the Chairman knows, \nthere is currently a very important program--it is not a large program, \nbut it is a very important program to historically Black colleges and \nuniversities within the parameters of our Historic Preservation Fund. \nIt helps these universities, as they come up with private sector \ndollars, to match the authorization that our program creates. It gives \nthem an opportunity to preserve these historic buildings, which are of \ntremendous significance to this Nation, for our heritage, our culture, \nand the current educational needs of over 300,000 students who attend \nthese fine institutions.\n  This amendment by Senator Lieberman and myself and many others on \nboth sides of the aisle basically reauthorizes the program. It expands \nit from $5 million a year to $10 million a year, an authorization for 5 \nyears to $50 million, reduces the match from 50 percent to 30 percent, \nwithout adding any money to the current bill. It is strictly an \nauthorization.\n  This amendment reflects two bills that passed both the House and the \nSenate that reflect this language. It has broad-based support and would \nbe very helpful to these universities.\n  I thank the managers for working this out. I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator \nLandrieu in offering this amendment to provide historic preservation \nfunding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Sixteen of us \nfrom both parties sponsored similar legislation last session, which \npassed the Senate as well as the House. But the two pieces did not come \ntogether in the closing days of the session.\n  American history has been a constant, if not always consistent, march \ntoward an ideal. That ideal is equal opportunity for all.\n  In every generation, it has taken the work of pioneers to open the \ngates of the American community to people who had previously been \nexcluded. We have seen it happen with one immigrant group after \nanother. Pioneers have stepped forward when others would not, to \ndefiantly State, in effect, that we as a nation will not be defined by \nsurface characteristics. We will look deeper and try harder. The \npioneers have held us to our national promise, and reminded us that \nAmerica and Americanism are not about where you came from, what \nlanguage you speak, what religion you practice, or what you look like, \nbut about belief in basic ideals of responsibility, opportunity and \ncommunity.\n  Historically Black Colleges and Universities have been such pioneers \nfor generations, and they continue today to help America become its \nbest self.\n  In April of this year, I went to Allen University in Columbia, SC to \ntalk about reforming higher education to help more Americans at all \nincome levels not only go to college, but graduate--and get a good job \nwhen they do. Today, about 30 percent of undergraduates at 4-year \ncolleges are minorities. That is an increase of 10 percent over the \nlast 10 years. HBCUs have helped expand that access to college. \nHowever, we are still living in a country where if you are white, you \nare twice as likely to obtain a bachelor's degree by the time you're 24 \nthan if you are African American. And if you are wealthy, you are five \ntime more likely to actually\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\nget a bachelor's degree than if you are from a low-income family. In \nother words, we don't have equal opportunity--not yet.\n  Historically Black Colleges have always held us to the high human \nstandards to which America deserves to be held--and to which our people \ndemand we be held.\n  Today, America has over 100 Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities, which educate about 300,000 undergraduate students and \nthousands of graduate, professional and doctoral students.\n  In fact, 8 of the top 10 producers of African-American engineers are \nHBCUs. And 42 percent of all the PhDs earned each year by African \nAmericans are earned by graduates of HBCUs.\n  Despite playing such a central role in our economy, society, and \nculture, HBCUs have been physically eroding for years. In 1998, the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation reported that most of the \nHBCUs in the United States are showing serious signs of neglect. The \ntrust said that campus landmarks are decaying and college grounds are \nbadly in need of attention. And a 1998 General Accounting Office report \nestimated that in HBCUs nationwide, there were more than 700 historic \nbuildings in disrepair.\n  That is why I am proudly sponsoring this amendment to provide more \nrestoration funding for historic sites at Historically Black Colleges \nand Universities throughout the Nation.\n  These beautiful, architecturally significant structures are in most \ncases over a hundred years old, and were often built using the help of \nthe students themselves. Their architectural beauty is a sign of \nsomething deeper--the fact that they have served as critical portals of \nopportunity for African Americans throughout our history. That is why \nthey deserve our strong protection and sensitive preservation.\n  I saw this firsthand. When I visited Allen University, I went to \nArnett Hall--a building that had been transformed from an eyesore into \na beautiful and stately facility with the help of Federal funds. In the \npast, students and faculty would walk into the hall and get the message \nthat we as a nation were neglecting these historic treasures. Now, they \nabsorb the message that we consider historically black colleges and \nuniversities central to our history and to our future.\n  Thanks in no small part to these institutions, the overarching \nhistory of African Americans in this country has been not a tragedy, as \nit once was, but a brilliant movement toward dignity, inclusion, \nfreedom, and opportunity.\n  that is the right message for African Americans and all Americans.\n  In closing, I would also like to reiterate that this amendment is not \nnew. Bills providing historic preservation funding to Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities unanimously passed both Houses at the \nend of last year. By approving this amendment, we will clean up last \nyear's unfinished business. Please join with me and Senator Landrieu to \nadopt this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I am \nprepared to ask that amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 137) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORNYN). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a motion to table the Cantwell \namendment, and the yeas and nays have been ordered on that motion.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Following that, there are two other amendments that \nwould be the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. First, the Bingaman \namendment, followed by the Mikulski amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the manager of the bill, it is my \nunderstanding that the matter that recurs now is Mikulski?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a pending motion to table the \nCantwell amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I say, then, for the benefit of Senators, we have Mikulski, \nBingaman, and Cantwell that are now pending, and we are going to \ndispose of Cantwell now. What would be the parliamentary order after \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Bingaman amendment would be next, and then \nthe Mikulski amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it would be my intention to attempt to \nadopt the Bingaman amendment without a recorded vote. We will see how \nthat happens. May we proceed with the Cantwell vote now?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 108\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 108. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID, I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin) and the \nSenator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 24 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed (RI)\n     Reid (NV)\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 138\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that we bring up Bingaman amendment \nNo. 138. We previously discussed this amendment. Does the Senator wish \nto say anything?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask to add Senators Johnson, Clinton, \nand Hollings as cosponsors.\n  I very much appreciate the managers' willingness to agree to this \namendment. It is a very good amendment. I know it is supported on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for agreement on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 138) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KYL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 61\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. The third amendment was the amendment of Senator \nMikulski. I inquire if there is a modification at the desk?\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I believe there is a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me ask unanimous consent that we proceed to Senator \nMikulski's amendment and that it be in order to offer, if a second-\ndegree amendment is agreed to, it be in order for her to offer a \nfurther second-degree perfecting amendment, and that there be 20 \nminutes equally divided between Senators Thomas and Mikulski prior to a \nvote in relation to this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we need consent that the \nMikulski amendment, the order with respect to that, be vitiated first. \nThere is an order already in effect in that regard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am afraid I didn't read the whole unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The only agreement was barring the second-\ndegree amendments, which the Senator has addressed.\n  Mr. REID. That will be fine.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that that unanimous consent request be withdrawn \nand I be permitted to offer a different one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order, please.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order with respect to \nthe Mikulski amendment be vitiated and that Senator Thomas be \nrecognized to offer a perfecting second-degree amendment regarding \npublic-private competition; provided further that there be a 20-minute \nperiod for debate equally divided between Senators Thomas and Mikulski \nprior to a vote in relation to the second-degree amendment. I further \nask that following that debate time, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the Thomas amendment. I further ask consent that if the \nsecond-degree amendment is agreed to, Senator Mikulski be recognized in \norder to offer a further second-degree perfecting amendment, provided \nthere be 20 minutes for debate equally divided between Senators Thomas \nand Mikulski prior to the vote in relation to that amendment; finally, \nif the Thomas second-degree amendment is not agreed to, the Senate \nproceed immediately to vote in relation to the Mikulski first-degree \namendment and, notwithstanding the drafting of the Mikulski amendment, \nif it were adopted, the first-degree amendment would be subject to \nfurther amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, it was my understanding we \nwere going to have three rollcall votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I say to the Senator, one of them was approved by \nvoice vote, so this is the third vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. This is the third vote. But this new request, what is this?\n  Mr. REID. This is to set up the order of debate on the Mikulski \namendment which is going to be second-degreed by Senator Thomas. This \nis something we have worked on almost all day. So there will be two \nvotes on the Mikulski amendment, one on Thomas and one on Mikulski.\n  Mr. BYRD. For the moment, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, is there any way--if I can \nget the attention of the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from \nMaryland--is there any way we could save 10 minutes by having 15 \nminutes between each of them rather than 20?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes, that is fine.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I didn't hear the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. We have 40 minutes. I am asking if we can reduce that to 15 \non each rather than 20, for a total of 30.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that that be agreed to: Rather than 20 minutes on \neach, it be 15 on each of the amendments for debate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I stated earlier that for the moment I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I renew the Stevens request, as amended by me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. As what?\n  Mr. REID. The time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1419-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JANUARY 24, AND TUESDAY, JANUARY 28, 2003\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

Mr. President, the amendment is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the second-degree \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas) proposes an amendment \n     numbered No. 246 to amendment No. 61.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n       While nothing in this section shall prevent any agency of \n     the executive branch from subjecting work performed by \n     Federal Government employees or private contractors to \n     public-private competition or conversions, none of the funds \n     made available in this Act may be used by an agency of the \n     executive branch to establish, apply, or enforce any \n     numerical goal, target, or quota for subjecting the employees \n     of the executive agency to public-private competitions or for \n     converting such employees or the work performed by such \n     employees to private contractor performance under the Office \n     of Management and Budget Circular A-76 or any other \n     administrative regulation, directive, or policy unless the \n     goal, target, or quota is based on considered research and \n     sound analysis of past activities and is consistent with the \n     stated mission of the executive agency. Nothing in this \n     section shall limit the use of such funds for the \n     administration of the Government Performance and Results Act \n     of 1993 or for the administration of any other provision of \n     law.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is a second-degree amendment to the \nunderlying amendment. We discussed this amendment this morning and \ndelayed a vote in hopes of coming to a compromise over some of the \nconcerns that were raised. For nearly 2 hours the administration \nofficials, my staff, Senator Collins' staff, Senator Brownback, and \nSenator Mikulski worked to find a way to address these concerns. \nUnfortunately, the Senator from Maryland did not agree with that.\n  So I am offering this amendment. The compromise was reached that the \nadministration believes allows the Government, the President, to \ncontinue setting important management goals for the public-private \ncompetition. What this is, of course, is allowing for the FAIR Act, \nwhich was passed in 1998, to continue to be effective, where we can go \nthrough and list those items that are not inherently governmental and \nhave some competition for those items in the private sector so we can \nhave certainly a more efficient Government. This is the way we think we \nought to do it.\n  This amendment would allow for the restrictions on the quotas. But \nwhen there has been study, when there has been a real approach to what \ncan be done and the kinds of activities that fit, then we can move \nforward.\n  The complaint here on the amendment has simply been because of \nsetting quotas. Quotas does not mean that people will be replaced by \nprivate enterprise, but, rather, areas that are not inherently \ngovernmental will be used.\n  I turn now to the Senator from Maine for her comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Maryland has \nraised a very legitimate point about the use of arbitrary quotas or \nnumerical targets to guide the contracting-out activities of Federal \nagencies. It seems to me that having one target for every agency may \nwell be counterproductive and not result in the greatest efficiencies.\n  On the other hand, I am concerned that the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Maryland may have some unintended consequences. It could be read \nas rejecting the notion of ever having competitive contracting, to see \nwhether a specific function is best performed in-house or contracted \nout to the private sector.\n  I am also concerned that it could have an impact on other laws, \nalthough I know that is not the intent of the Senator from Maryland.\n  We have consulted with the General Accounting Office and have come up \nwith some language to try to deal with this. I do want to assure the \nSenator from Maryland, as the new chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I want to work with her to try to resolve this issue because \nthe issue she has brought to our attention is a legitimate one. So I \nhope to continue, in my new capacity, to work with her, to work with \nthe Senator from Wyoming,\n\n[[Page S1422]]\n\nto work with the Senators from Virginia who have also expressed \nconcerns about this issue.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield now to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: First, I \nrecognize that the Senator has time. But I didn't know if we were going \nto alternate speakers. Does the Senator from Wyoming intend to use all \nof his 15 minutes and then turn it over to me?\n  I am sorry. I don't want to in any way deny the Senator from Ohio his \nright to speak. Usually one side makes an argument, and then the other \nreplies, and then go back. Are we not doing that?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I understood we had 15 minutes to present our point of \nview and that the others would present their point of view.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. This discussion will be on my time. But usually when we \nhave a time allocation we go back and forth. Is the Senator from \nWyoming going to take all of his 15 minutes and then give me all of \nmine? Is that the way we are going to do it?\n  Mr. THOMAS. That was my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will say that there is no agreement \nto go back and forth. The Senator from Ohio has the floor at the \nmoment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio has the right to \nspeak, but it was not part of the agreement. I was just referring to \nthe usual and customary behavior in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would also announce that the 15 \nminutes was to be evenly divided----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No. We didn't.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On each amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. When do I get my time? There are 15 minutes on each \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct--evenly divided on each \namendment by 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, how much time do we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes twenty seconds remain.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Chair.\n  First, I share the concerns of the Senator from Maryland about this \nproblem, and I want to do everything in my power as chairman of the \nsubcommittee on Government oversight and work toward dealing with the \nsolution to the problem that is being presented.\n  According to the best information I have, this amendment would \ncircumvent the administration's prerogative in the executive branch by \nprohibiting the administration from managing the Federal Government's \ncompetitive sourcing process. It would repeal initiatives passed on a \nbipartisan basis over the past 10 years, including the Government \nPerformance Act.\n  The amendment would prohibit agencies from developing and \nimplementing strategic plans allowing Federal employees to focus on \nhigh-priority activities, and it would prevent agencies from increasing \nefficiencies, lowering costs, implementing innovation and technology, \nand it would prevent agencies to meet their agency missions.\n  Additionally, the President has said that if this provision were in \nthe Treasury-Postal appropriations, he would veto the bill.\n  We tried to work out a compromise based on some of these concerns \nthat he had. We thought that it met the concerns of the Senator from \nMaryland. Unfortunately, it did not.\n  I urge that we vote no on her amendment and yes on the amendment we \nare proposing today--understanding this will not solve the problem and \nthat we will need to deal with it throughout the remainder of the year.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, do I have time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I would like to turn to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nleadership. I rise in support of his amendment, and, as the Senator \nfrom Ohio said, in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  My friends and colleagues, we need to always, as a government, be \nlooking at new ways of adopting innovation and have improvements--\nwhether it is our national security or homeland defense. There are many \nideas, many systems, and many programs in the private sector that can \nperform more efficiently and better for the American people. We need to \nexamine those.\n  I think the Bush administration's proposal is very modest and \nreasonable, and it is supported by a variety of private sector groups. \nThe Mikulski amendment is opposed by a broad range of organizations, \nsuch as the Northern Virginia Technology Council, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the Professional Services Council, the Contract Services \nAssociation, and many others.\n  For small businesses, large businesses, disadvantaged businesses, \nminority-owned businesses, let us care about the jobs in the private \nsector. Let us also care about those governmental services that are \nessential for our security, but let us make what we are procuring the \nbest for all Americans.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment of Senator Thomas and \noppose the amendment of the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise with vigor to unabashedly oppose \nthe amendment of the Senator from Wyoming. The reason I do is that he \nreintroduces the words ``quota'' and ``target.''\n  The amendment of the Senator from Wyoming essentially says that a \n``target'' or a ``goal'' is to be considered--``target, target, quota, \nquota.'' I thought we didn't like targets and quotas. I am surprised \nthat the Senator from Wyoming is so enthusiastic about them.\n  Under the Thomas amendment, Federal managers will still be forced to \nmeet arbitrary quotas for privatization without real criteria, \nrationales, or consideration. Under the Thomas amendment, the goal is \nto get a quota or a target--not better government.\n  Let us be very clear. My original amendment never did seek the end to \nprivatization. Privatization must be based on thoughtful criteria as \nestablished by the Congress in the FAIR Act.\n  Let us privatize Federal jobs where appropriate, but let us keep a \nstrong, independent Federal workforce.\n  I want to deal with the very valid issues raised by the Senator from \nMaine. I agree. I wanted to modify my amendment. I wanted to modify my \namendment by adding what is now in the first paragraph in the Thomas \namendment, which I agree to--that nothing in this section would prevent \nany agency of the executive branch from subjecting work performed by \nthe Federal Government employees to be contracted out to public or \nprivate competition.\n  I wanted to do that this morning. The Senator from Wyoming would not \nagree to that modification. We went into a dialog. In the dialog, the \nSenator from Maine, again, offered a very constructive recommendation--\nthat nothing in this section would limit the use of such funds under \nthe Government Performance Act.\n\n  I was willing to go with that. If we had agreed to that, we could \nhave agreed to that modification this morning and Senators could be \nheading home tonight. But, no, OMB had to get into the act. They \ninsisted that this paragraph say, unless there has to be a target or \nquota. Sure. They say based on research and sound analysis.\n  Let me tell you. When the fox is guarding the hen house, I don't care \nwhat accounting system they have. They are still going after targets \nand they are still going after quotas. That is why I object to the \namendment of the Senator from Wyoming.\n  I would love to have agreed to the original two paragraphs that I \nthink would have met the very valid concern of the other side.\n\n[[Page S1423]]\n\n  I salute those on the other side who are reformers. But, no, we \ndidn't go that route.\n  I am still opposing it. Anything with the word ``target'' in it and \nanything with the word ``quota'' in it. I am fighting today. I am \nfighting all night, if I have to. I will fight tomorrow, and I will \nfight on until the end of the 108th Congress.\n  I am not going to destroy the integrity of the civil service system \nwith arbitrary quotas and with arbitrary and capricious targets. We are \ngoing to do this right. We are going to do it under the law. We are not \ngoing to turn Federal managers into bounty hunters.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting in favor of Senator \nMikulski's amendment and against Senator Thomas' amendment because the \nThomas amendment provides for quotas. I favor contracting out where \nthere is an individual analysis that saves the Federal Government money \nand maintains appropriate quality. I have consistently opposed quotas \nin school admissions and employment and I similarly oppose quotas in \nthis situation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I hope when we do another process such \nas this and enter into negotiations and when the negotiation is over we \ndon't come back and offer something that had been rejected as an \namendment.\n  I am disappointed that this amendment is being offered. That is \npolitics. Everyone has a right to offer their amendments. I accept the \noffer of the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Ohio for the long \nhaul and for discussion.\n\n  This is very serious. We do know we need a modernized civil service. \nWe do know we need to reform. But we do not need targets and quotas \nwhere OMB has said itself, get rid of 127,000, 500,000 jobs this year. \nSo 127,000 people? Who are we going to get rid of? Let's start with the \nNobel prize winners at NIH. Who needs them? They can go off to the \nprivate sector. Good-bye. Who needs a Nobel prize winner for finding \nthe cure for Alzheimer's? Maybe we could contract out Customs officers. \nMaybe we could go to rent-a-cop agencies.\n  Or what about those secretaries who keep the agencies going--like the \none who went to my high school who has worked for the FBI for nearly 50 \nyears in Baltimore, who has helped keep the FBI going, such as when the \nFBI was out trying to find the sniper who killed several Marylanders \nand people from Northern Virginia.\n  I don't know what is so hostile about Federal employees. If we want \nto save money in pensions, and if we want to save money in health care, \nthat is another issue. But bounty hunters? No. Maybe bounty hunters are \nOK when you go after predators, but I don't think the Federal employees \nshould be subjected to bounty hunters.\n  Guess who else is opposed to this amendment. Federal managers, \nbecause they say all they are going to be doing is paperwork to be able \nto justify this.\n  I could elaborate. Everybody knows I am opposed to the Thomas \namendment because it is just a dressed-up version of going after \nquotas, which I tried to stop in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I know that it is getting late. I think we ought to \nhave a vote on this. If I prevail, by defeating the Thomas amendment, \nwe are done. If not, I am going to come back and have another say.\n  Mr. President, I yield all of my time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Maryland has 7\\1/2\\ minutes, \nand the Senator from Wyoming has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is the original amendment that I had \npending this morning. It seeks to maintain the integrity of the civil \nservice system by making sure that civil service is never subjected to \nbounty hunters looking to get rid of their jobs through arbitrary and \ncapricious targets and quotas. It makes sure that the civil service \nnever lapses into cronyism or political patronage.\n  My amendment prevents Federal agencies from establishing or applying \narbitrary targets or quotas for the contracting out of Federal jobs.\n  I want to be clear that my amendment does not prohibit privatization. \nPrivatization can continue to go forth as established by Congress in \nthe FAIR Act of 1998. It allows contracting out. I don't object to \nthat. What I object to is targets, quotas, and bounty hunters. Firstly, \nthis is the smallest Federal workforce since the 1960s. Next, we are at \nwar. We are fighting a war against terrorism. We also created a new \nagency called Homeland Security. Lastly, we are facing the largest \nnumber of potential retirees from civil service in over 30 years.\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\n  Don't we want a civil service? I am proud of the civil service. \nMembers of my family have been part of the Federal civil service. My \nbrother-in-law was a librarian, I have a sister who was a secretary, \nand I am a Senator. I believe if we are going to recruit and retain the \npeople we need, we need to make sure we do not embark upon this \narbitrary, capricious, hostile, and predatory behavior. That is not the \nway to govern. That is not the way to inspire. That is not the way to \nrecruit, and it is certainly not the way to retain.\n  It is not that Barbara Mikulski is opposed to this; Federal managers \nare opposed to this amendment. They are concerned that they are going \nto be writing lots of justifications on how to retain jobs. They want \nto fight for America. They want to fight for or perform the missions of \ntheir agencies. We went from an era of patronage politics. Now we are \nembroiled in an atmosphere of partisan politics. I wish we could get \nback to performance-based politics, sound civil service, good reform, \nsome of the ideas being proposed by the other side of the aisle, \nlooking at what should be contracted out, which would maintain the \nmission of the agency, give value to the taxpayer but dignity to the \nFederal employee.\n  So what is wrong with that? I will tell you why the amendment is \nbeing opposed. What we want to be able to do is allow the privatization \nto occur under the laws that now exist.\n  The FAIR Act of 1998 and the 76-OMB circular that was established in \nthe 1960s in the Kennedy-Johnson era is what I want.\n  My amendment simply prohibits the arbitrary and capricious \ncontracting out by saying:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this act may be used by \n     an executive agency to establish, apply, or enforce numerical \n     targets or quotas.\n\n  That is all it says.\n  If you are for quotas, vote for this. If you are for targets, vote \nfor this. If you are for arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking, go \nahead and do it. Who is going to hire these people? Are we going to \ncreate new corporations?\n  What about all those guys who worked for Enron? Maybe they could get \ninto ``let's hire a public employee and privatize.'' And all the guys \nfrom WorldCom, maybe when they get out on parole they could start a new \nagency to pick up these Federal employees.\n  I do not know for the life of me why we are so hostile to Federal \nemployees. We have less of a workforce now, and we are asking them to \nfight for America; we are asking them to work for missions, the \nagencies. We took away their privileges in homeland security, and now \nwe are going to take away their jobs.\n  Mr. REID. I ask to be made a cosponsor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Nevada for asking to be a \ncosponsor. I reserve such time as I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President I remind my colleagues that the amendment \nthis body just agreed to contains word for word the amendment of the \nSenator from Maryland. However, it goes on to explain that as we go \nthrough the 76 process; it is not the quotas that matter. That is what \ngives some guidance to management. What you have to do is study the \nissue and make sure that is the appropriate place.\n  It seems to me we ought to be looking a little bit ahead instead of \nbeing defensive about big Government and everyone working in the big \nGovernment. We all like Government. We like the employees. They do a \ngood job. The point is, do you want an efficient Government or one that \ncontinues to grow and pays no attention to efficiency and has no \ncompetition? What we are talking about is a bill that was passed in \n1998 which said we are going to list those functions within the Federal \nGovernment that are not specifically governmental, that could be done \noutside the Government, and compete.\n  I cannot imagine what is wrong with the idea of having competition, \nwhat is wrong with the idea of being more efficient. They are still \njobs. We are not taking away jobs. They may be moving to the private \nsector where they can compete and do that particular function of \nGovernment more efficiently.\n  The idea that we just sit here and defend civil service because they \nare working--it disturbs me when we talk about secretaries. This does \nnot have anything to do with secretaries. This has to do with those \nfunctions in Government that can be done by contracting with the \nprivate sector. There are a lot of those functions, and there are a lot \nof those functions that are already in place.\n  We need to go ahead with what we have done. I suppose it is somewhat \nphilosophical: If you do not like the private sector, if you do not \nlike competition or like to create opportunities for people to compete, \nthen I suppose that is the way you feel.\n  There are a number of reasons to oppose the amendment.\n  The administration worked at this compromise. The administration and \nOMB said they are going to suggest to the President that if this \nprovision passes, that the bill be vetoed. Senior advisers are \nrecommending the President veto any legislation that challenges a \nmanagement agenda to be more efficient.\n  By the way, before this appropriations bill was passed, this \namendment was taken out. It was in there, and it was defeated last \nyear. This is not the first time we have dealt with this issue, and \neach time it has been defeated because most of us think competition is \na good idea. Most of us think efficiency is a good idea. Most of us \nthink we ought to keep Government as small as we can and get the job \ndone that way.\n  Therefore, I urge we defeat this amendment that is before us and \ncontinue to move ahead with the opportunity for the Federal Government \nto carry out a plan of more efficiency and a plan that passed in the \nCongress to do that.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Is the Senator yielding back all his time?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am yielding back.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Excuse me?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield back my time. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to be recognized?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 2 minutes 28 \nseconds. The Senator from Wyoming has 4 minutes 44 seconds.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Mikulski \namendment. As we focus on this after having previously accepted the \namendment of the Senator from Wyoming, let me share with my colleagues \nthe views of people who would be affected by this in the private \nsector.\n  The Information Technology Association of America recognizes that as \na result of this amendment, rather than promote competition and better \nmanagement of the Federal Government, the Bush administration would \nface restrictions. There are many companies in the ITAA. There are \nlarge companies, some small startups, as well as industry leaders in \nsoftware and the Internet. All of these companies would be denied \nopportunities or hampered by this amendment and therefore urge us to \nvote no.\n  Other associations, such as the Northern Virginia Technology Council, \nwhich consists of 1,600 members and 180,000 employees, urge us to vote \nno as well. Bobbie Kilberg, the president, says this amendment would \nsignificantly limit private sector involvement and discourage \ncompetition vital to the technology community.\n  The Contract Services Association of America, an industry \nrepresentative for private sector companies that provide services to \nthe Federal, State, and local governments--they include small \ndisadvantaged businesses, Native American-owned businesses, section \n8(a)-certified companies--wants to have those folks working for the \npublic good.\n  The Professional Services Council recognizes that we want to hold the \nexecutive branch responsible for efficient management of services and \nlooks at this amendment as one that would harm the ability of the \nadministration to do so.\n  The Chamber of Commerce of the United States looks at this issue in a \nway with which I agree, and that is, that this is the time to create \nmore efficient and effective partnerships between the public and \nprivate sectors, not to restrict policies that limit funding or \nflexibility in sourcing and decisionmaking processes.\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\n  We talk about homeland security. It is very important. Many wonderful \npublic servants will be involved in homeland security, but what is \nreally going to help homeland security is the adaptation, the \nutilization of technologies from enterprise services that allow them to \nanalyze the volumes of information, share it within those agencies, \nalso with other agencies in a secure way, and with State and local \ngovernments.\n  It is important that in this time when we are worrying about the cost \nof Government and worrying about the taxpayers, we should not be \nlimiting the ability of our Government to respond to changing economic \nand security needs of the American people.\n  While I understand the heartfelt sincerity of the Senator from \nMaryland, I think there are a lot of people we need to be worried \nabout, and let's make sure we are providing the very best of services \nto the people of this country.\n  Competition has always been good. It has made it better. Let's adapt, \nlet's innovate, and let's move forward in a principled way. I ask my \ncolleagues to defeat this amendment. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I guess we are going to use this time. I might as well \njoin in.\n  I want to read a part of a communication from OMB:\n\n       Now is the wrong time to short-circuit implementation of \n     the common sense principle of competition--a proven \n     prescription for reaping significant cost savings and \n     performance enhancements--especially since numerous agencies \n     are starting to make real progress. The principle of \n     competition was unanimously adopted by the recent \n     congressionally-mandated Commercial Activities Panel. \n     Prohibiting the funding for public-private competitions is \n     akin to mandating a monopoly regardless of the impact on \n     services to citizens and the added costs to taxpayers. If the \n     final version of the bill would contain such a provision--\n\n  Talking about this amendment--\n\n     the President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto \n     the bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the Senator from \nWyoming has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment \noffered by Senator Mikulski regarding the use of quotas in contracting \nout Government jobs. The administration has put forth proposals \nrequiring that a specified number of jobs usually performed by Federal \nemployees be contracted out to private companies each year. Senator \nMikulski's amendment would prevent any of the funding in the omnibus \nappropriations bill to be used in the enforcement of these quotas.\n  The administration states that this is an issue of efficiency. I \ndisagree. There is no evidence that contracting out Federal Government \njobs saves the Government time or money. In fact, the opposite is often \ntrue, the Federal Government is overcharged for less efficient work by \nprivate companies, work that could be done more efficiently and more \neffectively by Federal employees. Too often, jobs are simply contracted \nout without a proper public-private competition, and without continued \nmonitoring of whether any cost savings actually results. Furthermore, \nby requiring that a set number of Federal jobs be contracted out each \nyear, the jobs may be contracted out without any regard to cost \nsavings.\n  In addition, national security is now of vital importance to our \nNation. We must take a close look at the implications of contracting \nout to ensure that our national interests are being protected. We need \nFederal employees to do these jobs, jobs that are not suited to the \nprivate sector. Indeed, Federal employees are now screening baggage at \nour Nation's airports, one of the most vital roles in this \nunprecedented time. Requiring that a certain number of Federal jobs be \ncontracted out each year could result in the contracting out of jobs \nvital to our national security.\n  I firmly believe that the United States Government should not \ncontract out jobs merely for the sake of ``reducing'' the Federal \nworkforce. Nor should we show a preference to contract employees over \nour dedicated public servants who have demonstrated such determination \nand commitment in this difficult time. I urge my colleagues to support \nSenator Mikulski's amendment and oppose the use of quotas in the \ncontracting out of jobs already ably performed by our Federal \nemployees.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Mikulski's \namendment to prohibit arbitrary, ``one-size-fits-all'' privatization \nquotas for Federal agencies. Under the amendment, agencies would still \nbe able to compete, convert, and contract out Federal activities, but \non a case-by-case basis, with the goal of maximizing quality and cost-\nefficiency.\n  Under the OMB quotas, Federal departments and agencies are encouraged \nto privatize five percent of their jobs now, and 50 percent by next \nyear. The administration's current policy will lead to the \nprivatization of 850,000 jobs, nearly half the Federal workforce.\n  Fair competition and contracting out can be effective when used in \nthe right way. But, this quota system imposes a blanket mandate on all \nFederal agencies, without taking into account individual agency needs. \nAgencies are not all alike. It may be appropriate to contract out the \nconstruction of military equipment or the mowing the lawn. But, many \nAmericans will have serious concerns about contracting out the food \ninspections conducted by the Department of Agriculture, or the tax \naudits performed by the Internal Revenue Service. It makes no sense to \nimpose the same privatization policy on every agency.\n  The Government has a responsibility to provide its services \nefficiently and effectively and with accountability. Under the \nadministration's quota system, a broad range of sensitive and critical \nactivities could be privatized without accountability, including some \nthat could put our national security at risk. Those who safeguard our \nborders and those who repair our planes, ships, and tanks should be \nheld accountable for their work.\n  Despite the growing reliance on private contractors, Federal agencies \ntoday do not have a method in place to hold contractors accountable. \nMany of us have deep concerns about privatizing so much of the Federal \nworkforce in the absence of reliable and comprehensive measures to \ndetermine the quality of the tens of billions of dollars of work \nperformed by private contractors. There are no mechanisms to track the \nquality of service contracting. Some agencies served by contractors \ntoday do not even know which services are being provided by \ncontractors.\n  In addition, privatization under the administration's current quota \nsystem can occur without competition. Many Federal jobs will be lost, \nwith no opportunity for the Federal employees to compete and \ndemonstrate their efficiency. Currently, when Federal jobs are opened \nto competition, Federal workers are hired more than half the time. It \nmakes no sense to privatize work that Federal workers can do more \nefficiently. The administration's proposal gives an unacceptable \npreference for private contractors over public workers.\n  The administration's proposal will reduce the standard of living for \nlarge numbers of Federal workers, since contractors have incentives to \nreduce costs by offering inferior compensation. According to the \nEconomic Policy Institute, one in ten contractor employees earns less \nthan a living wage. When work is privatized, displaced Federal workers \nare likely to lose their health benefits and their security for the \nfuture.\n  Several groups have voiced their opposition to the administration's \nplan. The Federal Managers Association, which represents the \nexecutives, managers, and supervisors in the Federal government, has \nstated its support for the Mikulski amendment. As the association \nstates, the amendment will ``provide Federal agencies and departments \nwith the ability to use competition to truly benefit the American \npeople and not require competition for the sake of fulfilling quotas.'' \nEven the Commercial Activities Panel, comprised largely of contractors, \nopposes the privatization plan because it believes that such decisions \nrequire informed judgements and analyses that consider the specific \nneeds of each agency.\n  The Mikulski amendment will preserve the high standards which make \nGovernment responsive to the needs of our citizens, and I urge the \nSenate to support it.\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered by \nSenator Mikulski that would prevent Federal agencies from establishing, \napplying, or enforcing any numerical goal, target, or quota for the \ncontracting out of Federal jobs. The Mikulski amendment is identical to \nlanguage that passed the House by a large, bipartisan margin and was \nincluded in the House fiscal year 2003 Treasury appropriations.\n  I was very troubled by the Office of Management and Budget's \ndirective to contract out 850,000 jobs over the next 3 years. I was \nconcerned because the OMB privatization quotas encourage agencies to \nprivatize Federal employee jobs without public-private competition, \nwhich is unfair both to the affected employees as well as the \ntaxpayers. In fact the OMB quotas force agencies to privatize Federal \nemployee jobs that even Federal managers believe should continue to be \nperformed by reliable Federal employees.\n  Senator Mikulski's amendment is reasonable and fair. It allows for \nthe contracting out of Federal employee jobs, but it prevents jobs from \narbitrarily being privatized. Instead it will ensure that thoughtful \ncriteria are established before Federal employee jobs are given away. \nThis is an issue of fundamental fairness, and about establishing a fair \nand reasonable process.\n  I strongly support Senator Mikulski's amendment and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to make a few quick points. \nFirst, my amendment, word for word, was voted for in the House of \nRepresentatives. I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle and \nto my very good friend, the Senator from Virginia, that this amendment \nwas offered by two Congressmen from Virginia, Moran and Wolf. This \namendment passed the House 261 to 166. Tom Davis, Jo Ann Davis, and \nFrank Wolf voted for this. I might also note that the Presiding Officer \nvoted for it when he was in the House. So it had bipartisan support.\n  I wish we had that bipartisan support. I wish the people who voted \nfor it in the House would vote for it now that they are in the Senate. \nThat is No. 1.\n  No. 2, who would be contracted out? OMB has told the agencies, \n127,500 people by the end of 2003. They are going to go for the largest \nnumbers in the quickest way. It is going to be clerical. It is going to \nbe support. It is going to be the mail. It is going to have a \ntremendous impact on people of color who have worked their way into \nFederal civil service.\n  If one reads the Federal Managers Magazine, they have said the VA has \nsaid it is going to have a tremendous impact, they fear, on their \ndiversity. The same has also been said by other agencies.\n  Again, I am not looking for quotas in diversity anymore than I am \nlooking for quotas in contracting out, but I want us to know who is \ngoing to be affected. It is not going to be that high-tech software \nengineer.\n  I believe that just as the Northern Virginia High Tech Council has \noffered great ideas and ingenuity through their members, so has \nMaryland. We understand that.\n  Let's look at NIH. Let's look at FDA. Who is going to be contracted \nout there? Is it really going to be the Nobel prize winner? No. It is \ngoing to be a lot of folks who do the thankless day to day work who are \ngoing to be contracted out.\n  Now, my colleagues also need to know, I fear for national security. \nIn many of these agencies, it is going to be the blue-collar jobs, such \nas the electricians, the people who are the facility managers, and \nothers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Maryland has \nexpired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Vote yes on Mikulski.\n  Mr. REID. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 247. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the \nSenator from Hawaii, (Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from Massachusetts, \n(Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 26 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kerry\n  The amendment (No. 247) was rejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the underlying amendment is \nagreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to present to the Senate a series \nof amendments that have been modified since they have been introduced. \nAfter that, the Senator from New Jersey has an amendment to offer on \nwhich there will be a 15-minute time limitation equally divided. I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 15 minutes equally divided on the \namendment of the Senator from New Jersey with no other amendments in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. After the Senator's amendment is presented, we will have \na vote in relation to that. I will probably move to table it. We, then, \nwill have a series of amendments from the agriculture subcommittee and \nfrom the interior subcommittee that have been worked out. Following \nthat, Senator Stabenow wishes to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nand speak briefly.\n  We will then go to third reading. We have, I believe, two Members who \nwish to speak briefly before third reading. If Senators will stay with \nus, we will probably have about 45 minutes to an hour of time ahead of \nus.\n  Does the Senator from Nevada have any comment about that?\n  Mr. REID. No. On our side, prior to third reading, we have Senator \nStabenow who wants to make a brief statement on her sense-of-the-Senate \namendment. And Senator Dayton is going to ask for up to 5 minutes \nbefore final passage.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think I misspoke. I think Senator Stabenow wishes to \nhave a sense-of-the-Senate regarding conferees. Am I correct?\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if the Senator from Alaska will yield, \nI think there is an understanding that I am going to modify the \namendment I have at the desk.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have not said that. The Senator has that right. But I \nam offering modified amendments before we take up the Senator's \namendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the manager.\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\nAmendments Nos. 6, 83, 85, 131, 136, 144, 156, 172, 150, 199, 186, 142, \n                178, 57, 167, 166, and 188, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now offer a series of amendments, and \nafter I name them I will ask that they be considered en bloc: Amendment \nNo. 112 offered by Senator Bunning and Senator Santorum--these are \nmodifications at the desk that have been cleared on both sides--\namendment No. 6 by Senator Coleman; amendment No. 83 by Senator Reid; \namendment No. 85 by Senator Reid; amendment No. 131 by Senators Harkin, \nDurbin, and Landrieu; amendment No. 136 by Senator Mikulski and others; \namendment No. 144 by Senator Santorum; amendment No. 156 by Senator \nDomenici; amendment No. 172 by Senators Landrieu and Snowe; amendment \nNo. 150 by Senator Murkowski and myself; amendment No. 199 by Senators \nDurbin and Hutchison; amendment No. 186, which is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution by Senator Bond; amendment No. 142 by Senator Reid; \namendment No. 178 by Senator Nelson of Florida; amendment No. 57 by \nSenator McCain--that is the Korea sense-of-the-Senate resolution--\namendment No. 167 by Senator Byrd; amendment No. 166 by Senator Byrd--\nthat is the China commission--and amendment No. 188 by Senator Dodd.\n  To my knowledge, we have no objections to any of those.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 112 has not been cleared on this side.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. 112 was cleared. We showed that to you. It was the \none modified by your subcommittee.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think the Korea resolution sense of the \nSenate was in that list that the chairman read.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It was.\n  Mr. KYL. I wanted to speak for 5 minutes on that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator make the statement after we adopt this \npackage?\n  Mr. KYL. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I just ask----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I still have the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Not wishing to object, I ask if any disposition has \nbeen made on amendment 126.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have not been able to clear that one yet. It is not \nin this package. We have another series in a package. There is another \npackage coming later.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will wait for the remaining package. If not, I will \nask for a vote on it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will confer with the Senator.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the series of amendments that I have \nreferred to be modified in accordance with the submissions that are at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Lautenberg has 5 minutes on his \namendment on the Superfund.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator wants to call up amendment \nNo. 112 now, he can.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 112, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 112.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 112, as modified.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                     amendment no. 112 as modified\n\n (Purpose: The Secretary of HHS may make grants to purchase ultrasound \n                               equipment)\n\n       At the end of the general provisions relating to the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ____. GRANTS FOR PURCHASE OF ULTRASOUND EQUIPMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     may make grants for the purchase of ultrasound equipment. \n     Such ultrasound equipment shall be used by the recipients of \n     such grants to provide, under the direction and supervision \n     of a licensed physician, free ultrasound examinations to \n     pregnant woman needing medical services: Provided, That: the \n     Secretary shall give priority in awarding grants to those \n     organizations that agree to adhere to professional guidelines \n     for counseling pregnant women. Whereby a pregnant woman is \n     fully informed in a non-biased manner about all options.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the immediate adoption of the \nmodified amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment, as modified, \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 112), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the manager.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 192, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call up my amendment, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 192.\n\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the amendment that \nis at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have \nnot seen the modification.\n  I remove that objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 192), as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n                     amendment no. 192 as modified\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the appropriation for the Hazardous Substance \n                               Superfund)\n\n       On page 982, strike lines 21 through 25 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     per project; $1,372,888,000, to remain available until \n     expended, consisting of $736,444,000, as authorized by \n     section 517(a) of the Superfund Amendments and \n     Reauthorization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-499; 100 Stat. \n     1613), and $636,444,000 as a payment from general\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  The authorization level under the Superfund law for this year is \n$11.5 billion. The bill before us provides $1.27 billion. Of that \namount, 50 percent comes from the Superfund trust fund and the rest \ncomes from general revenues.\n  There is now about $120 million in unobligated funds left in the \nSuperfund trust fund. My amendment takes $100 million of that and adds \nit to the $1.27 billion so that we can increase the number of \ncontaminated sites we will be cleaning up, but also to give some \nencouragement to a group of highly trained professionals so they can \nlook to a continuation of a career that has been devoted to getting \nthese sites cleaned up.\n  My amendment doesn't fully fund the program, but because the average \ncost of cleanup in a normal Superfund site is $12 million, this $100 \nmillion could help protect eight more communities from contaminated \nground water and toxic soil in their neighborhoods.\n  From the beginning, an important principle of Superfund has been that \nthose responsible for the contamination should pay for the cleanup. The \npolluters--not the general public--should pay.\n  In keeping with this principle, my amendment draws only from the \ntrust fund, not from general revenues.\n  Unfortunately, it seems that some have lost sight of the ``polluter \npays'' principle at the heart of the Superfund program.\n  In the appropriations bill before us, taxpayers, not polluters, would \npay for 50 percent of the cleanup program. This simply isn't fair to \nour Nation's taxpayers.\n  But the ``polluter pays'' principle is fair. It has worked, and it \nshould be preserved. Yet the tax on petroleum and chemical products--\nthe sources of contamination at most Superfund sites--has been allowed \nto lapse. We need to reauthorize the funding source and reinstate a \ndependable revenue stream for the program, but that is a debate for \nanother day. In the interim, we have to do more with what we have.\n  In the 4 years leading up to the year 2000, an average of 87 \nSuperfund were being cleaned up each year. Since then, the number has \ndropped by half: 42 sites cleaned up in 2001 and 47 sites cleaned up in \n2002. This isn't acceptable nor is it responsible.\n  Adequate funding for Superfund is a very serious matter for the \npeople of my home State of New Jersey. My State has 113 hazardous waste \nsites on the National Priority List (NPL)--more than any other State.\n  But I would quickly point out this isn't simply an urban-State \nproblem. The largest Superfund site in the country right now is in \nCoeur d'Alene, ID, one of the most beautiful States in our country. And \nyet there is this blight in their midst. And we see the same thing in \nMontana, another rural mountain State, so beautiful with nature's \nblessing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Sure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank the \nSenator from New Jersey and say how wonderful it is, for anyone who \ncares about the environment and of cleaning up the environment, to have \nhim back.\n  This is a very important amendment. Superfund sites are all over the \ncountry in almost every single State. They hurt our people. They are \ndangerous to our children. They have to be cleaned up.\n  The Senator is right. Polluter pays is the way we ought to go with \nthese funds. So I just wanted to rise to thank my friend.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. \nWe have worked diligently together to try to turn these Superfund sites \nfrom environmental and health hazards into productive properties for \nthe affected communities.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator for the amendment. \nIt is a crime that we have not been utilizing the Superfund the way it \nshould be utilized. The Senator is putting it back on track. I commend \nthe Senator for his efforts.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will my colleague from New Jersey yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I just want to reinforce and reemphasize how important \nthis is in our State of New Jersey with the 113 sites. By the way, \nthere is an increasing sense--scientific sense, data sense--that we are \nhaving a high incidence of cancer in areas that surround these sites.\n\n  This is a health problem. It really is something that needs to be \naddressed. I think my colleague from New Jersey is doing exactly the \nright thing to bring this issue forward.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. President, nationally, one in four Americans lives within 4 miles \nof an NPL site. That is unacceptable. Contaminated sites endanger our \nenvironment, they endanger our health, they endanger our economy.\n  We have money in the trust fund. We should use it. We desperately \nneed to clean up these sites and make them safe and productive again, \nespecially for the sake of the communities that surround them. Having \nthese blighted locations throughout our country is simply that; it is a \nplague on these communities. We ought to get on with transforming them \nfrom wastelands into industrial, commercial, and residential sites that \nbenefit everybody.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by several of my colleagues, including \nSenator Corzine, Senator Boxer, Senator Kennedy, Senator Biden, Senator \nClinton, Senator Nelson of Florida, Senator Jeffords of Vermont, \nSenator Kerry, and Senator Schumer.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will be able to use these funds for the \npurpose intended: cleaning up more Superfund sites faster in the coming \nyear. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Lautenberg \namendment. I look over and see both Senators from Louisiana here. I can \nassure you that money is not just the answer. I remember at Bossier \nCity there was a site that the Federal Government was going to clean \nup. It was going to cost X dollars. I don't remember the exact amount, \nbut I didn't know this amendment was going to come up. After we spent \nquite a bit of time, we found that the responsible parties were willing \nto do it under State supervision. All of the parishes agreed to it. All \nof the citizens, neighborhood groups, agreed to it. Yet they were still \ngoing to do it. We ended up forcing this through and cleaning it up for \none-half the amount of money and in one-half of the time.\n  We need to reform the Superfund system. I would argue with my good \nfriend from Idaho, I think we have the largest Superfund problem in Tar \nCreek in the State of Oklahoma.\n  I will not yield to my friend because I think I need my time.\n  But I would say this: We have spent about $100 million on it over the \nlast 15 years, and it has not resolved the problem. We want to reform \nthe system. We need to reform the system. And, of course, there are no \noffsets. So I know that will mean something to some of the people.\n  But let's go ahead, give our committee a chance, give Senator Chafee, \nwhose subcommittee has the jurisdiction, a chance to go in here and do \na better job rather than pouring money on a system that is not working \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\n  Now I will yield----\n  Mr. CRAIG. One minute.\n  Mr. INHOFE. One minute to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The superfund site in Coeur d'Alene, ID, that the Senator \nfrom New Jersey referred to, 3 years ago was touted to cost $1 billion \nto clean up. As a result of a cooperative State plan, in conjunction \nwith EPA--the first unique plan of this kind, designed under a new \nState commission; and our new Director Whitman has signed off on it--\nthat same area can be cleaned up and meet all of the standards for less \nthan $300 million over a 12-year to 15-year period.\n  Now, $300 million versus $1 billion is a heck of a lot of money. \nBecause of these new cooperative relationships and State plans--that \npast EPAs refused to negotiate and bring States into the process--but \nbecause we are now doing that, I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma, \nthere is great opportunity for reform. You just don't throw money at \nthese problems. You resolve them in new, creative ways, and still meet \nstandards for clean water and clean air.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Idaho \nbecause we do have two of those devastating sites.\n  I yield whatever time I have to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in addition to the arguments that the \ndistinguished Senators from Oklahoma and Idaho made about the need to \nrevise the Superfund law, let me simply point out that this amendment \nwould add $100 million more to Superfund spending. You can call it \ncoming from the Superfund trust fund, but it is still spending, and it \nstill scores against the budget. It goes over the agreement that we had \nwith the President.\n  The current bill funds Superfund activities and cleanup at $1.273 \nbillion for fiscal year 2003. This is what the administration \nrequested, and that is what is needed.\n  The Superfund cleanups are adequately funded.\n  Does my colleague from Oklahoma wish to add anything further?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. We are in the process of making some major changes. \nYou heard from the Senator from Idaho the improvements that have been \nmade there. And this is one of the main agenda items.\n  So I urge the defeat of the Lautenberg amendment and yield to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will you give me 1 minute?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Sure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to tell the Senate, 10 years ago I made a speech \ndowntown to 350 people. They were anxiously paying attention. I said: \nIt is this year we are going to reform that crazy fund where we can't \nget anything done. The money is piling up and chemicals don't get \ncleaned up--the Superfund. I am looking to make sure I never go back to \nthat group because it has been 10 years, and I don't want them to ask \nme what happened. Maybe it will happen next year.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the \ncomments of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time does \nthe Senator from New Jersey have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 52 seconds \nremaining. The Senator from Oklahoma has 2 minutes 30 seconds.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, no one would suggest that we shouldn't \nlook for more efficient ways to do things with regard to the Superfund \nprogram. And there is always redress, unfortunately, to the court if \none wants it. But the Superfund Program has been working: 87 sites a \nyear, on average, were being cleaned up, up until the year 2000; over \n800 sites in all. That is pretty darn good. We learned how to do it. \nThe program is working. To deprive it now is really not what ought to \nbe happening. I am sure citizens across this country would agree with \nus: More money, more cleanups. That is what we want out of the \nSuperfund Program.\n  I yield back whatever time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have to argue with my good friend from \nNew Jersey. If he wants to use the Superfund Program as an example of a \nprogram that has been working, then we don't have any problems around \nhere because it hasn't been working. We have been working on making \nmajor changes. We are going to make major changes.\n  I yield back the time and move to table the Lautenberg amendment. I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin) and the \nSenator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I offer, on behalf of myself and \nSenators Snowe, Landrieu, Lieberman, and Levin, an amendment to H.J. \nRes. 2, the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations resolution. The \npurpose of the amendment is to reverse severe budget cuts to the SBA's \nlargest small business lending program, commonly referred to as the \n7(a) loan program. As part of the administration's fiscal year 2003 \nbudget request, the President under-funded the program by 56 percent, \nleaving small businesses short than $6 billion in critical loan \ndollars.\n  In order to restore over a billion dollars of that short-fall, this \namendment would transfer unused funds from SBA's STAR loan program to \nthe 7(a) loan program. As my colleagues may recall, the STAR program \nwas a temporary loan program that I established with Senator Bond to \nhelp small businesses across the Nation hurt by terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. Thousands of small businesses nationwide were \nhelped by the $3.6 billion in loans already made available through the \nSTAR program, and I thank Senators Hollings and Byrd for helping me to \nsecure the funding.\n  The authorization for the STAR loans has expired and rather than let \nthe remaining money lapse, we should re-allocate it to help small \nbusinesses have access to regular 7(a) loans. Just as we took care of \nsmall businesses hurt by 9/11, it is time to turn our attention to \nthose who need financing in this down economy when banks are \nrestricting capital to small businesses. Not only is the 7(a) loan \nprogram SBA's largest lending program to small businesses, but it is \nalso the single, largest source of long-term capital available to small \nbusinesses in this country. As banks have cut back on lending to small \nbusinesses, demand for SBA's loan programs have grown by more than 16 \npercent, and this is one of the few sources for working capital loans. \nAs I said a few minutes ago, by reprogramming this money, we will be \nable to leverage over a billion dollars in loans to small businesses, \nthereby stimulating the economy and creating and preserving jobs. \nFurther, transferring this money would be budget neutral and has the \nsupport of OMB.\n  There is much at stake for small businesses in all of our States. In \nmy home State of Massachusetts, if we implement the President's budget \nas requested, small businesses stand to lose $121 million in loan \ndollars and almost 3,700 jobs. As a nation, we would lose $6.2 billion \nin loans, which translates into 189,000 jobs either lost or not \ncreated. In this economy, we can not afford to lose any more jobs or \nhinder job creation.\n  This amendment was part of a more comprehensive proposal that Senator \nBond and I put forth last Congress. One part was to use more accurate \ndata and a more predictive cost model, and the other was to transfer \nmoney from the STAR program to the 7(a) loan program. That legislation \nhad the bipartisan support of then-Budget Committee Chairman Conrad, \nthen-ranking Member Domenici and Senators Landrieu, Snowe, Harkin, \nHollings and Byrd. It was approved by the Office of Management and \nBudget and voted out of the Senate by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, \npolitics kept it from passing the House. This Congress, our incoming \nChair, Senator Snowe,\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\nhas quickly taken up where Senator Bond left off, re-introducing last \nyear's bill, now S. 141, to correct the program's subsidy rate model. I \nthank her for her swift work and for joining me today in offering this \namendment. I ask all my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  In closing, I want to thank Chairwoman Snowe, Senator Bond, Senator \nConrad, Senator Domenici, Congressman Manzullo, and Congresswoman \nVelazquez for their previous and continued efforts in this fight for \nsmall businesses. In addition, I would like to thank the countless \nsmall business groups, from NAGGL and NADCO to the small business \ncoalition lead by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which included among \nmany others, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, National Small \nBusiness United, and the American Bankers Association, for their hard \nwork and support with regard to this matter.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 226, as modified\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the 2002 farm bill authorized the Grants for \nYouth Program, an initiative to develop pilot programs and expand \noutreach to youth in rural communities and small towns across the \nNation. The Girl Scouts of the USA, Boy Scouts of America, National FFA \nOrganization, and National 4-H Council will be key players in this \ninitiative. The original Senate version of the fiscal year 2003 \nAgriculture appropriations bill included $6 million in funding for this \nnew program. That funding was removed in the version before us.\n  I am offering an amendment to restore $3 million in funding for the \nGrants for Youth program. This program will be funded through the USDA \nExtension Service. In view of enhanced need for funds for education and \nother Federal initiatives for our children, we should also support \nprivate efforts to bring programs like Girl scouts, Boy Scouts, 4-H and \nFuture Farmers of America to our underserved rural youth. It would be a \nmistake to keep these marvelous--and proven--youth programs from \nexpanding to our rural areas.\n\n\n                  provo airport control tower funding\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the distinguished chairman of the \nTransportation Subcommittee, my good friend, the Senator from Alabama, \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. HATCH. My office was recently visited by the mayor of Provo, in \nmy home State of Utah. He reiterated to me the importance of erecting a \ncontrol tower to handle an unusually large volume of air traffic coming \ninto and out of the airport.\n  My colleagues may not be aware of this, but Provo's airport currently \ndoes not have a tower--even though it is the second most used airport \nin the state, providing a much needed training ground for new pilots \nand a landing area for corporate jets that keeps them out of the Salt \nLake City International Airport traffic flow.\n  It is my understanding there are 143,000 operations at this airport \nper year. I share the concern of Mayor Lewis Billings and the citizens \nof Provo that this type of airport traffic with no control tower is \nvery unsafe and, in the past, has led to a crash and a number of near \nmisses.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I note for the Senator from Utah that the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee has already allotted $666,000 for this \nproject in the Fiscal Year 2003 appropriations bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am very appreciative to the Senator from Alabama and the \nother Appropriations Committee members for this, and I know it will be \nvery helpful to the effort. However, I understand the House \nappropriation for this same project currently stands at $1 million \nwhich would really help the city of Provo get this project underway. I \nam also very appreciative for the Appropriations Committee's vigilance \nin keeping the budget to an absolute minimum and restraining \nsuperfluous spending. I only ask that the good Senator from Alabama try \nto work in conference to recede to the House number.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank my colleague for making me aware of his interest \nin this project. I know you recognize that we have a great many \nrequests for funding, and we are working hard to provide the \nappropriate levels for each one within budget constraints. I will be \nmindful of the Senator's interest in this project during conference \ndeliberations with the House.\n\n\n                      summer food service program\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I have long supported programs important to \nimproving the lives of children and, last year, I had included in the \nfiscal year 2003 Agriculture appropriations bill a provision to expand \nan ongoing pilot related to the USDA Summer Food Services Program. This \nincrease would have expanded to all 50 States a successful 13-State \npilot program to streamline the process of setting up a summer feeding \nsite. A report released last summer by the Food Research and Action \nCenter found that the 13 pilot States increased their participation in \nthe SFSP by 8.9 percent between July 2000 and July 2001. Participation \nin the rest of the Nation decreased by approximately 3.3 percent during \nthe same time period.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the efforts of my friend from Wisconsin. I \nagree that the Summer Food Service Program is important for several \nreasons. Not only does it provide children with a healthy meal, but \nmany of the approved sites that administer the SFSP also provide \neducational and recreational opportunities that foster learning \nthroughout the summer months while parents are working.\n  Mr. KOHL. While I understand the fiscal constraints we were facing \nduring this budget year, I believe that it is important that we \ncontinue to work to find ways to increase the number of low-income \nchildren who receive healthy meals over the summer. I believe the \nexpansion of the SFSP is an excellent way to do that, and I look \nforward to working with the chairman of the Agriculture Committee to \nmake such an expansion permanent during the reauthorization of the \nChild Nutrition Act.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Again, I thank the senior Senator from Wisconsin, and I \nappreciate his commitment to this important issue. I look forward to \nworking with him on this program during the upcoming reauthorization of \nthe Child Nutrition Act.\n\n\n                               Section 32\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have two amendments at the desk that are \nintended to address a critical shortage in nutrition funding for \nschools, food banks and soup kitchens brought about by the Bush \nadministration's decision to pay for Federal farm disaster assistance \nusing funds available to the Secretary of Agriculture under Section 32 \nof the Act of August 24, 1935.\n  Since 1935, the so-called Section 32 program has provided the means \nfor the Secretary of Agriculture to assist farmers and ranchers by \npurchasing surplus commodities, which are then used to help poor \nAmericans by providing emergency food assistance to those in need. It \ncreates a ``win-win'' situation allowing us to help our farmers while \nfeeding the hungry.\n  Section 32 is the primary source of federal funding for purchases of \nfood distributed to the needy through schools, state and tribal \ngovernments, food banks, soup kitchens, and other charitable \ninstitutions. Last year, USDA surplus food donations to the needy \nthrough Section 32 totaled more than $250 million. And the President's \nbudget for 2003 called for $215 million in Section 32 surplus food \ndonations this fiscal year.\n  On October 10 of last year, Senator Tom Harkin and I wrote to \nSecretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman seeking assurances that federal \nfunding for these programs would not be diminished this fiscal year due \nto the Bush Administration's use of Section 32 to pay for the Livestock \nCompensation Program. We were concerned that this maneuver--taking some \n$752 million out of Section 32--would constrain the Secretary's ability \nto provide the needed and historic levels of funding for federal \nemergency food assistance programs.\n  The Secretary never responded to our letter, but White House and USDA \nofficials met with hunger program advocates and assured them there \nwould not be cuts in federal emergency food assistance. Senator Harkin \nand I found this quite remarkable, because it appeared evident from the \nbeginning that the Bush Administration had over-\n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\ncommitted its Section 32 funds. According to the President's own budget \nfigures, it was clear that Section 32 funds would be depleted once the \nLivestock Compensation Program (LCP) was implemented and that was \nbefore a $185 million cost over-run was reported by USDA in early \nDecember, bringing the cost of the LCP program to $937 million.\n  According to the President's budget submissions and information \nprovided by USDA, an estimated $5.9 billion in funding will be \navailable for Section 32 during fiscal year 2003. This includes \napproximately $5.8 billion in new appropriations and approximately $92 \nmillion in carryover funds. Taking the original estimate of $752 \nmillion out of Section 32 to fund the Livestock Compensation Program \nleaves only $5.148 billion to meet the Department's other obligations \nunder Section 32. That amount is not enough to fully-fund the child \nnutrition programs and meet the Department's other obligations under \nSection 32.\n  In fiscal year 2003, to meet requirements of the Richard B. Russell \nSchool Lunch Act $4.746 billion was scheduled to be transferred from \nSection 32 directly into the child nutrition programs' cash account and \n$400 million was budgeted to purchase commodities for the child \nnutrition programs. In addition, $75 million was budgeted to be \ntransferred to the Commerce Department for fisheries activities; and \n$25 million is needed for Agriculture Marketing Service administrative \nexpenses. These expenditures alone exceed the level of funding \navailable in Section 32 after the LCP program is implemented, leaving \nno funding food banks, soup kitchens and the like.\n  I understand that the Administration has since shifted monies among \nvarious accounts, and was able to alleviate some of the pressure on \nSection 32 by tapping the Commodity Credit Corporation to pay for a \nportion of the commodity purchases for the School Lunch Program. This \nallowed USDA to come closer to balancing its books and freed up some \nmoney for emergency food assistance, but a gap still remains.\n  In a December 3 letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry, Secretary Veneman acknowledged that even after shifting funds \namong various accounts, USDA would be able to donate no more than $125 \nmillion worth of surplus commodities to food banks, soup kitchens, etc. \nthis year.\n  That is half of last year's level and roughly $90 million less than \nbudgeted for by the President.\n  It is a sad fact that this food is sorely needed. According to USDA, \nin 2002 more than 33.6 million Americans were food insecure--at risk of \nhunger. Nearly 25 million of them turned to charities that operate food \nbanks or soup kitchens for food. Sixty-two percent of the people \nrequesting emergency food assistance were members of families--children \nand their parents. Thirty-two percent of the adults requesting food \nassistance were employed. Of those people seeking emergency food \nrelief, more than one-third (36 percent) had to choose between buying \nfood or paying for housing. Many seniors have to choose between \npurchasing food or purchasing prescription drugs. For many Americans, \nwages and pensions have simply not risen enough in the last years to \ncover the increased cost of living, and food has become unaffordable.\n  These cuts couldn't have come at a worse time. With the weak economy \nand increased joblessness, demand for emergency food assistance is \nrising. A recent survey by U.S. Conference of Mayors found that during \nthe past year requests for emergency food assistance in our nation's \ncities increased by an average of 17 percent-the sharpest increase in \n10 years--with 83 percent of the cities registering an increase.\n  Now is not the time to reduce federal emergency food assistance \nfunding. Now is the time to increase federal emergency food donations, \nnot decrease them.\n  In his amendment, Senator Cochran provided an additional $250 million \nfor surplus commodity purchases, largely addressing this year's \nshortfall. If these funds are fully utilized to provide emergency food \nassistance this fiscal year, then I would agree that at least this \nyear's problem has been adequately addressed. However, I am concerned \nthat the Administration might elect not to use these funds this year.\n  And so I ask Senator Cochran and Senator Kohl whether they will \nentertain a question regarding the intended use of these funds.\n  Is it the Senators' intention and understanding that the $250 million \nmade available in the Cochran amendment for the Section 32 program be \nused to provide emergency food assistance to those in need this fiscal \nyear?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. As the language in section 205 of my amendment that was \nadopted by the Senate yesterday states, these funds would only be \navailable for surplus removals and would restore funds in the Section \n32 account that were used for other purposes this fiscal year.\n  Mr. KOHL. That is my understanding. I share your concern that the \nAdministration might elect not make these purchases, and it would be my \nhope that the House and Senate conferees agree on language ensuring \nthat these purchases are made this fiscal year.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will be glad to work with the Senator from Wisconsin \nand the Senator from Vermont to address their concerns during the \nConference.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senators for their assurances. In light of \nthis, I will withdraw my amendments.\n Mr. HARKIN. I would like to associate myself with the remarks \nof Senator Leahy regarding the restoration of Section 32 funds that \nwere depleted to finance the Administration's ad-hoc program to provide \nemergency aid to livestock producers.\n  On two separate occasions last year, the Senate passed provisions on \nstrongly bipartisan votes to provide disaster assistance for our \nNation's farmers and ranchers. Rather than acknowledging the need for \nthis emergency disaster assistance legislation, the Administration \ndevised a program of limited help to livestock producers and thereby \nput in jeopardy Federal assistance for the school lunch and other \ndomestic nutrition and hunger relief programs this fiscal year and \npossibly next.\n  The Administration funded the Livestock Compensation Program through \nthe use of Section 32 funds. Section 32 provides funds for school lunch \nand other domestic nutrition and hunger relief programs. Further, \nthrough Section 32 purchases of surplus commodities--such as fruits, \nvegetables and portk--USDA is able to support producers and provide \nfood to child nutrition programs, soup kitchens and food banks, and \nIndian reservations.\n  When the LCP was announced, the Administration estimated the program \nwould use $752 million from Section 32. However, due to the ``open \nended'' nature of the LCP and an under-estimate of its projected cost, \nas of December 3 the program had drained an additional $185 million--\nfor a total of $937 million--from Section 32. Even at the $752 million \nlevel, it was apparent that the Administration had over-committed the \nresources of the Section 32 account by several hundred million dollars.\n  Use of such a large amount of Section 32 funds diverted resources \naway from other agricultural producers who benefit from use of Section \n32 for the traditional purpose of removing surpluses from the market. \nThe shortfall in Section 32 funds also jeopardizes child nutrition \nprograms that depend on bonus commodities as well as The Emergency Food \nAssistance Program which relies on surplus commodities to supply soup \nkitchens and food banks and the Food Distribution Program on Indian \nReservations.\n  As a result of the current economic downturn, State, local and \nprivate contributions to food banks and other emergency nutrition \nfacilities are declining while demand for emergency food assistance is \non the rise. In fact, a recent U.S. Conference of Mayors report shows \nthat the need for emergency food assistance has increased by a sharp 19 \npercent this year. Pulling back on the Federal commitment to domestic \nfood assistance programs run by faith-based and other institutions at \nthis time would be unjustified and irresponsible.\n  I therefore commend Senator Cochran for including an additional $250 \nmillion in Section 32 funds in his disaster assistance amendment. If \nused carefully, this amount should be sufficient, although a larger \namount would have been justified. It is essential that Senate and House \nconferees protect the intended use of these funds. I join my\n\n[[Page S1438]]\n\ncolleague, Senator Leahy, in requesting that the Administration be \ndirected to use these funds for surplus removals and restoration of \nfunds in the Section 32 account that were diverted to other purposes \nthis fiscal year.\n\n\n    the importance of assisting Fox Islands Electric Cooperative in \nproviding affordable and reliable electricity to the residents of north \n                          haven and vinalhaven\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished junior Senator from Maine, the distinguished junior \nSenator from Maine, the distinguished ranking member of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee. As the chairman and ranking member are \naware, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service \nadministers the electric programs that provide funding and support \nservices for utilities that serve rural communities in order to assist \nin modernizing local infrastructure. I ask the chairman and ranking \nmembers to give consideration to the extraordinary electricity costs \nfaced by the island communities of North Haven and Vinalhaven, and work \nto have the Rural Utilities Service assist Fox Islands Electric \nCooperative in providing reliable and affordable electricity to these \ncommunities.\n  The 1,770 households in North Haven and Vinalhaven obtain electricity \nfrom four undersea electric cables that run twelve miles to the \nmainland. These cables, which are maintained by Fox Island Electric \nCooperative and serve as the islands' only source of electricity, were \noriginally installed back in 1978 and have now reached the end of their \nmanufacturing life expectancy. Over the past five years the cables have \nbeen failing with ever-increasing frequency and since February, \nelectric service has been interrupted four times.\n  I have been in touch with the Fox Islands Electric Cooperative and \nthe communities of Vinalhaven and North Haven about this situation, and \nit has become clear that the escalating nature of this problem deserves \nattention. With that said, Fox Islands Electric Cooperative is \nconfronted with the difficult decision of taking on significant debt to \nreplace the submarine cables or continue operating the outmodeled \ntransmission system. Unfortunately, both alternatives will continue to \nimpose high electric costs on the townspeople. Each household on the \nisland currently pay 15.5 cent per kilowatt hour, a rate almost triple \nthe national average. Without assistance in replacing these cables \nelectricity rates would rise to 23 cents per kilowatt hour.\n  As the chairman and ranking member are aware, the fiscal year 2003 \nOmnibus Appropriations bill provides $30 million for the Rural \nUtilities High Energy Cost Project to assist communities with extremely \nhigh energy costs. If the communities of North Haven and Vinalhaven \nquality for the High Energy Cost Program, this could provide much \nneeded assistance to the citizens who pay an extraordiarily high rate \nfor their electric utilities. Any consideration that the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member can provide is much appreciated.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I join the distinguished senior Senator from Maine in \nasking the distinguished chairman and distinguished ranking member to \ngive this unique situation consideration in conference. While many \nAmericans have experienced the inconvenience of a temporary blackout or \nbrownout, frequent power outages and high energy prices for the \ncitizens of North Haven and Vinalhaven have imposed significant \nfinancial burden and uncertainty on the community.\n  The placement of the cables on the sea floor, in combination with \ntheir old age, means that the lines are susceptible to damage from \nrough seas and fishing activity. Blackouts resulting from a severed or \ndamaged cable not only incapacitate local businesses, but also disable \nthe Water Districts, hampering their ability to maintain adequate water \nsupplies to the towns' residents.\n  Due to the complex nature of working underwater, repairing the \nundersea cables is both expensive and time consuming. Fox Islands \nElectric Cooperative currently carries $2.7 million in debt owed to the \nRural Utilities Service and estimates that replacement of the submarine \ncables will cost $7 million dollars. While the islands' electricity \ncosts have always been above average due to its remoteness and small \npopulation, frequent disruptions and repairs have raised electric rates \neven further for the citizens of North Haven and Vinalhaven. As the \ndistinguished chairmen and distinguished ranking member continue their \nwork on the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill in conference, \nI would greatly appreciate consideration that may be given to Fox \nIslands Electric Cooperative.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the distinguished Senators from Maine, and I \nwill be happy to work with them in conference on this important \nelectric project, which will provide affordable and reliable \nelectricity to the islands.\n  Mr. KOHL. I look forward to the opportunity to work with the \ndistinguished Senators from Maine on this important project to provide \na reliable and affordable source of electricity to these communities, \nand I will work with Senator Cochran in conference to remedy this \nproblem.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when we \nreach third reading, Senators Kyl, McCain, Dayton, and Stabenow be \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are still two amendments. On one we \nare waiting for the papers, and on the other we are waiting for \nclearance. One is amendment No. 207; the other is amendment No. 143. It \nis my understanding we worked out language so that these two are \nacceptable, but I do not have the language yet. We should have it \nmomentarily.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct, but we do not have the \nmodifications yet at the desk.\n  Mr. REID. I ask if the four Senators can speak after the vote. The \nreason I say that is the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the former chairman of the Intelligence Committee and \npresent chairman of the Banking Committee are scheduled to leave on a \nplane immediately. They both have very important speeches to give. If \nthey do not leave quickly, the speeches will not be given.\n  I am wondering if it is possible to do those speeches after third \nreading, but that does not work because we have amendment No. 143 and \namendment No. 207 still awaiting action.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I inquire of the Senators mentioned if those four \nSenators will be willing to speak after final passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Kyl, McCain, Dayton, and \nStabenow each have their time after final passage and that Senator \nColeman be added for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Stabenow has a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that \nhas to be part of the package, so I ask that she be allowed to do hers \nright now.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Stabenow may proceed now.\n  Mr. REID. Five minutes is what she has agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Stabenow seeks 5 minutes on a \nmatter of the sense of the Senate regarding instructions to conferees.\n  Mr. REID. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator be recognized \nfor 5 minutes at this time and I regain control of the floor after \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Does the Senator from Minnesota object?\n  Mr. DAYTON. May I inquire, I was not clear on the sequence. Will we \nhave the opportunity to make our remarks before the vote on final \npassage?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The request is that the other Senators speak after final \npassage. Two Senators have a plane to catch to go on a very important \nmission for the Senate and they need to leave.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 248\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask unanimous consent that it be considered in lieu of my motion to \ninstruct the conferees that is already at the desk.\n\n[[Page S1439]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 248.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 248\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the conferees on the \n     part of the Senate for H.J. Res. 2 should insist that certain \n  amendments to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 be included in the \n                           conference report)\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the conferees on the \n     part of the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \n     on this joint resolution should insist that the committee of \n     conference ensure that the joint resolution as reported from \n     the committee includes section 102 of division I, relating to \n     Homeland Security Act of 2002 Amendments, as passed by the \n     Senate, (relating to amendments to sections 1714 through 1717 \n     of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296)).\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as I indicated, my amendment is a sense \nof the Senate that insists that the conference report for the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act retain the Senate provisions that repeal the special \ninterest vaccine component provisions that were originally included in \nthe Homeland Security Act.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to send a very strong message to the \nSenate conferees who will represent our interests in the conference, \nand to the House, that we stand firmly behind the repeal of the vaccine \ncomponent provisions that were contained in last year's Homeland \nSecurity Act. We need a strong show of support in favor of this \namendment to demonstrate our commitment to public interest over special \ninterests. We also need to ensure that the conference report of this \nbill maintains a full repeal of that language. Anything less is \nabsolutely unacceptable.\n  Last November, Speaker Hastert and Representative DeLay gave only \nvague assurances they would strike the special interest provisions from \nthe Homeland Security Act, and since then I have seen signs that their \ncommitment to this process may have continued to slip, and we certainly \ndo not wish that to happen after the hard work of putting this language \ninto the bill.\n  Again, we need to send a very strong message to all the Members of \nthe House and the Senate that we must have full repeal of this special \ninterest provision, commonly referred to as the ``thimerosal \nprovision.''\n  I thank my colleagues Senators Snowe, Collins, and Chafee, who worked \nto incorporate the spirit of the bill, S. 105, that I introduced at the \nbeginning of the year that proposed a full repeal into the final \nversion of this Omnibus Act. I also thank the cosponsors of my bill.\n  Most importantly, though, I thank the families of children with \nautism for working so hard to repeal the special interest provisions. \nThey are the ones who have been successful in this effort, and I \ncongratulate them. I joined them in a capital rally a few weeks ago \nwhere we praised them for their courage, hard work, and commitment. \nThey traveled of their own accord and paid their own costs, which is \nvery difficult and burdensome for a family of a special needs child. \nThey came to Washington, DC, to fight to repeal this provision.\n  I promised those parents I would fight to remove it and that we would \nfight that it be repealed in total in conference and signed by the \nPresident. So I thank my colleagues who have been involved in this \nissue, and I ask that they join in keeping the promise to these very \nspecial families by supporting my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution concerning instruction to conferees, and I am pleased to \nconsider the Senator's suggestion. I ask that the sense-of-the-Senate \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 248) was agreed to.\n       Amendments Nos. 207 and 143, As Modified\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are two remaining amendments. No. \n207 is at the desk as well as No. 143, as modified. This is the \nmodification for No. 143. I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modifying the amendment? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is modified.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that the amendments be adopted en bloc.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 207\n\n  (Purpose: To expand the boundaries of the Ottawa National Wildlife \n  Refuge Complex and the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge)\n\n       On page 547, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n          TITLE ____--OTTAWA NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE COMPLEX\n\n     SEC. ____01.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary--\n       (1) to acquire land and water within the Refuge Complex \n     under section ____03(c);\n       (2) to carry out the study under section ____03(e); and\n       (3) to develop, operate, and maintain the Refuge Complex.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 143\n\n (Purpose: To clarify the obligation of certain producers and handlers \n      of milk to Federal order pools, to apply minimum milk price \n   requirements to certain handlers of Class I milk products in the \n Arizona-Las Vegas marketing area under certain circumstances, and to \n           exclude Nevada from Federal milk marketing orders)\n\n       On page 80, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       (a) Study on the Sale of Milk Into California.--Within 90 \n     days, the Secretary shall report to Congress on the economic \n     impacts to California dairy farmers from handlers or \n     processors of Class I milk products in the Las Vegas-Nevada-\n     Arizona region selling milk or milk products into the \n     California state order.\n       (b) Exemption of Milk Handlers From Minimum Price \n     Requirements.--Section 8c(5) of the Agricultural Adjustment \n     Act (7 U.S.C. 608c(5)), reenacted with amendments by the \n     Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (as amended by \n     subsection (a)), is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(N) Exemption of milk handlers from minimum price \n     requirements.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     subsection, prior to January 1, 2005 no handler with \n     distribution of Class I milk products in the Arizona-Las \n     Vegas marketing area (Order No. 131) or Pacific Northwest \n     Marketing Order (Order No. 124) shall be exempt during any \n     month from any minimum milk price requirement established by \n     the Secretary under this subsection if the total distribution \n     of Class I products within the Arizona-Las Vegas marketing \n     area or the Pacific Northwest Marketing area of any handler's \n     own farm production exceeds the lesser of--\n       ``(i) 3 percent of the total quantity of Class I products \n     distributed in the Arizona-Las Vegas marketing area (Order \n     No. 131); or the Pacific Northwest Marketing area (Order No. \n     124); or\n       ``(ii) 5,000,000 pounds.''.\n       (c) Exclusion of Clark County, Nevada From Federal Milk \n     Marketing Orders.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 8c(11)(C) the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 608c(11)(C)), reenacted with \n     amendments by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of \n     1937, is amended by striking the last sentence and inserting \n     the following: ``In the case of milk and its products, Clark \n     County, Nevada shall not be within a marketing area defined \n     in any order issued under this section.''.\n       (2) Informal rulemaking.--The Secretary of Agriculture may \n     modify an order issued under section 8c of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 608c), reenacted with amendments by \n     the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, to \n     implement the amendment made by paragraph (1) by promulgating \n     regulations, without regard to sections 556 and 557 of title \n     5, United States Code.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion on to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to pose a question to my \nesteemed colleague from Montana. It is my understanding that the fiscal \nyear 2003 Senate Appropriations Interior Subcommittee report contains 4 \nmillion dollars allocated for the Next Generation Lighting Initiative. \nIs that correct?\n  Mr. BURNS. You are correct Senator. Four million dollars is in the \nreport for this purpose which originated from a request to the Interior \nAppropriation Subcommittee in the form of a Dear Colleague letter dated \nApril 23, 2002, initiated by both Senator DeWine and yourself, which \ncontains 22 bipartisan signatures.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Senator Bingaman, as you know my state of Ohio is \nconsidered the home to the lighting industry, and from the start, I \nhave been a strong supporter of the Next Generation Lighting \nInitiative. I feel it is important that for the record, there is a good \nunderstanding by the executive branch on the legislative history of the \nNext Generation Lighting Initiative. Would you please be so kind as to \nshare with us its history?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would be glad to. The Next Generation Lighting \nInitiative was first introduced as S. 166 in the 107th Congress. It was \nthen included in H.R. 4, the Comprehensive Energy Bill, as amended by \nthe Senate, which then went into conference with the House. \nUnfortunately, the energy bill failed in conference, but the Next \nGeneration Lighting Initiative, and nearly the entire R authorization \ntitle were conferenced with the House. This agreed upon R \nauthorization\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\ntitle, with the Next Generation Lighting Initiative, is now found in \nH.R. 238, as introduced by the House Science Committee in the 108th \nCongress.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Senator Bingaman, did we not introduce this conference \nlanguage as a bill this Congress?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, it is now S. 167.\n  Mr. BURNS. My esteemed colleagues, Senators Bingaman and DeWine, I \nwish to thank you both for sharing with me the legislative history of \nthe Next Generation Lighting Initiative, and I hope this is of aid to \nthe Department of Energy as it manages this project. It will be useful \nbackground to my subcommittee as it performs its oversight duties in \nthe upcoming year.\n\n\n                clean water partnership for the americas\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Included within Senate Report 107-219, and repeated in \nChairman Stevens' Overview and Summary of his amendment to H.J. Res. 2, \nthe Omnibus Appropriations Bill, is report language stating the \nAppropriations Committee's strong support for the Clean Water for the \nAmericas Partnership. Does the Chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee share my expectation that the United States Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID) will fund the Clean Water for the \nAmericas Partnership at $10 million for fiscal year 2003?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my expectation that it will be funded, and I \nexpect USAID to communicate with you and your office in a timely manner \nto discuss funding for this program.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Let me add that the subcommittee would appreciate being \ninformed of these discussions. There are millions of impoverished \npeople in Latin America who lack access to clean, safe water, which is \na cause of chronic disease and environmental pollution. The Senator \nfrom Rhode Island's initiative, the Clean Water for the Americas \nPartnership, could help address these problems, and I would hope that \nUSAID would work with him and the Subcommittee to support it.\n\n\n                     sawtooth nat. recreation area\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, would the distinguished Chairman of the \nSubcommittee yield for a colloquy regarding Land and Water Conservation \nFunds for Idaho?\n  Mr. BURNS. I would be pleased to yield to the Senator to discuss this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. CRAPO. First allow me to commend the Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Subcommittee for their leadership and hard work on this bill. \nThe Committee has had to make difficult decisions with scarce resources \nand have worked hard to do so in a fair manner. I appreciate Chairman \nBurns and Ranking Member Byrd's effort and diligence.\n  Idaho is a state of spectacular natural beauty and wildlife habitat. \nOne jewel within the Gem State is the Sawtooth National Recreation \nArea, SNRA. The SNRA is a national treasure enjoyed by locals and \nvisitors to Idaho alike. The opportunity to preserve important parts of \nits pristine beauty is available through the purchase of scenic \neasements. Further, when the SNRA was established nearly thirty years \nago, a commitment was made to private property owners to secure \neasements.\n  In the past, funding has been inadequate to complete the easement \npurchases. However, in recent years, with the support of the Chairman \nand Ranking Member, we have been a renewed interest in completing the \npurchase of relevant easements within the SNRA. Idaho is grateful for \nthe committee's support in obtaining these easements.\n  It is expected that $3 million in Fiscal Year 2003 will fulfill the \neasement needs in the SNRA. Unfortunately, funding for easements in the \nSNRA was not included in the committee-passed bill. I recognize the \nsubcommittee is operating under significant financial restraints and \nnot all worthy projects can be funded. Yet, it is my hope the Chairman \nand ranking member can revisit their important project in the \nconference.\n\n  Again, I am grateful the committee has previously responded to the \nopportunities to use land and water conservation funds to acquire \neasements in the SNRA to protect the valuable habitats and scenic \nvalues. Support for easements in the SNRA are locally-driven, with \nwide-spread support and anxious willing-sellers. Completion of this \nproject will address the concerns of private property owners and \nprotect this wonderful resource for all Americans to enjoy.\n  I would ask the Chairman and ranking member if they would work with \nme in conference to evaluate this request, with an eye toward inclusion \nin the conference report.\n  Mr. BURNS. I appreciate Senator Crapo's interest in the Sawtooth \nNational Recreation Area. I understand this is an important issue to \nthe Senator and would be happy to work with him so that the acquisition \nof these easements will be considered in conference.\n  Mr. BYRD. I too appreciate Senator Crapo's devotion to the SNRA. I am \npleased we have been able to provide funding for this worthy project in \nthe past and are near completion.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator during the conference.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The chairman may be aware that drought in the west has \ncaused record low water levels in Lake Powell at Glen Canyon National \nRecreation Area. Does the chairman agree that the National Park Service \nshould use funds available in its repair and rehabilitation account to \naddress the recreation infrastructure needs that have arisen because of \nthese low water levels?\n  Mr. BURNS. I agree with the Senator that the service should make \nevery effort to address these recreation infrastructure needs, \nincluding boat ramp extensions and intermediate pump stations, using \nresources in the repair and rehabilitation account or other appropriate \nfunding sources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                         ergonomics regulation\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the \nLabor, HHS, Education Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Spector, to engage in a colloquy on certain appropriations \nwithin his subcommittee's jurisdiction.\n  There is a $2 million appropriation for the Department of Labor that \nindicates that the Secretary may use it if she decides to issue new \nergonomic standards. It is my understanding that the appropriation is \nnot a mandate or a direction to the Secretary to issue any such \nstandard, but it is only available in case there is a decision made to \nissue those standards. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would report that the language does not require the \nSecretary of Labor to re-issue ergonomics regulation, but simply make \nsure that funding is available for work within the $18 million \nrecommended for safety and health standards activities of OSHA.\n\n\n                          wildlife management\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill in a brief colloquy, and commend them, along with \nthe distinguished junior Senator from Montana, for providing \nsubstantial la mounts of funding in recent years for wildlife \nconservation efforts at the State level. As you know, United States \nlaws and policies place the primary responsibility for implementing \nwildlife management programs in the hands of the 50 States, but \neffective implementation depends on Congress providing consistent and \nadequate funding to the States. For decades, such Federal funding has \nfocused primarily on- and been largely responsible for- enormously \nsuccessful programs ensuring conservation and sustainable use of \nimportant wildlife species hunted or fished by the millions of \nsportsmen across America. At the same time, the population of many non-\ngame species has fallen dramatically over the past thirty years due in \ngreat measure to the lack of focus of Federal resources on the \nconservation of these species prior to their decline.\n  The bottom line it that it is in the Federal interest to continue our \npartnership with the States and provide adequate funding so we can \nmaintain the population of these non-game species of wildlife before \nthey near endangered status, which is far more costly to correct.\n  Funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service State and Tribal Wildlife \nGrants Program for Fiscal Year 2003 has fallen to dangerously low \nlevels in the current bill. I ask the managers of the bill to give \nevery consideration to addressing this issue to the best of their \nability when this important program is considered in conference with\n\n[[Page S1442]]\n\nthe House of Representatives. I yield the floor to my distinguished \ncolleague from Arkansas.\n  Mr. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I strongly support the remarks of my \nfriend from Virginia. The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants Program \nprovides States with the resources critically needed for foresighted \nand cost effective wildlife conservation and restoration efforts. These \nfunds will enable the States to probatively plan and implement their \nwildlife management strategies for game and non-game species in \ncooperation with landowners to their mutual benefit. I, too, would ask \nthe managers of the bill to give serious consideration to significantly \nincrease the funding for this critical program as it is considered in \nconference.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from \nVirginia and Arkansas for their support of this important program to \nassist States in implementing effective programs to ensure conservation \nand sustainable use of game and non-game species. As this program is \nconsidered in conference, I will give every consideration to the \nrequest of the Senators from Virginia and Arkansas, and keep their \nviews in mind as we negotiate a final omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. president, I, too, thank the Senators from Virginia and \nArkansas for raising this issue and for their strong support of State \nwildlife conservation efforts, I will give every consideration to this \nrequest as we discuss this program during a conference with the House \nof Representatives.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to thank chairman Burns and \nRanking Member Byrd for their support of the National Park Service \nRivers and Trails Conservation Assistance Program. I see the Chairman's \nCommittee report has included language requiring the Park Service to \ngive careful consideration to applications for assistance for the Ohio \nRiver Trail, the Fanno Creek Greenway Trail and the Tuscaloosa Nature \nPreserve and Hiking Trail. I would like to also bring the trail \nredevelopment project at Charles Towne Landing to your attention.\n  Charles Towne Landing in Charleston, SC, was the first successful \nEuropean/African settlement in South Carolina between 1670 and 1680. It \nis one of four original settlement sites remaining in the United \nStates. In 1971, the State of South Carolina designated the site as a \nState Park comprised of 663 acres, of which 196 acres are high ground \nand 467 acres are salt marsh and freshwater lagoons. Three trails make \nup over 6 miles of paths which edge freshwater lagoons and wetlands. \nWhen these trails were originally constructed in 1970 no consideration \nwas given to disability access, erosion control or archaeological \ncultural resources. Today, the trails are in a serious state of \ndisrepair. Would the Chairman and Ranking Member agree that the Rivers \nand Trails Program is ideally suited to provide technical assistance to \nCharles Towne Landing in their trail redevelopment efforts?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from South Carolina is correct. The Rivers and \nTrails Program provides significant benefits to local governments and \norganizations for river restoration, the preservation of open space, \nand the development of trail and greenway networks. Certainly, the \nstaff's technical expertise in ecologically sensitive trail \nconstruction would be appropriate for the Charles Towne Landing \nproject.\n  Mr. BURNS. I concur. The National Park Service should give careful \nconsideration to the Charles Towne Landing application as well as the \nothers.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Subcommittee for their attention to this matter and, again, \nappreciate their support.\n\n\n                              BYRNE GRANTS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Senator Stevens, I would like to speak with you for a \nmoment about the recent vote on Senator Harkin's Byrne Grant Program \namendment. While I agree with you that it is vitally important that \nthis Omnibus Appropriations bill adheres to principles of fiscal \nresponsibility, I must stress that the continuation of the Byrne \nFormula Grants is absolutely critical to local law enforcement, \nespecially in rural States like Iowa. I voted on the procedural motion \nto table the Harkin amendment, because of our need for fiscal \nresponsibility. However, I would not have done so, if you had not made \na personal commitment to me that the funds for the Byrne Formula Grants \nwould be fully restored in conference. Because the availability of \nthese funds makes such a difference to Iowa, I want to once again get \nan assurance from you that when we take the final vote on this bill the \nfull funding for the Byrne Grants will be included in the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Grassley, I appreciate your concern about the \nByrne Grant Program. I agree with you completely. I will commit to you \nthat when the conference report comes back here for a final vote, we \nwill have the Bryne Formula Grants in there at the House level of $500 \nmillion. I appreciate your understanding and help on this important \nmatter.\n\n\n                            hydrogen economy\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Senator Gordon Smith and I would like to discuss an \nimportant element of the Department of Energy's Hydrogen Fuel Cells and \nInfrastructure Program. This program is preparing the country for the \nnext energy revolution--what many refer to as the ``hydrogen economy.'' \nIt will establish an energy infrastructure for America based on \nabundant and domestically produced hydrogen, which will be used to fuel \nour powerplants, our homes, and our automobiles. The Senator's \nleadership, and that of the Congress as a whole, has strengthened the \nprogram over the past few years. However, there is one area on which \nthe House and Senate have not yet achieved a consensus, an area that \nSenator Smith and I believe is important for establishing one early \nelement of the hydrogen economy.\n  I am referring to fuel cells, and specifically the Proton Exchange \nMembrane, or P-E-M fuel cell. Is the Senator aware that this technology \nis being developed by American companies for widespread applications, \nincluding homes and automobiles, but that before it may be used broadly \nin these applications, the fuel cell must be greatly improved and made \naffordable?\n  Mr. REID. That is my understanding. Would you please explain further?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Congress and the DOE have partnered with the U.S. fuel \ncell industry, beginning with the space program and continuing today, \nto develop and demonstrate fuel cells. Early commercial fuel processors \nthat generate the hydrogen for fuel cells are being marketed tested by \nour industrial partners, as are P-E-M fuel cell powerplants. They need \nto be improved and demonstrated in niche markets. Then their costs will \nreduce substantially. As this scenario plays out, as it has so many \ntimes with the introduction of revolutionary new technology supported \nby the Federal Government, the very large residential and automotive \nmarkets will adopt fuel cells. It is then that America will achieve a \nsignificant level of independence from overseas sources.\n  Mr. REID. That is very helpful. Is it possible that there will be \nnear-term niche markets such as hospitals, aircraft control centers, or \nother buildings that cannot tolerate power failure?\n  Mr. WYDEN. That is correct. However, at the current pace of \ndevelopment it will be at least a decade before fuel cell systems are \navailable in any significant numbers for large markets. Meanwhile, \nJapan and the European countries are investing more in fuel cell \ndevelopment than the U.S. is investing, and we are losing our \nleadership in this area. Japan's investment last year alone was three \ntimes that of the DOE.\n  Senator Smith and I agree that U.S. fuel cell companies are ready to \ndemonstrate P-E-M fuel cell powerplants that will serve the niche \nmarkets, and can accelerate the introduction of fuel cells to markets \nin the near term and the larger markets in the mid term. Would the \nSenator agree that there is an exciting opportunity here?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, and what does the Senator recommend be done?\n  Mr. WYDEN. We suggest that the Congress approve $4 million for \ncontinued development and validation of advanced P-E-M fuel cells and \nmetal membrane fuel purification technologies in the Energy & Water \nappropriations measure.\n  Mr. REID. Do other funding communities support an acceleration of \nthese technologies?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes. The Interior Appropriations Conference, directed DOE \nto\n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\nprovide the plan and rationale for increasing the pace of fuel cell \npublic-private partnerships in the fiscal year 2002 report.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Senator Smith and I appreciate the Senator's consideration \nof our request. We thank him for the opportunity for this exchange, and \nhis continued leadership for the advancement of energy technologies \nimportant to our Nation.\n\n\n               southeast louisiana flood control project\n\n  Ms. LANDREIU. Mr. President, I rise to request a colloquy with my \nfellow Senator from Louisiana and the Chairman of Appropriations \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, regarding Amendment \nNo. 225 to provide additional funding for the Southeast Louisiana Flood \nControl Project.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, the Southeast Louisiana Flood Control \nProject is of extreme importance to me and Louisiana, so I will gladly \nengage in a colloquy with the junior Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I also agree that the Southeast Louisiana \nFlood Control Project is critical to protecting the citizens of \nsoutheast Louisiana and wish to engage in a colloquy with my \ndistinguished colleagues from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on July 24, 2003, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee unanimously approved the fiscal year 2003 \nEnergy and Water Appropriations bill, which included $55 million for \nthe Southeast Louisiana Flood Control Project. However, the current \nomnibus bill that we are debating regarding fiscal year 2003 \nappropriations only provides $40 million for this worthy project. \nAccordingly, Senator Breaux and I have offered an amendment which will \nrestore funding to $55 million for this critical flood control project \nin the New Orleans metropolitan area.\n  Although Senator Breaux and I have decided to withdraw our amendment \nfrom consideration by the full Senate at this time, we wish to inform \nthe Senate of this project and emphasize its importance.\n  The Southeast Louisiana Flood Control Project is commonly referred to \nas SELA. Its purpose is to provide flood protection to handle a 10-year \nrainfall event and reduce damages arising from larger rainfall events \nin the New Orleans metropolitan area. In 1996, Congress authorized \nconstruction of this project.\n  The SELA project is currently under construction and essentially \ninvolves adding pumps and increasing the number and size of drainage \nchannels in the New Orleans metropolitan area. The total cost of this \nproject is $647 million with a non-federal cost share of approximately \n25 percent or $166 million. To date, $308 million in Federal funds have \nalready been expended on SELA.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Louisiana annually experiences an enormous amount of \nrainfall. One example of this occurred in May 1995 when the New Orleans \nmetropolitan area received more than 24 inches of rainfall in less than \n24 hours. This area is particularly vulnerable to large rainfalls \nbecause the rainwater is trapped within the developed areas by the \nlevees at the edges of the Mississippi River which were built to \nprevent river flooding.\n  When complete, SELA will protect approximately 30 percent of \nLouisiana's population and 40 percent of Louisiana's economy. \nFurthermore, when complete, its average annual flood control benefits \nare estimated at $53.4 million.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the SELA flood control project is a \nsmart investment. By investing in these flood control projects, we \ncould prevent the expenditures of hundreds of millions of dollars that \nwill otherwise be spent in Federal flood insurance claims and other \ndisaster assistance programs.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, for all of these reasons, my distinguished \ncolleague from Louisiana and I respectfully request that SELA funding \nfor fiscal year 2003 be increased beyond the $40 million currently \nproposed in the omnibus bill and, further, that funding be restored to \n$55 million as was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee in \nJuly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will work with my distinguished \ncolleagues from Louisiana, my ranking member, and the entire Senate in \nour continued deliberation of the appropriations legislation so that \nthe construction of the vital SELA project can continue.\n\n\n                  Provo Airport Control Tower Funding\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the distinguished Chairman of the Transportation \nSubcommittee, my good friend, the Senator from Alabama, yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. HATCH. My office was recently visited by the mayor of Provo in my \nhome state of Utah. He reiterated to me the importance of erecting a \ncontrol tower to handle an unusually large volume of air traffic coming \ninto and out of the airport.\n  My colleagues may not be aware of this, but Provo's airport currently \ndoes not have a tower--even though it is the second most used airport \nin the state, providing a much needed training ground for new pilots \nand a landing area for corporate jets that keeps them out of the Salt \nLake City International Airport traffic flow.\n  It is my understanding that there are 143,000 operations at this \nairport per year. I share the concern of Mayor Lewis Billings and the \ncitizens of Provo that this type of airport traffic with no control \ntower is very unsafe and, in the past, has led to a crash and a number \nof near misses.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would just note for the Senator from Utah that the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee has already allotted \n$666,000 for this project in the fiscal year 2003 appropriations bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am very appreciative to the Senator from Alabama and the \nother Appropriations Committee members for this and I know it will be \nvery helpful to the effort. However, I understand the House \nappropriation for this same project currently stands at $1 million \nwhich would really help the City of Provo get this project underway. I \nam also very appreciative for the Appropriations Committee's vigilance \nin keeping the budget to an absolute minimum and restraining \nsuperfluous spending. I only ask that the good Senator from Alabama try \nto work in conference to recede to the House number.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank my colleague for making me aware of his interest \nin this project. I know you recognize that we have a great many \nrequests for funding and we are working hard to provide the appropriate \nlevels for each one within budget constraints. I will be mindful of the \nSenator's interest in this project during conference deliberations with \nthe House.\n\n\n                     BIA SCHOOL OPERATIONS FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the fiscal year \n2003 omnibus appropriations bill, Interior Chapter, I would like to \nengage the distinguished Senator from West Virginia in a colloquy \nregarding the School Operations Budget for the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs. As the Chairman knows, the current language of the Senate \nomnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 2003 eliminates $11.9 \nmillion in increased funding the administration requested for these \nschools.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I understand very well \nthe difficult task the Chairman faced in putting the Interior bill \ntogether under the difficult budget constraints we are operating under \nfor the upcoming fiscal year. However, the 185 Bureau-funded schools \nrely solely on the Federal Government for funds to provide an education \nto about 50,000 Indian children.\n  I suspect that the funding level for school operations in the Senate \nbill reflects the Chairman's wise desire to reject the administration's \nill-advised ``School Privatization Initiative.'' I commend him for \nrejecting the School privatization Initiative, but I hope we might find \na way to still retain the programmatic increases requested by the \nadministration for Student Transportation, Administrative Cost Grants \nand facility operations, as well as to restore the $2 million reduction \nproposed by the administration for instructional programs through the \nIndian School Equalization Program.\n  The House bill uses the funds targeted for the privatization \ninitiative to make the increases outlined above. I respectfully request \nthe Chairman's assurance that he will do his best to accept the House \nbill's level of funding for the School Operations budget of the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs when we go to conference, and I will be as helpful as \nI can as a conferee on this matter.\n  Mr. BYRD. I understand the concern of my colleague regarding this \nmatter\n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\nand thank you for raising it. The Committee realizes the importance of \nfunding for these schools that rely on the Federal Government for 100 \npercent of their funding. I can assure the Senator that the Committee \nis supportive of the Bureau of Indian Affairs school system, and I will \ndo what I can to see that higher levels of funding for School \nOperations are provided during conference with the House.\n\n\n            TRIBAL SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend my colleagues on the Senate Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee for their continued support and commitment to the Tribal \nSchool Construction Demonstration Program administered by the Bureau of \nIndian affairs. I also rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. \nBurns.\n  My distinguished colleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Burns and Mr. Byrd \nrespectively, worked to make sure that this important program received \nfunding this year. A tribe in my home State of Michigan, the Saginaw \nChippewa Tribe of Michigan, met with me and the subcommittee early in \nthis process regarding their intention to utilize the demonstration \nprogram. Thank you for all of your cooperation and hard work on this \nlegislation.\n  Over the last 25 years, the Saginaw Tribe has worked hard to create a \ntribal economy to provide education, health care, and other \ngovernmental services to its members. The tribe has made many \nconstructive steps towards self-sufficiency and is dedicated to \nproviding every educational opportunity to its tribal youth. The \ndilapidated condition of their current school facility has been a \nroadblock to further advancement. The temporary, modular housing \nfacility where Saginaw Chippewa children attend classes is inadequate. \nIt is a dismal learning environment, anything but conducive to the \npositive development and education of young minds.\n  Although the current language in the Interior appropriation bill only \nallocates $3 million to the program, a sum nearly $2 million short of \nwhat the Tribe is seeking in a Federal match, the Tribe would still \nlike to partner with the Department this funding cycle in order to \nbegin immediate construction of the Saginaw Chippewa Academy. The Tribe \nis willing to assume a cost-share greater than 50 percent to complete \nconstruction. In addition, the Tribe is also willing to forgo any \nfuture Federal dollars to fund operation and maintenance costs in order \nto receive the highest priority for a Federal matching grant as set \nforth in the authorizing language under the program. Given all of these \ncommitments, don't you think the tribe should be given high \nconsideration from the Department of Interior for this grant during the \nfiscal year 2003 year?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes, I agree with the distinguished Senator from Michigan. \nThe Senate did include funding in the amount of $3 million for the \nTribal School Construction Demonstration Program. The legislation also \nauthorizes the Department of Interior to continue administering the \nprogram from fiscal year 2003 to 2007. Future years funding will be \nsubject to appropriations. In addition, the authorizing language \nprovides that the Secretary of Interior shall ensure that a tribe that \nagrees to fund all future operations and maintenance costs receives the \nhighest priority for a grant under the program.\n  The program was first authorized and funded in fiscal year 2001. The \nProgram was reauthorized in fiscal year 2002, but the subcommittee did \nnot provide funds to the Department of Interior because there were no \neligible tribes capably of sharing the construction costs. The \nsubcommittee was pleased to learn that the Saginaw Chippewa Tribe of \nMichigan is eligible, willing, and capable to take advantage of this \ninnovative program during the fiscal year 2003 funding cycle.\n  The subcommittee believes that the Tribal Construction Demonstration \nProgram will continue to prove to be one of the most beneficial and \nsuccessful programs of its kind for the improvement of Native American \neducation facilities.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. Chairman, thank you for clarifying this issue and \nfor your support of this critical project. The Saginaw Tribe is eager \nto partner with the Department of interior to ensure that the \neducational needs of its people are met.\n\n\n                  Advanced Housing Research Consortium\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I request the Senate's support and \nassistance on a funding item of importance to the University of North \nDakota and other universities involved in the consortium for advanced \nhousing research.\n  Several years ago, my state experienced extreme flooding in the Red \nRiver Valley. These floods destroyed thousands of homes in my state. \nAfter the flood waters receded, the University of North Dakota, UND, \nrecognized the need for research that could increase the survivability \nof wood structures during natural disasters. To meet this need, the UND \nchemistry department began working with the Housing Research Consortium \nfor Natural Disasters to improve the durability of wood and to increase \nthe effectiveness of assessment and recovery technologies.\n  Although it has taken several years, I am pleased that this research \ninitiative has finally been identified for funding through the U.S. \nForest Service. The House fiscal year 2003 Interior Appropriations Bill \ncontains $1.7 million for this research through the advanced housing \nresearch consortium. While the initial request was substantially higher \nthan what was contained in the House bill, I think that this funding is \na good start and I urge my colleagues who will serve with me on the \nConference Committee to recede to the House position on this item.\n  Mr. BURNS. I understand the importance of this item to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, and I will work with him on this item when this bill \nmoves to conference.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from North Dakota, a Member of our \nSubcommittee, for bringing this item to the attention of the Senate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the distinguished managers of this chapter of \nthis bill.\n\n\n                  next generation lighting initiative\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to pose a question to my \nesteemed colleague from Montana. It is my understanding that the fiscal \nyear 2003 Senate Appropriations Interior Subcommittee report contains \n$4 million allocated for the next generation lighting initiative? Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. BURNS. You are correct, Senator. Four million dollars is in the \nreport for this purpose which originated from a request to the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee in the form of a dear colleague letter \ndated April 23, 2002, initiated by both Senator DeWine and yourself, \nwhich contains 22 bipartisan signatures.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Senator Bingaman, as you know my State of Ohio is \nconsidered the home to the lighting industry, and from the start, I \nhave been a strong supporter of the next generation lighting \ninitiative. I feel it is important that for the record, there is a good \nunderstanding by the executive branch on the legislative history of the \nnext generation lighting initiative. Would you please be so kind as to \nshare with us its history?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would be glad to. The next generation lighting \ninitiative was first introduced as S. 1166 in the 107th Congress. It \nwas then included in H.R. 4, the comprehensive energy bill, as amended \nby the Senate, which then went into conference with the House. \nUnfortunately, the energy bill failed in conference, but the next \ngeneration lighting initiative, and nearly the entire R authorization \ntitle were conferenced with the House. This agreed upon R \nauthorization title, with the next generation lighting initiative, is \nnow found in H.R. 238, as introduced by the House Science Committee in \nthe 108th Congress.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Senator Bingaman, did we not introduce this conference \nlanguage as a bill this Congress?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, it is now Senate Bill 167.\n  Mr. BURNS. My esteemed colleagues, Senators Bingaman and DeWine, I \nwish to thank you both for sharing with me the legislative history of \nthe next generation lighting initiative, and I hope this is of aid to \nthe Department of Energy as it manages this project. It will be useful \nbackground to my subcommittee as it performs its oversight duties in \nthe upcoming year.\n\n[[Page S1445]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while I appreciate the desire of my \ncolleagues to complete the omnibus fiscal year 2003 appropriations bill \nearly in the session of this Congress, this rush to complete the bill, \nunfortunately, allows for the addition of certain riders that should \nhave greater scrutiny prior to being added under the cover of darkness. \nOf particular concern to me is section 329, which would eliminate \nconsideration of the record of decision for the 2002 Supplemental \nEnvironmental Impact Statement for the 1997 Tongass Land Management \nPlan, forest plan, from the Forest Service's administrative appeal \nprocess and judicial review.\n  The inherent values of the Tongass National Forest to the American \npublic cannot be understated. As the Nation's largest national forest, \n17 million acres, located in southeast Alaska, it contains large tracts \nof pristine lands that are presently unprotected from future management \nactivities. This is the last vestige for species that once roamed the \nLower 48 States uninterrupted by the designs of humans. The Tongass is \nhome to the American eagle, grizzly bears, a variety of fish species, \nincluding the Chinook, Coho, and Sockeye salmon to name a few, that \nonce flourished in the rivers throughout the United States and numerous \nplant and wildlife species both common and unique.\n  Section 329 is opposed by many Alaska and national environmental \norganizations. Over 170,000 Americans commented on the agency's 2002 \nDraft EIS, which recommended no new wilderness on any of the 9.7 \nmillion acres of Tongass roadless areas. Over 95 percent of those \ncommenting urged the agency to recommend more wilderness protection for \nthe Tongass.\n  While there is a time and place for the appropriate management of any \nnational forest, making that determination of when and where needs to \ninclude the public in the decisionmaking process. Whereas, \ncollaboration and public involvement play an integral role in the \ndevelopment of any forest plan, at times there is the need for an \nobjective review to ensure that the public's concerns have been \naddressed. Removing these reviews, either through the agency's \nestablished appeals process or by the court, undermines the basic \nintent of allowing for public involvement in the management of the \npublic's lands.\n  It has taken numerous years to develop the Tongass Forest Plan; this \nshould not be viewed negatively, but as a reflection of the public's \npassion for this national treasure. The court told the Forest Service \nin a previous order to go back to the drawing board. This determination \nwas due to the lack of additional lands into the National Wilderness \nPreservation System. This court decision resulted in the 2002 \nSupplemental EIS, which now my colleague proposes to bypass both the \nagency's internal review process and the judicial system. It is as \nthough he is saying ``trust us, we will get it right this time.'' It is \nnot a matter of right or wrong, but a matter of due process that we \nneed to ensure has been adhered to, to ensure that the American \npublic's concerns have been heard on the management of their national \nlands.\n  This amendment would set a dangerous precedent for the entire \nnational forest system by essentially giving the Forest Service a free \npass to write the record of decision however they like because it \ncannot be reviewed. I urge my colleagues to remove the language and \ninstead let the review process work as it is intended to occur.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed that this \nbill contains a 15-year reauthorization of the Price-Anderson Act, \nwhich indemnifies the commercial nuclear power industry and limits the \nindustry's liability in the event of an accident. This act, which has \nprovided such protections for the nuclear power industry for some 45 \nyears, needs to be revisited and seriously reconsidered--particularly \nin the wake of the events of September 11, 2001. It is my hope that \nsuch consideration will still be given by the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, the Committee of jurisdiction of which I \nam proud to be a member, despite the reauthorization of the Act on page \n1027 of this 1052-page bill--a reauthorization which has not been \ndebated at all of the floor or in Committee this Congress.\n  In addition to increased security concerns at nuclear powerplants as \na result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there are \nadditional issues that warrant further debate before this act is \nreauthorized. Recently, the General Accounting Office found that \nliability limits under the Price-Anderson Act are not adequate to \nprovide for compensation of victims in all nuclear accident scenarios--\nnot to mention the kind of event we experienced in New York on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Also, questions have been raised as to whether the \nPrice-Anderson Act includes sufficient protections to deal with the \ncurrently deregulated energy industry--whether the act would operate as \nintended and ensure that nuclear powerplant operators are able to \nprovide compensation in the event of an accident up to the act's \nlimits.\n  A recent study has concluded that under the act, limited liability \ncorporations and multi-tiered holding companies that own nuclear \npowerplants may be able to effectively shield their intermediate and or \nparent corporations from financial responsibilities under the Price-\nAnderson Act and thereby walk away from Price-Anderson obligations \nwithout jeopardizing other assets. The use of these relatively new \ncorporate structures for ownership of nuclear powerplants raises \nquestions about the respective obligations of subsidiary, intermediate, \nand parent corporations to make the payments required under the \nprovisions of the Price-Anderson Act--questions that should be resolved \nbefore the act is reauthorized for a 15-year period.\n  In addition, there is increasing cause for concern regarding the \ngeneral safety and security of our Nation's nuclear powerplants. A \nrecent report by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) Inspector \nGeneral found that ``NRC appears to have informally established an \nunreasonably high burden of requiring absolute proof of a safety \nproblem . . . before it will act to shut down a power plant.'' In \naddition, the NRC recently ruled that the risk of terrorism is too \nspeculative to be considered when making nuclear reactor licensing \ndecisions. And a recent survey of NRC employees shows that a third of \nemployees question the Commission's commitment to safety, and almost \nhalf say that they do not feel safe speaking up in the NRC. While \nalmost 90 percent of the agency's executive-level employees answered \nfavorably to questions regarding the Commission's commitment to safety, \nless than two-thirds of those in the mid-level ranks answered \nsimilarly, according to recent press reports about the employee survey.\n  In addition, reports have been issued that show security guards at \nnuclear powerplants are over-worked and under-trained, that the guards \nthemselves do not feel that they are getting the support they need to \ndo their jobs right. In fact, a January 2002 report commissioned by \nEntergy, the owner of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York, \nfound that only 19 percent of security guards at Indian Point 2 stated \nthat they could ``adequately defend the plant after the terrorist event \nof September 11th.''\n  For these and other reasons, I strongly oppose the inclusion of this \n15-year reauthorization of the Price-Anderson Act in this legislation. \nI remain committed to a thoughtful reconsideration and debate of this \nact as it pertains to the commercial nuclear power industry, and look \nforward to addressing this and other issues related to nuclear \npowerplants, including the important issue of nuclear powerplant \nsecurity, in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee this \nCongress.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I intended to offer an amendment to \naddress fundamental concerns that a provision in this bill \ndiscriminates against children in need of special education services \nbecause they happen to live in the District of Columbia. That provision \nimposes a limitation of $3,000 on how much the District of Columbia may \npay per case in attorney's fees to plaintiffs who prevail in litigation \nbrought against the District of Columbia public schools under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, in order to enroll \ntheir children in special education services.\n  I would prefer that we eliminate section 135 from the bill entirely. \nCongress should not impose restrictions on the District of Columbia's \nuse of local funds. If someone is raising a child\n\n[[Page S1446]]\n\nwith a serious learning disability and wants that child evaluated for \nenrollment in a special education program, we have provisions in the \nlaw across America governing access to services. This law provides for \nthe awarding of reasonable attorney's fees at prevailing community \nrates to parties who prevail in their due process proceedings. It is \nonly in the District of Columbia that some Members of Congress want to \nunfairly limit the amount paid to those attorneys. These same \nCongressmen and Senators would never impose such limitations on their \nown States and districts. In last year's Senate appropriations bill for \nthe District of Columbia, the Senate overwhelmingly supported an \namendment I offered to soften the impact of a $2,500 attorney fee \nlimitation by designating certain situations in which such a cap would \nnot apply.\n  I have been engaged in extensive discussions with my colleague, \nSenator Hutchison, the chief proponent of section 135, which have led \nto a modification of that provision. The nature and amount of attorney \nfees in special education cases brought under IDEA raise serious \nquestions about both the adequacy of in-school programs to serve \nspecial education students and some aggressive activities of certain \nattorneys and firms. The modification raises the limit on the amounts \nwhich may be paid to $4,000 per action. It also precludes the payment \nof the fees of any attorney or firm whom the chief financial officer of \nthe District of Columbia determines to have a pecuniary interest, \neither through an attorney, officer, or employee of the firm, in any \nspecial education diagnostic services, schools, or other special \neducation service providers.\n  I note that this bill mandates that the chief financial officer of \nthe District of Columbia require disclosure by attorneys in IDEA cases \nof any financial, corporate, legal, board memberships, or other \nrelationships with special education diagnostic services, schools, or \nother special education service providers before paying any attorney's \nfees. The chief financial officer may also require attorneys in special \neducation cases to certify that all services billed in special \neducation were rendered. The bill also directs that the chief financial \nofficer will prepare and submit quarterly reports to the Committees on \nAppropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the \ncertifications and the amount paid by the government of the District of \nColumbia, including the District of Columbia public schools, to \nattorneys in cases brought under IDEA. The bill further allows the \ninspector general of the District of Columbia to conduct audits of the \ncertification to ensure attorney compliance.\n  I endorse the committee report's strong recommendation that the \ncouncil of the District of Columbia, in cooperation with the Mayor of \nthe District of Columbia and the District of Columbia school board, \ndevelop legislation to address conflicts of interest in special \neducation cases.\n  I hope these provisions will produce needed accountability. I hope \nthese provisions will help prevent manipulative practices by a few \nwhich unfortunately denigrate the honest, dedicated work of the vast \nmajority of the attorneys who devote their careers to serving \nvulnerable families and children through legal representation in \nspecial education placement cases.\n  It is my expectation that the reauthorization of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act and reform efforts by the District of \nColumbia Public Schools will make the imposition of caps on how much \nthe District of Columbia may pay in attorney's fees in IDEA cases \nunnecessary in subsequent appropriations bills.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I voted in support of the Edwards \namendment to delay the implementation of the EPA's final rule on New \nSource Review for six months for the purpose of ascertaining the impact \non air quality and human health. There has been significant controversy \nand uncertainty about the effects of this rule. I believe in this case \nwe need to have an independent assessment in order to assure the public \nthat this regulatory change will not jeopardize existing air quality or \nhuman health.\n  Given that the rule represents a significant change in national clean \nair policy, we should have this essential information in hand at this \nfinal phase of the rule-making process. However, we haven't seen any \nthorough or independent analysis of the pertinent data or a definitive \nassessment of impacts.\n  I have stated my strong view on the issue of global climate change \nthat we have sufficient information to move forward to define effective \nmeasures to address this most serious environmental problem. In order \nto move forward responsibly with this significant change of air \nemissions regulation, we apparently need additional scientific \ninformation.\n  I am struck by the extent of disagreement over the effects of this \nchange amongst air quality experts, members of the regulated community, \nair quality regulators on the federal, state, and local levels, and \nenvironmental groups. I believe the federal taxpayers who pay for this \nregulatory program, in terms of both dollars and health impacts, would \nwant Congress to approve the implementation of this new regulatory \nregime only if we are certain the costs are commensurate with the \nbenefits.\n  At this point, there is significant confusion on this score. The EPA \nhas testified that 50 percent of the facilities that are now subject to \nthe Clean Air Act's technology requirements would fall out of those \nrequirements under the rule changes. A number of reputable studies \nindicate that emissions will increase as a result. The argument has \nalso been made by the Administration and others that air quality will \nimprove because facilities would be encouraged to install new, more \nenergy-efficient technology.\n  This amendment provides a six month period for an independent panel \nof scientific experts to give us the information that we need in order \nto assert that this policy change will benefit the public and the \nenvironment, as well as the regulated community. Once we have this \ninformation, we should move forward decisively to either put the final \nrule in place or reject this approach.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 23, 2003.\n     The Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     The Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Inouye: We very \n     much appreciate your efforts on behalf of including in the \n     FY03 Omnibus Appropriations bill an amendment we have worked \n     on relating to the Department of Defense Total Information \n     Awareness Program.\n       We wish to let you know that as the Senate moved toward \n     final passage of the Omnibus Appropriations bill this \n     afternoon, our office continued to be engaged in a discussion \n     with other interested offices about the wording of the \n     language in Sec. 111(c)(2)(B) of Amendment No. 59 affecting \n     the scope of the Office of Total Information Awareness. \n     Questions have been raised that the wording of this \n     subsection of the amendment, as adopted, could be interpreted \n     to inhibit lawful foreign intelligence activities. That is \n     not the intent of the amendment, and to correct the problem \n     we propose to strike in that subsection (B) all after the \n     word ``activities.'' We are committed to working jointly with \n     you to address this concern through enactment of this change \n     in conference.\n       Again, we appreciate your willingness to include a \n     provision establishing strong Congressional oversight over \n     this program, and look forward to working with you to correct \n     the language to reflect our intent more accurately.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Grassley.\n     Ron Wyden.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after six continuing resolutions to keep \nthe Federal Government operating and more than 3 months into the new \nfiscal year, the appropriations process for fiscal year 2003 is finally \ncoming to an end. Of the 13 appropriations bills that were required to \nbe passed and enacted into law last year to fully fund programs for \nfiscal year 2003, only two were passed and enacted. The 11 remaining \nbills have been bundled up in this so-called ``omnibus'' appropriations \nlegislation.\n  And once again, as in past years, we are faced with voting on a \nmassive legislative package without adequate time for thorough review \nand debate. The 1,052-page bill before us, which appropriates \napproximately $400 billion,\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\nwas not made available for review at 9:00 p.m. on the night before the \nfirst full day of debate on the bill. The managers submitted for the \nRecord what would have been the committee reports for the 11 bills \nencompassed in this omnibus, but it was not available for review until \ndebate on this bill was well under way. Have members and their staffs \neven spent the time to learn what is contained in this monstrous \nvehicle?\n  When will we ever learn? I hope that the 108th Congress brings with \nit a renewed spirit of bipartisan cooperation. In the last Congress, \nsuch cooperation took a backseat to election year politics, partisan \nbickering, and ill-advised parliamentary tactics that had the effect of \nfurther polarizing this body. If we continue on this troubled path, we \nwill be in the same situation 1 year from now. And again, this will be \nat the cost of the American taxpayer.\n  During times of threats to our national security, it has been common \npractice to ask Americans to sacrifice to protect our homeland. \nHowever, today some believe it appropriate to merely craft this \nappropriations bill with little regard for the severe security and \nfiscal challenges confronting our Nation. We are on the verge of a \npossible war, and our economy is in distress. So what are we \nappropriating scarce resources for? Orangutans, pig waste, and sea \notter commissions.\n  There is approximately $11 billion in pork-barrel spending and a \nnumber of legislative riders that are riddled throughout this bill. In \nfact, Congressional earmarks reached their highest level during the \nlast fiscal year, increasing 32 percent from the previous year. The \nmultitude of unrequested funding earmarks buried in this 1,052-page \nbill will undoubtedly further burden American taxpayers. While the \namounts associated with each individual earmark may not seem \nextravagant, taken together, they represent a serious diversion away \nfrom Federal programs that have undergone the appropriate merit-based \nselection process.\n  As I discussed earlier today, one of the most egregious riders we \nconsistently see in appropriation bills are the Army Corps of \nEngineers's water projects. Water projects have become synonymous with \npork because of the habitual authorization of these projects in \nappropriation bills. These water projects continue to be slipped into \nappropriation bills without congressional consideration as to their \neffects on the environment and without going through established \nproject evaluation procedures.\n  Today's Washington Post reports that the Yazoo Pump project in \ncentral Mississippi--which would involve building the world's largest \nhydraulic pumping plant--would authorize $15 million to drain 200,000 \nacres of wetlands that is home to both waterfowl and rare plants. The \nsole purpose of this project is to drain environmentally sensitive \nwetlands for agricultural production. Touted as a ``flood control \nproject,'' the Yazoo pump is not designed to save homes or land but to \ndrain the wetlands for soybean and cotton production. More importantly, \n$30,000 of federal taxpayer money has already been spent to preserve \nthese wetlands because of their unique features as a bird sanctuary. At \na minimum, we should allow the EPA to complete its study of this \nproject--environment review is still ongoing. In fact, in the draft \nenvironmental review, the EPA gave the Yazoo the lowest possible rating \ncalling the project ``flawed and inadequate.'' If this project could \nnot proceed forward on the merits, why should Congress give its \nblessing to it in a rider to an omnibus appropriation bill?\n  The next project, located in Devil's Lake, North Dakota not only \nauthorizes a wasteful and highly controversial project but the rider \nalso exempts the project from standard evaluation procedures. Today's \nMinneapolis Star Tribune reports that the rider provides $100 million \nfor pipeline into the Sheyenne River, which flows into the Hudson Bay. \nBecause of widespread water quality concerns on connecting rivers and \nlakes, there is strong opposition to this project from the Canadian \ngovernment, the States of Missouri and Minnesota, and U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service, the EPA, national conservation organizations and \nenvironmental groups in North Dakota. Despite this opposition and the \ncomplex ecological issues raised by this project, funding has been \nauthorized and standard language requiring the Corps to evaluate the \nmerits of the project has been omitted. The bottom line: If this \nproject was ever assessed on its merits, it would likely never survive.\n  The report language for this bill directs the Agency for \nInternational Development to provide at least $2.5 million to the \nOrangutan Foundation located in Indonesia. The foundation likes to call \nthe orangutan ``the neglected ape.'' Luckily for them, they are not \nbeing neglected by the Appropriations Committee. And, the appropriators \nnot only like orangutans, they also are fond of gorillas. The Committee \ngave $1.5 million to groups like the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. Mr. \nPresident, why stop at giving special preference to these two primates? \nWhat about the other members of the animal kingdom? Which brings us to \nthe lowly catfish and its heretofore unknown relation to the cow. In \nthe emergency disaster relief section of this bill, a provision was \nincluded that would qualify catfish farmers for livestock compensation \npayments. As my colleagues know, the livestock compensation program is \na Federal farm program that compensate eligible livestock producers--\nsuch as owners of beef and dairy cattle, sheep, goats, or certain \nbreeds of buffalo--who have suffered losses or damages as a result of a \nsevere drought.\n\n  While I often take issue with various farm policies that \ndisproportionately benefit large agribusiness of farms at the expense \nof small farmers and taxpayers, or those that compromise American \nagricultural trade commitments, this effort to compensate catfish \nfarmers from a farm program that is intended for livestock stands out. \nI am certain that catfish proponents will offer a dozen different \nexplanations to justify this provision. However, not even hog, poultry, \nor horse producers are eligible under the livestock compensation \nprogram. Why should catfish then get livestock payments? Mr. President, \nwhen did a catfish become analogous to a cow?\n  Catfish farmers are hardly left out in it the cold--they are eligible \nfor other types of emergency assistance from USDA. Also, in the recent \n2002 farm bill, domestic catfish proponents were successful in banning \nall catfish imports by requiring that foreign catfish be labeled as \nsomething other than catfish. It seems very clear to me that catfish \nfarmers do not want to compete on a fair basis, domestically or abroad, \nand are willing to double-dip into disaster-relief funding intended for \nother farmers in need. Mr. President, let's remove this extraneous \nprovision and let livestock be livestock, not catfish.\n  Other interesting earmarks include: $200,000 for the Anchorage People \nMover in Alaska; $250,000 for the Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, \nVirginia for the Center for the Exceptionally Gifted; now they really \nare exceptionally gifted; $1.5 million for WestStart's Vehicular \nFlywheel Project in the State of Washington; an extra $1 million for \nthe National Center for the Ecologically-based Noxious Weed Management \nat Montana State University; $600,000 to treat waste on small swine \nfarms in South Carolina; $1 million for a DNA bear sampling study in \nMontana; $100,000 for the Alaska Sea Otter Commission; $300,000 to the \nSouthern Regional Research Center at New Orleans, LA, for termite \ndetection systems, evaluation of wood products for protecting building \nmaterials, and bait technology; $200,000 to study seafood waste at the \nUniversity of Alaska; $300,000 for Old Stoney feasibility study in \nWyoming; $650,000 for grasshopper and Mormon cricket activities in the \nState of Utah;\n  I am pleased to see that $1.5 billion was added to this legislation \nto supplement the $50 million that was originally appropriated to fund \nthe recently-passed ``Help America Vote Act.'' However, I am concerned \nthat this funding has only been added as a common pool and not \ndesignated according to the legislation that Congress passed last year. \nFor example, the bill would not explicitly fund the program to improve \naccessibility for disabled voters at the poling places. I urge my \ncolleagues to address this discrepancy in the House-Senate Conference.\n  I believe it is beneficial that the Senate address physician and \nhospital fee\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\nschedules under Medicare. Recent Medicare physician fee reductions have \nforced many doctors across the Nation to reduce Medicare patients, \nleaving seniors without access to the care they need. Similarly, rural \nhospitals, particularly in my home State of Arizona, have experienced \nan unfair imbalance in payment schedules compared to their urban \ncounterparts. Although our Nation's health care providers would benefit \nfrom provisions under this bill, I do not believe that appropriations \nbills are the venue for such legislative language. I am also concerned \nabout giving hospitals and doctors well over $1 billion in additional \nfunds from Medicare, without providing seniors with a much needed \nprescription drug benefit.\n  There are numerous provisions in this bill that circumvent the clear \njurisdiction of the Commerce Committee. Perhaps the most egregious \nexample is section 211 of Division B, which would grant new life to an \nalready failed shipbuilding project that has cost the American taxpayer \nover $185 million, and give it to a foreign-owned corporation. I've \nalready expressed my opposition to this special interest provision. But \nthere are a host of other items that I wish to discuss.\n  Another section of the bill would allow a narrow class of airports to \nexclude air carriers that may want to provide scheduled air service. It \nis my understanding that this is so narrowly tailored that it benefits \njust one airport--Centennial Airport in Colorado.\n  Another provision would allow an airport to give Airport Improvement \nProgram money back to the FAA enabling the agency to hire staff to \nspeed up environmental reviews of that airport's projects. This is an \narea in which the Commerce Committee took action last year, and we will \ncontinue to monitor and pursue further action this year, should it be \nnecessary. Appropriations bills are not the proper nor the traditional \nvehicles that should be used to address the AIP.\n  This bill also earmarks $1.2 billion for New Starts under the transit \nprogram. I find this set of earmarks to be particularly egregious. The \nearmarks do not just direct the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to \nspend the appropriated funds on pet projects in certain States, they \nalso actually change the recommendations that FTA has made regarding \nwhich projects should be funded and the level of funding each project \nshould receive in fiscal year 2003. Mr. President, when are we going to \nallow the FTA to do its job? The FTA, not the appropriators, should \ndetermine which projects have merit and should be funded.\n  This bill also would limit funding for the number of Coast Guard flag \nofficers to 37. While the Coast Guard is authorized under title 14 to \nhave 48 flag officers, it currently has 37 on active duty. But as the \nCoast Guard grows in size to meet its new homeland security missions, \nits authorized flexibility to promote additional flag officers would be \nseverely restrained under this bill. If there is a concern that the \nCoast Guard has too many flag officers, then that concern should be \naddressed through the committee of jurisdiction--the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  The bill provides $48.7 million for the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting for costs related to digital program developed associated \nwith the transition of public broadcasting to digital broadcasting. \nThis is $23.7 million more than the President's request, and it was not \nconsidered by the Commerce Committee, which is the authorizing \ncommittee. More importantly, I don't believe that Congress is \nexercising sound fiscal policy when we make a decision to appropriate \nmillions of dollars to publicly funded television stations so that they \nmay purchase the latest in digital technology. Rather the Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting should come before the authorizing committee to \nhave a discussion with members on how to best achieve the goals of \npublic broadcasters and ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent \nwisely.\n  The bill appropriates $100 million for fisheries disaster assistance. \nOf this, $35 million is for direct assistance to the State of Alaska, \nfor any person, business, or town that has experienced an economic \nhardship even remotely relating to fishing. This money is in addition \nto the $20 million for developing an Alaskan seafood marketing program.\n  Of the remainder, $35 million is for the shrimp industries of the \nGulf of Mexico and South Atlantic, to provide far-reaching assistance \nto these fisheries. $20 million is provided for voluntary capacity \nreduction programs in the Northeast and West Coast groundfish \nfisheries. $5 million is for Hawaiian fishermen affected by fishing \narea closures. And, 5 million for the blue crab fisheries affected by \nlow harvest.\n  The bill provides these handouts without requiring any accountability \non how the money is actually spent. Moreover, the allocations were made \nwithout offering any form of justification. How much federal money do \nthese regions really need, if any? If these needs are legitimate, how \ndo they compare to the needs of other regions? We may never know, \nbecause these appropriations circumvented every stage of committee \nreview. We have no basis for determining how necessary this is or \nwhether or not this is sound policy.\n  Another provision authorized the Secretary of Commerce to award \ngrants to encourage individuals to travel to the United States and \nestablishes the United States Travel and Tourism Promotion Advisory \nBoard; $50 million is appropriated to implement this section. This is \nyet another example of inserting authorizing language in an \nappropriations bill, and providing an enormous amount of money for an \ninitiative that has not yet been fully examined and discussed by the \nSenate Commerce Committee.\n  The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that the Federal \nGovernment had a budget deficit of about $109 billion during the first \nquarter of fiscal year 2003. That is significantly more than the $35 \nbillion shortfall recorded over the same period last year. And all \nforecasts project growing deficits for as far as the eye can see.\n  Our current economic situation and our vital national security \nconcerns illustrate that we need more than ever to prioritize our \nFederal spending. While I commend members of the Appropriations \nCommittee for holding down spending to the level recommended by the \nPresident, some of these provisions, as is the case in virtually all \nappropriations legislation, serve no national priority. My friends on \nthe committee are no doubt tired of hearing me say this, but I am \nobliged to do so; we can and we must do better.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nyesterday by Senator Bill Nelson and several others to increase funding \nfor emergency relief in Africa by $600 million in fiscal year 2003. I \ncould not be present for the vote on this amendment, but I would have \nvoted for it if I were able to. This additional funding is urgently \nneeded to address a mounting famine that has put an estimated 38 \nmillion people at risk for starvation in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and six \nsouthern African countries.\n  Because the President submitted his fiscal year 2003 budget request \nnearly a year ago--before the famine reached its current magnitude--the \nomnibus appropriations bill we are now debating does not provide \nadequate resources both to counter this humanitarian crisis and to fund \nongoing programs in Africa to assist poor and displaced persons. The \nUnited States has generally provided more than half of the food aid \nrequired to address this kind of crisis. The proposed $600 million in \nadditional funding is needed to reach the one-half mark and forestall \nfurther destruction in southern and eastern Africa.\n  The ripple effects of this kind of famine go far beyond the millions \nof Africans who are directly affected. Because severe famine can force \nfamilies to leave their homes--sometimes even their countries--in \nsearch of better conditions and to resort to other desperate measures, \nit can cripple economic progress and threaten political stability \nthroughout the affected regions. Ultimately, a crisis of this magnitude \ncan imperil even our own security. We have an obligation to the people \nof Africa and to our own citizens to provide the resources necessary to \naddress this emergency.\n\n\n                     emerald ash borer infestation\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill. This bill funds a wide array of vital programs, \nbut this bill does not address a relatively new problem that is \naffecting the ash tree population in Southeast Michigan.\n  I am talking about the Emerald Ash Borer, an Asian beetle that most \nlikely\n\n[[Page S1449]]\n\ntraveled to Michigan on wooden shipping pallets. An invasive species, \nthe Ash Borer is rapidly destroying ash trees in southeastern Michigan \nand as it spreads will do so nationwide. In the time that it has been \nin Michigan, the Ash Borer has already killed 6 million trees. \nIronically, this invasive pest has the potential to wipe out the very \ntree that was planted to replace the elm trees that succumbed to Dutch \nElm Disease.\n  Ms. STABENOW. My good friend and fellow Senator from Michigan is \ncorrect; the Emerald Ash Borer has the ability to destroy our nation's \nurban forests. The threat is so great that the Departments of \nAgriculture for Indiana and Ohio as well as the Province of Ontario, \nall of which border Michigan, have published warnings about the Ash \nBorer even though it is not known to have spread from Michigan, yet.\n  Currently, an Interagency Invasive Species Task Force including the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture. Michigan State University, Michigan \nTechnological University, and the Michigan Department of Agriculture is \nworking to analyze this problem. As such the task force has placed a \nquarantine on 13 counties in southeastern Michigan.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my friends from Michigan for bringing this problem \nto the Senate's attention. I understand that the Emerald Ash Borer may \npose a very real threat to the health of our Nation's urban forests.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is imperative that the Animal Plant Health Inspection \nService (APHIS) take a vital role addressing this problem. It is my \nexpectation that APHIS will conducted surveillance into this problem \nand develop a containment strategy that will lay the groundwork for the \neradication of this invasive species.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Having APHIS report on these efforts to Congress would \ngreatly assist us as we seek to assist with the eradication of this \npest and as we seek funds to help contain and eradicate the Emerald ash \nborer.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the concerns expressed by my colleagues, \nand I assure them that this subcommittee recognizes the horrible \neffects that the Emerald Ash Borer has had on Southeastern Michigan and \nthe potential it has to devastate our nation's Ash tree population. We \nwill work with them to address this problem.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Committee Report to the fiscal year \n2003 Interior Appropriations bill recommends a $2 million increase in \ntechnology deployment for the Clean Cities program and recognizes the \nwork of the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition to increase E-85 fueling \ncapacity.\n  I appreciate the Subcommittee's recognition of the important \nenvironmental, energy, and economic security benefits that would result \nfrom expanding our nation's E-85 fueling capacity. I would also like to \nthank Senator Byrd for the Subcommittee's recognition of the work being \ndone by the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition to increase E-85 fueling \ncapacity. E-85 is a form of alternative transportation fuel consisting \nof 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. It will help reduce \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil.\n  Currently, there are over 2 million vehicles in the national vehicle \nfleet that are capable of using E-85 fuel. The use of E-85 in these \nvehicles has the potential to reduce foreign oil imports by 34 million \nbarrels a year, while adding $3 billion to total farm income and \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  On March 18, 2002, 10 colleagues and I sent a letter to the chairman \nand ranking member requesting that $2 million be designated to install \nadditional E-85 fueling capacity across the country and to begin an E-\n85 educational awareness effort in cooperation with the Nation's \nautomakers.\n  It is my hope that, as this bill goes to conference with the House, \nthe Subcommittee would work to provide funding to expand the deployment \nof E-85 fueling capacity, which is important for my State and the \nNation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on Christmas Eve, the Department of Labor \nquietly announced that it would discontinue the Mass Layoff Statistics \nprogram, which collects data and reports on large layoffs involving 50 \nor more employees. It's obvious from the timing of the announcement \nthat the administration hoped few would notice this embarrassing \nattempt to conceal bad news about the economy.\n  Since President Bush took office two years ago, the economic well-\nbeing of America's families has dramatically deteriorated. Yet the \nadministration continues to support economic policies that neglect the \nbasic needs of working men and women, and lavish excessive tax breaks \non the wealthiest taxpayers.\n  The unemployment rate has risen, while wages have stagnated. Income \ninequality has increased, while stock portfolios and 401(k)s have \ndeclined.\n  The poverty rate has increased to its highest level in nearly a \ndecade, while household incomes have fallen and home foreclosures have \nreached their highest rate in 30 years.\n  Hard-working families are suffering. Nearly 8.6 million workers are \nnow unemployed, 2.6 million more than when President Bush took office. \nCompanies are more likely to continue to layoff workers than create new \njobs. Now is not the time to conceal information about layoffs and \nother important economic data from the public.\n  The mass layoff statistics are one of the best measures we have to \nunderstand the impact on workers of changes in the economy. In the wake \nof the September 11 tragedies, the mass layoff statistics were used to \ngive us a clear picture of the economic damage that resulted from \nterrorist attacks. Many businesses, particularly those in downtown \nManhattan, were directly affected by the horrific attacks and were \nforced to layoff many workers.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics added non-natural disasters as a \nreason for mass layoffs in its report, and these layoffs became one of \nthe few available figures on individuals hurt economically by the \nattacks.\n  Similarly, in the wake of the Enron, WorldCom and other corporate \nscandals, the statistics revealed the tens of thousands of layoffs that \nfollowed. WorldCom had 20,000 layoffs. At Arthur Andersen, 7,000 \nworkers were laid off. At Global Crossing, 9,000 workers were laid off, \nand Enron laid off 4,000 workers.\n  The Mass Layoff Statistics program is respected as one of the most \naccurate signs of the industries has been described as the best, easy-\nto-understand overview of which industries in the greatest distress and \nthe workers bearing the burden.\n  Unfortunately, history is repeating itself. In 1992, in a time of an \nearlier economic downturn, the first President Bush also canceled the \nMass-Layoffs Statistics program.\n  It was reinstated by President Clinton, and has continued to provide \nimportant information. Economic policy officials, state and local \nworkforce investment boards, state unemployment insurance directors, \njob training agencies, job placement organizations, and researchers \nrely on this data, and they deserve to have it.\n  The National Association of State Workforce Agencies has sent a \nletter to Secretary Chao urging the Department of Labor to reinstate \nthe program. As the letter says: ``The states have come to rely on this \ninformation as an economic indicator and a tool for operational \ndecisions on service delivery and funding allocations for dislocated \nworker programs.''\n  The Mass Layoff Statistics program provides accurate, timely \ninformation about the industries that are involved in large layoffs. It \nprovides clear guidance on how to allocate resources, set economic \npriorities, and respond to the urgent needs of the local communities \naffected.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has accepted my amendment to restore the \n$6.6 million in funding needed by this program. This is great news for \nthe State and local governments that rely on this information, the \neconomists who use this data and the American public, which has a right \nto know the truth about our economy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment that \nthe funding level for the State Wildlife Grants Program has been \ndecreased dramatically. This program is essential in our Nation's \nefforts to conserve fish and wildlife, because it focuses on preventing \nspecies from becoming threatened or endangered. Due to constraints in \nthis bill, the Senate had funded this important program at $40 million \nless than the House level of $100 million. Now, in the omnibus, this \nprogram is funded at an even lower level of $45 million. This is quite \ndisappointing. And there will be additional across-the-board cuts which \nwill hurt programs such as this one even more.\n\n[[Page S1450]]\n\n  Today, more than 1000 species are listed as federally threatened or \nendangered. The State Wildlife Grant Program helps provide resources to \nState agencies like the North Dakota Game and Fish Department to \nprevent further decline in fish and wildlife.\n  In this time of fiscal constraints it is important to recognize that \nthis program will actually save taxpayer dollars. Efforts to bring a \nspecies back from the brink of extinction are quite difficult and \nexpensive. The old adage ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of \ncure'' is most appropriate in this case. These funds allow States to \naddress such conservation problems before they become even more costly. \nThus, these funds simultaneously save both wildlife and taxpayer \ndollars.\n  There is growing recognition of North Dakota's national importance as \na key breeding area for migratory birds, especially grassland species. \nBaird's sparrow and Sprague's pipit are two priority species that are \nfound in my State in greater abundance than most other places. If we \ncan work now to maintain healthy grasslands, we can ensure that \nranchers can continue to work this land, as well as ensure the survival \nof these birds. This is possible when we work early to prevent problems \nrather than waiting for a species to become listed and endangered.\n  The State Wildlife Grants program has the support of our Nation's \nleading sportsmen and environmental organizations as evidenced by a \nletter delivered to each Senator earlier this year. This includes a \nbroad range of conservation interests such as Pheasants Forever, \nAudubon, Defenders of Wildlife, National Wildlife Federation, and the \nInternational Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. Notably, all \n50 state fish and wildlife agencies, including the North Dakota Game \nand Fish Department, support this program.\n  Because of this nationwide support, and our own understanding of the \nprogram's commonsense approach to conservation, 28 Senators--myself \nincluded--signed a letter requesting an increase from the fiscal year \n2002 base of $85 million.\n  I hope we will be able to increase the funding for this important \nprogram in conference and that we will be able to work across the aisle \nto restore much needed funding for this program. In fact, I hope we \nwill be able to restore this funding to the $100 million level that was \npreviously provided by the House.\n  The funding provided for the State Wildlife Grants program in this \nbill will significantly help conserve declining wildlife, but a \nsignificantly stronger commitment from the Federal Government is \nessential to address mounting conservation needs and, therefore, I am \nextremely disappointed that this funding has been cut even below the \nprevious Senate level. Instead, I support the House position that \nprovides greater funding for this critical program.\n\n\n                                smallpox\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished majority \nleader and chairman for their commitment to enhancing America's \npreparedness for bioterrorism. We have worked together successfully for \nmany years to help America prepare more effectively for the threat of \nbiological attack. The Nation is embarking on a program to vaccinate \nmillions of health care and emergency workers against the threat of a \npotential biological attack using smallpox, and I look forward to \nworking with the distinguished majority leader and chairman to ensure \nthat this program is conducted in a way that properly protects the \nhealth and safety of those receiving the vaccine.\n  Mr. FRIST. I appreciate the Senator's comments. I believe that we are \nall in agreement on the importance of a smallpox immunization program \nto our national security, and I look forward to working with the \nSenator and with Chairman Gregg to ensure the success of a smallpox \nimmunization program.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have offered an amendment to the current legislation \nthat would provide funding for a program to compensate those who suffer \ninjuries from the smallpox vaccine, and to provide States, localities \nand cities with funding to implement the vaccination program. I \nunderstand from my colleagues that, while they are unable to support \nthis amendment, they are willing to work with me on legislation that \nwould provide appropriate compensation for those who may be injured by \nthe vaccine.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senators' interest in this area, and I \nbelieve we should work to pass legislation to provide appropriate \ncompensation. I have scheduled a hearing in the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee for next week that I hope will delve into \nmany of the questions we must address in crafting the appropriate \npolicy in this area. We are all in agreement that we should work to \naddress this issue in a timely manner, and I will work with the Senator \nand leaders to ensure prompt consideration in the committee and on the \nfloor of the Senate of such legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am sure that my colleagues appreciate that \nimplementing the smallpox plan will impose significant costs on many \ncommunities. We should provide additional resources to allow \ncommunities to implement the plan without having to curtail other \nimportant health priorities.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will do my best to see that appropriate funding is \nprovided later in the year.\n  Mr. FRIST. I join my colleagues in their comments, and I am committed \nto bringing legislation to provide appropriate compensation to the \nfloor promptly and to address legitimate funding needs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my colleagues for their commitment to address \nthese issues.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to speak about an amendment that \nI have offered to get behind the nurses and patients in this country. \nMy amendment would provide $20 million in this bill to fund programs \ncreated by last year's bipartisan Nurse Reinvestment Act to recruit and \nretain nurses. I'm pleased that my amendment has been accepted by the \nmanagers of this appropriations bill. I thank Senators Stevens, Byrd, \nSpecter, and Harkin for working with me to include my amendment in the \nSenate fiscal year 2003 appropriations bill.\n  My amendment is a down payment. It has the support of 17 bipartisan \ncosponsors. The Nurse Reinvestment Act is an important bipartisan \naccomplishment from the last Congress. Republicans and Democrats came \ntogether to make this down payment to address the nursing shortage, a \ncrisis that impacts patient care across the country. Now Congress must \nprovide the funds to make these nurse recruitment and retention efforts \na reality.\n  America is facing a nursing shortage and it will only get worse. \nToday, there are about 126,000 nurse vacancies in hospitals alone \nnationwide. This number does not even include the nurses needed in \nnursing homes, home health agencies, schools and other sites. In my \nhome state of Maryland, about 15.6 percent of the nursing jobs are \nvacant in hospitals. More than 2,000 full-time nurses are desperately \nneeded.\n  In 2000, there was a shortage of 110,000 registered nurses in this \ncountry. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, this \nnumber will: more than double by 2010 to 275,000; more than quadruple \nin 2015 to 507,000; and reach 808,000 in 2020.\n  The demand for nurses will increase as the 78 million baby boomers \nget older and start to need more health care. The nursing shortage \ncomes at a time when nurses are being asked to do more: hospitals \ncaring for more critically ill patients; nurses receiving small pox \nvaccinations and giving small pox vaccinations to patients; and the \nnurses in military reserves called into active duty.\n  Most importantly, this nursing shortage affects patient care. Nurses \nare on the front lines of health care everyday in hospitals, nursing \nhomes, and home health agencies. A study published last year in the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine found that nursing shortages in hospitals \nare associated with a higher risk of complications and even death for \npatients.\n  Last year, Congress passed the bipartisan Nurse Reinvestment Act as a \ndown payment to help recruit and retain nurses, a first step to help \naddress the nursing shortage. This bill alone will not solve the \nnursing shortage. It does not address the fact that nurses are \nunderpaid, overworked, and undervalued.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act does three things. First, it helps bring \nmen and women into the nursing profession\n\n[[Page S1451]]\n\nby making nursing education more affordable. It provides scholarships \nand loan repayments in exchange for two years of service in areas that \nneed nurses the most.\n  Second, the Nurse Reinvestment Act helps keep nurses in the \nprofession by providing additional education and training opportunities \nand programs to empower nurses. It provides financial assistance to \npursue advanced degrees and training such as fostering mentoring \nprograms, internships and residencies, as well as specialized geriatric \ncare training. It also supports programs to encourage collaboration \nwith other health care professionals and promote nurse involvement in \ndecision-making. Finally, it increases the number of faculty in nursing \neducation programs by forgiving loans in exchange for a commitment to \nteach in a nursing school.\n  Last year, Congress put nursing recruitment and retention as a \npriority in our federal lawbooks. But this will be a hollow opportunity \nif Congress does not fund the Nurse Reinvestment Act this year. \nCongress must now put the Nurse Reinvestment Act as a priority in the \nfederal checkbook. Funding the Nurse Reinvestment Act in 2003 has \nbipartisan support from 37 Senators. I also want to thank Senators \nKennedy, Kerry, Jeffords, Clinton, Murray, Rockefeller, Corzine, \nLieberman, Collins, Sarbanes, Lautenberg, Johnson, Biden, Cantwell, \nSmith, Roberts, and Landrieu for cosponsoring my amendment.\n  My amendment is endorsed by the American Nurses Association, American \nAssociation of Colleges of Nursing, National League for Nursing, \nEmergency Nurses Association, American Association of Community \nColleges, American College of Nurse Practitioners, National Association \nof Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, Oncology Nursing Society, and the \nMaryland Nurses Association. Numerous other groups support funding the \nNurse Reinvestment Act in 2003 including the American Hospital \nAssociation, American Health Care Association, and the Federation of \nAmerican Hospitals. But most importantly, this amendment has the \nsupport of patients who want to have nurses when they need them. \nPatients across the country are depending on the Congress to help them.\n  This is my third nursing shortage as a United States Senator. I want \nto help find solutions so that it is the last nursing shortage. I thank \nmy colleagues for their support. I strongly urge the House and Senate \nconferees on this bill to keep this $20 million to fund the Nurse \nReinvestment Act in the conference report. Patients, nurses, and health \ncare facilities across the country are depending on your support.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my \ncolleague, Senator Larry Craig, which I am proud to cosponsor along \nwith the entire Northwest delegation. This amendment would provide an \nadditional $700 million in borrowing authority for the Bonneville Power \nAdministration, BPA, which will allow the agency to make much-needed \nimprovements in our region's transmission grid, modernizing lines and \nreducing bottlenecks. The borrowing authority will also allow BPA to \nfund new conservation and renewable energy initiatives and make \nimprovements at existing hydroelectric facilities, to make them more \nefficient and fish friendly.\n  This amendment is consistent with current law, advances many of our \nshared, bipartisan energy policy goals, and represents a sound \ninvestment for U.S. taxpayers. I would also point out to my colleagues \nthat this amendment is similar to legislation passed as part of the \nSenate energy bill last spring, which contained $1.3 billion in \nadditional BPA borrowing authority. Further, it is consistent with the \nPresident's budget request for Fiscal Year 2003, which provided $700 \nmillion for this purpose.\n  The Bonneville Power Administration--created in 1937 under the \nBonneville Project Act--has historically been one of the primary \neconomic engines of the Pacific Northwest. Today, BPA owns and operates \n75 percent of the high-voltage transmission system in the region, \nconsistent with principles of non-discriminatory open access. My \ncolleagues may be interested to learn that among BPA's various \nstatutory responsibilities included in the Pacific Northwest Power \nPlanning and Conservation Act of 1980 is that the agency must ``assure \nthe Pacific Northwest of an adequate, efficient, economical and \nreliable power supply.''\n  Even more specifically, the Federal Columbia River Transmission \nSystem Act of 1974 stipulates that the BPA Administrator ``shall \noperate and maintain the Federal transmission system within the Pacific \nNorthwest and shall construct improvements, betterments, and additions \nand replacements of such system within the Pacific Northwest as he \ndetermines are appropriate and required to: . . . maintain the \nelectrical stability and electrical reliability of the Federal system . \n. .''\n  The additional borrowing authority provided in this amendment will \nenable Bonneville to uphold these crucial responsibilities. It is also \nimportant to note that this infrastructure investment is one for which \nU.S. taxpayers would be repayed, with interest. As my colleagues may \nknow, BPA makes payment to the U.S. Treasury on an annual basis--from \nrevenues it collects from northwest ratepayers. BPA expenditures thus \ndo not place any long-term burden on appropriated or trust fund \nactivities. Indeed, the principal on all BPA capital-borrowing costs is \nfully repaid, with legally-required, market-determined interest.\n  Like most of the country, transmission investment in the northwest \nhas lagged behind demand. No major new transmission lines have been \nconstructed in our region since 1987. In the meantime, Northwest loads \nhave been growing steadily at a rate of 1.8 percent per year. This load \ngrowth, combined with deregulation of wholesale power markets, has \ngiven rise to a 2 percent per year rise in traffic on the transmission \nsystem.\n  In addition, the Northwest Power Pool has estimated that winter peak \nload will have grown from 59,972 megawatts in 1998 to 66,952 megawatts \nby 2008 or, by 12 percent. But at the present rate of transmission \ninvestment--without the improvements this amendment will allow--the \nsystem will have grown from only 61,415 circuit miles in 1998 to 62,325 \ncircuit miles in 2008--or, by 2 percent. In short, regional \ntransmission is not keeping up with load growth.\n  To remedy this situation--and in keeping with its statutory \nobligations--BPA has identified 26 groups of needed transmission \nprojects, for construction and energization over the next 5 to 6 years. \nThe first nine, some of which are already underway, would address the \nmost critically constrained pathways in our area.\n  The construction of additional transmission will reduce existing \nbottlenecks, reinforce the system to assure minimal conformance with \nreliability standards for major load centers such as Seattle, Portland \nand Spokane, and ultimately allow the integration of more than 5,000 \nmegawatts of new generation. I would also like to point out that this \namendment will aid in the acquisition of new conservation and renewable \nenergy sources, as well as make capital improvements on the 31-project \nfederal hydroelectric system--all of which are extremely important \ncomponents of BPA's multi-faceted public purposes.\n  This amendment will enhance the reliability of the northwest \nelectricity grid--and, by extension, the western transmission system as \na whole. It is consistent with the missions this body set out for the \nBonneville Power Administration, dating back to 1937 and in the \nlegislative history spanning the 66 intervening years. And it \nrepresents good energy policy today, which is why FERC Chairman Pat \nWood--in hearings before the Senate Energy Committee last year--voiced \nhis strong support for an increase in BPA borrowing authority.\n  I thank Senator Craig for bringing this amendment to the floor today, \nas well as all of my Northwest colleagues. I believe it has been a \ntremendous team effort that has spanned both a couple of years and the \njurisdictions of the Senate Energy, Budget and of course Appropriations \nCommittees. I would also like to thank the Chairmen and Ranking Members \nof those Committees for their support today.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I discussed an item in the Energy \nConservation account with the distinguished\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\nmanagers of the Interior Appropriations chapter of this bill. I believe \nthat the reliable, efficient, and clean generation of electricity is \nvital to the American economy. The Congress has made important \ninvestments in fossil energy research to improve the efficiency and \nreduce emissions of large, central power generation technologies. In \nrecent years the Appropriations Committee has recommended increases in \nwhat, I believe, are complementary and equally important technologies \nthat generate power on a smaller, distributed generation scale.\n  These smaller technologies, including microtubines, fuel cells, \nreciprocating engines and industrial turbines, range in size from only \na few hundreds of kilowatts up to 30 megawatts and offer many benefits. \nFor example, fuel cells and microturbines can be deployed in urban \nareas to provide power where the construction of additional \ntransmission and distribution lines is not practical because of the \ncrowded conditions. Ironically, these same systems are well suited for \nuse in rural areas, as well, where the cost of constructing electric \nlines to serve only a few customers may be prohibitive.\n  These onsite power generation systems are highly reliable. They are \nnot vulnerable to power line failures caused by weather or manmade \ncircumstances. Moreover, their smaller scale often allows distributed \nenergy technologies to be located in areas where exhaust heat from the \ngenerators can be utilized rather than released into the atmosphere. \nWhen used in a combined heating and or cooling mode, distributed energy \ndevices can attain efficiencies in excess of 80 percent.\n  The wise research investments recommended by the Committee will help \nconserve our important domestic energy resources, reduce environmental \nemissions, and help American companies and their employees maintain \nU.S. leadership in global markets for these technologies. I compliment \nthe Senators from Montana and West Virginia for their leadership in \nthis allocation of scarce resources available to the Committee.\n  Through the National Accounts Energy Alliance, the natural gas \nindustry has worked closely with leading commercial and industrial \ncompanies who are logical candidates to use these distributed energy \ntechnologies as they become ready for testing in the market place. This \nis a partnership between government and the private sector. It marries \nthe technology developers with the technology users such as major \ngrocery stores, restaurant chains, and building developers. Most \nimportant, the Alliance serves to ensure that market requirements are \nfully understood by those who develop the technologies and that field \ntesting in specific applications, which is essential to market \nacceptance and technology improvement, is an integral part of the \ndevelopment process.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the House-passed version of the \nFiscal Year 2003 Department of the Interior and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill included $3 million for this ``applications \nintegration.'' The Senate Committee report passed last summer is not \nspecific about how the Department should allocate funds to the National \nAccounts Energy Alliance. I would hope that in conference we could \naccept the specific funding level provided in the House report for \napplications integration including the National Accounts Energy \nAlliance.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis kind words as a member of the Interior subcommittee.\n  The Senator is correct. The House has recommended $3 million for \n``applications integration.'' I say to the Senator that he is always a \nstrong and compelling advocate and that I will endeavor to give his \nrequest every favorable consideration within the limitations that will \nconfront the conferees on this bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota \nfor bringing this matter to our attention. I, too, will work with him \nduring the conference in support of his request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senators.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I had planned to offer an amendment to \neliminate a dangerous anti-environmental rider that was slipped into \nthis bill. I am not going to offer that amendment today because I \nbelieve the best strategy is to strip it in conference.\n  However, I want to take just a couple of minutes to let my colleagues \nknow about this rider and to explain the bad precedent we would be \nsetting.\n  In the National Forest Management Act, Congress requires a review of \nroadless areas for possible designation as wilderness areas. Under the \nNational Environmental Protection Act we also require that this process \ninvolve the public and the right to appeal those decisions.\n  In 1997 a management plan for the Tongass National Forest was \nproposed that did not adequately address the question of wilderness \ndesignations. In response, a federal district court in Alaska ordered \nthe Forest Service to complete a supplemental evaluation of possible \nwilderness areas. The Draft was released in May of 2002, with 8 \nalternatives. The administration's preferred alternative was no \nadditional wilderness areas. A final recommendation is due to be \nreleased in February. At that point, the public has the opportunity to \nappeal the agency's decisions through the administrative process, and \nif necessary to make use of the courts.\n  Section 329 of the Interior Appropriations section of this bill would \neliminate judicial and public oversight of U.S. Forest Service \nwilderness recommendations in the Tongass National Forest. In doing so, \nit waives two key environmental laws--laws that protect the right of \nthe public to be involved in decision-making--the National \nEnvironmental Protection Act and the National Forest Management Act. \nThis language will prevent the public, the states and the localities of \ntheir right to participate in the decision-making process.\n  Even more egregious, section 329 prohibits any judicial review or \nappeal of a decision on the Tongass Land Management Plan--a decision \nthat has not even been made. So, before we know what the decision is, \nthis section says there can be no more public input and no judicial \nreview. This is a very bad precedent.\n  Judicial and public oversight are an intrinsic part of the process of \nenvironmental decision-making. In fact, the laws that govern management \nof our public lands are built on these principles of judicial and \npublic oversight. These are our public lands, and we all have a right \nto take part in deciding how they are managed, how they are protected, \nand how they are exploited. Stripping away the ability of the American \npeople to take part in the process is contrary to the spirit of our \nlaws.\n  One hundred years ago, Republican President Teddy Roosevelt \nestablished the Tongass National Forest in Alaska with the support of \nthe Alaskan people. For the last hundred years we have managed the \nTongass in concert with the wishes of the public because we have had \npublic participation.\n  This rider ignores history, it ignores our environmental laws and it \ncreates dangerous precedent.\n  It is dangerous because it is a back door attempt to silence the \npublic. It is dangerous because it is a back door attempt to override \nour laws, laws passed by this Congress after extensive debate. It is \ndangerous because it is a backdoor attempt to eliminate the normal \nchecks and balances that are inherent in our system. And it is a \ndangerous thing for those of us who have pristine lands in our states.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to express opposition to a provision \nin the bill that syphons off critically needed enforcement funds in \norder to create an unnecessary bureaucracy.\n  The bill instructs the Secretary of Labor to create an Office of \nPension Participant Advocacy. Committee language indicates that this \noffice is to serve as a career ombudsman in the Department to advise \nCongress and the administration on necessary changes in policies to \naddress problems affecting pension participants. It would also be \ncharged with coordinating public and private efforts to assist \nparticipants and provide meaningful information.\n  At this time of heightened concern for pension plan stability, it \nmakes no sense to curtail the enforcement budget of the Pension & \nWelfare Benefits Administration (PWBA). President\n\n[[Page S1453]]\n\nBush had requested an additional $3 million for enforcement and \ncompliance activities. This bill takes that $3 million and puts it \ninstead in the separate Management account to create a new, unnecessary \noffice.\n  With every new corporate scandal, pension plan stability is put in \ndoubt, and the PWBA is called into action. There is every reason to \nbelieve that Fiscal Year 2003 will be one of the agency's busiest \nevery. Yet the money needed for enforcement has been diverted to create \na new bureaucracy that duplicates current functions.\n  Since the collapse of Enron, more Americans than ever have learned of \nthe important and effective work of the PWBA. We all hailed the \nagency's action in ousting the Enron pension plan board of trustees, \nand putting outside experts in their place. The PWBA's profile has \nnever been higher, and its needs have never been greater. Now is the \ntime to fund pension plan enforcement.\n  If this provision in the appropriations bill is allowed to become \nlaw, pension plan participants will be the losers. Enforcement efforts \nby the Department of Labor in their behalf will be curtailed. The money \nfor enforcing their claims will have been diverted to decorate new \noffices for bureaucrats.\n  As the chairman of the authorizing Committee for the Department of \nLabor, I am strongly opposed to efforts to restructure an important \nfunction of the Department. Likewise, I object to efforts to divert \nresources away from needed investigations, compliance efforts, and \nparticipant education. I oppose the creation of an Office of Pension \nParticipant Advocacy at this time and in this manner.\n  It must be recognized that the creation of such an Office is already \nwithin the management prerogative of the Secretary of Labor. She could \ncreate a separate office under current authority and resources. The \nproposal in the committee report language in essence micro-manages the \nDepartment.\n  The proposed functions of the Office of Pension Participant Advocacy \nare duplicative of the ongoing functions of Pension and Welfare \nBenefits Administration (PWBA) of the Department of Labor.\n  Today there are more than 100 highly trained and dedicated Benefits \nAdvisors working out of PWBA's national office and 15 field offices \nlocated throughout the country. In 1996, PWBA had only 12 Benefits \nAdvisors all located in the national office.\n  The creation of this team of Benefits Advisors represents a serious \ncommitment on the part of the Department to protecting the rights of \nand helping workers obtain the benefits to which they are entitled.\n  The Benefits Advisors handled 170,000 inquiries in 2001 and recovered \nover $64 million in benefits for participants and beneficiaries through \ninformed individual dispute resolution. Over $250 million have been \nobtained through this informal process over the last five years. These \ndollars are separate from any amounts recovered through the formal \ninvestigative process.\n  Complaint referrals from PWBA's benefits advisors have become the \nbest source of investigative case leads. If a complaint from an \nindividual appears to indicate a fiduciary violation by the plan or a \nmatter that impacts several participants and not just one individual, \nthen that inquiry is referred to an investigator.\n  According to statistics from the PWBA, last year 1,263 investigations \nwere opened as a result of referrals from the Benefits Advisors; 1,238 \ninvestigations were closed with over $111 million in monetary results.\n  The proposed research functions of the Office of Pension Participant \nAdvocate also duplicate important research of the General Accounting \nOffice and investigations of the Department's Inspector General.\n  It is premature to establish an Office of Pension Participant \nAdvocacy since it is the subject of ongoing legislative debate. Last \nyear, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee narrowly \nreported out a pension reform bill that included a section creating an \noffice of Pension Participant Advocacy with wider scope than is \nincluded in this appropriations bill. This year, the Democrat pension \nbill, S. 9, fails to include this controversial and unnecessary \nbureaucracy.\n  The ERISA Industry Committee makes the point quite succinctly in a \nletter to every Senator: ``the creation of a new office in the federal \ngovernment should be subject of full debate in the light of day. New \ngovernment bureaucracy should not be established by adding provisions \nto appropriations bills, the language of which is unavailable to the \npublic until after Committee consideration.'' I share their concerns.\n\n  Therefore, it is inappropriate through this bill to divert and \nrestructure the important work of the Department of Labor in protecting \nworkers' pensions. I regret the manner in which this provision was \nadded to this legislation and I will work to oppose it at every turn.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I submitted an amendment to extend the \nauthority for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, SPR, is the major tool the United States has to deal with the \nimpact of a significant disruption in oil supplies. Current \nauthorizations to the President to release or drawdown oil from the SPR \nwill expire on September 30, 2003.\n  Release of oil from the SPR, in coordination with stock drawdowns \nwith other consumer nations is done pursuant to the International \nEnergy Agency's International Energy Program, IEP, Agreement. Actions \ntaken under this agreement seek to add more supply to a tight market, \nreducing the possibility of price spikes and economic havoc that oil \nmarkets experienced during such incidents as the Arab oil embargo. \nDecisions to withdraw crude oil from the SPR during an energy emergency \nare made by the President under the authorities of the Energy Policy \nand Conservation Act.\n  It is important to extend the SPR authority on this legislation. \nWhile it may be possible to move legislation through the Energy \nCommittee, there is no guarantee that a separate bill would be \ncompleted and on the President's desk before September 30. Therefore, \nthe prudent thing for the Senate to do is to add this language to the \nOmnibus Appropriation bill. Such precautionary action has already been \ntaken with regard to Price Anderson authority which does not expire \nuntil the end in 2004.\n  My amendment incorporates the exact language that was agreed to last \nfall by the House and Senate conferees on H.R. 4, the comprehensive \nenergy bill.\n  The amendment:\n  Permanently authorizes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and our \nparticipation in the International Energy program.\n  Codifies current Administration policy that the reserve be filled to \n700 million barrels which is its current capacity. This does not affect \nthe Administration's discretion to adjust the timing and extent of fill \nin light of market conditions.\n  Permanently authorizes the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve program.\n  Current market disruptions such as political unrest in Venezuela and \nthe potential threat of a war with Iraq have already led to unusually \nhigh oil prices and talk of potentially tapping the SPR. In the current \nmarket context, operation of the SPR should be a top concern to all \nSenators.\n\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I thought I would talk a little \nabout the current situation regarding oil production in two important \noil producing states--Venezuela & Iraq. The current uncertainty over \nproduction in Venezuela and the possibility of war with Iraq has \ncontributed to the high oil prices we see today.\n  On December 2, oil workers opposed to Venezuelan President Chavez, \ninitiated a general strike, now in its 53rd day. The strike has nearly \nshut down the government-owned oil company PdVSA. Production has \ndropped from 2.7 million barrels per day to less than half a million. \nAt the same time, world oil prices, currently at a 2 year high, have \nrisen more than $8 per barrel, or 30 percent since the strike began. \nOil market experts attribute half of the price increase to the \npolitical unrest and production uncertainty in Venezuela.\n  The U.S. imports a significant amount of Venezuelan crude. Roughly 16 \npercent of U.S. imports come from Venezuela, or what on average amounts \nto more than a million barrels per day, according to the EIA. In the\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\nabsence of Venezuelan imports, U.S. refiners have had to dip into their \nown inventory stocks and resort to using other crudes. Absent \nVenezuelan imports, the U.S. has increased its import of Iraqi crude in \nthe last month.\n  Even though OPEC overproduction helped cushion the strike's impact at \nthe outset, U.S. refiners had to turn to their own inventories and to \nIraqi crude to make up for lost imports. Those inventories are already \nbelow normal operational inventory level. Even if the strike were to \nend today, experts are unsure how long it will take to bring Venezuelan \ncrude production back to its pre-strike level of three million barrels \nper day. It is unclear how carefully the oil wells in PdVSA's fields \nwere shut down improperly, it may take more than six months to bring \nthem back online.\n  Although some strikers have returned to work and the government \nsucceeded in pumping up light crude production, Venezuela has not been \nable to restart production of its trademark heavy crude. To add to the \nuncertainty, Venezuela's Central Bank closed the country's foreign \nexchange market on Wednesday frustrating oil operators' ability to \nconvert currency. The reliability of Iraqi crude supplies going forward \nis also uncertain.\n\n  The threat of war with Iraq has contributed to unusually high oil \nprices and talk of potentially tapping into the SPR. This region's \nimportance to the stability of not only U.S. but also world markets \ncannot be understated.\n  Iraq represents 6 percent of U.S. petroleum imports and the Persian \nGulf region represents 25 percent. If military conflict disrupts oil \nimports from Iraq or other gulf states, the larger shortfall may exceed \nOPEC's leftover capacity. Even under a benign war scenario, panicked \nbuying and a rise in crude prices would still occur at the outset of \nthe conflict. Price estimates from oil analysts at the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies range up to $80 barrel oil for the \nworst case scenario.\n  In addition to the impact of a war on oil from Iraq, we cannot be \ncertain about Iraqi production after a conflict is concluded. If Iraqi \noil fields are damaged during the war, Iraqi production could be \nreduced for a longer period of time.\n  In this period of very tight oil markets and continuing uncertainty \nabout both Venezuelan and Iraqi production, we may have to look very \nseriously at releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve this \nyear. We should not take the risk that our authority to use the SPR \nwill expire in September. I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment \nand re-authorize SPR authority now.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as Abigail Scott Duniway, a leader in \nthe women's suffrage movement, once said, ``the young women of today, \nfree to study, to speak, to write, to choose their occupation, should \nremember that every inch of this freedom was bought for them at a great \nprice. It is for them to show their gratitude by helping onward the \nreforms of their own times, by spreading the light of freedom and of \ntruth still wider. The debt that each generation owes to the past it \nmust pay to the future.'' If I think about my own life and the many \nblessings and freedoms that have been bestowed on me by my foremothers, \nI am mindful of the awesome responsibility I bear to ``onward the \nreform of my times.'' It occurs to me that when Ms. Duniway made this \nstatement she did not mean to infer that this responsibility went only \nas far as the American border, but rather to the women of the world.\n  With this in mind, I rise in support of an amendment offered by \nSenator Snowe and myself which attempts to help ensure that the women \nof Afghanistan go to sleep at night covered by the same security \nblanket of freedom and democracy that the women of America enjoy. As \nyou well know, Mr. President, it has been a long time since the people \nof Afghanistan have enjoyed such freedoms. For years, they suffered \nunder one of the most brutal regimes in modern history. Instead of \nlisting for my colleagues the rules imposed and the rights denied to \nwomen, I would like to read two excerpts from an article by Jan Goodwin \npublished in 1998, entitled, ``Buried Alive: Afghan Women Under the \nTaliban.''\n\n       Thirty thousand men and boys poured into the dilapidated \n     Olympic sports stadium in Kabul. Street hawkers peddled nuts, \n     biscuits and tea to the waiting crowd. The scheduled \n     entertainment? They were waiting to see a young woman, \n     Sohaila, receive 100 lashes for walking with a man who was \n     not a relative . . . Since she was single it was punishable \n     by flogging; had she been married, she would have been stoned \n     to death.\n       Not so long ago, a young mother, Torpeka, was shot \n     repeatedly by the Taliban while rushing her seriously ill \n     toddler to the doctor. Veiled as the law requires, she was \n     spotted by a teenage Taliban guard, authorized to use weapons \n     against women if they decide they are breaking the law, tried \n     to stop her because women are not supposed to leave their \n     homes. Afraid her child would die if she were delayed, she \n     continued. The guard aimed his machine gun and fired several \n     rounds.\n\n  Now, one may think that was yesterday and this is today. Yet, I am \nhere to tell you that while the Taliban may no longer be in power, \ntheir legacy remains. For instance, a September 26, 2002 Washington \nPost article detailed what it is like for a woman to give birth to a \nbaby in a ``Taliban-free'' Afghanistan. Even now, women continue to be \nbanned by their husbands and fathers from giving birth in hospitals or \nreceiving medical care during labor. Even if they are able to access \ncare, there is often no care to be had. As a result, women are forced \nto have babies on a dirt floor with no help from anyone but their \nuntrained female relatives.\n  Young girls traveling to schools on country roads are systematically \nbeaten and raped by roadside bandits. Only 11 percent of girls can read \nand write and only 16 percent of women over 16 years old are literate \nand yet young girls are prevented by violence from getting the \neducation they need. This cannot continue. If we hope to see the roots \nof democracy take hold and flourish in Afghanistan, then we must be \nwilling to make a long term commitment to restoring justice and \nequality for all.\n  I am sad to report that a lot has been said about our level of \ncommitment to the Afghan people, but so far, there has been more talk \nthan action. On October 4, 2001, President Bush pledged that ``America \nwill stand strong and oppose the sponsors of terror. And America will \nstand strong and help those who are hurt by those regimes.'' Three \nmonths later, he confirmed this commitment in saying, ``Thanks to our \nmilitary and our allies and the brave fighters of Afghanistan, the \nTaliban regime has come to an end. Yet our responsibilities to the \npeople of Afghanistan have not ended.'' Two months later, he sent a \nbudget to Congress that did not have one red penny for aid to \nAfghanistan.\n  I am glad that my colleagues in the Senate, on both sides of the \naisle, understand that actions speak louder than words. In July, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee passed a bill that included $150 \nmillion in military and humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. The bill \nbefore us now goes even farther, including a total of $220 million in \naid. I would like to thank the Chair and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Senators McConnell and Leahy for their leadership in this \nregard. In offering this amendment, Senator Snowe and I propose that we \ngo even one step further. What it does is proposes that while the \namount of money appropriated is, of course, important to the overall \nsuccess of our efforts in Afghanistan, so is the way in which it is \nspent.\n  Its purpose is twofold. First, it reserves $8 million, approximately \n10 percent of the total funds appropriated for humanitarian aid, for \nprograms to support women's development in Afghanistan, including \ngirls' and women's education, health, legal and social rights, economic \nopportunities, and political participation. These programs should be \nlong term in nature and invest in infrastructure development in \nAfghanistan. What I mean by this is, there are two ways to address the \nlack of women's health in this country, you can set up temporary \nimmunization and nutrition centers or you can help build a women's \nhealth center and train physicians to work there. I am certain that \nUSAID is doing the former, but I would like to suggest that we need to \ndo more of the latter. This amendment is designed to move us in that \ndirection.\n  Secondly, this amendment is structured in such a way to ensure that \nthese funds are channeled through\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\nwomen-focused, women-run governmental and nongovernmental \norganizations. As you can imagine, the women of Afghanistan are more \nlikely to access the services and support necessary to ensure their \nlong-term economic independence and health if they trust that the \nperson providing the service is not the enemy. Even during the Taliban \nregime, it was women's organizations, run by extremely brave Afghani \nwomen, who were fighting to protect women from violence and death. It \nwill take time before the women there are able to trust in their \ngovernment to protect and provide for their needs.\n  I am proud of this amendment. It is the first step in a road with \nmany steps. I thank the Chair and the ranking member for their \nleadership and foresight in agreeing to accept it. I look forward to \nworking with committee and with USAID to ensure that we use this money \nto ``onward the reform of our times.''\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I oppose the passage of H.J. Res. 2, the \nOmnibus Appropriations Resolution, because it does not provide \nappropriate levels of funding for the important priorities facing our \nNation. First, the Republican majority and the Bush administration have \nset an arbitrary cap on spending that is inadequate to meet the needs \nof our Nation with respect to homeland security, education, veteran's \nhealth care, housing, highway funding, Amtrak, and other important \ndomestic priorities. Second, the Republican majority forced a $9.8 \nbillion reduction in domestic spending made available in the Senate \nAppropriations Committee-passed bills last year. Finally, this \nlegislation includes a provision which would impose a 1.6 percent \nacross-the-board reduction on all domestic spending and Senator Gregg's \namendment increased that across-the-board cut to 2.9 percent. Together, \nthese actions will dramatically reduce domestic spending and will force \npunitive cuts in many programs crucial to the future of our low- and \nmoderate-income families, our children, and our economy. It is obvious \nthat the Republican majority has been forced to impose these dramatic \nspending cuts in order to hide the huge costs of the tax legislation \nenacted in the 107th Congress--the benefits of which will accrue \nprimarily to the wealthiest in our society.\n  I strongly believe that the level of funding included in the omnibus \nappropriations resolution to improve our homeland security is not \nsufficient and that additional funding is necessary for several \ncritical initiatives aimed at strengthening our efforts to protect \nAmerica and its interests. It is unbelievable to me that the President \ncan propose an additional $674 billion tax cut, but can't make a \nsufficient investment in homeland security, which should be our first \npriority. Vulnerabilities exist in our homeland security infrastructure \nand we should not squander a single day addressing them. An independent \ntask force, chaired by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman, \nrecently advised that ``America remains dangerously unprepared to \nprevent and respond to a catastrophic attack on U.S. soil.'' We must \nact to ensure that the functions needed to better protect our borders, \ncoasts, cities, and towns have sufficient resources to do so.\n  Specifically, I believe this bill should have provided more money to \nstates and localities to implement President Bush's smallpox \nvaccination plan, to make the radio equipment of first responders \ninteroperable, and provide emergency planning and training for \nterrorist attacks. This bill should have made critical investments in \nour preparedness for biological attack. It should have included more \nfunding to fortify our borders by funding such things as additional \nCoast Guard patrol boats and improvements to the INS entry and exit \nsystem.\n  Last year I was very involved in the development of the new port \nsecurity law, which included new rigorous security requirements for our \nports. I also worked hard to enact the Aviation Security Act to provide \nincreased security at our airports. Given the vulnerabilities that we \nknow exist in our port and airport security, I am deeply disappointed \nthat the Senate would opt to provide insufficient funding to address \nthese problems. The need to fully fund the TSA cannot be overstated; \ninstalling baggage screening equipment in the top 40 U.S. airports \nalone is expected to cost billions, and to date only one major airport \nhas installed the necessary equipment mandated by the Aviation Security \nAct. We cannot hope to maintain the confidence of the American people \nin our ability to secure the nation's transportation system if we fail \nto adequately fund the legislation we've passed to achieve that goal. \nThese investments are essential if we are to be fully protected from \nthose who threaten our freedom.\n  I am also concerned that the omnibus appropriations resolution \neviscerates the Byrne program. The Byrne program provides a flexible \nsource of funding to state and local law enforcement agencies to help \nfight crime by funding drug enforcement task forces, more cops on the \nstreet, improved technology, and other anti-crime efforts. \nMassachusetts received over $11.5 million in Byrne funding last year. \nOn countless occasions I have heard from law enforcement officers from \nMassachusetts about the value of the Byrne program to their crime \nfighting efforts.\n  The war against terror has placed unprecedented demands on State and \nlocal law enforcement to prevent terrorist attacks and to respond to an \nattack should one occur. But fighting the war on terror is not the only \njob that we expect police officers to do. We also expect them to combat \nthe prevalence of drugs in our cities and rural communities, we expect \nthem to keep our homes and families safe from thieves, and we expect \nthem to make us feel secure when we walk through our neighborhoods. \nWe're well aware that the States are facing a severe fiscal crisis--\nsome $75 billion collectively--what priority does it reflect to cut \nback on support to local law enforcement in this budget and security \nenvironment? A wrong-headed one, in my estimation.\n  The increased accountability and teacher quality requirements of the \nNo Child Left Behind Act necessitate a significant investment in our \nschools, but the omnibus appropriations bill before the Senate falls \nshort of the needed investment. We must do everything possible to \nensure that all children can learn to high standards, which is the goal \nof the No Child Left Behind Act. States, districts, schools, and \nteachers are diligently working to meet the stringent requirements of \nthe new law at a time when they are facing shrinking education budgets \ndue to the state fiscal crisis. Twelve states cut K-12 education \nspending last year and another eleven are poised to do so this year.\n  The omnibus appropriations bill includes an increase of only $1 \nbillion for the Title I program--the education program that provides \nresources for the most economically disadvantaged students in the \ncountry. This amount is $4.65 billion short of the level authorized by \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. The Department of Education announced \nthat 8,652 schools will begin the 2002-2003 school year ``in need of \nimprovement.'' How will these schools be able to perform if they are \nnot provided with the resources to attract and retain high-quality \nteachers and to implement reforms that will ensure all children can \nlearn to high standards? As I stated many times during debates on the \nNo Child Left Behind Act, tough accountability requirements without \nsufficient resources to meet the requirements is cruel to students, \nteachers, administrators, and parents. Ultimately it will undermine the \nsuccess of this education law.\n  I strongly believe we must include additional funding in the omnibus \nappropriations resolution to increase the maximum Pell grant award from \n$4,100 to $4,500. Pell grants are extremely important in helping \nfinancially needy students enroll and stay in college, many of whom \nwould not otherwise have the opportunity to attend college. According \nto ``Empty Promises'', a report released in June 2002 by the \ncongressionally mandated Advisory Committee on Student Financial \nAssistance:\n\n       . . . this year alone due to record-high financial \n     barriers, nearly one-half of all college-qualified, low- and \n     moderate-income high school graduates--over 400,000 students \n     fully prepared to attend a four-year college--will be unable \n     to do so, and 170,000 of these students will attend no \n     college at all.\n\n  If we are to reduce income inequality in this country, then we must \nsupport\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\nstudents who are academically prepared to attend college, but do not \nhave the financial means to do so on their own. Unfortunately, this \nfunding was not included in the spending bill we are considering today. \nOur Nation's schools and our children deserve better.\n  Today, we are not meeting our promises to our veterans. The \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs--VA--has consistently received \ninadequate resources to meet rising medical costs and a growing demand \nfor its health services. In November 2001, Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs Principi identified a $400 million funding shortfall for fiscal \nyear 2002. As a result of this shortfall, more than 300,000 veterans \nthroughout the country are on waiting lists for medical care, and many \nmust wait 6 months or longer for an appointment to see medical staff. \nAlthough Congress provided $417 million for veterans health care as \npart of the FY 2002 emergency supplemental spending bill, passed in \nJuly 2002, the President agreed to spend only $142 million of the \napproved funds. In addition to the fact that the VA health system must \nnow overcome the severely inadequate amount provided in fiscal year \n2002, the VA has also been operating at last year's funding level since \nthe onset of the 2003 fiscal year in October.\n  This funding crisis has forced the VA health system to resort to \nshort-term fixes, such as discontinuing outreach activities in an \neffort to reduce enrollment, instituting new regulations that require \nthe rationing of health care, and most recently excluding priority \neight veterans from care. Moreover, the VA has already reduced services \nat a number of facilities throughout the country and has closed some \nfacilities altogether. It is crucial for the VA to receive an \nappropriate increase in fiscal year 2003 medical care funding. For this \nreason I circulated a letter co-signed by 39 of my colleagues, urging \nthe appropriations committee to assure that the $23.9 billion \npreviously provided in both the Senate and the House Appropriations \nCommittee bills--a $1.2 billion increase over the President's request--\nwas not decreased. Instead, the Republican majority has decided to \nimpose a 2.9 percent reduction to this funding level. Our nation's \nveterans deserve better.\n  Today, our nation is also facing an affordable housing crisis. For \nthousands upon thousands of low-income families with children, the \ndisabled, and the elderly, privately owned affordable housing is simply \nout of reach. Recent changes in the housing market have further limited \nthe availability of affordable housing across the country, while the \ngrowth in our economy in the last decade has dramatically increased the \ncost of the housing that remains.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, estimates that \nmore than 5 million American households have what is considered ``worst \ncase'' housing needs. Since 1990, the number of families that have \nworst case housing needs has increased by 12 percent--that's 600,000 \nmore American families that cannot afford a decent and safe place to \nlive.\n  Earlier this month, HUD also announced plans to dramatically reduce \nthe amount of funding available for the operation of public housing by \nup to 30 percent. This would cost the city of Boston approximately $13 \nmillion in housing funding during fiscal year 2003. This additional \nacross-the-board cut would impose even further cuts in the operation of \npublic housing. This is simply unacceptable to those who depend upon \nhousing assistance.\n  I am also very disappointed at the inclusion of Section 213 in VA-HUD \nand Independent Agencies section of the omnibus appropriations \nresolution. This provision repeals of Section 9(n)(1) of the United \nStates Housing Act and Section 226 of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 1999. Repealing this important law will stop 7,000 \nlocally developed housing units in the State of New York and 5,000 \nhousing units in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from being eligible \nfor public housing operating and capital funds from HUD. Those who \nreceive public housing assistance in Massachusetts and around the \nNation deserve better.\n  Above and beyond those issues, I have significant concerns about the \nanti-environmental riders in this package. The Tongass Rider, a prime \nexample, locks citizens out of the courts, thwarting legal challenges \nto the Bush administration's rewrite of the Tongass' land management \nplan and its failure to recommend any new wilderness in the nation's \nlargest intact temperate rainforest. The Yazoo Pumps rider expedites \nconstruction of the largest water pump project in the world right on \nthe Lower Mississippi River Basin, destroying as much as 200,000 acres \nof ecologically rich wetlands--not even the administration recommended \nfunding for the Yazoo Pumps in its fiscal year 2003 budget. These are \nserious riders affecting our Nation's wild lands in serious ways and \nthey do not belong in any legislation passed by the Senate, much less \ntacked on in a sneaky manner as riders to this omnibus bill.\n  The funding levels included by the Republican majority in the omnibus \nappropriations resolution and supported by the Bush administration are \nsimply inadequate to meet our Nation's education, homeland security, \nveterans and housing needs. Our Nation deserves better. That is why I \nwill oppose this legislation and I ask all of my colleagues to oppose \nthis bill as well.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote against the omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  I agree that it is important to complete work on the fiscal year 2003 \nappropriations bills. But, while it is important to pass a bill, that \ndoes not mean we should pass this bill.\n  Last year, the Democratic-led Appropriations Committee completed its \nwork on all 13 appropriations bills. The new Republican majority took \nthose bills and had one mission: cut, cut, cut.\n  The FBI was cut $388 million, eliminating over 1000 FBI agents and \nsurveillance aircraft used to respond to terrorist attacks.\n  The Food Safety Inspection Service was cut $28 million, eliminating \nover 600 food safety inspectors.\n  The National Institutes of Health was cut $809 million, reducing the \nbudget for biodefense by 46 percent and abandoning the plan to double \nthe health research budget over five years--a goal that I worked to \nestablish when I was a member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n  The Veterans Administration was cut $692 million, meaning that over \n200,000 veterans will go without medical services and another 200,000 \nwill remain on the waiting list for care.\n  Head Start was cut over $395 million, depriving over 21,000 children \nof early education.\n  And the funding for After-School programs--the provision of the No \nChild Left Behind Act that I authored with Senator Ensign--was cut $90 \nmillion, meaning that 130,000 additional kids will not be able to \nparticipate in after-school programs and will be left alone on the \nstreets after school gets out.\n  These cuts are not acceptable. Yes, we need to pass the \nappropriations bills, but not this way. We should go back to the \ndrawing board and do it right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I am very \nconcerned about the growing number of uninsured Americans. This \nvulnerable population reached an estimated 41.2 million in 2001 and has \nsurely grown during the recent economic down turn. I believe this is a \nserious problem facing our Nation and I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues to reduce the number of uninsured Americans, to address \ntheir needs and to help all Americans access affordable health care. It \nis because of this commitment that I strongly support the Community \nAccess Program (CAP) and I am pleased to see that it has been fully \nfunded for fiscal year 2003 in the Senate-passed bill.\n  In my home State of Arizona and across the country, the CAP program \nhas helped many hardworking Americans, who are neither eligible for \nState assistance or employer-based insurance, obtain access to health \ncare. Five CAP programs currently operate in Arizona. All of them \nfunction differently, but together the programs help thousands of \nArizonans access affordable health care. These programs are \nparticularly critical in the southern border region of and in the \nnorthern rural areas of my State, where the programs\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\nprovide outreach services to low-income and non-English speaking \npatients. One program, the Pima Community Access Program (PCAP) works \nwith doctors and hospitals to negotiate reduced rates for its members, \nand in some cases has successfully reduced the cost below that of our \nstate Medicaid program.\n  The simple fact is that these programs are providing an invaluable \nservice for the people of my State and across the country. CAP is one \nof several federally funded programs that exist to provide assistance \nto the uninsured. It is a merit-based grant program that allows local \ncommunities to develop plans that will best provide assistance to their \nuninsured populations. I believe that not only do we need to ensure \nfunding for this important program, but we must also look towards \nexpanding other successful programs and creating new innovative \nprograms, like CAP, to address the needs of this vulnerable population.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \nthe third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, shortly we will be having our last vote of \nthe evening on passage of the appropriations bill. I congratulate our \ntwo managers, and I thank all of our Members for their cooperation.\n  I will outline what our schedule will be so Members can plan. The \nSenate will be in a pro forma session on Friday. No business will be \nconducted tomorrow. The Senate will not be in session on Monday. We \nwill next convene on Tuesday.\n  As a reminder, the President will deliver his State of the Union \nAddress on Tuesday evening and Senators are asked to be in the Chamber \nbeginning at 8:30 that evening. I expect there will be several \nimportant nominations available for consideration next week.\n  In addition, there may be other legislative matters and therefore \nrollcall votes are possible during next week's session. I do not \nanticipate any rollcall votes prior to Wednesday of next week. There \nwill be further announcements as scheduling of those votes becomes more \nclear.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin) and the \nSenator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendments and requests a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses and the Chair appoints 29 members \nof the Appropriations Committee as conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The Presiding Officer appointed Senators Stevens, Cochran, Specter, \nDomenici, Bond, McConnell, Burns, Shelby, Gregg, Bennett, Campbell, \nCraig, Hutchison, DeWine, Brownback, Byrd, Inouye, Hollings, Leahy, \nHarkin, Mikulski, Reid, Kohl, Murray, Dorgan, Feinstein, Durbin, \nJohnson, and Landrieu conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSpecter be added as an original cosponsor of Senate amendment No. 167. \nIt was our error.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to express my deep appreciation to \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to the distinguished \nranking member, Senator Byrd, and to their staffs who very patiently \nfor the last week have been working on this literally 24 hours a day. \nTerry Sauvain and Steven Cortese have really showed great leadership \nthroughout on the completion of a very critical bill. I especially \nthank the staffs very much but also the chairman and the ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a long statement concerning the \nbill. There are colleagues of mine waiting. Senator Kyl, my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona, would like to talk about Korea. But I want to \ntalk about the sense-of-the-Senate amendment on Korea.\n  First, I would like to make a few comments about the bill that just \npassed. This is a very massive piece of legislation. Obviously, there \nwere many legislative authorizations about which I was pleased to hear \nthe distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee complain. \nBut there are several in the area of water projects--the Yazoo Pump \nproject in central Mississippi and Devils Lake in North Dakota.\n  I would like to point out a couple of items of interest.\n  Report language directs the Agency for International Development to \nprovide at least $2.5 million to the Orangutan Foundation located in \nIndonesia. The foundation likes to call the orangutan ``the neglected \nap.'' Luckily for them, they are not being neglected by the \nAppropriations Committee. The appropriators not only like orangutan, \nthey are also fond of gorillas. The committee gave $1.5 million to \ngroups such as the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund.\n  I do not know why we stop at gorillas. What about man's best friend? \nWhat about other species around the world that are endangered? I am \nsure that animal lovers throughout the world would be pleased to know \nthat we are not just selecting orangutans and gorillas for millions of \nthe taxpayers' dollars, which brings us to the lowly catfish.\n  Many of my colleagues will remember that last year the lowly catfish \nwas designated as not a catfish but basa, depending on where it was \nraised. If it was raised in a pond in Vietnam, it was called basa. If \nit was raised in Arkansas, Mississippi, or other Southern States, it \nwas called a catfish--a very interesting interpretation of species of \nanimals.\n  Now the Appropriations Committee has done another marvelous feat; \nthat is, we have now concluded that the lowly catfish, heretofore \nunknown, is related to the cow. In the emergency disaster relief \nsection of this bill a provision was included that would qualify \ncatfish farmers for livestock compensation payments. Perhaps the \nlivestock\n\n[[Page S1458]]\n\ncompensation program is a Federal farm program that compensates \neligible livestock producers such as owners of beef, dairy cattle, \nsheep, goats or certain breeds of buffalo that have suffered losses or \ndamages as a result of the severe drought.\n  I discussed this issue with some of my colleagues. The distinguished \nPresident informed me that catfish in Tennessee many times walk on land \nand are seen to be moving about the countryside foraging in various \nplaces. That helps me understand the logic of designating the catfish \nas livestock.\n  My friend, Mr. Enzi of Wyoming, said he heard that trout can easily \ndie in certain conditions. Trout can easily die. Certainly the same \ncould be said about catfish. That could take place with catfish as \nwell.\n  I often take issue with various farm policies that disproportionately \nbenefit large agribusinesses or farms at the expense of small farmers \nand taxpayers or those who compromise American agricultural trade \ncommitments. This effort to compensate catfish farmers from a farm \nprogram intended for livestock stands out. I am certain that catfish \nproponents will offer a dozen different explanations to justify this \nprovision. But hogs, poultry, and horse producers are not eligible \nunder the livestock compensation program. I wonder why catfish should \nget livestock payments when those worthy animals are excluded, such as \nhogs, poultry, or horses.\n\n  I think it is important for us to recognize that we have now a new \ncategory of livestock; and that is catfish. Catfish lovers, and I count \nmyself as one, all over America will be very grateful to know not only \nare they a tasty treat, but they are eligible for disaster payments so \nthat we can keep Americans supplied with catfish under any \ncircumstances, drought or no drought.\n  Also, in the recent 2002 farm bill, domestic catfish proponents were \nsuccessful, as I mentioned, in banning all catfish imports by requiring \nforeign catfish be labeled as something other than catfish.\n  I want to mention a few others and make a couple of comments about \nthem.\n  Included in the bill are earmarks, among many others, such as \n$200,000 for the Anchorage People Mover in Alaska. Strangely, as I have \nmentioned in the past on numerous occasions, you will find many \nearmarks that are designated for the great state of Alaska; $250,000 \nfor the Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, VA, for the Center for the \nExceptionally Gifted. Now, my dear friends, they are exceptionally \ngifted because they have just received $250,000 for the exceptionally \ngifted. Not many colleges around the country are as lucky and \nexceptionally gifted as the young men and women at the Mary Baldwin \nCollege in Staunton, VA. And $1.5 million for WestStart's Vehicular \nFlywheel Project in the State of Washington.\n  One of the unfortunate aspects about an appropriations bill is that \nquite often, or most of the time, there is not an explanation. As I \nremember flywheel projects, it seems to me that was a perpetual motion \nmachine. But it is something on which I think we should continue to \nmake an effort. So we have decided to gift WestStart's--I don't know \nwho WestStart's is. I know they are located in the State of \nWashington--$1.5 million to continue that effort. And $1 million for \nthe National Center for the Ecologically Based Noxious Weed Management \nat Montana State University.\n  I think families all over America that have noxious weeds in their \nyards would be pleased to know that we are continuing a multimillion-\ndollar effort over a many-year period of time at the uniquely qualified \nMontana State University to try to get rid of these noxious weeds, or \nat least manage them, because I don't think they claim to remove \nnoxious weeds. It is just a management program.\n\n  There is $600,000 to treat waste on small swine farms in South \nCarolina. I don't know if that means for small animals or small farms; \nthat was not designated--perhaps both. It is in South Carolina. Since \nit is only $600,000, we all know it is chicken feed.\n  But my favorite--I will get to my favorite--again, strangely enough, \n$100,000 for the Alaska Sea Otter Commission.\n  There is $300,000 to the Southern Regional Research Center at New \nOrleans, LA, for termite detection systems, evaluation of wood products \nfor protecting building materials, and bait technology.\n  Bait technology is something that all of us who love to fish will be \nvery interested in hearing about. As we all know, for those of us who \nlove to fish, bait technology is an intricate and very difficult \nchallenge. So I can certainly see why the Southern Regional Research \nCenter in New Orleans, LA, would be qualified.\n  There is $200,000 to study seafood waste at the University of Alaska. \n``Seafood waste''--I am not exactly sure what that means, but I am sure \nit is an important study.\n  There is $300,000 for the Old Stoney feasibility study in Wyoming. \nOld Stoney, he has been in there before--Old Stoney. And, again, I am \nnot sure exactly what Old Stoney is. I think he is a building, but I am \nnot sure. And I don't know what the feasibility or nonfeasibility is of \nOld Stoney.\n  There is $650,000 for grasshopper and Mormon cricket activities in \nthe State of Utah. I don't know exactly what activities the Mormon \ncrickets engage in and grasshoppers, but they are going to have \n$650,000 to engage in their activities.\n  Finally, because my colleagues are waiting to speak, there is $1 \nmillion for a DNA bear sampling study in Montana. I have to repeat \nthat: $1 million for a DNA bear sampling study in Montana.\n  Up to this time, in my limited knowledge and experience, I had only \nknown that DNA studies were to determine paternity in the commission or \nnoncommission of a crime. But perhaps there are other uses. And I am \nnot really familiar with a lot of the bears that live up in Montana. \nBut this is really quite a remarkable study--a remarkable study--$1 \nmillion.\n  And I don't know how many bears there are in Montana, but I wonder if \nprobably that amount of money is very significant, because I think it \nwould be very hard to hire people who are eager to go out and get a DNA \nsample from a grizzly bear. In fact, I would be very interested in \nknowing the methodology as to how this DNA sampling is obtained from \nthese grizzly bears.\n  So I wish them all luck up there in Montana. We will eagerly await \nthe results of the DNAs of these bears. And any of them that have been \nguilty of the commission of some serious crime, I am certain it will \nhelp us in identifying them. I do agree that it is very difficult to \ntell one from another. So that is probably why the DNA is warranted \nhere, as I am sure the Senator from Alaska would allege and the good \nfolks up in Montana who have been plagued with a lack of ability to \nidentify the bears according to their DNA now for several generations.\n  So I do believe, in a moment of seriousness, we really need to \nscrutinize some of these appropriations items more carefully. They do \namount to a great deal of money. Again, I see this legislating on \nappropriations continuing, which I think is an unfortunate practice.\n  I congratulate the distinguished manager of the bill with the \nefficiency and dispatch in which he handled the legislation today. I \ncongratulate him for his hard work in providing much needed funding so \nwe can now begin next year's efforts. And I look forward to being able \nto do this 13 times in the coming year rather than just once or twice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from \nArizona concerning a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, that was a very enlightening speech, but I \nwonder how long the Senator wishes to speak. There are several others \nwho want to speak. I understand it is only for 3 minutes; therefore, I \nwill not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 57, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, obviously, the subject which I will speak to \nis a very serious one and requires a lot more discussion than we are \ngoing to give it this evening. But the reason Senator McCain and I \noffered the sense-of-the-Senate resolution on\n\n[[Page S1459]]\n\nNorth Korea was to begin to shed light on this most difficult problem \nand to give voice to the Senate feelings so that everyone could \nappreciate the fact that the Senate views this as an incredibly \nimportant problem that requires us to pay a lot more attention to it \nand that requires the President to have additional tools to deal with \nit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Brownback of \nKansas be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, one of the primary reasons that Senator \nBrownback is interested in this matter is because the last portion of \nthis amendment talks about the fact that North Korea, alone among \nnations in the world, does not participate appropriately in the \ndistribution of food aid assistance under the World Food Program.\n  The United States is the largest provider of food aid to North Korea, \nsome $620 million since 1995. Yet North Korea does not comply with the \nWorld Food Program requirements to ensure that the food we provide \nactually gets to its intended beneficiaries. They, instead, divert \nmuch, if not most, of that food aid--that we desire for humanitarian \nreasons, to keep the people of North Korea fed, at least in a modest \nway--to its military industrial complex.\n  What this sense of the Senate does is to make it clear that the \nSenate believes that North Korea is in violation of agreements that it \nhas signed not to develop nuclear weapons, that it is in violation of \nthe agreed framework--by its own actions it has been declared null and \nvoid--that a diplomatic solution desirable in this situation must \nachieve the total disarmament of North Korea's nuclear weapons and \ntheir production capability, and that the United States and other \nallies in the region must take measures to ensure the highest possible \nlevel of deterrence and military readiness in the event that something \nthere should occur.\n  So what we want to do by this sense of the Senate--as I said, the \nsubject is far too serious to be dealt with in just a perfunctory way, \nbut at least we hope this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which was \nadopted earlier this evening, will begin the debate in the Senate, will \nenable us to make clear to the rest of the world that we view this \nsituation seriously, that we support the President's efforts to try to \nachieve a resolution of it in a way that will result in the \ndismantlement of the nuclear program in North Korea and, frankly, will \nexpose its horrendous practice of taking food aid with which the rest \nof us intend to keep the people of North Korea alive and diverting that \nfor the military in North Korea. It will expose that problem to the \nlight of day so we can begin to get that food to the people who deserve \nit.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment Senators Bayh, Kyl, \nSessions, and I offered expresses the sense of the Senate that North \nKorea must immediately comply with its international obligations to \nabandon and dismantle its nuclear weapons programs. As the \nadministration explores a diplomatic solution to the crisis with North \nKorea, we believe it is important for the Senate to send Pyongyang a \nclear message that flagrant for its commitments to the United States \nand the international community remains unacceptable.\n  Our amendment highlights North Korea's violation of both the Agreed \nFramework and the North-South Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization \nof the Korean Peninsula. It expresses the Sense of the Senate that the \nAgreed Framework, as a result of North Korea's own actions, is own \nactions, is null and void, and that North Korea must immediately come \ninto compliance with its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty \nand other commitments to the international community.\n  Our amendment states that North Korea's pursuit and development of \nnuclear weapons represent a serious threat to the security of the \nUnited States and our allies; that any diplomatic solution to this \ncrisis must achieve the total dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear \nweapons and nuclear production capability, backed by intrusive \ninspections; and that the United States and our regional allies should \ntake measures to ensure the highest possible levels of deterrence and \nmilitary readiness in the face of the North Korean threat.\n  We have also worked with Senator Lugar to craft language calling on \nNorth Korea to allow full verification of food aid assistance by \nproviding the World Food Program access to all areas of North Korea and \npermitting the WFP to undertake random inspections. Since 1995, the \nUnited States has been the single largest food donor to North Korea, \nproviding $620 million in food aid assistance. We must have confidence \nthat this assistance is going to hungry North Koreans, not the \ncountry's political and military elite. I thank the Senator from \nIndiana for his contribution.\n  North Korea's pursuit of a nuclear arsenal directly threatens the \nsecurity of the American people. Those who counsel a return to the \nstatus quo fail to grasp the danger of rewarding threats and retreat \nand concession.\n  We all hope for a diplomatic solution to the current crisis. But as \nwe have seen in the debate over Iraq and in our previous dealings with \nPyongyang, our desire for peaceful outcomes cannot blind us to the \ndangers of policy drift or diplomatic accommodation in the face of \ncompelling threats to our security.\n  North Korea and Iraq present different faces of the same danger. I \nbelieve North Korea poses a greater danger than Iraq, and confronting \nit presents a more difficult challenge. That is all the more reason to \ntake whatever action necessary to prevent Saddam Hussein from becoming \na threat of equal magnitude, and just as difficult to confront.\n  But the greater difficulty of resolving the Korean crisis is not the \ncentral concern. The greater danger it poses is. This doesn't absolve \nus of the responsibility to meet and overcome the threat any more than \nit replaces the necessity of overcoming the threat from Iraq. Nine \nyears ago we faced a difficult set of options in dealing with North \nKorea. We chose to avoid them, and our irresolution has placed us in \neven greater danger. I hope we don't make the same mistake again.\n  Our security depends on preventing North Korea from possessing a \nnuclear arsenal. That must be the primary object of our diplomacy. \nFreezing Pyongyang's nuclear program in place while we and our allies \nprolong the reign of the world's last Stalinist regime does not \naccomplish that objective, but merely encourages future attempts at \nnuclear blackmail. In my view, only if North Korea is prepared to \nsurrender the enriched uranium it secretly attained, the spent fuel \nrods that would yield enough plutonium for three to five nuclear \nweapons, as well as dismantle the reactor and reprocessing plant it now \nthreatens to restart, should we or any other country consider any \nassistance that might help North Korea escape the certain destiny of a \nfailed state.\n  I am pleased the Senate is going on record in its clear support for \nNorth Korea's nuclear disarmament, a rigorous inspection regime in any \ndiplomatic agreement that is reached, the highest possible level of \nmilitary readiness against the threat North Korea poses, and full and \neffective monitoring of food aid assistance. The burden is on North \nKorea to comply with its obligations, not on the United States to \nrefrain from telling the truth about this rogue regime, or facing the \nconsequences of the grave threat it poses to our people and our \ninterests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 6, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I know it is late, but I did want to say \na few words about Paul and Sheila Wellstone before we left today.\n  I am deeply gratified one of the first subjects that brings me to my \nfeet in this Chamber is the memory of Paul and Sheila Wellstone.\n  I knew them both well. I was their mayor. I campaigned for them. I \ncampaigned against them. At times I agreed with them, and at times I \nstrongly disagreed with them. It is a measure of the humanity and \nintegrity of Paul and Sheila Wellstone that even those who disagreed \nwith them always respected and admired the enthusiasm, the passion, and \nthe courage with which they pursued their vision.\n\n[[Page S1460]]\n\n  This fall I had planned to contest an election against the Senator. I \nnever dreamed I would be mourning his death. I was his political \nopponent. And, as two fighters at the end of a boxing match who embrace \neach other after the final bell has rung, I am sad for myself we never \nhad that moment.\n  This body began the good work of providing a living memorial to Paul \nand Sheila and the others who died. We are proud that it will be in St. \nPaul, the city I served as mayor. It is a Paul and Sheila Wellstone \nkind of place. It is literally where the East meets the West. Since \nPaul came from the East, as I did, he probably felt very much at home \nin our ethnic neighborhoods, filled with middle-class working families. \nIt has been a destination for immigrants, as were the Wellstones a \ngeneration back. It is a city of hard work and big dreams, the soul of \nwho Paul and Sheila were.\n  We have the opportunity to retain that spirit; and that is the Paul \nand Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building.\n  It will be a 93,000-square-foot building. A community center is a \npoor substitute for the real thing--Paul and Sheila themselves--but it \nis worth doing, providing a safe place where kids can play and learn, \nwhere families can receive training and support and community members \ncan be organized to fight injustice and partake in the American dream.\n  In the spirit of Paul Wellstone, I should probably be out here trying \nto triple the funding because he was always pushing the edge, but I was \nsent here by my constituents with a more conservative vision. I simply \nurge my colleagues to support the funding level for the Paul and Sheila \nWellstone Center authorized last year. I honor Paul and Sheila's memory \ntoday and will strive to be worthy of the example they set throughout \nthe time I am in this place.\n  I had introduced an amendment and intended to offer it today to \nincrease the appropriations amount for the Paul and Sheila Wellstone \nCenter from $3 million currently in the bill to the full funding level \nof $10 million. However, I understand and very much appreciate the fact \nthat my good friend, the chairman of the VA-HUD appropriations \nsubcommittee, along with other distinguished managers of this bill, has \nagreed to increase the amount to $5 million and to ultimately provide \nfull funding at $10 million in the conference report to accompany this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if the Senator from Minnesota will yield.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I am happy to yield to my friend, the distinguished \nchairman of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee.\n  Mr. BOND. I commend the Senators from Minnesota for their tribute to \nour colleague, to Paul Wellstone and to Sheila Wellstone, Senator and \nMrs. Wellstone.\n  We know what a priority this is for them and for the people of \nMinnesota. We commend their devotion. I know I speak for my colleagues \nin the Chamber when I say we want to do everything we can to help \nensure that the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building \nserves as a successful living memorial to the two fine friends we have \nlost.\n  In order to do this, we have, working with my distinguished ranking \nmember, the Senator from Maryland, increased the appropriations in this \nbill from $3 million to $5 million. I assure the Senators that Senator \nMikulski and I will work together with our counterparts in the House to \nachieve full funding, $10 million, for the Paul and Sheila Wellstone \nCenter. This is something which we understand is very important, and \nthey have our commitment to work very hard to see that those dollars \nare made available.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleague from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nhis assistance on this matter that is so important to me and all the \npeople of the State of Minnesota. I know Senator Wellstone and his wife \nwill be honored by the tribute we pay them today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, the Senator from Missouri. I appreciate the Senator \nstaying here to engage my colleague from Minnesota and myself in this \ncolloquy.\n  I accept as a matter of good faith the sincerity of the words \nexpressed on the floor and also in conversation with the chairman of \nthe full Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens from Alaska, that \nthis full funding will be sought in conference with the House. In a \nmoment now of suspension of disbelief and cynicism, I will trust and \nbelieve that actually will occur.\n  I must say, nothing I have seen so far in this process has persuaded \nme that this result is going to occur. Obviously, what happens here is \ndecided by the actions of the 100 of us, and the House the same. Before \nmy distinguished colleague from Minnesota was sworn in last November, \nSenator Wellstone's immediate successor, Senator Dean Barkley, in his 2 \nmonths as a Senator from Minnesota, distinguished himself in a number \nof ways. One of them was getting the support of the administration and \nthe House-Senate Democratic and Republican caucuses and leaderships to \na $10 million authorization for this center that will be named after \nand honor the memory of Paul and Sheila Wellstone.\n  Ten million dollars is certainly real money, but in the scheme of a \n$690 billion bill, it is a tiny speck. As we heard from Senator McCain \nearlier, there are projects of far less merit that have been funded at \nsignificantly higher amounts than this particular project. It is hard \nto listen to all of that and see how some of these projects that are \nnot supported get in because a certain somebody is in favor of them. On \na project such as this, which the entire Senate, only 2 months ago, \nvoted unanimously to authorize at $10 million, I understand full well \nthat is not an appropriation, but it was certainly the expectation when \nthis vote was taken that $10 million was going to be needed and \nprovided in a way that the memory of Paul and Sheila Wellstone could be \nrecognized and acted upon and, in the spirit in which this project was \npassed, with unanimous, bipartisan support, that amount would be \nrealized. Then we come back and hear at the beginning of this week \nthat, in fact, only $3 million out of the $10 million was appropriated. \nSenator Coleman, to his credit, worked very hard this week within his \ncaucus to raise that amount, I am told, to a commitment to $5 million.\n  I know how difficult it is for a freshman Senator in the first 2 \nyears to get $2 million in this process. So I give the Senator from \nMinnesota high praise for getting $2 million in his first month. \nNevertheless, that is only half of the commitment.\n  To me, it is shameful that we are quibbling over this kind of funding \nfor something that the entire Senate ought to be doing because they \nsaid they would do it, because it is the right thing to do.\n  Paul Wellstone was my friend of 22 years and colleague for the last 2 \nyears. I would feel the same way if it were a member of the other \ncaucus and if it were somebody whose ideological views were totally the \nopposite of mine. This man gave his life in the service of his country. \nHis wife lost her life, and his daughter lost her life. There but for \nthe grace of God go any one of us who get on these planes and fly \naround.\n  For the Senate to have made a commitment and then failed to honor \nthat commitment in full without any of this finagling is disgraceful. \nTo pretend that 5 is really 10 and half is really whole and we will get \nit next time or the next round in the process when, with our own \nopportunity right here in front of us, we failed to do so--again, I \nwill trust, but as President Reagan said: Trust, but verify.\n  The State of Minnesota will be watching this process in conference to \nsee if in fact we can count on the words that have been expressed here \ntonight.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1460-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1460-S1461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor a \ngreat American and a valued public servant. Captain Kevin Bakke of the \nSouth Dakota Highway Patrol has served the people of South Dakota for \nmore than 27 years. In his most recent capacity as the District One \nCommander in my hometown of Aberdeen, he oversaw all the law \nenforcement functions of the highway patrol for the northeastern region \nof South Dakota. His affable style of leadership is respected and well-\nliked by all those who know him.\n  During his 27 years as a law enforcement officer, Captain Bakke has \nserved in various posts throughout the State of South Dakota. His \ntalents were widely recognized by his peers and colleagues alike.\n  Kevin Bakke began his law enforcement career in 1975 as a trooper in \nRapid City, was promoted to squad sergeant in Huron, and then to \nlieutenant in Aberdeen. Most recently, he has served capably as one of \nfour captains in the South Dakota Highway Patrol.\n  Captain Bakke's absence will leave a void in the highway patrol, as \nmany will miss his quick smile and skillful leadership. The citizens of \nSouth Dakota have been in good hands under Captain Bakke's protection. \nAs he retires from the South Dakota Highway Patrol, I want to commend \nhim for his extraordinary service to the people of our State, and to \nwish him the best in his new endeavors with the Transportation Security \nAdministration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1461-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTHY HOUSING'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the National \nCenter for Healthy Housing as it celebrates its 10th year of protecting \nchildren from residential environmental hazards while preserving the \nsupply of affordable housing.\n  The National Center for Healthy Housing was founded in 1992 as the \nNational Center for Lead-Safe Housing to address the No. 1 \nenvironmental health problem facing our Nation's children, childhood \nlead poisoning, and the threat that lead paint posed to the \npreservation of our Nation's affordable housing stock. Since its \ninception, the center has become our country's preeminent source of \ntechnical and practical information on reducing the threat of lead \npaint hazards in housing. The center was responsible for publishing the \nfirst comprehensive technical guidelines for evaluating and controlling \nlead paint hazards in housing, which are still being used today. The \ncenter conducted a scientific evaluation of 14 projects funded by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, (HUD), Lead-Based Paint \nHazard Control Grant program. The evaluation yielded important \ninformation about the effectiveness of lead hazard control treatments \nand the results continue to inform national lead poisoning prevention \npolicy. The center also published a groundbreaking scientific study on \nthe relationship between settled lead dust levels and blood lead levels \nin children. It was this study that highlighted the insidious nature of \nthe hazardous dust generated from lead-based paint.\n  Despite its many research accomplishments, the center is perhaps best \nknown for its unique ability to translate scientific research and \nGovernment regulations into results. When HUD published its final lead-\nsafe housing regulation 2 years ago, communities expressed concern \nabout the lack of trained personnel to carry out the rule's \nrequirements. In response, the center administered training to over \n14,000 individuals across the country, enabling them to perform the \nlead-related services required by the rule. When local housing programs \nexpressed a need to better understand the rule's requirements and how \nto incorporate them into the Community Development Block Grant and HOME \nprograms, the center provided training to over 2,000 housing program \nstaff in over 40 communities.\n  Today, as the National Center for Healthy Housing, the center \ncontinues its commitment to childhood lead poisoning prevention and is \nexpanding its expertise to other environmental hazards in the home such \nas mold, allergens, and other irritants.\n  As we celebrate the center's 10th anniversary, I would also like to \npay tribute to its founding director, Nick Farr. Mr. Farr retired last \nOctober after a long and distinguished career in both the public and \nprivate sectors. Much of his professional experience was in the areas \nof housing finance, housing and urban development, and housing-based \nlead poisoning prevention. A graduate of Yale Law School, Mr. Farr \nspent the 1950s and early 1960s in private practice. In 1962, Mr. Farr \njoined the Agency for International Development at the U.S. Department \nof State as Deputy Assistant Administrator for the Near East and South \nAsia economic assistance programs. Five years later, President Lyndon \nJohnson appointed him Director of the Model Cities Administration at \nthe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. In the 1970s, Mr. \nFarr was a New York University law professor before joining the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce as General Counsel to the Economic Development \nAdministration in 1977. In 1979, Mr. Farr was appointed General Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development at the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. Then in the 1980s, Mr. \nFarr was Executive Director of the California Housing Finance Agency, \nExecutive Vice President of the Wells Fargo Mortgage Company in \nCalifornia, and Vice President for Field Services at The Enterprise \nFoundation. During his tenure with The Enterprise Foundation, Mr. Farr \nserved on the board of directors of a nonprofit housing developer based \nin Baltimore that focused on creating affordable, lead-safe housing \nunits. As a result of his service on this board and his accumulated \nprofessional experience, in 1992, Mr. Farr conceived of, and created, \nthe National Center for Lead-Safe Housing. As the founding director of \nthe center, Mr. Farr helped spearhead a variety of public and private \ninitiatives to protect our Nation's children from residential lead \nhazard exposures.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Nick Farr's legacy and the \nprofound impact that the National Center for Healthy Housing has had \nand continues to have on the creation and maintenance of safer and \nhealthier affordable housing for low-income families across our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1461-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1461-S1462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ON LIBYA'S CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the selection \nof Libya this week to head the U.N. Human Rights Commission. Libya's \ntaking the helm of the U.N. Human Rights Commission makes a mockery of \nthat institution and deprives the U.N. and the world at large of \ncredible leadership from that position at a critical time.\n  It is a well established fact that Libya's totalitarian regime under \nMuammar al-Qadhafi has had an abysmal human rights record and has been \na leading state sponsor of terrorism. The most widely publicized \nincident was the 1988 bombing of Pan American Airways flight 103 that \nresulted in 270 deaths. The Iran Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA, was \nextended until August 2006 due to such support for terrorism, attempts \nto acquire weapons of mass destruction, and belligerency over \nterritorial claims. I was proud to author the ILSA extension in the \nlast Congress.\n  The Libyan government must improve its standing in the international \ncommunity by ceasing support to terrorists and moving towards a more \ndemocratic system. Under current circumstances, however, this \nchairmanship will be sadly devoid of leadership by example. Libya's \nascendancy to the chairmanship of the Commission has dealt an appalling \nblow to the cause of human rights and to the credibility of that U.N. \nbody.\n  Last week my great friend and colleague, Chuck Schumer, the senior \nSenator from New York, urged Secretary Powell to do all that he could \nto prevent this travesty.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter from Senator Schumer and \nme printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1462]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Colin L. Powell, Secretary of State, 2201 C Street, NW, \n       Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Powell: We were greatly troubled to learn \n     that Libya has been nominated by the African delegation to \n     lead the U.N. Human Rights Commission and stands to \n     potentially assume that key leadership role in a vote at the \n     UN on Monday, January 20. We share the opinion of our \n     respected colleague from the House International Relations \n     Committee that Libya's ascendancy to that position would deal \n     a significant blow to the cause of human rights.\n       Libya, under Muammar al-Qadhafi, has an abysmal human \n     rights record and has been a leading state sponsor of \n     terrorism. The most widely publicized incident was the 1988 \n     bombing of Pan American Airways flight 103 that resulted in \n     270 deaths. As you are well aware, the Iran Libya Sanctions \n     Act (ILSA) was extended until August 2006 due to such support \n     for terrorism, attempts to acquire weapons of mass \n     destruction, and belligerency over territorial claims.\n       We hope that the Libyan government will improve its \n     standing in the international community by ceasing support to \n     terrorists and moving towards a more democratic system. Under \n     current circumstances, however, Libya's taking the helm of \n     the UN Human Rights Commission would make a mockery of that \n     institution and deprive the UN and the world at large of \n     credible leadership on human rights at a critical time.\n       We believe that your personal leadership may be required to \n     secure an acceptable outcome in the vote next Monday. Toward \n     that end, we urge you to speak out on the human rights \n     situation in Libya and to consider interceding with relevant \n     delegations so that wisdom might prevail.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look \n     forward to continuing to work with you, and appreciate your \n     consistent efforts to promote respect for human rights.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gordon H. Smith.\n     Charles E. Schumer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1462-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STOLEN FIREARMS, ARMING THE ENEMY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last month Americans for Gun Safety, an \norganization which seeks to educate Americans on existing gun laws and \nnew policy options for reducing access to guns by criminals and \nchildren, released a report entitled Stolen Firearms, Arming the Enemy. \nThis report examines the effect of stolen guns on communities. \nAccording to the report, nearly 1.7 million firearms have been reported \nstolen since 1993. These stolen guns are frequently used later in \ncommitting crimes and fuel the black market for guns. Most of the \nestimated 170,000 guns stolen each year are never recovered.\n  The accessibility of stolen firearms was earlier highlighted by a \n1997 Department of Justice survey of 33,731 state prison inmates. The \nsurvey found that nearly 10 percent of the inmates used a stolen \nfirearm to commit the crime that put them in prison.\n  The Americans for Gun Safety report points to several factors that \ncontribute to a state's firearm theft rate, such as gun ownership \nrates, overall crime rates, and safe storage laws. The report notes \nthat the eighteen states with safe storage laws had firearm theft rates \nnearly 30 percent below that of States without safe storage gun laws. \nAdditionally, over the last 10-year period, theft rates declined by at \nleast 47 percent in States with safe storage laws compared to 30 \npercent in States without such laws.\n  As the Americans for Gun Safety report illustrates, safe storage laws \ncan help prevent criminals from gaining access to firearms. Federal \nsafe storage laws aimed at protecting children may have the added \nbenefit of preventing gun theft. Last Congress, I cosponsored Senator \nDurbin's Children's Firearm Access Prevention Act. Under this bill, \nadults who fail to lock up loaded firearms or unloaded firearms with \nammunition can be held liable if a weapon is taken by a child and used \nto kill or injure him or herself or another person. The bill also \nincreases the penalties for selling a gun to a juvenile and creates a \ngun safety education program that includes parent-teacher \norganizations, local law enforcement and community organizations. This \nbill is similar to legislation President Bush signed into law as \nGovernor of Texas. I believe this is a simple common sense step we can \ntake to reduce gun violence and gun-related crime. I support this bill \nand I hope the Senate will act on it during this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1462-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred October 7, \n2001 in Mira Mesa, CA. A man of Indian descent was knocked out with a \nbaseball bat in what was described as a hate crime linked to the \nSeptember 11 backlash. The victim told police he was walking beside the \nroad when he heard someone yell an ethnic slur. He was then hit on the \nhead and knocked unconscious. A woman came to his aid and told him he \nhad been hit by two white males with an aluminum baseball bat. The \nvictim was treated at a local hospital.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1462-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1462-S1463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to address the importance of \nmaintaining a commitment to affirmative action in college admissions \nprograms.\n  President Bush, unfortunately, took our nation a step backward when \nhe announced last week that his administration would file an amicus \ncuriae brief with the Supreme Court opposing the admissions policies of \nthe University of Michigan. The President apparently believes that \ncollege admissions decisions should never consider the race of \napplicants, even though he also says that he supports the pursuit of \ncampus diversity.\n  In 1978, in University of California v. Bakke, the Supreme Court \nruled that campus diversity can be a ``compelling governmental \ninterest'' that justifies reasonable, narrowly tailored affirmative \naction programs at universities. The Supreme Court said that colleges \nand universities cannot use quotas to achieve campus diversity, but \naffirmed that campus diversity can be a worthy goal of college \nadmissions policies. In December 2002, the Supreme Court, for the first \ntime since its Bakke decision, agreed to review two cases that \nchallenge a university's affirmative action programs--Grutter v. \nBollinger, which involves the admissions program at the University of \nMichigan Law School, and Gratz v. Bollinger, which involves the \nundergraduate admissions program at the University of Michigan.\n  Some, including President Bush, have criticized affirmative action \nprograms in higher education, like those in place at the University of \nMichigan, as ``quota'' programs. They are simply wrong. These \naffirmative action programs do not set quotas or numerical targets for \nadmitting a certain number of students of a particular race or \nethnicity. In fact, the Bakke decision long ago prohibited colleges \nfrom employing a quota system. So, for President Bush to suggest that \nthis is a question of whether to support a quota system is a \nmischaracterization of the issue before the Court.\n  Some critics have also wrongly stated that affirmative action \nprograms admit students primarily on the basis of race. According to \nthe Washington Post, the President stated that the University of \nMichigan's admissions system selected students ``primarily on the basis \nof the color of their skin.'' But again, this is simply not an accurate \ndescription of the current law or of how students are admitted to the \nUniversity of Michigan.\n  Rather, in most affirmative action programs for college or graduate \nschool admissions, race is simply one of numerous factors that can be \nconsidered by admissions officers to create a diverse student body. For \nexample, under the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions \npolicy, the University considers the entire background of the \napplicant. Students are evaluated on a 150 point scale to determine \ntheir fitness for admission. The\n\n[[Page S1463]]\n\nvast majority of these points--110 of 150 points--are awarded based on \nacademic achievement. That means grades, test scores, and curriculum. \nThe University also considers other factors like leadership, service, \nand life experiences. Only 20 points can possibly be awarded on the \nbasis of race. A student who is socioeconomically disadvantaged can \nalso earn 20 points but students cannot earn 20 points for both race \nand being socioeconomically disadvantaged. Thus, the University does \nnot have a quota or numerical target for minority students, nor does \nthe University admit students primarily on the basis of race.\n  Like the University of Michigan, most colleges and universities \ngenerally give academic records--such as college grades and \nstandardized test scores, the caliber of high school attended, and the \nrigor of the student's chosen curriculum--the greatest weight in \ndetermining whether a student gains admission. But other factors--such \nas extracurricular activities, race, athletic talent, geographic \ndiversity, or whether students are related to alumni--are also \nfrequently given consideration in the college admissions process. Many \ncolleges give preferences to the children of alumni, and these \npreferences will often work to the disadvantage of people of color. So, \nrace can be a factor but is not the sole factor in determining \nadmission to college.\n  I am especially disappointed in the Bush Administration's decision to \noppose affirmative action programs because the President has said that \nhe is committed to equal educational opportunities for all America's \nchildren. The President has said that education is one of his top \npriorities. Yet, he has now turned his back on many of the students he \npromised to help. By submitting an amicus curiae brief to the Supreme \nCourt favoring the abolition of affirmative action programs, the \nPresident sends the message that he opposes creating higher education \nopportunities for minority students, who do not always have the same \neducational opportunities at the secondary school levels as white \nstudents.\n  I might add, that I believe Congress also has an important \nresponsibility to ensure equal access to higher education. I strongly \nbelieve that Congress can do more to ensure that students meet the \ncosts of today's college education. That is why Senator Collins and I \nhave recently called for a doubling of Pell Grant funding by 2010. Pell \ngrants are an important support for all low income students, regardless \nof race. In fact, if it were not for the Pell grant program, many low \nincome students would not have the chance to attend college at all.\n  The Pell grant, however, does not cover what it once did. The price \nof a college education at both public and private institutions has \nincreased dramatically. Congress needs to increase the funding of the \nPell grant program to keep up with the increasing costs of higher \neducation.\n  One of the greatest strengths of our nation is its pursuit of equal \neducational opportunities for all students. Our nation's colleges and \nuniversities are the envy of the world for their rigorous curricula and \nhigh-caliber professors, but also for their enriching experience of \nlearning in an environment with students who represent a range of \nracial, ethnic, and social and economic backgrounds representing every \npart of America, if not the world. I am deeply disappointed that the \nPresident decided to put the government of the United States of America \non the wrong side of the case where the Supreme Court will address this \ncrucial issue. I hope that the Court will affirm the importance of \ncampus diversity and uphold affirmative action admissions policies that \nallow colleges and universities to achieve this important diversity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1463-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE NOMINATION OF GOVERNOR TOM RIDGE AS SECRETARY OF THE HOMELAND \n                          SECURITY DEPARTMENT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nGovernor Tom Ridge to head the newly created Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Although I support his confirmation, I would like to \nelaborate on my expectation that Governor Ridge will be responsive to \nCongressional committees as he carries out his duties.\n  As the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works \ncommittee, I have been deeply concerned about the creation of this new \ndepartment. I voted against the legislation creating the Homeland \nSecurity Department in part because of concerns about the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, role in the new organization and its \nability to carry out its mission once moved into the Department. The \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, EPW, will continue to have \noversight of FEMA within the new department. I fully expect Governor \nRidge to answer any and all questions we may have about FEMA's new role \nin a responsive and timely fashion.\n  I also expect the Department to act to protect our chemical and \nnuclear plants from attack and to support legislation such as S. 157, \nthe Chemical Security Act sponsored by Senator Corzine and myself in \nthe 108th Congress, and favorably reported by the EPW Committee in the \n107th Congress as S. 1602, and S. 1746, the Nuclear Security Act \nsponsored by Senator Reid and reported favorably by the EPW Committee \nin the 107th Congress.\n  Governor Ridge expressed his concern about these important security \nissues in testimony before the EPW Committee on July 10, 2002, stating, \n``The fact is, we have a very diversified economy and our enemies look \nat some of our economic assets as targets. And clearly, the chemical \nfacilities are one of them.'' The Washington Post published a letter on \nSunday, October 6, 2002 from Governor Ridge and Administrator Whitman \nexpressing the commitment of the Bush Administration to reduce the \nvulnerability of America's chemical facilities to terrorist attack. In \nthis letter the Governor stated that voluntary efforts alone are not \nsufficient to provide the level of assurance Americans deserve. I agree \nwith the Governor and expect his engagement in the development of \nlegislation to address this issue.\n  As Senator Levin pointed out in Governor Ridge's confirmation hearing \nbefore the Government Affairs committee last week, language contained \nin section 214 of the implementing legislation for the Homeland \nSecurity Department could be interpreted to exempt from disclosure any \ninformation included in a voluntary submission, including evidence of \nillegal activity such as hazardous waste dumping. Further information, \neven if discovered independently of the submission, could not be used \nin any action against that company. Even a Member of Congress would be \nprevented from taking any action with that information.\n  In other words, this language could give substantial legal shelter to \ncompanies acting illegally. The potential environmental consequences of \nthis are enormous.\n  While I note the potential for this interpretation, I do not believe \nit is the correct interpretation, and I was heartened to hear that \nSecretary Ridge shares my views on this. In last week's confirmation \nhearing, he said, ``That certainly wasn't the intent, I'm sure, of \nthose who advocated the Freedom of Information Act exemption--to give \nwrongdoers protection, or to protect illegal activity. And I'll \ncertainly work with you to clarify that language.''\n  I agree with the Secretary that ambiguities in this language must be \nclarified to make clear that it is only the physical document being \nsubmitted to the Department of Homeland Security that is intended to be \nprotected by this provision. Records generated elsewhere or by other \nmeans, even if they contain similar or identical information to that \nwhich was submitted to Homeland Security, would not be affected by this \nprovision but would continue to be treated under existing Freedom of \nInformation Act provisions or other applicable law. This allows \nconfidentiality of the information voluntarily submitted to Homeland \nSecurity, while still allowing other Government agencies to proceed \nwith their duties under existing law. It also allows the public \ncontinued access to information to which it has traditionally been \nentitled under our public information laws.\n  I look forward to working with Governor Ridge as he assumes his new \npost.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1464-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1464]]\n                              GLOBAL AIDS\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, yesterday, I was pleased to join Senators \nDurbin, DeWine and others in sponsoring an amendment to increase \nfunding to fight AIDS around the world. It is imperative that we do all \nwe can to stem the spread of this deadly and devastating disease.\n  The latest statistics tell a grim story: The AIDS epidemic claimed \nmore than 3 million lives in 2002, and an estimated 5 million people \nacquired the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, in 2002, bringing to 42 \nmillion the number of people globally living with the virus. While we \nare most familiar with the presence of AIDS in Africa, especially sub-\nSaharan Africa, AIDS is rapidly expanding throughout Eastern Europe, \nAsia and the Caribbean. By 2010, it is estimated that approximately 40 \nmillion children worldwide will have lost one or both of their parents \nto HIV/AIDS.\n  The amendment adopted by the Senate would increase our commitment to \nthe United States Agency for International Development's Child Survival \nand Health Programs Fund by $180 million. Of that amount, $100 million \nis for a U.S. contribution to the United Nations Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and $25 million is available for \ntransfer to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to help in the \nprevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. This amount will bring the total \nU.S. contribution for Fiscal Year 2003 in the fight against global AIDS \nto $1.525 billion. While this is a far cry from the $2.5 billion sought \nby the international health community to meet the needs of \ninternational organizations working to eradicate AIDS and individual \ncountries grappling with soaring HIV infection rates, it is the least \nwe can do.\n  The current Administration has asserted on a number of occasions that \nthe U.S. government is prepared to play a leadership role in the fight \nagainst the spread of HIV/AIDS. Yet earlier this year, the President \nchose not to spend $200 million which was included in the Fiscal Year \n2002 emergency supplemental for the U.N. Global Fund to Fight AIDS. it \nis no surprise that the international community questions our \ncommitment to this fight. Leadership requires more than rhetoric. It \nrequires that we commit our fair share of resources so we can fully \nparticipate in a larger, more comprehensive international effort to \nregain control of this crisis.\n  I am pleased my colleagues supported this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1464-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1464-S1466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AMERICA'S PLACE IN THE WORLD\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday I gave an address to the \nWorld Affairs Council in Los Angeles, CA on America's role in the \nworld. I ask unanimous consent to print my address in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Today America faces four great international challenges: \n     the war on terror, the situation in Iraq, the Israel-\n     Palestinian dispute, and the crisis in North Korea. These \n     four present challenges to our Nation greater than any our \n     Nation has faced in decades.\n       With respect to the ongoing war on terror, which centers \n     around Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, I can report substantial \n     progress. The United States with its allies and the Northern \n     Alliance succeeded in dispersing the Taliban government and \n     putting al-Qaida operatives on the run. The government of \n     Hamid Karzai is reasserting control over Afghanistan, \n     although the going is difficult.\n       The security situation in Afghanistan is improving. We have \n     7,500 troops on the ground, and our allies, 5,000; they are \n     providing security until the new government of Afghanistan is \n     able to train military and police.\n       And, as a final action in the last Congress, a new \n     Department of Homeland Security has been created to better \n     coordinate efforts to safeguard the American people from \n     terrorist attacks.\n       On the negative side, however, Osama bin Laden and many of \n     his senior lieutenants are most probably still alive, along \n     with hundreds, and possibly thousands of followers. They \n     remain extremely dangerous.\n       And while Mullah Omar and the Taliban have been removed \n     from power, they lurk in the remote areas of Afghanistan \n     along the border with Pakistan and wait for a sign of \n     weakness so they can return.\n       Bottom line, if we are to be successful in the war on \n     terror, it is critical that Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar, and \n     other senior Taliban and al-Qaida operatives be brought to \n     justice.\n       So, we must stay the course in Afghanistan. And wherever \n     the war on terror takes us, we must not allow ourselves to \n     get distracted or take our eye off the ball.\n       We must ensure that the Afghan economy and infrastructure \n     are rebuilt. We must protect this fledgling democracy so it \n     can survive and the Afghan people can flourish.\n       Just last week, Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of \n     Defense, said from Kabul that ``stability and security'' must \n     be the goal. I agree.\n       Internationally, we must relentlessly pursue those who \n     would use terror to destroy us. That must be our mission and \n     it must be sustained until the job is finished.\n       With regard to Iraq, let me begin by saying categorically \n     that no information has been presented to the Senate to date \n     to connect Iraq to 9-11 or to any al-Qaida terrorist attack.\n       Nevertheless, Vice President Cheney laid the groundwork for \n     a preemptive U.S. military strike against Iraq in a major \n     speech last August 26, stating that Iraq either is, or would \n     imminently be, a nuclear power.\n       But he provided no evidence to back up this accusation \n     either publicly to the American people or privately, on a \n     classified basis, to the Senate. He was, I believe, laying \n     the ground work for a unilateral and preemptive attack on \n     Iraq.\n       Then, however, in a welcome shift of position, the \n     President went to the United Nations on September 12 and \n     strongly urged the Security Council to compel Iraqi \n     compliance with the 16 resolutions Iraq has defied over the \n     past 11 years.\n       The President has repeatedly stated that the United States \n     will lead ``a coalition of the willing'' to compel Iraq's \n     compliance. In September, it appeared that the President had \n     turned away from a unilateral course of action to a \n     multilateral one. That was good and welcome news.\n       On October 10, I voted for a Senate Resolution that would \n     have required the President to return to the Security Council \n     for a vote before launching a military strike against Iraq. \n     That resolution was defeated.\n       Subsequently, and based on the President's support for \n     acting in concert with the UN Security Council, I joined 76 \n     of my colleagues and voted to support a resolution \n     authorizing the President to use of force to compel \n     compliance if necessary.\n       Since November 24, the UN inspection teams have inspected \n     Iraqi facilities that produce chemicals and pharmaceuticals, \n     Saddam's palace compounds, health care centers, water plants, \n     and numerous other facilities where old records, prior \n     inspections, or intelligence indicate chemical, biological or \n     nuclear weapons or missiles might either be made or secreted.\n       The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is also in \n     the process of doubling the number of inspectors.\n       On December 7, Iraq gave the United Nations a 12,000-page \n     account of its chemical, biological, nuclear, and missile \n     programs.\n       And on December 28, Iraq provided the UN inspectors with \n     the list of Iraqis participating in its weapons programs.\n       January 27 is a key date. On that day, the findings of the \n     IAEA inspectors will be detailed, and any discrepancies \n     between what they have found thus far and Iraq's earlier \n     declaration should be revealed.\n       Inspections to date have produced no evidence sufficient to \n     clearly establish continuing culpability in the production of \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n       However, Iraq is not yet cooperating fully with the UN \n     inspectors as the Security Council demanded. Saddam may well \n     be up to his old tricks, moving weapons or other \n     incriminating evidence from place to place. The history is a \n     sordid one.\n       If there is clear evidence that Iraq is continuing an \n     illegal program to produce weapons of mass destruction; or \n     has submitted inaccurate or false information regarding its \n     nuclear and biological programs; or has secret programs, \n     facilities, or stockpiles; then the administration should \n     make it public.\n       And, if there is hard evidence of weapons of mass \n     destruction, then the Security Council must take immediate \n     action to compel compliance, including using force, if \n     necessary. And I would support such action.\n       But the massive increase of U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf \n     appears to be an indication that regardless of the findings \n     of the UN inspectors the President may well intend to use \n     military force to bring about regime change in Iraq. This is \n     deeply disturbing.\n       I strongly believe that the arms inspectors must be allowed \n     to complete their task, to report back to the UN Security \n     Council, and the Security Council must then consider action.\n       In the meantime, Iraq is effectively contained and \n     prevented from developing weapons of mass destruction. It is \n     not an imminent threat to its neighbors or the United States. \n     And there is no need for precipitous action under these \n     circumstances.\n       A preemptive unilateral attack against a Muslim nation may \n     well create a divide between the U.S. and the Muslim world so \n     deep and wide that it will bring with it negative \n     consequences for decades.\n       There are efforts being made behind the scenes by Arab \n     nations to achieve a peaceful regime change. These efforts \n     should be given the opportunity to succeed. What is the rush \n     to bring the tragedy of war?\n       If Iraq can be successfully contained and disarmed and war \n     can be avoided, if the deaths of innocent people can be \n     prevented,\n\n[[Page S1465]]\n\n     then that must be our course. War must be a last resort.\n       Let me make a few comments about one additional issue \n     before discussing North Korea: A solution must be found to \n     the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, and soon.\n       Unfortunately, it has not been, in my view, a high enough \n     priority for the administration. As long as the Israeli-\n     Palestinian crisis escalates, the risks of catastrophe remain \n     unabated. Yet, one of the few things that most Israelis and \n     most Palestinians agree on is that the United States is a \n     unique third party capable of advancing the peace process.\n       Peace between Israel and the Palestinians is clearly in the \n     U.S. national interest and would produce broader benefits as \n     well: it would increase cooperation in the Islamic world in \n     the war on terror; it would help us secure assistance from \n     the Islamic world in pressuring Saddam Hussein to disarm; and \n     it would restore credibility and momentum worldwide for \n     American diplomacy and influence.\n       Right after the January 28th Israeli election, I believe \n     President Bush should name a very senior and experienced \n     person to be his personal emissary dealing with the Israeli-\n     Palestinian crisis. The Israeli-Palestinian problem demands \n     more creative and higher-level attention by the United \n     States. It must be solved. Time is running out.\n       Now, with regard to North Korea I believe the situation is \n     more menacing than that in Iraq. It presents a substantial \n     and real danger to stability throughout the Asia-Pacific \n     region and could ultimately directly threaten the United \n     States.\n       North Korea possesses a much more advanced nuclear weapons \n     program than Iraq, and it has been assessed that North Korea \n     may already possess nuclear capability.\n       North Korea also has a missile delivery system, and once \n     the third stage of the Taepo Dong missile is completed and \n     operational, North Korea could strike any place in the United \n     States.\n       Also, North Korea has: expelled all international \n     inspectors and equipment; withdrawn from the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty; restarted its plutonium processing \n     plants; moved thousands of plutonium rods out of locked safe \n     storage back into the nuclear production line; and is \n     enriching uranium for nuclear weapon purposes.\n       The country and leadership are isolated, the economy is a \n     failure and even the most basic necessities of life such as \n     electricity, sanitation, and food are lacking. People are now \n     starving by the thousands.\n       I had the opportunity in December to helicopter to the \n     Demilitarized Zone, DMZ, where General LaPorte, our 4-star \n     general in command, pointed out North Korean troop \n     concentrations: 70 percent of the 1.2 million-man North \n     Korean army is deployed along the DMZ, with enough heavy \n     artillery to be able to substantially damage Seoul, killing \n     millions. And there are reports that nerve agents may also be \n     deployed along the DMZ.\n       Since my visit in December, the 800,000 forward-deployed \n     North Korean troops have been placed on high alert and are \n     prepared to move instantly.\n       North Korea, isolated with its failing economy, has clearly \n     placed its total focus, not on feeding its people, but in \n     developing its military, its missiles and its nuclear \n     capability, all in defiance of treaties it has signed.\n       I believe the blame for precipitating this crisis lies \n     squarely with North Korea, which clearly violated the agreed \n     framework by beginning the surreptitious development of \n     nuclear capacity.\n       But it also appears clear to me that the administration's \n     handling of events on the Korean Peninsula over the past 2 \n     years, as well as its broader foreign policy rhetoric and \n     statements, have served, ironically, to fuel North Korea's \n     paranoia and made the situation much more difficult to \n     manage.\n       First, the administration failed to endorse President Kim \n     Dae Jung's ``Sunshine Policy'' when President Kim visited the \n     White House in March 2001. This move was perceived as a major \n     humiliation in South Korea, helped set the stage for the \n     rising tide of anti-Americanism, and was seen as a sign by \n     the North that the administration was intent on a policy of \n     isolation and confrontation.\n       Second, in January of 2002, the administration issued its \n     Nuclear Posture Review, which states that there are certain \n     situations in which the United States would contemplate and \n     perhaps engage in a first use of nuclear weapons. One of the \n     scenarios in this review included North Korea.\n       Third, in September 2002 the administration issued its \n     National Security Strategy, which states that the United \n     States reserves the right to strike preemptively, even \n     without an imminent threat, if the administration believes \n     another nation poses a threat to the United States.\n       And fourth, including North Korea as part of the ``axis of \n     evil'' in the 2002 State of the Union address, along with \n     statements by the President saying that he loathed Kim Jong \n     Il, calling him names, and saying that he deliberately \n     starved his own people, all helped fuel North Korea's \n     paranoia and belligerence.\n       Meanwhile, one other troubling aspect of the Korean crisis \n     is the growing anti-American sentiment in South Korea.\n       The new President, Roh Moo Hyun, won the election in an \n     atmosphere of anti-Americanism. And in some quarters, our \n     37,500 troops stationed there are increasingly unwelcome.\n       The anti-American sentiment has been galvanized by the \n     accidental deaths of two young Korean girls, run down by a \n     large tank-like tracked vehicle on a narrow road while the \n     girls were walking to a birthday party. A major outcry arose \n     after the two servicemen driving the vehicle were acquitted \n     in U.S. military court on charges of negligent homicide.\n       The situation on the Korean Peninsula offers no easy \n     solution.\n       So I am pleased to see that after so many weeks of refusing \n     to negotiate directly, the administration has now opened the \n     door to high level discussions. This is a welcome and \n     imperative change. It is the only acceptable course. And its \n     result may well determine the effectiveness of diplomatic \n     efforts in this crisis.\n       There must be direct and multilateral discussions between \n     North and South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia as well as \n     the United States. The solution is everyone's business and \n     the responsibility of the leaders of all nations.\n       Much of what the administration has done since September 11 \n     to safeguard U.S. security interests has been necessary and \n     right. I have supported these efforts.\n       I believe that the administration has been correct in \n     identifying the threat of the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction, especially if they fall into the hands of \n     terrorists, as one of the top challenges facing U.S. foreign \n     policy.\n       But in Iraq and North Korea, the administration has been \n     pursuing two very different, and at times contradictory, \n     approaches, which, in the process, has confused and angered \n     many of our closest friends and allies.\n       With Iraq, the administration is beating the drums of war. \n     With North Korea, it is pursuing multilateral diplomacy and a \n     peaceful resolution of the crisis.\n       But these two crises are similar in many respects, and thus \n     the question remains: can diplomacy be an effective tool in \n     this new century to stay the ambitions of those states which \n     seek nuclear weapons? Or is the use of force our only \n     recourse?\n       I believe that the administration's current policy towards \n     North Korea is more likely to produce a peaceful and \n     acceptable outcome than its policy towards Iraq.\n       If you look at the different approaches to each of these \n     problems alongside the administration's broader foreign \n     policy statements and rhetoric, it is no wonder why serious \n     questions about America's role in the world have been raised \n     both here and abroad.\n       The administration's emphasis on unilateral action; its \n     dismissal of international law, treaties, and institutions; \n     and its dominant focus on military power as put forward in \n     the Doctrine of Preemption, the rationale for unilateral \n     preemptive attack; the National Security Strategy, which aims \n     to make the United States the preponderant and \n     unchallengeable military power in the world; and the Nuclear \n     Posture Review, which states scenarios in which the United \n     States would engage in a first use of nuclear weapons, even \n     against the non-nuclear states, are particularly troubling.\n       Taken at face value, these positions mean the United States \n     holds for itself the right to strike another sovereign \n     nation, to wage war, if you will, even in the absence of an \n     immediate threat, but based solely on the perception of a \n     sufficient threat.\n       Despite administration efforts to downplay the actual \n     wording in these documents, they are, in my view, \n     unnecessarily provocative and dangerous.\n       I believe now, more than ever, that Teddy Roosevelt had it \n     right, ``walk softly and carry a big stick.''\n       As a presidential candidate in 2000, George W. Bush spoke \n     eloquently about the need for America to conduct itself with \n     humility in international affairs. I remember him saying \n     during the second Presidential debate on October 11, 2000: \n     ``If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us; if we're a \n     humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us. And our nation \n     stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and \n     that's why we've got to be humble, and yet project strength \n     in a way that promotes freedom.''\n       Yet, one of the things I have found in the trips I have \n     made abroad in the past year is that our allies across the \n     globe increasingly believe that the United States is anything \n     but humble.\n       They feel the United States does not listen to its allies, \n     has shown disregard for treaties and international \n     organizations, and has become increasingly unilateral.\n       As a result, we have lost much of the good will that \n     followed the 9/11 attacks.\n       The preeminent position America occupies in the world today \n     rests only in part on our military and economic strength.\n       In large part, it is also due to our moral influence and \n     our unquenchable quest for truth, justice, and freedom, our \n     belief that ``all (people) are created equal, that they are \n     endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, \n     that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of \n     Happiness.''\n       And regardless of whether one views Iraq or North Korea as \n     the bigger threat, one thing they both have in common is that \n     the United States is much more likely to be successful in \n     dealing with them and safeguarding our own national security \n     interests if we are able to act in concert with our friends \n     and allies.\n       So we stand today at an important decision point in the \n     history of our Nation and the world: Will the United States \n     turn away from the successful bipartisan tradition of\n\n[[Page S1466]]\n\n     supporting a world ordered by law, and pursue instead a \n     unilateralist path?\n       Or will we recommit our Nation to the achievement of \n     workable democratic structures, to law and diplomacy, and to \n     constructive leadership that produces coalitions to bring \n     about just solutions?\n       There may be times, when all else fails, that unilateral \n     American military action will be necessary, and Iraq may be a \n     case in point. However, in my view, that has not been \n     established. War must only be a last resort.\n       But the spirit of our foreign policy should not be the \n     establishment of American hegemony, any more than we would \n     want to see the establishment of al-Qaida's vision of a new \n     radical fundamentalist Islamic world.\n       More importantly, I strongly believe that a foreign policy \n     oriented towards cooperation and consultation will, in the \n     long run, prove to be a more effective guarantor of U.S. \n     national security than one of unilateralist impulse and \n     confrontation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1466-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        SEPTEMBER 11 COMMISSION\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this past November, after \nextensive discussions, the Congress authorized the establishment of a \ncommission to investigate the event surrounding the September 11 \nterrorist attacks. This commission should play a critically important \nrole by allowing us to better understand the events surrounding this \nnational tragedy and to better prepare against the threats of similar \nattacks in the future. The commission's work is also essential for the \nthousands of families who lost loved ones on September 11, and who want \nbetter information about what happened on that fateful day, and who \nwant to ensure that all those responsible are held accountable. These \nfamilies have suffered tremendous losses and they deserve our support.\n  I am very concerned, however, that the commission may lack the \nresources need to do the job right. So far, in defense appropriations \nbill for Fiscal Year 2003, Congress has appropriated only $3 million \nfor the commission. From all indications, this is grossly inadequate. \nAnd if we fail to supplement this with additional funding, we would not \nonly be disgracing the memory of the victims of September 11, but we \ncould be jeopardizing the future safety of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, in recent days, my staff and I have discussed the \noperation of this important investigatory commission with several of \nthe appointed commissioners, both Democrats and Republicans. They have \nexplained that the $3 million appropriated so far appears woefully \ninsufficient to meet the commission's anticipated needs this fiscal \nyear. in fact, actual needs for FY2003 probably will exceed $6 \nmillion--more than twice the amount approved by the Congress.\n  Mr. President, the responsibilities of the September 11 commission \nare much broader than the other commissions and it is simply \nunreasonable to expect the commission to function effectively with only \n$3 million. After all, that's a $2 million less than the funding \nreceived by a 1996 commission to look into the issues surrounding \nlegalized gambling.\n  Think about that: $5 million to study gambling, $3 million to study \nthe worst terrorist attack in the history of this country. That simply \ndoes not make sense.\n  Mr. President, it is important to remember that this commission has \nresponsibilities and requirements that go far beyond those of any other \ncommission in U.S. history. There are unique and expensive logistical \nrequirements, including the hiring of expert staff with high-level \nsecurity clearances. The commission must secure real estate appropriate \nfor top secret discussions, and provide high-level security of its \nemployees and its information systems.\n  In order to complete the work of this important commission thoroughly \nand on time, more resources will be needed during this fiscal year, and \nin the future.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that if the Congress considers a \nsupplemental appropriations bill later this year, that legislation will \ninclude needed additional resources for the commission.\n  In fact, I had prepared an amendment to this bill to increase funding \nfor the commission by $3 million. However, after a conversation with \nGovernor Tom Kean, chair of the commission, I have decided not to \nintroduce my amendment at this time. Rather, I will wait until a formal \nbudget is drawn up by the commission.\n  I want to assure my colleagues, however, that I will not stop \nfighting for increased funding for the commission until I am convinced \nthat the September 11 commission has received the funding that it needs \nto investigate the worst attack on American soil in our history. This \nmatter is simply too important to do anything less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1466-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1466-S1467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               MIKE EVANS\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of the \nmost dedicated public servants and loyal staff members I have had the \nprivilege to work with. Mike Evans has served me with deliberation, \ndedication, and distinction for 18 years and I, the people of Montana, \nthe United States Senate, and our Nation are the better for it.\n  Mike began his career as my legislative assistant for tax policy in \n1983. As many in this Chamber will recall, that was a time of great \ndebate in the Finance Committee. We had passed a major tax cut in 1981. \nThe following year, a soaring budget deficit was demanding attention. \nBy the time Mike came on board, not only was the Finance Committee \ndealing with ``revenue raisers,'' to use the language of the day, but \ntax simplification was the hottest topic on the Finance Committee's \nagenda. Mike guided me through the controversies with his usual \nenthusiasm and attention to detail. In fact, he was so impressive that \nhe soon became my legislative director, and expanded his \nresponsibilities to include overseeing my work on the Agriculture and \nEnvironment and Public Works Committees.\n  Perhaps his most significant accomplishment during his time with the \nEPW Committee was seeing the Clean Air Act of 1990 through the \nlegislative process and into law. I was chairman of the Environmental \nPollution Subcommittee then and Mike was my right arm--and sometimes my \neyes and ears, too!\n  Getting that bill through the EPW Committee, the Senate floor, and \nthen conference with the House was an arduous task. But Mike was there \nall the way. Through the seemingly endless markups, through the \nbackroom negotiations off the Senate floor, and through the midnight \nconferences with the House, Mike was always ready with the right \narguments, the necessary supporting materials, and, most important, his \nsage advice. That bill was a significant advance in the protection of \npublic health and the cleanup of our environment. Mike's contributions \nto the bill will be long remembered.\n  In 1991, the lure of the Preston Gates law firm proved too much and \nhe returned to the firm from whence he came. But when I became chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee in 1993, I succeeded in \nluring him back into public service. Mike became my general counsel on \nthe EPW Committee, integrally involved with the reauthorization of the \nClean Water Act, the Superfund law, and the Endangered Species Act. We \nweren't always successful, but Mike provided the legal underpinnings of \nour efforts.\n  It is as a lawyer that Mike's true talents show through. He not only \nmasters the statutory construction and case law on any point with \nease--or at least so it seems to me--but he is renowned among the staff \nfor his ability to footnote material. I recall on several occasions \ngetting memos from him where there was not a word of the memo on a \npage. Rather, the page was filled with footnotes. I told him that I \nappreciated a good footnote or two as much as the next lawyer, but next \ntime he should save them for our opponents.\n  Mike is respected and admired by his colleagues. He was always \nwilling to spend time with other staff to review legal arguments, \nprovide advice and direction, and sometimes just be a sounding board. I \nwas told that Mike's stature among his peers increased beyond measure \nwhen he revealed to the other staff that when reading bill language, \nsubclause two is pronounced ``subclause two'' and not, as was the \napparent custom, ``two little eye.''\n  Mike's attention to detail was perhaps most apparent when it came to \nthe rules. First, he updated the EPW Committee rules and religiously \nfiled\n\n[[Page S1467]]\n\naway each application so that the Committee would have a file of \nprecedents on which to refer.\n  It was in the defense of those EPW Committee rules that Mike became a \nsmall legend. In particular, he staunchly defended the Committee rule \nthat prohibited the naming of public buildings for any living \nindividual under the age of 70. But, lest you think Mike is perfect, \neven his best oratorical skills and most reasoned argument in defense \nof the rule were never a match for the political imperative involved in \na naming bill. Mike lost every single one of those arguments.\n  When I took over as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in \n2001, Mike moved over as the Deputy Chief of Staff and General Counsel. \nOnce again, Mike took responsibility for updating the Committee rules \nand establishing a record of precedents.\n  Mike not only mastered committee rules, he mastered the Senate rules. \nOn his last day in the Senate, the Senate Parliamentarian noted that \nMike was always prepared when he made a parliamentary inquiry. And, for \nthe record, I have to warn the Senate Parliamentarian that Mike \nprepared comprehensive, annotated references for the Finance Committee \nstaff and provided what is now affectionately known as ``The Mike \nEvans' Procedure Seminar.''\n  Ironically, despite his respect of the rules, last year he was thrown \noff the Senate floor with a bipartisan gaggle of Finance Committee \nstaff for being too noisy. I believe Senator Dayton presided over the \nouster.\n  I have always respected a person who can manage both the demanding \nresponsibilities of Senate staff while also caring for a growing \nfamily. And Mike has certainly done both. We were fortunate to be part \nof Mike's life as his family expanded from two--he and his wife \nMaureen--to six, with the addition of their four beautiful children: \nSean, Christopher, Aselefech and Adanech. We have watched their \nchildren grow up and every step has been a reflection of their \nincredible parents.\n  Mike also found time to be one of the best read staffers I have ever \nknown. I have no doubt that his counsel has been greatly strengthened \nby his acquaintanceship with thoughts and history beyond the reach of a \nsingle individual. And his literary interests are not limited to \nreading. He is a most prolific author. As with most staff, he has done \nmore than his share of floor statements. And as a lawyer, he has \ndrafted the occasional law review article. But his talents also extend \nto poetry, including the occasional rhyming remembrance of triumphs and \nthings best left unsaid when a staff member departs.\n  Suffice it to say, Mike fancies himself a music impresario. He feels \nit is his duty to bring music to ``the people.'' Some of that music is \neven good. Mike has been known to wear Bob Marley T-shirts in the \noffice over the weekend and sing Bruce Springstein lyrics at the drop \nof a hat. In fact, when he discovered that one of the Finance Committee \ninterns house-sat for Bob Dylan, the intern was suddenly spending more \ntime in intense discussions with Mike.\n  Mike truly believes in the dignity and responsibilities of public \nservice. He understands that when it comes to working in the Senate, as \nBruce Springstein would say, ``the door's open but the ride ain't \nfree.'' So, while he leaves the Senate staff to return to private \npractice at Preston Gates, I know that he will retain his commitment to \nservice, to his family, to his colleagues, and to his country.\n  Every President, every member of Congress, every staff person in the \nUnited States Congress must first swear to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic, to bear true faith and allegiance to the same and to \nfaithfully discharge the duties of the office. Mike Evans lived by this \noath every day of his public service in the Senate.\n  Mike follows the rules: The Senate rules. The Committee rules. And \nthe rules by which he lives his life--loyalty, diversity, fairness, \nhonesty, and compassion, coupled with an unexpected, yet sharp sense of \nhumor.\n  I thank Mike for his dedication and the nearly two decades for which \nI have been fortunate enough to benefit his counsel and friendship. May \nwe all follow his example, to have the wit to discover what is true and \nthe fortitude to practice what is good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1467-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                POPCORN\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, in 1996 the Congress promised \nagriculture producers that they would no longer be penalized for \nheeding market signals and raising crops the market demanded.\n  Two-hundred farmers in my home State of Missouri responded to strong \ndomestic and foreign demand and planted acres of popcorn. Now, with the \npassage of the 2002 farm bill, these producers are greatly \ndisadvantaged compared to farmers that stayed with traditional program \ncrops.\n  Under the provisions of the 2002 farm bill, producers who opted to \ngrow popcorn since 1996 on acreage traditionally dedicated to program \ncrops or soybeans are severely penalized if they attempt to update \ntheir program acreage history or yield history.\n  Unless corrected, this will cause a substantial, potential loss to \nboth farm income and land value. I believe that this problem should be \ncorrected in the most expeditious manner, as the April 15 deadline for \nsignup into the new farm programs is quickly approaching. Senator Lugar \nand I have introduced an amendment to allow producers to include \npopcorn in their program base acres. I am grateful to managers on both \nsides for addressing this issue in a managers amendment.\n  The correction is simple. Popcorn is simply treated as a variety of \nthe traditional corn for the purposes of determining bases and yields. \nI urge my colleges to support my amendment and allow the Department of \nAgriculture to consider popcorn equivalent to corn for the purpose of \ncomputing base acreage. There are 278,000 acres of land nationwide \nnormally devoted to production of popcorn.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments \ntoday to make some remarks in appreciation for the Alabama \nCongressional delegation's most senior staff member, Mr. Clay Swanzy. \nOriginally from Greensboro, AL, one of Alabama's most charming towns, \nClay retired in November after 31 years of service to the U.S. \nCongress.\n  Mr. Swanzy has served on the congressional staff of three different \ndistinguished Alabama congressmen: former Congressmen Jack Edwards of \nMobile and Bill Dickinson of Montgomery, and most recently Congressman \nTerry Everett of Enterprise. He was known on the staff of each \ncongressman for his hard work, dedication to duty, and loyalty. In \n1971, former Congressman Jack Edwards hired Clay away from his position \nas a political reporter for the Mobile Press Register to become his \npress secretary in Washington. Clay remained with Congressman Edwards \nuntil Congressman Bill Dickinson of Montgomery offered him a position \nas his chief of staff. In 1993, when Congressman Dickinson retired, \nClay remained in Washington as the chief of staff for Dickinson's \nsuccessor, Congressman Terry Everett.\n  After managing Congressman Everett's office for 10 years, Clay \ndecided to retire from public service in Washington and return to \nAlabama.\n  Clay always enjoyed working behind the scenes, outside the glare of \nthe political spotlights. His departure is a loss for the Second \nCongressional District and the State of Alabama. All who knew and \nworked with him will miss him.\n  On more than one occasion I have sought and received good advice from \nClay. During his years of service he has learned much. He never panics, \nand always thinks clearly and with compassion for those involved. He is \na strong leader, but one who leads by wisdom, thoughtfulness, insight \nand grace rather than threats or bluster. The people of Alabama have \nbenefited greatly from his leadership. I, as well as many other \ngovernment officials, have benefited greatly from his service. Clay has \nalways been a leader among Alabama's delegation staff. They have valued \nhis judgment, insight, and experience.\n  We will certainly miss Clay, but he has earned his retirement. As \nproof\n\n[[Page S1468]]\n\nthat his long tenure in Washington has not turned his head, I am \npleased to note that he has chosen to make his retirement home, back in \nAlabama, in beautiful Baldwin County. Clay, we thank you for your \nfriendship and service and wish you Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1468-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF PEG BRADLEY'S BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Peg \nBradley upon her fiftieth birthday. She is a woman with a kind heart, \ndiverse interests and great abilities. She is one of the most \nremarkable people with whom I served in State government. In a State as \nsmall as ours, her dedication and tenacity have become legendary. She \ntruly embodies the best of Delaware. I consider it a privilege to have \nknown her and an even greater privilege to have worked closely with her \non Delaware's education reforms in the decade of the 1990s.\n  Just 50 years ago, Peg was born in Kansas to O. Wayne and Wilma \nGordon. While her journey to Delaware took her many places in the years \npreceding it, when she arrived at the University of Delaware in the \nlate 1960s, she found her true home. With her diploma in hand, Peg \nembarked upon a career that would set the tone for education \ninnovations throughout the State of Delaware and across the Nation.\n  The proud mother of three children, Kirsten, Carrie and Cort, and the \ngrandmother to 4-year-old Xavier, Peg lives her life through the eyes \nof children.\n  While Peg learned and honed her craft teaching elementary school \nchildren, she really made her mark when she opened and became the first \nDirector of the Preschool at Concordia Lutheran Church. Then, in 1992, \nPeg ran for State Representative as a Democrat in the most Republican \nDistrict in the State of Delaware and won. During her 2 years in the \nState House, she sponsored legislation that dramatically expanded Head \nStart opportunities for Delaware youngsters and began drawing attention \nto the important role that the first few years of a child's life play \nin their ability to learn and go on to live productive lives.\n  Peg served as my education adviser during most of my 8 years as \nGovernor. She was instrumental in helping me work my education reform \nproposals through the legislature, through the education community, and \nthrough the public from their infancy to implementation. She worked \ntirelessly to ensure that the reforms we made reflected what was best \nfor Delaware's children. Today, Delaware has rigorous academic \nstandards, the ability to measure objectively student progress toward \nthose standards, and real accountability, in no small part because of \nPeg Bradley's stewardship and persistence. Part of her legacy is the \nconsistent improvement in academic performance at all grade levels in \nDelaware in core subjects like math, English, language arts and \nscience.\n  Together, along with the support of the legislature, the business \ncommunity, many parents and educators, we amassed a record of \ninnovative accomplishments, including unprecedented support for charter \nschools and public school choice; standards-based education, statewide \ntesting and accountability. She even persuaded me to support a public \nschool choice bill written by a certain State Senator named Rick Hauge. \nJust last week they celebrated their first wedding anniversary.\n  Peg helped me win battles that seemed daunting. In doing so, she won \nthe grudging respect of more than a handful of cynics along the way. \nMore than almost anyone else, Peg Bradley helped shape the legacy of my \nadministration and change the face of education in Delaware.\n  Peg was an invaluable advisor, mentor, and resource to me throughout \nthe last decade. She takes pride in her work and has made hundreds of \neducators and parents proud to work alongside of her. During the time \nthat I was chairman of the National Governors' Association, we focused \na good deal of our attention on raising student performance. Peg's \nassistance to me during that stressful time was invaluable and afforded \nher with an opportunity to play a significant role on a national stage.\n  Today, I rise both to celebrate this milestone moment in Peg's life \nand to shine a spotlight on her momentous commitment and countless \ncontributions to the community. She is living proof that a life filled \nwith good works is a good life indeed. I thank her for her friendship, \ncongratulate her on her first 50 years and wish her and her husband \nRick only the very best in the years that lie ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1468-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1468-S1469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHAMPIONS OF GOLF--THE FORD FAMILY\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to share with my \ncolleagues an article in Golf Journal about the Ford family from my \nhometown of Charleston, South Carolina. Since 1927, the Ford family has \nwon a number of golf tournaments including 10 Azalea Invitationals, 10 \nSouth Carolina or Carolina Amateur crowns, 20-some city titles and 50 \nclub championships. I am proud to recognize this talented family, and I \nask that this article be reprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                  [From Golf Journal, Jan.-Feb., 2003]\n\n                            Model Tee Fords\n\n                          (By Rich Skyzinski)\n\n       The Fords of Charleston, S.C., much like the Kennedys of \n     Massachusetts or the Baldwins of Hollywood, have a family \n     tradition. For nearly a century, one generation after another \n     has been reared by a philosophy handed down much like an old \n     family recipe. The motto on the family crest ought to read, \n     If you want to be good at something, play golf.\n       Role models have never been lacking. If any Ford \n     demonstrated a desire for golf, he or she didn't need to look \n     far for inspiration or instruction. Good golf genes have \n     blessed generations, dating most notably to the second of \n     five men named Frank Cordes Ford. Now 98, Frank Sr. (actually \n     the second FCF) was the most accomplished of the Fords, and \n     he can prove it. He can still rattle off a lot of the \n     stories, in rapid-fire fashion: the games with Bob Jones, \n     Harry (Lighthorse) Cooper, Henry Picard and Craig Wood; how \n     he won a dollar bill (signed and framed) from Horton Smith; \n     the day he one-upped the great Ben Hogan by hitting a 4-wood \n     to within eight inches of the hole after Hogan hit a 3-wood \n     shot to eight feet from virtually the same fairway location.\n       If ever a forebear set a standard for his progenies to \n     shoot at, it's Granddaddy (Frank Sr.). He made sure any \n     challenger was in it for the long haul. How else could you \n     top his record of seven South Carolina Amateur crowns (and \n     three runner-up finishes), four Azalea Invitational \n     victories, 11 Charleston City titles and 18 Country Club of \n     Charleston championships?\n       ``The Ford family is known, certainly in the city and \n     probably around the state, because of golf,'' says Bert \n     Atkinson, 1991 U.S. Mid-Amateur runner-up and a C.C. of \n     Charleston member. ``I think it's probably always been that \n     way.''\n       If you are a Charleston golfer, at one time or another, a \n     Ford has beaten you. Since 1927, family members have won 10 \n     Azaleas, 10 South Carolina or Carolinas Ams, 20-some city \n     titles and 50 club championships, give or take a few. An \n     extra room would be needed for all the junior, mid-amateur \n     and team trophies.\n       How did this all start? Tommy Ford, one of Granddaddy's \n     three sons, claims it was not planned.\n       ``No family ever gets together and says, `Here is what \n     we're going to do,' '' says the 58-year-old. ``It comes to \n     you; you deal with it. If you become good, you try to live up \n     to it. When you play well, the headlines start to reinforce \n     this idea that you're living up to your dad's records. And \n     all of a sudden you are, not that you ever tried. But you're \n     fulfilling a pattern that started 60 years ago.''\n       Granddaddy speaks from the other side of the equation. ``I \n     think they saw the fun I got out of golf,'' he allows, ``and \n     maybe some of them wanted to play because they thought it \n     would be fun. Most of them worked pretty hard at it.''\n       It isn't ``a guy thing,'' either. Granddaddy's mother, Anne \n     (Sissie) Ford, who moved to Charleston following her \n     husband's death in 1918, won the C.C. of Charleston Women's \n     championship in 1927. A year later, she lost in the final to \n     her daughter, Anne Ford Melton.\n       And family members also are quick to credit Granddaddy's \n     wife, Betsy. She was a caring, nurturing mentor who made the \n     game what it should be for kids: fun. She also was an \n     accomplished player, collecting a half-dozen club \n     championships and two city titles.\n       Betsy, who died in 1998, and her husband played different \n     roles in advancing the family tradition. She had a deep love \n     for the game and passed it down to scores of youngsters. She \n     helped her three sons and any grandchildren or great-\n     grandchildren who wanted to play the game and was involved \n     in many club and city youth programs. Once a youngster \n     became proficient enough to break 80, Granddaddy would \n     begin to share his passion and try to light their \n     competitive fires.\n       ``I don't remember any pressure or push, other than the \n     brilliance of a mother, who believed that we should know a \n     little about the game at the age we were,'' Tommy says.\n\n[[Page S1469]]\n\n     ``There was a nudge towards lessons during the summer, but it \n     was also, `Go hunting. Do whatever you want to do' from \n     her.''\n       Sarah (Mahony) Ford Rijswijk, Frank Jr.'s widow, adds, \n     ``She said, ``If you marry into the Ford family, dear, you'd \n     better play golf.' . . . I thought they were a little nuts \n     because I played tennis. But I took up golf and Betsy was the \n     one who led me into the game. She was the most wonderful \n     teacher. She had a beautiful swing, classic, and was one of \n     the few people I know who was really interested in your game, \n     everybody's game. She really helped everybody. She was the \n     consummate golfer.''\n       Betsy's favorite classroom was the par-3 11th hole at the \n     Country Club of Charleston. The hole is a classic Seth Raynor \n     design with the green elevated some 10 or 12 feet and sharp \n     drop-offs on each side. Betsy, a.k.a. Granny, would take a \n     youngster to the bottom of the slope in front of the green \n     and show them how to chip with a 7-iron. They would practice \n     that shot over and over until the youngster could bump a shot \n     into the hillside with an artisan's touch.\n       It's been more than 40 years since Frank III was tutored \n     there by his grandmother but, he says, ``I remember that to \n     this day. She taught me to chip, and I've never chipped with \n     a wedge or a sand wedge like so many guys do. I'm going to \n     grab my 7-iron because that's what she taught me.''\n       Even if a youngster had only a passing interest in the \n     game, Betsy made her mark. Billy Ford, her middle son, \n     recalls going out for a round with his son, Billy Jr., whom \n     he thought was a novice, but evoked a double take with his \n     confident practice swing on the first tee.\n       ``Where'd you learn that?'' his father asked.\n       ``Granny,'' he replied proudly. ``Granny taught me.''\n       Betsy rarely commented on any of the youngsters' successes, \n     but they could sense her pride when they did well.\n       ``She could instill desire, which I think is a hard thing \n     to do,'' says Sarah. ``I won my first club championship and I \n     beat her, and I think she was happier about it than I was.''\n       Granddaddy himself was introduced to the game at age 15, by \n     his mother and an uncle who lived in Canada. But he learned \n     swing basics from a group of African-American caddies in \n     Summerville, S.C. ``They used to say, `This is how you hold \n     the club. This is the way you stand,' '' he recalls.\n       He developed a tendency to sway during his backswing \n     instead of pivoting, but there was little anyone could do to \n     change this; after all, the swing worked for him. There was a \n     time when the club's head professional was Henry Picard, \n     later a Masters and PGA Championship winner. Picard had what \n     was considered one of the finest swings in the game, but not \n     even he could convince Granddaddy.\n       ``He said, `I'm going to get you out of this swaying,' '' \n     he remembers. ``I said, `Now Henry, listen. Don't try to give \n     me any lessons because you can do whatever you want, but I'm \n     not going to change my swing.''\n       ``He said, `Okay,' and never again told me how to do it.''\n       Granddaddy carried that insistence with him to the cement \n     and concrete business. Tommy tells a story of his dad trying \n     to sell a prospective customer cement at 20 cents a bag, only \n     to be told, ``I don't need any cement.'' Ford lowered the \n     price to 15 cents a bag and, receiving the same reply, went \n     to 10 cents and then to a nickel.\n       ``The customer finally said he couldn't afford not to buy \n     it at that price and Dad got a customer for life,'' Tommy \n     concludes. ``He was the same way in golf as in business. He \n     wanted to make every sale, and he wanted to win every time he \n     stepped onto the golf course.''\n       Granddaddy confined most of his playing to a local and \n     regional level because he had a business to run. He qualified \n     for the only U.S. Amateur he entered, in 1934 at The Country \n     Club in Brookline, Mass., losing in the third round. He \n     played until he was 90, then gave away his clubs one day \n     after he shot 45 for nine holes. Atkinson, who played with \n     him that day, remembers the exchange afterward.\n       ``I said, `That's pretty good playing, Mr. Ford.''' \n     Atkinson says. ``He put his arm around me and said, `Yeah, \n     but if I was 30 years younger I would have beaten you guys \n     butt good.'''\n       None of Granddaddy's three sons were as passionate about \n     the game as their father. Tommy blossomed into an \n     accomplished player later in life, with seven club \n     championships and a handful of senior titles. Billy was a \n     good junior player and captain of the University of North \n     Carolina golf team in 1953, but hasn't competed much since. \n     Frank Jr., who died at age 44 in a 1974 Eastern Airlines \n     plane crash, played little competitive golf.\n       If the old man's competitive fires were passed down, most \n     of them found their way to Frank III, who has qualified for \n     nearly a dozen U.S. Amateurs and four U.S. Mid-Amateurs, and \n     his son, Cordes (Frank Cordes Ford IV), a 26-year-old law \n     student at the University of South Carolina with his own \n     collection of trophies. In 1996, Cordes completed a rare \n     double when he won the Carolinas Amateur a week after Frank \n     III took the state am. ``They're the two that have the desire \n     to go out there,'' says Sarah, ``They want to win.''\n       By contrast, Billy says, ``I'm not trying to win anything \n     anymore, just have a nice golf day.''\n       Which isn't to say the patriarch's presence has not been \n     felt. Billy once was about to close out a match at Biltmore \n     Forest Country Club in Asheville, N.C., when Granddaddy came \n     up to him, put his arm around the teenager and said, ``Son, \n     this is where I won my war bond.''\n       ``Everything's fine. I've got 20 feet for birdie, but I got \n     it back to here,'' says Billy, imitating a putting stroke, \n     ``and just locked; couldn't move it. It exploded in my hand, \n     went past the hole about 15 feet. I three-putted that, snap-\n     hooked it on 16, hit a limb coming out of the woods on 17. \n     Before I knew it, I went from 5 up with five to play to 1 up \n     with one to play. It's funny now, but I was in tears then.''\n       Because of the family's countless successes, there's an \n     assumption throughout the Carolinas that Fords should be \n     accomplished players simply because of their last name.\n       ``I felt like I was supposed to play better than whatever I \n     did,'' says Billy. ``There was certain pressure on me, \n     sure.''\n       Tommy, who's a decade younger than his brother, adds: \n     ``Your identity is golf, because you grew up seeing golf and \n     that's what you gravitated to. But I maintain you do the best \n     you can for your own expectations, not necessarily for this \n     family tradition thing. I never wanted to win tournaments to \n     extend my father's streak.''\n       Tommy is said to have the best swing in the family. People \n     in Charleston often call him ``sweet-swingin' Tommy Ford. ''\n       ``The `sweet-swingin' does not always live up to people's \n     expectations,'' he says. ``They know I'm Frank Ford's son so \n     they think I am good. They remember what you've accomplished. \n     You carry that expectation with you more so because of Daddy, \n     Billy, Frank--the trickle-down effect of the background of \n     winning. People view us as winners because that's what they \n     remember Daddy doing, Frank doing, Billy doing. They expect \n     us to be hard to beat. That's a little bit difficult \n     sometimes.''\n       Frank III's sister, Anne Ford Strickland, lived near \n     Winston-Salem, N.C., for years and says the difference in the \n     pressure she felt was palpable. ``I never felt anything up \n     there,'' she insists. ``Part of it may have been because I \n     had my married name. people didn't know me by Ford.''\n       The Fords have never called attention to their exploits. \n     Sometimes, even family members are unaware of them. Anne \n     played in a C.C. of Charleston girls' program with Beth \n     Daniel, who went on to become an LPGA Hall of Famer and a \n     favorite of Anne's son David. Looking through Anne's \n     scrapbooks, David came upon a newspaper clipping about his \n     mom's victory over Daniel in a junior club championship in \n     the mid-1960s.\n       ``You beat Beth Daniel?'' he asked, eyes widening.\n       What do you expect? She is a Ford.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1469-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1469-S1470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-711.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California relative to airport security workers; to \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 39\n\n       Whereas, The Aviation and Transportation Security Act \n     (Public Law 107-71) established the Transportation Security \n     Administration within the Department of Transportation, to be \n     administered by the Under Secretary of Transportation for \n     Security; and\n       Whereas, Under the act, the Under Secretary is responsible \n     for day-to-day security screening operations for passenger \n     air transportation, including the screening of passenger \n     baggage; and\n       Whereas, Under the act, the Under Secretary is responsible \n     for developing standards for the hiring, training, testing, \n     and retention of security screening personnel; and\n       Whereas, Under the act, the qualification standards require \n     that security screeners be citizens of the United States; and\n       Whereas, The Under Secretary assumed responsibility for \n     airport security on February 19, 2002, and all security \n     screening personnel that are not United States citizens will \n     be terminated by November 19, 2002; and\n       Whereas, A large percentage of security screening personnel \n     at several airports in California are not United States \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, In the bay area alone, approximately 1,200 \n     security screeners, most of whom are of Filipino descent, \n     will lose their jobs as a result of the requirement that \n     security screeners must be United States citizens, with no \n     demonstrable showing that this will improve safety or \n     security; and\n       Whereas, The vast majority of security screeners that are \n     not citizens of the United States are legal immigrants from \n     nations that have long been friends or allies of the United \n     States and their countries having fought alongside our \n     soldiers during wartime; and\n       Whereas, The vast majority of security screeners that are \n     not citizens of the United States have either applied for \n     citizenship or are prevented from applying for citizenship as \n     a result of punitive immigration policies; and\n       Whereas, Immigrant security screeners are not to blame for \n     the September 11, 2001, disaster, and punitive action against \n     those immigrants who are not a security risk creates and \n     inflames ill feelings for this country abroad: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the President and the Congress of the \n     United States to suspend or eliminate the requirement that \n     security screeners be citizens of the United States, and \n     instead provide that those individuals must meet the same \n     immigration requirements as persons who serve in the National \n     Guard; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the President and the Congress should act to \n     ensure that any legal immigrant that has applied for \n     citizenship should be allowed to keep his or her security \n     screening job, absent evidence showing that they are a \n     security or criminal risk; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-13. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California relative to federal proposal to devolve \n     the administration of the unemployment insurance system; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 42\n\n       Whereas, Unemployment insurance has been the bedrock of the \n     social safety net for workers who have been laid off and are \n     seeking jobs and is the first line of defense during economic \n     downturns; and\n       Whereas, Unemployment insurance not only provides vital \n     income support to laid off workers, but also stabilizes the \n     local, state, and national economies because the benefits \n     workers receive are invested back into the community; and\n       Whereas, President Bush's proposal would destroy the \n     federal-state partnership on which the unemployment insurance \n     system is founded and would eliminate the historic role of \n     the federal government in both ensuring that administrative \n     financing keeps pace with ever-changing workload needs and \n     assuring that the program is implemented consistently across \n     the country; and\n       Whereas, Although the administration proposes to provide \n     much-needed additional ``Reed Act'' funding for state \n     unemployment programs, under the proposal states would \n     receive no federal aid to fund the administrative costs of \n     the unemployment insurance system after 2006; and\n       Whereas, President Bush's proposal would reduce federal \n     administrative payments that will result from the reduction \n     in the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) flat tax from $56 \n     per worker per year to $14 per year; and\n       Whereas, This proposal would force California to raise \n     taxes or find other state general funds to administer the \n     unemployment insurance program; and\n       Whereas, President Bush's proposal would jeopardize the \n     federal government's ability to help our state respond to \n     economic downturns by drastically reducing the funding now \n     dedicated to the federal unemployment trust funds; and\n       Whereas, The federal proposal would do nothing to help \n     states cope with the challenges of expanding and modernizing \n     their unemployment insurance systems, including ensuring that \n     more low-wage workers are covered when they become \n     unemployed; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California urges the President and Congress of the United \n     States to abandon the federal proposal to devolve the \n     administration of the unemployment insurance system. The \n     Legislature also urges the President and Congress of the \n     United States to instead work with the state to ensure that \n     the state receives a greater level of workload-based federal \n     appropriations for administrative financing, and to provide \n     new dedicated federal funding to help the state cover the \n     workers who are now having the most difficulty collecting \n     unemployment benefits; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit a \n     copy of this resolution to the President of the United States \n     and to each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-14. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California relative to veterans; to the committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 50\n\n       Whereas, The United States presently has a population of \n     over 25 million veterans from its previous wars. The majority \n     of that veteran population is from World War II and the \n     Korean War; and\n       Whereas, The World War II and Korean War veteran population \n     is presently over 70 years of age, and that group is passing \n     away at the rate of 1,000 veterans per day; and\n       Whereas, The United States government has acknowledged its \n     responsibility to provide medical care or compensation for \n     medical problems, as well as other benefits, to those \n     veterans who served their country in time of war; and\n       Whereas, The United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     is charged with administering the federal benefits program \n     for veterans; and\n       Whereas, When a veteran passes away with a claim pending \n     against the Department of Veterans Affairs, the claim \n     essentially ends with the veteran's passing regardless of how \n     long the claim had been pending; and\n       Whereas, Dying while waiting is unacceptable for American \n     veterans; and\n       Whereas, There presently exists a backlog of over 601,000 \n     claims submitted by veterans. This backlog has persisted for \n     several years, with some claims outstanding for one year or \n     more; and\n       Whereas, A significant portion of these claims involve \n     World War II and Korean War veterans, and despite determined \n     efforts by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     to eliminate this backlog, the backlog continues; and\n       Whereas, There exists a trained group of individuals known \n     as county veterans service officers located in 37 of the 50 \n     states, representing 700 counties and a workforce of over \n     2,400 full-time local government employees; and\n       Whereas, These county veterans service officers were \n     established in 1945 after World War II for the purpose of \n     helping returning veterans reenter civilian life, and have \n     continued to do so for all veterans of all wars since then; \n     and\n       Whereas, These county veterans service officers are highly \n     trained individuals who have continued to provide assistance \n     to all veterans for over 50 years and are already familiar \n     with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs claims \n     policies and procedures; and\n       Whereas, For example, in California, county veterans \n     service officers annually assist California's veterans obtain \n     monetary benefits in excess of $150 million by assisting \n     these veterans in filing over 50,000 claims annually with the \n     United States Department of Veterans Affairs; and\n       Whereas, This claims processing backlog needs to be \n     urgently reduced while our World War II and Korean War \n     veterans are still with us; and\n       Whereas, The United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     could enter into a partnership with state and local \n     governments to utilize these highly trained county veterans \n     service officers to eliminate the present claims processing \n     backlog, by expanding the county veterans service officers' \n     role; and\n       Whereas, This would be a cost-effective way of reducing the \n     claims processing backlog by eliminating the need for a \n     substantial increase in federal employees; and\n       Whereas, These county veterans service officers, as \n     represented by the California Association of County Veterans \n     Service Officers and the National Association of County \n     Veterans Service Officers, have offered to assist the United \n     States Department of Veterans Affairs in exchange for block \n     grants to the various states based upon each state's veteran \n     population to compensate county veterans service officers for \n     their expanded role: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S1473]]\n\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California urges the Congress of the United States and the \n     President to support and enact legislation that would \n     establish a federal/state partnership to use the knowledge \n     and skills of the local county veterans service officers to \n     assist the United States Department of Veterans Affairs in \n     eliminating the veterans claims processing backlog in order \n     that America's veterans can take advantage of the benefits \n     that the United States has authorized for them for their \n     faithful and loyal service to a grateful nation; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-15. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California relative to a national memorial; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 52\n\n       Whereas, On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 \n     while en route to San Francisco with 40 passengers and crew \n     aboard was hijacked by terrorists; and\n       Whereas, The passengers and crew on the flight, \n     understanding that the intention of the hijackers was to fly \n     the plane into a target in the nation's Capitol, consulted \n     with each other and their families about what action to take; \n     and\n       Whereas, The passengers moved to stop this heinous act of \n     terrorism, even at the cost of their lives, in an act of \n     extraordinary bravery and self-sacrifice that resulted in the \n     fatal crash of Flight 93 in Somerset County, Pennsylvania; \n     and\n       Whereas, The passengers and crew, some of whom were \n     California residents, will forever be remembered and are \n     memorialized in this resolution. The crew included: Jason \n     Dahl, Leroy Homer, Jr., Lorraine G. Bay, Sandra W. Bradshaw, \n     Wanda A. Green, Ceecee Lyles, and Deborah Ann Jacobs Welsh. \n     The passengers included: Christian Adams, Todd Beamer, Alan \n     Beaven, Mark Bingham, Deora Bodley, Marion Britton, Thomas E. \n     Burnett, Jr., William Cashman, Georgine Rose Corrigan, \n     Patricia Cushing, Joseph Deluca, Patrick ``Joe'' Driscoll, \n     Edward Porter Felt, Jane C.

The legislation reads, in part, ``the \n     crash site is a profound symbol of American patriotism and \n     spontaneous leadership of citizen-heroes''; and\n       Whereas, The designated National Memorial will honor the \n     heroism of the Californians who were among the passengers and \n     crew, demonstrating our commitment to the families, friends, \n     neighbors, and colleagues of the victims that the legacy of \n     their loved ones will endure for generations; and\n       Whereas, The National memorial will remind future \n     generations of the unmatched courage of those aboard Flight \n     93 and inspire the nation to work for a world at peace and \n     free of terrorism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California requests the Congress and President of the United \n     States to enact H.R. 3917 to designate a National Memorial at \n     the crash site of Flight 93 in Somerset County, Pennsylvania \n     to pay tribute to and honor the true heroes of this nation; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved. That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-16. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California relative to the Temporary Assistance for \n     Needy Families (TANF) program; to the Committee on Finance.\n       Whereas, The United States Congress must reauthorize the \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program by \n     October 1, 2002; and\n       Whereas, States are achieving success under TANF because \n     states have the flexibility to design appropriate, effective \n     programs that move people into work and support vulnerable \n     children. Under TANF, California has decreased families' \n     dependence on welfare, increased work rates and wages, and \n     improved the well-being of children; and\n       Whereas, Welfare reauthorization should help states like \n     California build on their unprecedented success at moving \n     people off welfare; and\n       Whereas, Devolution was a core principle in welfare reform. \n     The TANF block grant allows each state to design the most \n     effective and appropriate programs for moving families from \n     welfare to work. Under TANF, California welfare recipients \n     are working more hours than ever before and California has \n     nearly tripled the number of welfare recipients who are \n     working; and\n       Whereas, The flexibility offered in current federal law has \n     permitted California to make the well-being of children its \n     highest priority. Under current federal law, California \n     ensures that poor children have a basic level of subsistence, \n     regardless of their parents' immigration status or ability to \n     meet participation requirements; and\n       Whereas, Current federal law supports the fact that \n     different strategies are needed for families facing different \n     barriers to work. Today, California's counties develop \n     welfare-to-work plans, work program, and participation \n     requirements that are tailored to each family's unique \n     circumstances. Current federal law permits California's \n     counties to develop programs that are sensitive to state and \n     country labor markets and employment rates; and\n       Whereas, Since 1997, when the TANF program was created, the \n     value of the TANF block grant has significantly diminished \n     due to inflation. If TANF funding continues at current \n     levels, the inflation-adjusted value of the block grant in \n     2007 would be approximately 22 percent less than its original \n     value in 1997; and\n       Whereas, California is using all of its TANF block grant, \n     yet faces a projected shortfall in its TANF program. At the \n     same time, California faces a budget deficit of $24 billion, \n     increasing the importance of adequate federal funding; and\n       Whereas, Child care is central to states' efforts to move \n     families into work. Under TANF, states have helped many \n     parents find and keep jobs, secure child care, and overcome \n     personal barriers to work. As work participation requirements \n     rise, so must state resources to meet families' corresponding \n     child care needs; and\n       Whereas, Despite states' success in moving many families \n     off welfare, many families still on aid have numerous and \n     complex barriers to joining the workforce. States want to \n     move these families into work as quickly as possible, but \n     recognize that families with difficulties, such as domestic \n     violence, learning disabilities, and mental illness, must \n     receive supportive services to address these barriers to \n     work; and\n       Whereas, California is currently being penalized by the \n     federal government for failure to implement a statewide \n     automated child support system due to system failure on the \n     part of the project's original vendor. California has paid \n     nearly $300 million in penalties from the state's General \n     Fund and, upon completion of the statewide automation system, \n     will pay total penalties of approximately $1.3 billion. \n     California has entered into a corrective action plan with the \n     United States Department of Health and Human Services and is \n     in full compliance with the plan; and\n       Whereas, Federal child support automation penalties have \n     served the important purpose of capturing the attention of \n     California and have resulted in significant restructuring to \n     establish a reliable approach to securing a statewide \n     automated child support system; and\n       Whereas, Governor Davis and the California Legislature have \n     made a strong commitment to improving the state's child \n     support program that has resulted in historically high levels \n     of child support collections: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That to build on the success of welfare \n     reform, in reauthorization of the TANF program, the \n     California Legislature urges federal policymakers to \n     maintain state flexibility to spend TANF funds. Given \n     states' demonstrated success using this flexibility, this \n     central premise of welfare reform should not be \n     compromised in welfare reauthorization; and be it further\n       Resolved, In TANF reauthorization, the California \n     Legislature urges federal policymakers to maintain state \n     flexibility to provide a safety net to vulnerable children; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, In TANF reauthorization, the California \n     Legislature urges federal policymakers to maintain state \n     flexibility to design the most effective ways to move people \n     into work. State flexibility in designing work programs \n     should not be compromised in welfare reauthorization; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, In TANF reauthorization, the California \n     Legislature urges federal policymakers to adjust the TANF \n     block grant for inflation. Freezing the TANF block grant at \n     current levels is not adequate to maintain even current \n     program levels because inflation has eroded the value of the \n     block grants. Welfare reauthorization is an opportunity for \n     the federal government to address this funding inadequacy; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, In TANF reauthorization, the California \n     Legislature urges federal policymakers to recognize states' \n     needs to provide ongoing supportive service. Welfare \n     reauthorization should help states provide child care and \n     supportive services, as they are substantial defenses in \n     permanently keeping families off welfare; and be it further\n       Resolved, In TANF reauthorization, the California \n     Legislature urges federal policymakers to base the year on \n     which the federal child support automation penalties are \n     assessed to the 1997-98 fiscal year, the year prior to \n     penalties first being imposed. This\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n\n     will ensure that states do not incur additional penalties \n     because of increased investments in the administration of \n     their child support programs; and be it further\n       Resolved, In TANF reauthorization, the California \n     Legislature urges federal policymakers to give states the \n     option to reinvest federal child support automation penalties \n     back into their child support programs and automation \n     efforts. This will ensure that states continue to concentrate \n     on the deficiencies that contribute to automation \n     implementation delays and subsequent penalties; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, In TANF reauthorization, the California \n     Legislature urges federal policymakers to simplify the child \n     support distribution rules to allow more money to reach \n     families while also reducing California's system procurement \n     cost and assisting in an earlier completion of the stateside \n     automated system.\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-17.

A resolution adopted by the City of Buffalo, state \n     of New York relative to Buffalo's CDGB allocation; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                           Resolution No. 184\n\n       Whereas, HUD Assistant Secretary Roy Bernardi has informed \n     Mayor Masiello that the City of Buffalo will be losing \n     approximately $1.825 million in CDBG funding in its 2003 \n     allocation (#11, CCP 10/15/02-``HUD CDBG Fiscal Year 2003 \n     Allocation);\n       Whereas, According to Mr. Bernardi, this funding cut is \n     mandated by HUD's funding formula, which is based on the 2000 \n     census data of poverty, housing overcrowding and pre 1940 \n     housing; and\n       Whereas, According to HUD's ``CDBG Program Description'', \n     CDBG funds may be used to ``benefit persons of law and \n     moderate income, aid in the prevention or elimination of \n     slums or blight, or meet other community development needs of \n     particular urgency'';\n       Whereas, It defies logic and fact that the City of Buffalo \n     should see a decrease in funding, given its ongoing devotion \n     in the areas of poverty and housing; and\n       Whereas, As in other urban areas throughout the country, it \n     is very likely that Buffalo suffered an undercount of both \n     its population and level of poverty in the 2000 census; and\n       Whereas, Buffalo's need for CDBG funding exists in greater \n     measure that ever before, and a cut at this time would be \n     particularly egregious given the City's projected deficit of \n     $228 million for fiscal year 2003/04; and\n       Whereas, For the sake of Buffalo's impoverished \n     communities, where hope is running short, it is imperative \n     that our Congressional delegates work effectively and \n     urgently to restore Buffalo's CDBG funding cut;\n       Now, therefore, Be It Resolved That:\n       This Common Council requests the WNY Congressional \n     delegation to insure that the City of Buffalo's CDBG \n     allocation for 2003 is restored to at least the 2002 level, \n     whether by appealing flaws in the formula that mask Buffalo's \n     need, or by building an alliance to increase total CDBG \n     funding nationwide; and\n       Now, Therefore, Be It Further Resolved That:\n       This Common Council requests the WNY Congressional \n     delegation members to file a response to this request with \n     the Council\n     c/o the City Clerk, 1308 City Hall, Buffalo, NY 14202, as \n     soon as possible, outlining any ways in which City officials \n     and others can support their strategy to restore CDBG \n     funding; and\n       Be It Finally Resolved That:\n       The City Clerk be directed to send certified copies of this \n     resolution to Congress members Slaughter, Quinn, and LaFalce, \n     Senator Schumer and Clinton, the Clerk of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House, HUD Secretary Martinez and President \n     Bush.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-27. A resolution adopted by the Michigan State Senate \n     relative to the Hunting Heritage Protection Act; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 281\n\n       Whereas, Hunting is an activity that is enjoyed by millions \n     of people across Michigan and our entire country. Unlike some \n     recreational pursuits, however, hunting provides a direct \n     link to the outdoors heritage of our nation and is a sport \n     that is closely tied to the quality of our natural resources. \n     The benefits of hunting extend far beyond economic \n     considerations. This reality is especially appreciated by the \n     people of Michigan; and\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\n       Whereas, Recreational hunting continues to be an important \n     way people relate to the outdoors, even in our modern \n     society. Hunters and hunting organizations are among the most \n     dedicated supporters of sound wildlife management and \n     conservation practices. Fees from licenses contribute to \n     programs that maintain unique resources for future \n     generations; and\n       Whereas, In an effort to perpetuate our country's hunting \n     heritage, Congress has been considering legislation that \n     would take steps to ensure that hunting remains a key part of \n     wildlife management on federal lands. This legislation, the \n     Hunting Heritage Protection Act, provides that federal lands \n     will be open to hunting, with specific exceptions. Federal \n     agencies with authority on public lands are to support and \n     enhance hunting within applicable laws and regulations. The \n     legislation includes provisions to ensure that there is no \n     net loss of land available for hunting as future land \n     decisions are made; and\n       Whereas, Michigan has a long history of respect for the \n     role that sound wildlife management can play in preserving \n     unique recreational resources. Our citizens have strongly \n     supported moves to protect our woods, waters, and wildlife. \n     Federal legislation to ensure that hunting remains part of \n     our national heritage reflects the will of our state: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact the Hunting Heritage Protection \n     Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-28. A resolution adopted by the Michigan State Senate \n     relative to funding for efforts to prevent the invasion of \n     the Asian carp into the Great Lakes; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 282\n\n       Whereas, Aquatic species from outside the Great Lakes that \n     have become established here have significantly altered the \n     ecology of this treasured freshwater resource. The lamprey, \n     zebra mussel, and goby are the best known of these exotic \n     invaders. The costs, from municipalities that have to \n     maintain water systems to those who make their living on the \n     lakes through recreation or other businesses, represent an \n     enormous economic drain. Most importantly, these species can \n     seriously upset the delicate balance of nature in ways we may \n     not fully understand for decades; and\n       Whereas, Another invasion species is close to entering the \n     Great Lakes. The Asian carp, a large, voracious fish imported \n     to the Mississippi Valley region to clean certain vegetation \n     and snails from commercial fish farming operations, has been \n     making its way up the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal and is \n     apparently getting close to Lake Michigan. Offices in the \n     Great Lakes area and from the International Joint Commission \n     have called for Congress to support measures to keep this \n     threat out of the Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, One of the strategies proposed to prevent the \n     Asian carp from entering Lake Michigan is an electric \n     dispersal barrier near Chicago. Congress has been considering \n     appropriations that would provide for the United States Corps \n     of Engineers to implement the dispersal barrier project. \n     Delays in this effort jeopardize further the long-term health \n     of the Great Lakes; Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to provide funding for efforts to prevent \n     the invasion of the Asian carp into the Great Lakes; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and member of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-29.

The recitals and findings contained in the \n     Preamble to this Resolution are adopted by reference and \n     incorporated as if fully set forth in this Section.\n       Section 2. The United States government and any other \n     nations or authorities responsible for the status and \n     treatment of women are strongly urged to review the Position \n     Statement/Paper of the City of Miami Commission on the Status \n     of Women which condemns the treatment of women and children \n     in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n       Section 3. The City Clerk is directed to transmit a copy of \n     this Resolution to President George W. Bush, Vice-President \n     Richard B. Cheney, Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert, \n     Senators Bob Graham and Bill Nelson, all members of the \n     United States House of Representatives for Miami-Dade County, \n     the United States Department of State, the United States \n     Department of Justice, the United Nations High Commissioner, \n     and all Consulate Generals based in the City of Miami and \n     Miami-Dade County.\n       Section 4. This Resolution shall become effective \n     immediately upon its adoption and signature of the Mayor.\n\n    City of Miami Commission on the Status of Women Position Paper \n   Condemning the Treatment of Women and Children in Afghanistan and \n                                Pakistan\n\n       The abuse of women in Afghanistan and Pakistan and other \n     countries under the leadership of fundamentalist regimes has \n     been documented for several years, particularly since the \n     take-over of Afghanistan by the Taliban.\n       Prior to the takeover by the Taliban in 1996, women \n     throughout Afghanistan enjoyed some degree of freedom. The \n     Taliban institutionalized the sort of discrimination the \n     entire world has now soundly condemned. Women comprised some \n     70% of school teachers, 50% of civilian workers, and 40% of \n     doctors in Kabul.\n       Women have been banished to a bare existence, denied most \n     schooling, adequate medical care, and any means to support \n     themselves. It is estimated that the illiteracy rate among \n     women is now 90%. Many women and children have died seeking \n     medical care of any sort. It is also estimated by \n     international organizations that there exist some 40,000 \n     widows in Afghanistan. Though exempt from some of the edicts \n     of the past government, they have been left with few means to \n     support and feed themselves and their children.\n       Women and their male supporters have been publicly beaten \n     and frequently killed by the ``Religious Police'' in their \n     attempts to enforce their version of the law.\n       Many women have continued to pursue education and medicine \n     in secret, teaching in secret home schools, and doctors have \n     had to practice medicine under extreme restrictions as to \n     their dress and the patients they may treat.\n       A recent article in the Miami Herald declared that in spite \n     of the ``loya jirga'' (or ``grand council'' that was in \n     progress in Afghanistan to choose the country's current and \n     future leaders, in practice, women who speak out and fail to \n     wear the traditional clothing mandated in the past, are still \n     prime targets of the local warlords and their followers and \n     are thus unable to fully participate in the rebuilding \n     process. Recently, a relief agency trucking supplies into the \n     mountains was stopped and a female relief worker raped by the \n     ``soldiers.'' Many of the warlords who control the areas of \n     worst abuse are the same warlords who are participating in \n     the ``loya jirga'' and have obtained positions of authority \n     in the new government. Women who are working for progress and \n     healing are subject to retribution at all levels.\n       In Pakistan and India, women have also historically been \n     subject to repression and laws which treat them as less than \n     property.\n       1. The United States government must come out even more \n     strongly in support of women and children in Afghanistan and \n     Pakistan and the Non-Governmental Organizations that strive \n     to support them.\n       2. In spite of the passage of the Afghanistan Women and \n     Children Relief Act of 2001 by Congress, more funding and \n     more support must be forthcoming. The United States was the \n     driving force behind the liberation of the countries in \n     question from extremist rule, and must be the leading force \n     assisting in the remediation of these atrocities.\n       3. The governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan should be \n     encouraged to clearly and publicly condemn all acts of \n     violence against women. They should develop and implement \n     policies and disseminate materials to promote women's safety \n     in the community and in detention.\n       4. The governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan should \n     prohibit all acts of violence against women and establish \n     legal protection. They should review existing laws such as \n     the ``Hudood Ordinance'' (which criminalizes extra-marital \n     sex, including adultery, fornication and rape outside of a \n     valid marriage) and add additional protections and penalties.\n       5. The governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan must \n     investigate all allegations of violence against women and \n     prosecute and punish those found to be responsible.\n       6. In Afghanistan, women must be reintroduced into open \n     society with all the protections we in the West enjoy. Women \n     doctors must be allowed to go back to work. Women teachers \n     must be allowed to teach and schools must be allowed past the \n     8th grade.\n       7. Women must be made equal citizens as far as enlightened \n     religious practice allows. Prior regimes in Afghanistan \n     allowed women great latitude in society. That must be \n     restored.\n       8. The United States must fully support all United Nations \n     efforts to end all forms of discrimination against women, and \n     monitor these efforts on an ongoing basis and report to the \n     people of the United States on progress achieved.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-32. A resolution adopted by the City of Belvedere State \n     of New Jersey relative to supporting Israel in the campaign \n     against terrorism; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the United States of America was struck by suicide \n     terrorists on September 11, 2001, in attacks that killed \n     thousands of U.S. citizens, destroyed the World Trade Center \n     in New York City, damaged the Pentagon, and purposefully \n     incinerated four commercial aircraft by turning those planes \n     into suicide missiles; and\n       Whereas, the government of the United States and the \n     military of this country are currently involved in an \n     international and domestic effort of historic proportions to \n     curb terrorism against this country and assist our friends \n     and allies who are engaged in similar efforts; and\n       Whereas, the State of Israel, the closest ally of the \n     United States in the Mideast and the only democratic nation \n     in that region, has experienced a brutal spate of suicide \n     terrorist attacks against civilizations in the last year by \n     groups sponsored or given safe harbor by the Palestinian \n     Authority and its Chairman, Yasser Arafat, and substantially \n     assisted by our nations in the region such as Iraq and Iran; \n     and\n       Whereas, an attack against the civilian population by \n     terrorists of one country is an attack on civilizations in \n     all countries and the increased use of suicide bombers is a \n     new form of terrorism that threatens civilians everywhere; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Warren County Board of Chosen Freeholders \n     laments the tragic loss of life experience by the Israeli \n     people during the recent hostilities in the Mideast: Now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Warren County Board of Chosen Freeholders:\n       That the Warren County Board of Chosen Freeholders on \n     behalf of the citizens of Warren County stands behind those \n     efforts of our President that support the government and \n     people of Israel in this time of crisis in the Mideast.\n       That the Warren County Board of Chosen Freeholders on \n     behalf of the citizens of Warren County supports the State of \n     Israel and\n\n[[Page S1479]]\n\n     her citizens in the campaign against terror and in the effort \n     to root out the terrorist infrastructure currently protected \n     by and encouraged by the Palestinian Authority and other \n     nations in the region still at war with the State of Israel.\n       That the Warren County Board of Chosen Freeholders on \n     behalf of the citizens of Warren County call upon all Arab \n     nations committed to and desirous of peace to take action by: \n     abstaining from monetarily rewarding attacks on innocent \n     citizens; encouraging accountability in the peace process by \n     facilitating the establishment of democratic institutions of \n     government in the Palestinian Authority to insure enforcement \n     of peace if and when it is brokered; halting the use of state \n     media and state education systems to fomet religious hatred \n     and anti-Semitism; and encouraging the Palestian Authority to \n     place in leadership people capable and willing to negotiate \n     and consummate a permanent peace accord.\n       That the Warren County Board of Chosen Freeholders on \n     behald of the citizens of Warren County urges our President \n     and our Congress to support the State of Israel in its effort \n     to live in peace and security, minimize to the greatest \n     extent loss to innocents and to withstand pressure from those \n     who would appease or accommodate terrorism in any form or at \n     any place.\n       That a copy of this resolution be distributed to the \n     President of the United States, the Honorable George W.

A bill to authorize the issuance of immigrant visas to, and \nthe admission to the United States for permanent residence of, certain \nscientists, engineers, and technicians who have worked in Iraqi weapons \nof mass destruction programs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on October 7, 2002, the President of the \nUnited States said something very important about United Nations \ninspections in Iraq. He said: ``Clearly, to actually work, any new \ninspections . . . will have to be very different. . . . To ensure that \nwe learn the truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal \nactivities to be interviewed outside the country--and these witnesses \nmust be free to bring their families with them so they are all beyond \nthe reach of Saddam Hussein's terror and murder. And inspectors must \nhave access to any site, at any time, without pre-clearance, without \ndelay, without exceptions.''\n  The President was right on the money about inspections. This is how \nto get the information the world needs on Saddam Hussein's weapons of \nmass destruction. Inspections are vital to stripping him of those \nbanned weapons.\n  The United Nations responded properly to the President's challenge. \nOn November 8, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1441, which \nprovided: . . . that Iraq shall provide UNMOVIC and the IAEA immediate, \nunimpeded, unconditional, and unrestricted access to any and all, \nincluding underground areas, facilities, buildings, equipment, records, \nand means of transport which they wish to inspect, as well as \nimmediate, unimpeded, unrestricted, and private access to all officials \nand other persons whom UNMOVIC or the IAEA wish to interview in the \nmode or location of UNMOVIC's or the IAEA's choice pursuant to any \naspect of their mandates; further decides that UNMOVIC and the IAEA may \nat their discretion conduct interviews inside or outside of Iraq, may \nfacilitate the travel of those interviewed and family members outside \nof Iraq, and that, at the sole discretion of UNMOVIC and the IAEA, such \ninterviews may occur without the presence of observers from the Iraqi \ngovernment.''\n  The inspectors are given unprecedented authority. But how are they to \nimplement it? Where will those weapons scientists and their families \ngo, once they've told the truth about Saddam's weapons programs? They \ncan't go home again. And at least in the short run, there will be no \nsafe haven in the region for people who reveal Saddam's most terrible \nsecrets.\n  Maybe some can go to Europe, although both al Qaeda cells and \nSaddam's agents have operated there. Maybe some can go to Canada, or to \nSouth America.\n  If the United States wants the world to show resolve in dealing with \nSaddam Hussein, however, then we must take the lead in admitting those \npeople who have the courage to betray Saddam's nuclear, chemical, \nbiological or missile programs. We have a large country in which to \nabsorb those people, and, for all our problems, we have the best law \nenforcement and security apparatus to guard them.\n  What we do not have is an immigration system that readily admits \nlarge numbers of persons who were involved with weapons of mass \ndestruction, have aided a country in the sop-called ``axis of evil,'' \nand are bringing their families. I introduced legislation last October, \ntherefore, to admit to our country those personnel, and their families, \nwho give critical and reliable information on Saddam's programs to us, \nto the United Nations, or to the International Atomic Energy Agency. On \nNovember 20, the Senate passed an amended version of that bill, S. \n3079, with the strong support of the Administration; but there was not \nenough time for the House of Representatives to act on the legislation.\n  Two months have passed since inspections were resumed in Iraq. The \nnew inspectors are gaining experience, as well as actionable \nintelligence from the United States and other countries. They are \nbeginning to find unreported weapons; and every weapon destroyed is a \nweapon that will never be used to cause mass destruction or to attack \nU.S. forces.\n  But inspectors have had a hard time getting truthful information from \nthe Iraqis they interview. Saddam Hussein terrorizes his people, \nincluding his weapons scientists, so effectively that they are afraid \nto be interviewed in private, let alone outside the country. They know \nthat even the appearance of cooperation could be a death sentence for \nthemselves or their families.\n  To overcome this obstacle, and to discover and dismantle Saddam \nHussein's weapons of mass destruction,\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\nUNMOVIC and the IAEA must interview relevant persons securely and with \ntheir families protected, even if they protest publicly against this \ntreatment. Hans Blix may dislike running ``a defection agency,'' but \nthat could be the only way to obtain truthful information about \nSaddam's weapons of mass destruction. The protests of those interviewed \ncan actually be helpful, as they prevent Saddam from knowing which of \nhis personnel may be willing to tell the truth once they and their \nfamilies are given a secure environment.\n  The United States must help UNMOVIC and the IAEA to create that \nsecure environment. So, today I am re-introducing the Iraqi Scientists \nImmigration Act.\n  I am joined by my esteemed colleague on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Specter of Pennsylvania, who co-sponsored the original bill, \nand also by the chairmen of the Foreign Relations Committee and the \nJudiciary Committee Senator Lugar of Indiana and Senator Hatch of Utah. \nI have been assured, moreover, that the Administration remains eager to \nsee this bill enacted. This bill is not political. Rather, it is a \nbipartisan effort to help the President succeed in forcing Iraq to \ndestroy all its weapons of mass destruction capabilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support quick action on this legislation. \nIraqis will not come forward unless we offer protection to them and \ntheir families. Those who are willing to provide truthful information \nwill merit our protection. And their information will help disarm \nSaddam Hussein; it will save lives if we have to go to war; and it \ncould even help us to disarm Saddam without a war.\n  Current law includes several means of either paroling non-immigrants \ninto the United States or admitting people for permanent residence, \nnotwithstanding their normal inadmissibility under the law. These are \nvery limited provisions, however, and they will not suffice to \naccommodate hundreds of Iraqi scientists and their families.\n  The legislation that I am re-introducing, the ``Iraqi Scientists \nImmigration Act of 2003,'' will permit the Attorney General, on a case-\nby-case basis in coordination with the Secretary of State and the \nDirector of Central Intelligence, to admit a foreigner and his family \nif such person: has worked in an Iraqi program to produce weapons of \nmass destruction or the means to deliver them; is willing to supply or \nhas supplied critical and reliable information on that program to an \nagency of the United States Government; may be willing to supply or has \nsupplied such information to United Nations or IAEA inspectors; and \nwill be or has been placed in danger as a result of providing such \ninformation.\n  The Attorney General will also have the authority to give legal \npermanent resident status to persons who provide the promised \ninformation.\n  Finally, this legislation will be limited to the admission of 500 \nscientists, plus their families. If it works and we need to enlarge the \nprogram, we can do so.\n  The important thing to do now is to give our country the initial \nauthority, and to give United Nations inspectors the ability to \nreassure Saddam's nuclear, chemical, biological and missile experts \nthat they and their families will be protected if they help the world \nto bring those programs down.\n  President Bush, other world leaders, and the inspectors in Iraq are \ntrying to disarm a tyrant whose arms programs make him a danger to \nworld peace. And they are trying to do this without going to war, even \nas we prepare to wage that war if necessary. We owe it to the \ninspectors to give them every chance to succeed. We owe it to the \nPresident to give him the tools he needs to help those inspectors. We \nowe it to Iraq's people and its neighbors to do everything we can to \ndismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs. And we owe it to \nour own people to do all we can to achieve that end peacefully, and \nwith international support.\n  This bill is a small, but vital step toward those ends. I urge my \ncolleagues to give it their immediate attention and support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na 10-year extension of the credit for producing electricity from wind; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nencourage a more environmentally friendly electricity future for the \nUnited States.\n  The bill I am introducing would provide for a ten-year extension of \nthe tax credit for producing electricity from wind. I believe that an \nextension of this length will provide stability to this important \nemerging energy sector.\n  For the past several years, we have provided short-term extensions, \nsometimes retroactively, of this important tax incentive. The result \nhas been that investors and utilities have been hesitant to commit the \ncapital necessary to bring wind projects on line.\n  A major European wind turbine manufacturer had planned to build its \nfirst U.S. manufacturing facility in Portland, OR. The plant was \nexpected to provide over 1,000 family-wage jobs once operational. \nUnfortunately, last November, the corporation announced it would put \nthose plans on hold and lay off more than 500 employees. This happened \nat a time when Oregon already had one of the highest unemployment rates \nin the country.\n  The main reason given for putting on hold this facility was the \nfailure of the Congress to clarify the production tax credit for wind \nenergy. Slow demand in this economic downturn was also cited.\n  However, our economy is going to rebound. And when it does, the \ndemand for electricity will increase. There is already over 180 \nmegawatts of installed wind energy capacity, with another 150 megawatts \nof planned development. The Stateline Wind Energy Project, which \nstraddles the Oregon-Washington border, has over 263 megawatts of \ninstalled capacity, making it the largest wind farm to date in the \nwestern United States.\n  When the Senate passed national energy legislation last year, there \nwas a strong, bipartisan commitment to renewable energy resources. We \ncan use the tax code to encourage the development of clean, renewable \nsources of electricity and a new generation of advanced technology \nvehicles. These vehicles can reduce our reliance on imported oil \nbecause their fuel efficiency is greatly improved and there are lower \nemissions of greenhouse gases and ozone-forming pollutants.\n  I have always held that if we use technology wisely, we can improve \nour environmental stewardship while maintaining our human stewardship \nand the standard of living we enjoy in this great Nation.\n  I would urge my colleague to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 208. A bill to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \ndevelop and implement a plan to provide security for cargo entering the \nUnited States or being transported in intrastate or interestate \ncommerce; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation aimed \nat closing the dangerous cargo security loophole in our Nation's \naviation security network.\n  In the wake of September 11 terrorist attacks, with the passage of \nthe Aviation and Security Act of 2001, we reinvented aviation security. \nWe overturned the status quo, and I am proud of the work we did. We put \nthe Federal Government in charge of security and we have made \nsignificant strides toward restoring the confidence of the American \npeople that it is safe to fly.\n  We no longer have a system in which the financial ``bottom line'' \ninterferes with protecting the flying public. We also addressed the \ngamut of critical issues, including baggage screening, additional air \nmarshals, cockpit security, and numerous other issues.\n  But there is more work to be done. We must not lose focus. If we are \nto fully confront the aviation security challenges we face in the after \nmath of September 11, we must remain aggressive. We need a ``must-do'' \nattitude, not excuses about what ``can't be done,'' because we are only \nas safe as the weakest link in our aviation security system.\n  I believe one of the most troubling shortcomings, which persists to \nthis day, is lax air cargo security infrastructure in this country. \nAccording to the GAO, a full 22 percent of all the cargo shipped by air \nin this country in 2000 was shipped on passenger flights and typically \nhalf of the hull of every passenger plane is filled with cargo. The \nDepartment of Transportation Inspector General has recommended that \ncurrent air cargo controls be tightened, particularly the process for \ncertifying freight forwarders and assessing their compliance with \nsecurity requirements, and has warned that the existing screening \nsystem is ``easily circumvented.'' This must not be allowed to stand.\n\n  Moreover, according to a Washington Post report last summer, Internal \nTransportation Security Administration documents warn of an increased \nrisk of an attack designed to exploit this vulnerability because TSA \nhas been focused primarily on meeting its new mandates to screen \npassengers and luggage.\n  This is clear evidence that cargo security needs to be bolstered. And \ntime is not on our side. We must act now. The bill I am introducing \ntoday is designed to tackle this issue by directing the TSA to submit a \ndetailed cargo security plan to Congress that will address the \nshortcomings in the current system.\n  And while TSA is designing and implementing this plan, my bill would \nrequire interim security measures to be put in place immediately. The \ninterim security plan would include random screening of at least 5 \npercent of all cargo, an authentication policy designed to ensure that \nterrorists are not able to impersonate legitimate shippers, audits of \neach phase of the shipping process in order to police compliance, \ntraining and background checks for cargo handlers, and funding for \nscreening and detection equipment.\n  On September 11, terrorists exposed the vulnerability of our \ncommercial aviation network in the most horrific fashion. The Aviation \nand Transportation Security Act of 2001 was a major step in the right \ndirection, but we must always stay one step ahead of those who would \ncommit vicious acts of violence on our soil aimed at innocent men, \nwomen, and children.\n  This bill is designed to build on the foundation we set in 2001. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in addressing this critical matter.\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 209. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to waive \nthe income inclusion on a distribution from an individual retirement \naccount to the extent that the distribution is contributed for \ncharitable purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday that will enhance and encourage charitable giving in the United \nStates. The Charitable IRA Rollover Act will allow individuals to \nrollover assets from an Individual Retirement Account, or ``IRA,'' to a \ncharity without incurring income tax consequences.\n  One of my priorities has been to promote charitable giving and expand \nthe role charities and faith-based institutions play in addressing \nsocial problems in the United States. I hope this legislation moves us \nfurther in that direction.\n  Government alone cannot solve society's most serious problems. In \nfact, government social programs often fail in their missions. The old \nwelfare system is a perfect example of what often goes wrong when \ngovernment tends to throw money at a problem.\n  Under the old system, while trying to help people, government \nactually encouraged them to stay on welfare. It encouraged out-of-\nwedlock births and discouraged fathers from living at home. Many of \nthese unintended consequences were addressed with the welfare reform \nbill, which will be reauthorized this year. The success of these \nreforms are evident in welfare rolls, which have now dropped by half \nacross the United States.\n  But government is not the solution. Charities change hearts and lives \nand have a superior track record to the government in tackling social \nills.\n  America's top charities address a broad range of problems. From the \nSalvation Army to the Boys and Girls Clubs, and the American Cancer \nSociety to the Red Cross, each plays a role in improving America's \nhealth, education and welfare. Their success has been documented. It \nhas been demonstrated that mentors in the Big Brothers/Big Sisters \nprogram can cut drug abuse by 50 percent.\n  Charitable giving is an American tradition. Americans appreciate the \nrole of charities and are actively involved in many philanthropic \ncauses. Nearly half of all Americans volunteer in some capacity on a \nregular basis, including nearly 25 percent of Americans who are active \nvolunteers in religious affiliated organizations. That is why it is \nlogical to use faith-based organizations as a means of accomplishing \nobjectives which can be more personal and tailored to the individual in \nneed.\n  The legislation I am introducing today helps these organizations by \nmaking it easier for people to make charitable contributions. \nIndividuals age 59\\1/2\\ and older will be able to move assets without \npenalty from an IRA directly to a charity or into a qualifying deferred \ncharitable gift plan, such as a charitable remainder trust, pooled \nincome fund or gift annuity. Current law requires taxpayers to first \nwithdraw the IRA proceeds and pay taxes on them before contributing the \nremaining funds to a charity. While current law allows taxes on the \nwithdrawal to be offset somewhat by the current charitable deduction, \nthis ability is limited.\n  Americans currently hold more than $2 trillion in assets in IRAs, and \nnearly 40 percent of American households have IRAs. This bill would \nallow senior citizens who have provided well for their retirement to \ntransfer IRA funds to charities without the government taking a slice. \nThis will cut bureaucratic obstacles and disincentives to charitable \ngiving and unlock a substantial amount of new funds that could flow to \nAmerica's charitable organizations.\n  The time for promoting charitable giving has come.\n  This proposal benefits everyone involved. Individuals will be able to \ngive more of their savings to charities of importance to them. \nCharities will benefit from increased philanthropy, enabling them to \ncontinue their important work. Those needing help will have increased \naccess to services from these charities. And the government will have \nto take care of fewer of those in need as charities are better able to \nassume that burden.\n  This is not a partisan proposal. It is a common sense way to remove \nobstacles to charitable giving. Senators Durbin and Levin are original \nco-sponsors of this legislation. I look forward to working with them, \nthe White House and many other colleagues to pass this bill. I hope the \nSenate will join in this effort to provide a valuable source of \nphilanthropy for our nation's charities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Charitable IRA Rollover Act \n     of 2003.''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TAX-FREE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT \n                   ACCOUNTS FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (d) of section 408 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to individual \n     retirement accounts) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new paragraph:\n       ``(8) Distributions for charitable purposes.--\n       ``(A) In general.--No amount shall be includible in gross \n     income by reason of a qualified charitable distribution from \n     an individual retirement account to an organization described \n     in section 170(c).\n       ``(B) Special rules relating to charitable remainder \n     trusts, pooled income funds, and charitable gift annuities.--\n       ``(i) In general.--No amount shall be includible in gross \n     income by reason of a qualified charitable distribution from \n     an individual retirement account--\n\n       ``(I) to a charitable remainder annuity trust or a \n     charitable remainder unitrust (as such terms are defined in \n     section 664(d)),\n       ``(II) to a pooled income fund (as defined in section \n     642(c)(5)), or\n       ``(III) for the issuance of a charitable gift annuity (as \n     defined in section 501(m)(5)).\n\n     The preceding sentence shall apply only if no person holds an \n     income interest in the amounts in the trust, fund, or annuity \n     attributable to such distribution other than one or more of \n     the following: the individual for whose benefit such account \n     is maintained, the spouse of such individual, or any \n     organization described in section 170(c).\n       ``(ii) Determination of inclusion of amounts distributed.--\n     In determining the amount includible in the gross income of \n     any person by reason of a payment or distribution from a \n     trust referred to in clause (i)(I) or a charitable gift \n     annuity (as so defined), the portion of any qualified \n     charitable distribution to such trust or for such annuity \n     which would (but for this subparagraph) have been includible \n     in gross income--\n\n       ``(I) shall be treated as income described in section \n     664(b)(1), and\n       ``(II) shall not be treated as an investment in the \n     contract.\n\n       ``(iii) No inclusion for distribution to pooled income \n     fund.--No amount shall be includible in the gross income of a \n     pooled income fund (as so defined) by reason of a qualified \n     charitable distribution to such fund.\n       ``(C) Qualified charitable distribution.--For purposes of \n     this paragraph, the term `qualified charitable distribution' \n     means any distribution from an individual retirement \n     account--\n       ``(i) which is made on or after the date that the \n     individual for whose benefit the account is maintained has \n     attained age 59\\1/2\\, and\n       ``(ii) which is made directly from the account to--\n\n       ``(I) an organization described in section 170(c), or\n       ``(II) a trust, fund, or annuity referred to in \n     subparagraph (B).\n\n       ``(D) Denial of deduction.--The amount allowable as a \n     deduction under section 170 to the taxpayer for the taxable \n     year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the \n     amounts of the qualified charitable distributions during such \n     year which would be includible in the gross income of the \n     taxpayer for such year but for this paragraph.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison, the charitable IRA Rollover Act of 2003. \nWe have introduced this legislation in the last two Congresses. Senator \nHutchison and I sincerely hope that this legislation will finally \nbecome law this year.\n  The IRA Charitable Rollover Act has the support of numerous \ncharitable organizations across the United States. The effect of this \nbill would be to unlock billions of dollars in savings Americans hold \nand make them available to charities. Our legislation will allow \nindividuals to roll assets from an Individual Retirement Account into a \ncharity or a deferred charitable gift plan without incurring any income \ntax consequences. Thus, the donation\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\nwould be made to charity without ever withdrawing it as income and \npaying tax on it.\n  Americans currently hold about $2 trillion in assets in IRAs. This \nrepresents over one-fifth of Americans' total retirement market assets \nand will likely grow due to the increased contribution limits enacted \nas part of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n2001. Recent studies show that assets of qualified retirement plans, \nsuch as IRAs, comprise a substantial part of peoples' net worth. Many \nof these individuals would like to give a portion of these assets to \ncharity, but are reluctant to do so because of the tax consequences.\n  Under our current law, if money from an IRA is transferred to a \ncharitable organization or into a charitable remainder trust, donors \nare required to recognize that as income. Therefore, absent the changes \ncalled for in the legislation, the donor will have taxable income in \nthe year the gift is funded. This is a huge disincentive contained in \nour complicated and burdensome tax code. This legislation will unleash \na critical source of funding for our Nation's charities. This \nlegislation will provide millions of Americans with a commonsense way \nto remove obstacles to private charitable giving.\n  Under the Hutchison-Durbin plan, an individual, upon reaching age \n59\\1/2\\, could move assets penalty- and tax-free from an IRA directly \nto charity or into a qualifying deferred charitable gift plan--e.g. \ncharitable remainder trusts, pooled income funds and gift annuities. In \nthe latter case the donor would be able to receive an income stream \nfrom the retirement plan assets, which would be taxed according to \nnormal rules. Upon the death of the individual, the remainder would be \ntransferred to charity tax free.\n  There are numerous supporters of this legislation including the Art \nInstitute of Chicago, the University of Chicago, the Field Museum, the \nCatholic Diocese of Peoria, Northwestern University, the Chicago \nSymphony Orchestra, Georgetown University, and others. There are over \n100 groups in Illinois alone that support this sensible legislation.\n  I hope the Senate will join in this bipartisan effort to provide a \nvaluable new source of philanthropy for our Nation's charities. I hope \nthat our colleagues will cosponsor this important piece of legislation \nand that it will be enacted into law this year. I thank the Senator \nfrom Texas, Senator Hutchison, for working with me and my staff in this \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN.\n  S. 210. A bill to provide for the protection of archaeological sites \nin the Galisteo Basin in New Mexico, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to again introduce \nlegislation to protect several important archaeological sites in the \nGalisteo Basin in New Mexico. This bill identifies approximately two \ndozen sites in northern New Mexico which contain the ruins of pueblos \ndating back almost 900 years. When Coronado and other Spanish \nconquistadors first entered what is now New Mexico in 1541, they \nencountered a thriving Pueblo culture with its own unique tradition of \nreligion, architecture and art, which was influenced through an \nextensive trade system. We know that these sites remain occupied up \nthrough the Pueblo revolt in 1680. After that, the sites were deserted, \nalthough we still don't know why they were abandoned, after over 700 \nyears of continuous use.\n  Through these sites, we have the opportunity to learn more not only \nabout the history and culture of these Pueblos, but also about the \nfirst interaction between European and Native American cultures. The \nCochiti Pueblo, in particular, is culturally and historically tied to \nthese sites, which have tremendous historical and religious \nsignificance to the Pueblo. I am grateful for the continued support of \nthe Pueblo de Cochiti for this legislation. This bill has strong local \nsupport, including the Santa Fe Board of County Commissioners, the City \nof Santa Fe, and the Archdiocese of Santa Fe. I would also like to \nthank the Archaeological Conservancy for its efforts over the past \nseveral years to identify and protect many of these sites, and in \nhelping with this legislation.\n  Many of these archaeological sites are on Federal land administered \nby the Bureau of Land Management. BLM archaeologists have already \nprovided extensive background research on many of these sites, and I \nwas pleased that the agency supported a similar bill I introduced in \nthe previous Congress. Last Congress the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee held a hearing on this bill in Santa Fe. It was clear from \nthat hearing that there is strong local support for protecting these \nsites. In fact nobody testified in opposition to the bill, at either \nthe Santa Fe or Washington hearings.\n  This bill simply authorizes the BLM to work in a cooperative manner \nwith interested landowners to protect sites on Federal and non-Federal \nlands. Last Congress we included several provisions to make clear that \nthe bill did not infringe on private property rights.\n  Although the bill is non-controversial, we have been unable to get \nthe legislation passed through both the House and Senate, although last \nCongress I was pleased that bill was favorably reported by the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and passed by the Senate as part of a \nlarger public lands bill. In the years since I first introduced this \nbill, many irreplaceable archaeological resources have been lost, \nwhether by vandalism, erosion, or other means. Enactment of the \nGalisteo Basin Archaeological Sites Protection Act will allow us to \ntake the steps necessary to protect these resources and to allow for \nimproved public understanding and interpretation of these sites.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Galisteo Basin \n     Archaeological Sites Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage \nArea in the State of New Mexico, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nto establish the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area in northern \nNew Mexico. I am pleased that Senator Domenici is again joining me in \nsponsoring this bill. The Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area \nwill be established as part of a collaborative effort between local \nresidents, Indian tribes, businesses and local governments, who are \nworking together to preserve the area.\n  By establishing the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area, I \nhope to commemorate the significant but complex heritage of northern \nNew Mexico communities and Indian tribes, from the pre-Spanish \ncolonization period to present day. Establishing a National Heritage \nArea will benefit the northern New Mexico communities, local residents, \nstudents, and visitors, as well as help the local protection and \ninterpretation of the unique cultural, historical, and natural \nresources of northern New Mexico.\n  Last Congress, similar legislation was considered and favorably \nreported from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and passed \nby the Senate by unanimous consent as part of a comprehensive heritage \narea bill. Unfortunately, the House was not able to consider the bill \nprior to the sine die adjournment of the Congress. Since the bill is \nnon-controversial and has already passed the Senate, it is my hope that \nwe will be able to move it through the Committee and to the floor as \nsoon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 211\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Rio Grande National \n     Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) northern New Mexico encompasses a mosaic of cultures \n     and history, including eight Pueblos and the descendants of \n     Spanish ancestors who settled in the area in 1598;\n       (2) the combination of cultures, languages, folk arts, \n     customs, and architecture make northern New Mexico unique;\n       (3) the area includes spectacular natural, scenic, and \n     recreational resources;\n       (4) there is broad support from local governments and \n     interested individuals to establish a National Heritage Area \n     to coordinate and assist in the preservation and \n     interpretation of these resources;\n       (5) in 1991, the National Park Service study Alternative \n     Concepts for Commemorating Spanish Colonization identified \n     several alternatives consistent with the establishment of a \n     National Heritage Area, including conducting a comprehensive \n     archaeological and historical research program, coordinating \n     a comprehensive interpretation program, and interpreting a \n     cultural heritage scene; and\n       (6) establishment of a National Heritage Area in northern \n     New Mexico would assist local communities and residents in \n     preserving these unique cultural, historical and natural \n     resources.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act--\n       (1) the term ``heritage area'' means the Northern Rio \n     Grande Heritage Area; and\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n     Interior.\n\n     SEC. 4. NORTHERN RIO GRANDE NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is hereby established the \n     Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area in the State of \n     New Mexico.\n       (b) Boundaries.--The heritage area shall include the \n     counties of Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, and Taos.\n       (c) Management Entity.--\n       (1) The Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area, Inc., a \n     non-profit corporation chartered in the State of New Mexico, \n     shall serve as the management entity for the heritage area.\n       (2) The Board of Directors for the management entity shall \n     include representatives of the State of New Mexico, the \n     counties of Santa Fe, Rio Arriba and Taos, tribes and pueblos \n     within the heritage area, the cities of Santa Fe, Espanola \n     and Taos, and members of the general public. The total number \n     of Board members and the number of Directors representing \n     State, local and tribal governments and interested \n     communities shall be established to ensure that all parties \n     have appropriate representation on the Board.\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \ncooperate with the High Plains States in conducting a hydrogeologic \ncharacterization, mapping, modeling and monitoring program for the High \nPlains Aquifer, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nhas significance for the entire Great Plains region of our Nation. It \nwill establish a program for the hydrogeologic characterization, \nmapping, modeling and monitoring of the High Plains Aquifer, which \nextends from Wyoming to New Mexico and Texas. This legislation was the \nsubject of a hearing last Congress before the Water and Power \nSubcommittee of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It \nis the same as legislation that was unanimously agreed to by the full \nSenate last year. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Brownback and \nDomenici in introducing this bill.\n  The High Plains Aquifer, which is comprised in large part by the \nOgallala Aquifer, extends under eight states: Colorado, Kansas, \nNebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. It is \nexperiencing alarming declines in its water levels. This aquifer is the \nsource of water for farmers and communities throughout the Great Plains \nregion. The legislation I am introducing today is intended to ensure \nthat sound and objective science is available with respect to the \nhydrology and geology of the High Plains Aquifer.\n  This bill, the ``High Plains Aquifer Hydrogeologic Characterization, \nMapping, Modeling and Monitoring Act,'' would direct the Secretary of \nthe Interior to develop and carry out a comprehensive hydrogeologic \ncharacterization, mapping, modeling and monitoring program for the High \nPlains Aquifer. The Secretary is directed to work in conjunction with \nthe eight High Plains Aquifer States in carrying out this program. The \nU.S. Geological Survey and the States will work in cooperation to \nfurther the goals of this program, with half of the available funds \ndirected to the State component of the program.\n  A reliable source of groundwater is essential to the well-being and \nlivelihoods of people in the Great Plains region. Local towns and rural \nareas are dependent on the use of groundwater for drinking water, \nranching, farming, and other commercial uses. Yet many areas overlying \nthe Ogallala Aquifer have experienced a dramatic depletion of this \ngroundwater resource. The problem we are confronting is that the \naquifer is not sustainable, and it is being depleted rapidly. This \nthreatens the way of life of all who live on the High Plains.\n  The bill I am introducing today would help ensure that the relevant \nscience needed to address this problem is available so that we will \nhave a better understanding of the resources of\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\nthe High Plains Aquifer.

A bill to clear title to certain real property in New Mexico \nassociated with the Middle Rio Grande Project, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nAlbuquerque Biological Park Title Clarification Act with the support of \nmy colleague Senator Domenici. This bill, which passed the Senate \nduring the 107th Congress, would assist the City of Albuquerque, by \nclearing its title to two parcels of land located along the Rio Grande. \nMore specifically, it would allow the City to move forward with its \nplans to improve the properties as part of a Biological Park Project, a \ncity funded initiative to create a premier environmental educational \ncenter for its citizens and the entire State of New Mexico.\n  The Biological Park Project has been in the works since 1987 when the \nCity began to develop an aquarium and botanic garden along the banks of \nthe Rio Grande. The facilities constitute just a portion of the overall \nproject. In pursuit of the balance of the project, the City, in 1997, \npurchased two properties from the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy \nDistrict, (MRGCD), for $3,875,000. The first property, Tingley Beach \nhas been leased by the City from MRGCD since 1931 and used for public \npark purposes. The second property, San Gabriel Park, has been leased \nby the City since 1963, and also used for public park purposes.\n  In the year 2000, the City's plans were interrupted when the U.S. \nBureau of Reclamation asserted that in 1953, in had acquired ownership \nof all of MRGCD's property associated with the Middle Rio Grande \nProject. The United States' assertion called into question the validity \nof the 1997 transaction between the City and MRGCD. Both MRGCD and the \nCity dispute the United States' claim of ownership.\n  This dispute is delaying the City's progress in developing the \nBiological Park Project. If the matter is simply left to litigation, \nthe delay with be both indefinite and unnecessary. Reclamation has \nalready determined that the two properties are surplus to the needs of \nthe Middle Rio Grande Project. Moreover, the record indicates that \nReclamation had once considered releasing its interest in the \nproperties for $1.00 each. Obviously, the Federal interest in these \nproperties is low while the local interest is very high. This bill is \nnarrowly tailored to address this local interest, affecting only the \ntwo properties at issue. The general dispute concerning title to \nproject works is left for the courts to decide.\n  I hope my colleagues will work with me to help resolve this issue \nwhich is important to the citizens of my State. While much of what we \ndo here in the Congress is complex and time-consuming work, we should \nalso have the ability to move quickly when necessary and appropriate to \nsolve local problems caused by Federal actions. I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 213\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Albuquerque Biological Park \n     Title Clarification Act''.\n\n     SEC 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1) In 1997, the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico paid \n     $3,875,000 to the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District to \n     acquire two parcels of land known as Tingley Beach and San \n     Gabriel Park.\n       (2) The City intends to develop and improve Tingley Beach \n     and San Gabriel Park as part of its Albuquerque Biological \n     Park Project.\n       (3) In 2000, the United States claimed title to Tingley \n     Beach and San Gabriel Park by asserting that these properties \n     were transferred to the United States in the 1950's as part \n     of the establishment of the Middle Rio Grande Project.\n       (4) The City's ability to continue developing the \n     Albuquerque Biological Park Project has been hindered by the \n     United States claim of title to these properties.\n       (5) The United States claim of ownership over the Middle \n     Rio Grande Project properties is disputed by the City and \n     MRGCD in Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. John W. Keys, III, No. \n     CV 99-1320 JP/RLP-ACE (D. N.M. filed Nov. 15, 1999).\n       (6) Tingley Beach and San Gabriel Park are surplus to the \n     needs of the Bureau of Reclamation and the United States in \n     administering the Middle Rio Grande Project.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to direct the \n     Secretary of the Interior to issue a quitclaim deed conveying \n     any right, title, and interest the United States may have in \n     and to Tingley Beach or San Gabriel Park to the City, thereby \n     removing the cloud on the City's title to these lands.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to designate Fort Bayard Historic District in the \nState of New Mexico as a National Historic Landmark, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ncolleague Senator Domenici, legislation to designate Fort Bayard in New \nMexico as a National Historic Landmark.\n  Fort Bayard is significant not only for the role it played as a \nmilitary post in fostering early settlement in the region, but for its \nrole as a nationally important tuberculosis sanatorium and hospital. \nDuring the 99 years spanning its establishment in 1866 through its \nclosing as a Veterans Administration hospital in 1965, Fort Bayard \nserved as the most prominent evidence of the Federal Government's role \nin southwestern New Mexico. Fort Bayard has recently been listed on the \nNational Register of Historic Places in recognition of the historical \nsignificance of the site.\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\n  From 1866 to 1899, Fort Bayard functioned as an Army post while its \nsoldiers, many of them African-American, or Buffalo Soldiers, protected \nsettlers working in the nearby mining district. These Buffalo Soldiers \nwere a mainstay of the Army during the late Apache wars and fought \nheroically in numerous skirmishes. Like many soldiers who served at \nFort Bayard, some of the Buffalo Soldiers remained in the area \nfollowing their discharge. Lines of headstones noting the names of men \nand their various Buffalo Soldier units remain in the older section of \nwhat is now the National Cemetery. In 1992, these soldiers were \nrecognized for their bravery when a Buffalo Soldier Memorial statue was \ndedicated at the center of the Fort Bayard parade ground. It gradually \nbecame apparent that the Army's extensive frontier fort system was no \nlonger necessary. By 1890, it was clear that the era of the western \nfrontier, at least from the Army's perspective, had ended. Fort Bayard \nwas scheduled for closure in 1899.\n  Even as the last detachment of the 9th U.S. Cavalry prepared to \ndepart the discontinued post, new federal occupants were arriving at \nFort Bayard. On August 28, 1899, the War Department authorized the \nsurgeon-general to establish a general hospital for use as a military \nsanatorium. This would be the first sanatorium dedicated to the \ntreatment of officers and enlisted men of the Army suffering from \npulmonary tuberculosis. At 6,100 ft. and with a dry, sunny climate, the \nfort lay within what proponents of climatological therapy termed the \n``zone of immunity.'' By 1919, the cumulative effect of over 15 years \nof construction and improvement projects was the creation of a small, \nnearly self-sufficient community.\n  In 1920, the War Department closed the sanatorium and the United \nStates Public Health Service assumed control of the facility. A second \nphase occurred in 1922 when a new agency, the Veterans' Bureau, was \ncreated within the Treasury Department and charged with operating \nhospitals throughout the country whose clientele were veterans \nrequiring medical services. As a result, in the summer of 1922 the \nUnited States General Hospital at Fort Bayard was transferred to the \nVeterans' Bureau and became known as United States Veterans' Hospital \nNo. 55. Its mission of treating those afflicted with tuberculosis, \nhowever, remained the same.\n  By 1965, there was no longer a need for a tuberculosis facility \nlocated at a high elevation in a dry climate, and the Veterans' \nAdministration decided to close the hospital in that year. However, in \npart because of the concerns of the local communities that depended \nupon the hospital, the State of New Mexico assumed responsibility for \nthe facility and 484 acres of the former military reservation. Since \nthen, the State has used it for geriatric, as well as drug and alcohol \nrehabilitation and orthopedic programs. Because of the extensive \ncemetery dating to the fort and sanatorium eras at Fort Bayard, the \nState of New Mexico transferred 16 acres in 1975 for the creation of \nthe Fort Bayard National Cemetery, administered by the Veterans' \nAdministration.\n  For these and many other reasons, I believe it is clear that Fort \nBayard is historically significant and merits recognition as a National \nHistoric Landmark. Fort Bayard illuminates a rich and complex story \nthat is important to the entire nation.\n  Last Congress identical legislation was considered and favorably \nreported by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and included in \na larger package of public land bills which passed the Senate by \nunanimous consent. Since there is broad local support for the bill, and \nit has already received the approval of the Senate, it is my hope that \nwe can expeditiously consider the bill this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 214\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fort Bayard National \n     Historic Landmark Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Fort Bayard, located in southwest New Mexico, was an \n     Army post from 1866 and 1899, and served an important role in \n     the settlement of New Mexico;\n       (2) among the troops stationed at the fort were several \n     ``Buffalo Soldier'' units who fought in the Apache Wars;\n       (3) following its closure as a military post, Fort Bayard \n     was established by the War Department as general hospital for \n     use as a military sanatorium;\n       (4) in 1965 the State of New Mexico assumed management of \n     the site and currently operates the Fort Bayard State \n     Hospital;\n       (5) the Fort Bayard historic site has been listed on the \n     National Register of Historic Places in recognition of the \n     national significance of its history, both as a military fort \n     and as an historic medical facility.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize funding assistance for the States for the \ndischarge of homeland security activities by the National Guard; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \ngive the National Guard an enhanced role in homeland security. I am \npleased that Senators Bond, Leahy, Lieberman, Gregg, Murray, Johnson, \nClinton, Breaux, and Feingold join me as cosponsors of the bill.\n  In essence, the bill would permit each governor to create a homeland \nsecurity activities plan for the National Guard in his or her State, \nand authorize the Secretary of Defense to provide oversight and funding \nfor such plans.\n  The legislation is modeled after the existing successful National \nGuard counterdrug program, which was established under 32 U.S.C. sect. \n112.\n  Under this program, the National Guard is used to provide support to \nlaw enforcement to help stop illegal drugs from being imported, \nmanufactured, and distributed, and in supporting drug demand reduction \nprograms.\n  The bill is supported by the co-chairs of the Senate National Guard \nCaucus, the National Governors' Association, the Adjutants General \nAssociation of the United States, the National Guard Association of the \nUnited States, and National Guardsmen across the country.\n  Giving the Guard an enhanced role in homeland security makes sense \nbecause the Guard connects local communities to the Federal Government, \nis located in almost every American community, and has the \ncapabilities, legal authority, and structure to help respond to attacks \non the homeland.\n  In addition, such an enhanced role would return the National Guard \nmore to what was envisioned by the founders of this country.\n  Colonial militias protected their fellow citizens from Indian attack, \nforeign invaders, and later helped win the Revolutionary War.\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\n  And during the 19th century, the militia provided the bulk of the \ntroops during the Mexican war, the early years of the Civil War, and \nthe Spanish-American War.\n  It was not until 1903 that Congress passed legislation to increase \nthe role of the National Guard as a Reserve force for the U.S. Army\n  Now, the National Guard has a dual Federal/State mission. In their \nrole as State militias, Guard units are often activated for homeland \nduty under Title 32 and thus come under the command of the State \ngovernor.\n  In this status, they are exempt from the Posse Comitatus Act, which \ngenerally restricts law enforcement to civil authorities, and thus are \nused as the armed forces' primary provider of support to civil \nauthorities.\n  The National Guard's access to military command and control, \ndiscipline, training, and equipment also makes it well suited to \ncoordinate with and aid police, fire, medical, and other emergency \nresponders.\n  The Army National Guard maintains over 3,000 armories around the \nNation and the Air National Guard has 140 units throughout the United \nStates.\n  There are about 460,000 National Guard members that train throughout \nthe year, 353,000 Army National Guard and 106,000 Air National Guard.\n  The approximate numbers of National Guard in individual States run \nfrom about 1,000 to 21,000, and vary according to the population of the \nState and recruitment efforts.\n  In light of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and \nPentagon as well as the October 2001 anthrax attacks on Congress and \nthe media, many of us have come to believe that the National Guard \nshould play a more central role in responding to terrorist attacks, \nparticularly those with weapons of mass destruction.\n  In fact, the Guard has already played an important role in helping \nrespond to these attacks, not only at the site of the attacks but also \nat airports, around the Capitol, and elsewhere.\n  For example, the National Guard currently has a number of Civil \nSupport Teams that assess a suspected weapon of mass destruction event, \nadvise first responders, and facilitate the assistance of additional \nmilitary forces, if needed.\n  The National Guard is well-suited to performing an enhanced homeland \nsecurity mission for many reasons. These reasons include that the fact \nthe Guard is already: deployed in communities around the country; \nintegrated into existing local, State, and regional emergency response \nnetworks; has ties with key players in local, State, and Federal \ngovernment; is not bound by the Posse Comitatus Act while serving in \nTitle 32 status and thus has maximum flexibility; is responsible for \nand experienced with homeland security missions, including air \nsovereignty, disaster relief, responding to suspected weapons of mass \ndestruction events, and counterdrug operations; has existing physical, \ncommunications, and training infrastructure throughout the U.S.; has \nexisting training facilities, distance learning training networks, and \na number of highly skilled individuals who have left active forces; and \nhelps preserve constitutional balance between State and Federal \nsovereign interests, given its unique dual State/Federal role.\n  Moreover, Department of Defense reviews and reports, including the \n2001 Quadrennial Defense Review and Reserve Component Employment 2005 \nStudy, have made clear that the National Guard should have an expanded \nrole in homeland security.\n  Other experts agree. The Hart-Rudman and Gilmore terrorism \ncommissions as well as the recent Hart-Rudman Terrorism Task Force have \nrecommended that the National Guard be given a more direct role in the \nwar on terrorism.\n  In sum, this legislation is a sensible, efficient way to make our \ncountry safer from terrorism. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to pass it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 215\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology to develop improvements in building and fire codes, \nstandards, and practices to reduce the impact of terrorist and other \nextreme threats to the safety of buildings, their occupants, and \nemergency responders, and to authorize the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to form a task force to recommend ways to strengthen standards \nin the private security industry, stabilize the workforce, and create a \nsafer environment for commercial building and industrial facility \noccupants; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, as we all know, when terrorists struck \nAmerica on September 11, 2001, the greatest loss of life occurred when \nthe World Trade Center's two towers fell. These two towers were symbols \nof America's strength and prosperity, and they were reduced to rubble \nby the two massive blows.\n  As we continue securing America against terrorist attacks, we need to \ngive more attention to the security of large buildings, especially \nskyscrapers and arenas. There are approximately 500 skyscrapers in the \nUnited States that are regularly occupied by at least 5000 people, and \nthere are 250 major arenas and stadiums that hold many times more. \nThese buildings will be primary targets of potential terrorist attack. \nWe must do more to ensure that these buildings are secure.\n  That is why I am introducing today the Building Security Act of 2003. \nThe bill does two things: first, it supports the research and funding \nwe need so that buildings can withstand extreme assaults, including \nterrorist attacks. Second, the bill takes steps so that buildings will \nbe guarded by a security workforce that is adequately prepared to \nrespond to these dangers.\n  Consider the construction of large buildings. Today, many older \nbuildings lack fire retardants and blast-resistant materials that can \nsave hundreds of lives in a disaster. As a result of the study of the \nattack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, we know that \ndesign changes that would have increased building costs by only 1 to 2 \npercent might have saved as many of 85 percent of the people killed in \nthat attack. The early reports on the World Trade Center collapse have \nsuggested that the two towers could have endured the impact of the \nplanes, but that the extraordinary heat generated by the explosions \nweakened the steel structure of those buildings. Advanced technologies \nin building construction would surely have slowed their collapse. On \nthe positive side, we know that improvements in the construction of the \nPentagon mitigated the loss of life; the plane struck the Pentagon on \nthe one side of the building where the windows were blast-resistant and \nthe structural columns had been reinforced. Those changes likely saved \nmany lives.\n  There are new, better construction practices and materials out there, \nbut we are not using them as much as we should. Part of the reason is \nthat today, our Nation's brightest scientists and most innovative \ncompanies do not have the resources needed to research, create, and \nimplement these practices. We must enable these people to develop new \nmethods and materials, and help industry meet the higher standards we \nneed, and we must do all that as quickly and efficient as possible.\n  The bill I introduce today will provide $40 million for the National \nInstitutes of Science and Technology, or NIST, to help improve \nconstruction standards. The needed research is happening now, but it \nneeds to move much more quickly. This legislation will do three things: \n1. undertake an intensive national research effort to determine both \nhow to build strong buildings, and how to improve building codes and \nstandards; 2. specifically research the question of how to ensure that \nthese higher standards are actually met, whether by mandates, tax \ncredits, or other incentives; and 3. provide technical guidance to \nbuilders in adopting the new standards and codes.\n  We also must address standards for private security officers. Our \ncountry's buildings are staffed by almost two million private security \nofficers. While they have the critical responsibility of preventing \nemergencies and protecting building occupants from harm, these officers \nare often inadequately trained or compensated to do so. The industry \nsuffers from low retention, deficient training, and meager salaries. \nThe job turnover rate within the private security industry is as high \nas 300 percent per year. Recent studies show that 4 in 10 private \nsecurity officers report no new security measures in their buildings \nsince September 11, and 7 in 10 report that their buildings never \nconduct evacuation and emergency drills. And over half of the States \nhave no clear oversight for their respective private security \nindustries, nor do they have standards or screening requirements for \nnew hires.\n  This legislation authorizes a review of the private security industry \nby a commission in the Department of Homeland Security that includes \nall those with critical knowledge of the industry. The commission is \ntasked with establishing industry guidelines and standards and \ndeveloping a means to implement those guidelines and standards in a \ntimely way.\n  Our Nation's buildings have been targeted before, and I believe that \nthey will be targeted again. We must do much more to make these \nbuildings secure. This bill is important step in the right direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 217. A bill to reinstate felony penalties for licensed gun dealers \nwho fail to maintain records of sales; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that could \nhave a large impact on reducing gun violence in this country.\n  Last fall, two snipers terrorized the Washington, D.C. metropolitan \narea, killing ten victims and wounding others including children. Among \nthe weapons used by the snipers was a high powered military-style \nassault rifle known as a Bushmaster XM15. Following the arrest of \nsniper suspects John Mohammed and John Lee Malvo, this weapon was \nlinked to killings in Maryland, Virginia,Louisiana, and Alabama.\n  Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms traced the \nBushmaster weapon to a Tacoma, Washington gun dealership, the Bull's \nEye Shooter Supply. Investigators even found the empty box in which the \nweapon was shipped.\n  But What the agents did not find was any record of the sale of the \nweapon because the gun dealer did not keep adequate records. If the gun \nwas bought from Bull's Eye, we do not know when because there is no \nrecord of the Sale. There is no record of a gun application or a \nbackground check for John Mohammed. Had a background check been carried \nout, John Mohammed would not have obtained the weapon because a \ndomestic violence restraining order had been field against him.\n  What is the weapon was stolen? If the owner of Bull's Eye had kept \nproper records and followed Federal law, he would have reported the \nweapon missing or stolen when it disappeared from the store. The \nknowledge that a Bushmaster XM15 was missing from a Tacoma area weapons \nstore could have greatly aided investigators looking into the case.\n  The sloppy recordkeeping for this particular weapon was not an \nisolated case. it has been learned that inspectors had uncovered \nrecord-keeping violations in audits at Bull's Eye in 1998, 2000 and \n2001. A total of 160 missing guns could not be accounted for in the \n2000 audit.\n  This type of shoddy recordkeeping is dangerous. A small percentage of \nlicensed dealers are responsible for a disproportionate number of crime \nguns. Specifically, 1.2 percent of all licensed gun dealers are \nresponsible for the original sale of 57 percent of all firearms used in \ncrimes, according to data from the ATF.\n  Gun dealers are not being punished when they ignore Federal \nrecordkeeping laws. Why? Because in 1986, the National Rifle \nAssociation pushed a law through Congress that significantly weakened \npenalties for poor recordkeeping reducing maximum jail time for five \nyears to one year. This meant that the crime was reduced from\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\na felony to a misdemeanor. With this change, the undermanned and \nunderfunded Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Federal \nprosecutors simply could not afford to bring cases against gun dealers \nfor misdemeanor violations.\n  It is time we restore record keeping violations to a felony and that \nis what my bill does. It is not a new gun law. It is merely making the \npenalties tougher for violations for existing law. Regardless of \nwhether you support or oppose additional gun laws, we all agree that we \nneed strong enforcement of existing laws. My bill would make \nenforcement easier and tougher. I hope my colleagues will support this \ncommon-sense legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill and a letter of support from the Violence Policy Center be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 217\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REINSTATEMENT OF CRIMINAL FELONY PENALTIES FOR \n                   FAILURE TO MAINTAIN RECORDS OF FIREARMS SALES.\n\n       Section 924(a)(3) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``one year'' and inserting ``5 years''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Violence Policy Center,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The Violence Policy strongly endorses \n     your legislation to reinstate felony penalties for firearm \n     recordkeeping violations. That this legislation is urgently \n     needed is highlighted by the circumstances surrounding the \n     tragic Washington-area sniper shootings. Bull's Eye Shooter \n     Supply, the gun dealer in Washington state from which the \n     snipers acquired their Bushmaster XM15 assault rifle, had no \n     record of the gun leaving its inventory. The store simply \n     could not account for the disposition of the gun used to kill \n     10 and would three in a shooting spree that terrorized the \n     Washington metropolitan area.\n       This is not surprising taking into account the feeble \n     penalties that currently apply to gun dealers who fail to \n     keep adequate records. Your legislation would simply restore \n     the felony penalty that applied until legislation backed by \n     the National Rifle Association reduced it to a misdemeanor in \n     1986.\n       At the time, the Reagan Administration agreed that reducing \n     recordkeeping violations to a misdemeanor was a dangerous \n     idea. In 1986, the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \n     and Firearms (ATF) identified this penalty change as a \n     ``weakness'' of the legislation in which it was included. In \n     a memorandum to the Department of the Treasury's Assistant \n     Secretary for Enforcement, the ATF Director wrote, ``By \n     reducing all licensee recordkeeping violations to \n     misdemeanors, serious violations could not be adequately \n     prosecuted and punished, i.e., a dealer's sale of firearms \n     off-record and his willful refusal to make or maintain any \n     required record could only be prosecuted as misdemeanors.''\n       It's time to put the teeth back in dealer recordkeeping \n     enforcement. The Violence Policy Center strongly supports \n     swift passage of the Boxer legislation to reinstate felony \n     penalties for failure to maintain records of firearms \n     transfers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  M. Kristen Rand,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 218. A bill to amend the Coastal Zone Management Act; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Coastal Zone \nEnhancement Reauthorization of 2003. I am pleased to have bipartisan \nsupport for this bill and to be joined by the Chair and Ranking \nDemocrats of the Commerce Committee and the Subcommittee on Oceans and \nFisheries. Senators McCain, Hollings, and Kerry have been instrumental \nin developing the wide range of support for this bill and I appreciate \ntheir interest in improving the way we manage our Nation's valuable \ncoastal and marine resources.\n  In 1972, Congress responded to concerns over the increasing demands \nbeing placed on our Nation's coastal regions and resources by enacting \nof the Coastal Zone Management Act. These pressures have greatly \nincreased since the Act was originally authorized.\n  Although the coastal zone only comprises 10 percent of the contiguous \nU.S. land area, nearly 53 percent of all Americans live in these \ncoastal regions, and more than 3,600 people are relocating there \nannually. This small portion of our country supports approximately 361 \nsea ports, contains most of our largest cities, and serves as critical \nhabitat for a variety of plants and animals.\n  This bill reauthorizes and makes a number of important improvements \nto the Coastal Zone Management Act. Under the authorities in this Act, \ncoastal States can choose to participate in the voluntary Federal \nCoastal Zone Management Program. States then design individual coastal \nzone management programs, taking their specific needs and problems into \naccount, and then receive Federal matching funds to help carry out \ntheir program plans. State coastal zone programs manage issues ranging \nfrom public access to beaches, to protecting habitat, to coordinating \npermits for coastal development.\n  As a voluntary program, the framework of the CZMA provides guidelines \nfor State plans to address multiple environmental, societal, cultural, \nand economic objectives.\n  The health of our coastal zone is vitally important not only to the \nmultitude of plants and animals that inhabit this area, but also to the \npeople and communities that are dependent on it for their livelihood. \nFor example, coastal areas provide habitat for more than 75 percent of \nthe U.S. commercial fisheries and 85 percent of the U.S. recreational \nfisheries. In turn, the commercial fishing industry, along with value-\nadded services included, contributes $40 billion to the U.S. economy \neach year. Recreational fishing adds another $25 billion to the \neconomy.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Program can be used to help balance the \nconservation of fish stocks with the demands that we place on coastal \nareas. In my State of Maine, a $150,000 study of the State's cargo \nneeds led to a $27 million bond issue for cargo port improvements. As a \nresult, Bath Iron Works built a new $45 million facility, creating \n1,000 new jobs. Similar work needs to be done with our fishing ports so \nthat when fisheries stock rebound, the fishermen will be able to \nrealize the returns.\n\n  Unfortunately our precious coastal resources are being threatened by \nenvironmental problems, including non-point source pollution. Although \nthe States are currently taking action to address this problem under \nexisting authority, the Coastal Zone Enhancement Reauthorization of \n2003 encourages, but does not require them to take additional steps to \ncombat these problems through the Coastal Community Program.\n  This initiative provides States with the funding and flexibility \nneeded to deal with their specific non-point source pollution problems. \nThe States will have the ability to implement local solutions to a \nbroad array of local problems. Many States are actively engaged in non-\npoint source pollution programs and all can benefit from this new tool. \nI'm proud to say that Maine has risen to the challenge and already \nspends close to 30 percent of its funding on such activities. This has \nled to the reopening of hundreds of acres of shellfish beds and the \nrestoration of fish nursery areas. Even with these successes, Maine is \nlooking forward to this new opportunity to do more.\n  The Coastal Community Program in this bill also aides States in \ndeveloping and implementing creative initiatives to deal with problems \nother than on-point source pollution. It increases Federal and State \nsupport of local community-based programs that address coastal \nenvironmental issues, such as the impact of development and sprawl on \ncoastal uses and resources. This type of bottom-up management approach \nis critical.\n  The Coastal Zone Enhancement Reauthorization of 2003 significantly \nincreases the authorization levels for the Coastal Zone Management \nProgram, allowing States to better address their coastal management \nplan goals. The bill authorizes $135.5 million for fiscal year 2003, \n$141 million for fiscal year 2005 and increases the authorization \nlevels by $5.5 million each year through fiscal year 2008. This \nincrease in funding is necessary to allow the coastal programs to reach \ntheir full potential.\n  Additionally, the Coastal Zone Enhancement Reauthorization of 2003 \nincreases authorization for the National\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\nEstuarine Research Reserve System, NERRS, to $13 million in fiscal year \n2004 with an additional $1 million increase each year through fiscal \nyear 2008. NERRS is a network of reserves across the country that are \noperated as a cooperative federal-state partnership.\n  Currently, there are 25 reserves in 22 States. The provide an \nimportant opportunity for long-term research and education in these \necosystems. Additional funds will help strengthen this nationwide \nprogram which has not received increased funding commensurate with the \naddition of new reserves.\n  I would like to address a very serious problem facing the Coastal \nZone Management Program that we have tried to rectify in this bill. The \nAdministrative Grant program, section 306, serves as the base funding \nmechanism for the States' coastal zone management programs. The amount \nof funding each State receives is determined by a formula that takes \ninto account both the length of the coastline and the population of \neach State.\n\n  However, since 1992, the Appropriations Committee has imposed a two \nmillion dollar cap per State on Administrative Grants. This was an \nattempt to ensure equitable allocation to all the participating states. \nOver the past eight years appropriations for Administrative Grants have \nincreased by $19 million, yet the $2 million cap has remained. The \nresult has been an inequitable distribution of these new funds. By \nfiscal year 2000, 13 States had reached this arbitrary $2 million cap. \nThese 13 States account for 83 percent of our Nation's coastline and 76 \npercent of our coastal population.\n  It is not equitable to have the 13 States with the largest coastlines \nand populations stuck at a two million dollar cap, despite major \noverall funding increases. While smaller States have enjoyed additional \nprogrammatic success due to an influx of funding, some of the larger \nStates have stagnated.\n  In an attempt to reassure members of the Appropriations Committee \nthat a fair distribution of funds can occur without this hard cap in \nplace, I have worked with Senator Hollings to develop language that has \nbeen included in this bill that directs the Secretary of Commerce to \nensure that equitable increases or decreases between funding years for \neach State. It further requires that States should not experience a \ndecrease in base program funds in any year when the overall \nappropriations increase.\n  I would like to thank Senator Hollings for his assistance in \nresolving this matter and his commitment over the years to ensuring \nthat the States are treated fairly.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Program enjoys wide support among all of \nthe coastal states due to its history of success. This support has been \nclearly demonstrated by the many members of the Commerce Committee who \nhave worked with me to strengthen this program over the past several \nyears.\n  I would like to thank Senator Kerry, the Ranking Democrat of the \nOceans and Fisheries Subcommittee for his hard work and support of this \nbill. I would also like to express my appreciation to Senator McCain, \nthe Chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator Hollings, the \nRanking Democrat of the Committee, for their support of this measure \nand for their willingness to discharge this bill out of the committee \nso that we may begin working with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives to enact this critical piece of legislation.\n  This is a solid, reasonable, and a realistic bill that enjoys \nbipartisan support on the Commerce Committee. It is time that we now \nturn to legislation reauthorizing a program with a long track record of \npreserving our coastal environment while allowing sensible development.\n  I am pleased to support this legislation that will provide the States \nwith the necessary funding and framework to meet the challenges facing \nour coastal communities in the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1494-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 25--DESIGNATING JANUARY 2003 AS ``NATIONAL MENTORING \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Specter, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nCochran, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Allen, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Dodd, and Ms. Landrieu) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 25\n\n       Whereas mentors serve as role models, advocates, friends, \n     and advisors to youth in need;\n       Whereas numerous studies and research document that mentors \n     help youth augment social skills and emotional well-being, \n     improve cognitive skills, and plan for the future;\n       Whereas, for some youth, having a caring adult mentor to \n     turn to for guidance and encouragement can make the crucial \n     difference between success and failure in life;\n       Whereas 17,600,000 youth, nearly half the youth population, \n     want or need mentors to help them reach their full potential.\n       Whereas there exists a large ``mentoring gap'' of unmet \n     needs, as evidenced by the fact that just 2,500,000 youth are \n     in formal mentoring relationships, leaving 15,000,000 youth \n     still in need of mentors;\n       Whereas the celebration of National Mentoring Month will \n     institutionalize the Nation's commitment to mentoring and \n     raise awareness of mentoring in various forms;\n       Whereas a month-long focus on mentoring will tap into the \n     vast pool of potential mentors and motivate adults to take \n     action to help a youth;\n       Whereas National Mentoring Month will encourage \n     organizations of all kinds--businesses, faith communities, \n     government agencies, schools, and other organizations--to \n     engage their constituents in mentoring; and\n       Whereas the celebration of that month would above all \n     encourage more people to volunteer as mentors, to the benefit \n     of the Nation's youth: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of January 2003 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities that promote awareness of and volunteer \n     involvement with youth mentoring.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege today to join my \ncolleagues in submitting a resolution recognizing January 2003 as \nNational Mentoring Month. Business, community and media leaders have \nformed a coalition to raise public awareness about the importance of \ntaking time to make a real difference in the life of a child.\n  Under the impressive leadership of the National Mentoring Partnership \nand the Harvard School of Public Health, the coalition is sponsoring an \nadvertising campaign to explain the benefits of mentoring for children \nand mentors alike: Each of us has had adults who have made a positive \ndifference for us, family, teachers, coaches, clergy, neighbors or \ncaring friends who were there to listen and offer guidance. Each of us \nhas the opportunity to offer that same gift to young persons today.\n  Each week with many of my colleagues in the Senate, I read with an \nelementary school student in the District of Columbia in the Everybody \nWins program. During our lunchtime sessions, my first grade partner and \nI share good books and stories. Whether mentors choose reading programs \nor some other activity, these times are dedicated to listening and \nresponding to the child's needs. Mentors have busy lives, and every \nchild needs to know that we can make time for them.\n  In States across this country there are long lists of young persons \nwaiting for mentors. This important project will connect new mentors to \nthese waiting children, and enhance the quality of their lives. I urge \nthe Senate to approve it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1494-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 246.

Mr. President, the Senate has just confirmed the \nappointment of Asa Hutchinson to serve as the Under Secretary for \nBorder and Transportation Security at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. This is a very important position within the newly created \nDepartment, and one that encompasses far-reaching responsibilities. \nTherefore, I am pleased the Senate was able to move expeditiously on \nthis confirmation so that Congressman Hutchinson can be in his position \nwhen the new Department officially begins operation tomorrow, January \n24.\n  The Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security is charged \nwith critical duties, including: preventing the entry of terrorists and \nthe instruments of terrorism into the United States; securing the \nborders, territorial waters, ports, terminals, waterways, and air, \nland, and sea transportation systems of the United States; \nadministering U.S. customs laws; establishing national immigration \nenforcement policies and priorities; carrying out INS immigration \nenforcement functioning; and administering the granting of visas or \nother forms of permission to enter the United States.\n  With these duties will go jurisdiction over many existing government \nunits, including the United States Customs Service of the Department of \nthe Treasury, the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, of the \nDepartment of Transportation, the Federal Protective Service of the \nGeneral Services Administration, the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter of the Department of the Treasury, and the Office for Domestic \nPreparedness of the Office of Justice Programs of the Department of \nJustice.\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\n  Security policies are intertwined with safety policies, and many of \nthe Under Secretary's functions are closely linked to other agencies of \nthe federal governmental, such as the modal administrations responsible \nfor transportation safety at the Department of Transportation. Further, \nmany duties overseen by the Under Secretary have been and will continue \nto be performed by the Coast Guard. All of these functions will have to \nbe carefully coordinated under Congressman Hutchinson's leadership.\n  The Under Secretary will face many difficult challenges, including \nthose associated with the very serious situation at our southern \nborder. For example, Arizona has been a leading gateway for illegal \nimmigrants into the U.S. since the mid-1990s. Illegal immigrants are \ndying along on our borders. The attrition rate for Border Patrol Agents \nand INS inspectors has reached alarming levels. We have reached the \npoint where we now have private citizens taking up arms and forming \nmilitia groups to patrol the border because they feel the federal \ngovernment has failed to protect them. Just yesterday, the Wall Street \nJournal reported about the death of a U.S. Park Ranger in Arizona who \nwas killed last August along the border, the fourth ranger killed in \nthe line of duty since 1990. Further, uncompensated emergency and \nmedical care provided to undocumented immigrants has left many border \nhospitals on the verge of financial ruin. Leadership and attention must \nbe paramount in any effort undertaken by the Under Secretary to \nadequately address the wide range of border security issues, including \nhow to ensure adequate resources are deployed for enforcement purposes.\n  Yesterday, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee held \nits hearing to consider Congressman Hutchinson's nomination. We \nunanimously approved his nomination earlier today. The new Under \nSecretary will certainly have our Committee's full support as he takes \non the many great challenges that he will face in his new position. The \nAmerican public is very fortunate to have such a fine, capable, \nhardworking citizen agree to take on the immense responsibilities \nassociated with this public service position.\n  I urge my colleagues' swift confirmation of Congressman Hutchinson.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate today considers the nomination \nof Asa Hutchinson to become the first Undersecretary of Border and \nTransportation Security for the Department of Homeland Security. I will \nvote for this nomination, but not without reservations.\n  In addition to his service as head of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, most of us in the Senate also know Asa Hutchinson from \nthe substantial amount of time he spent on the floor of the Senate a \nfew years ago during the impeachment trial of President Clinton. He and \nI were both involved in the deposition phase of that trial, and \nalthough we reached opposite conclusions on the question of \nimpeachment, I found him to be a skilled attorney and advocate for his \nposition, and a very likable colleague.\n  Because of my respect for him, I expedited his 2001 nomination to \nhead the DEA. I noticed a hearing only days after becoming chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, held the hearing the following week, and \nscheduled a committee vote for the earliest possible time. I then \nworked with Senator Daschle to have the full Senate consider his \nnomination as quickly as possible.\n  In his role as administrator, I believe he has done many things well. \nI do, however, have two concerns I would like to express today.\n  At his confirmation hearing to head the DEA, I asked Mr. Hutchinson \nwhether the Federal Government should make it a priority to prosecute \npeople who distribute marijuana to ill people in States that have \nlegalized marijuana for medicinal use. He said he wanted to work with \nthe Attorney General and develop an appropriate policy to reflect the \nFederal-State tensions involved in the issue. If such a policy was \ndeveloped, I am unaware of it. In practice, the DEA under Administrator \nHutchinson's leadership took a very tough line against the use of \nmarijuana for medical purposes, launching a number of raids in \nCalifornia against individuals and groups that were operating in \ncompliance with California law.\n  In Vermont, we are experiencing severe and growing problems with \nheroin abuse and our law enforcement officers face extraordinary \nburdens, it is problems like that that should be a priority for the \nDEA. Administrator Hutchinson's decision to use substantial Federal \nresources to crack down on the use of marijuana by ill people strikes \nme as setting the wrong priority, and certainly a different priority \nthan he identified at his hearing.\n  I am also concerned by recent reports that Administrator Hutchinson \nmade extensive use of Government planes at significant taxpayer expense \nfor public appearances, while previous administrators flew commercially \nfor similar events. If these reports are true, he would not be the \nfirst member of the Department of Justice to make questionable use of \ntaxpayer dollars for travel. Similar questions were raised in 2001 \nabout Attorney General Ashcroft's reliance on chartered planes. In \naddition, Hispanic agents have criticized Mr. Hutchinson for allowing \nthe expiration of a committee that had been formed to brief the \nadministrator on the concerns of Hispanic agents. I have not had the \nopportunity to discuss these accusations with him and his confirmation \nhearing for this post was not held before the Judiciary Committee. I \nwould encourage Mr. Hutchinson to take affirmative steps to run an \ninclusive agency.\n  In his new position, Mr. Hutchinson will be responsible for ensuring \nthat our borders are safe. I have worked extensively to strengthen our \nnorthern border, particularly since the terrorist attacks of September \n11, 2001. I know that the personnel who protect our border are \nexcellent, and I also know that they need more help. That is why I \nincluded provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act to triple INS and Customs \npersonnel at the northern border, and to invest in improved technology \nand equipment to monitor the border. I look forward to working closely \nwith Mr. Hutchinson to ensure that these provisions are finally and \nfully implemented and our borders are secure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/23/senate-section/article/S1496-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
